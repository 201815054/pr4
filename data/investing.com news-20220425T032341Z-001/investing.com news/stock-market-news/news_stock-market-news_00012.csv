Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Wednesday as fears of an economic slowdown and, possibly, an early withdrawal of monetary stimulus, continued to dominate.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 65 points, or 0.2%, at 35,035 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite, which had closed at a fresh record high on Tuesday, was down 0.4%.
Earlier, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard repeated his call for an immediate start to the 'tapering' of bond purchases by the Fed, whose policy-setting committee next meets on September 22nd. Bullard told the Financial Times that there are more vacant jobs than there are unemployed workers in the U.S. economy and that the weak August employment report was well within the limits of monthly volatility that should be expected.
The morning's trading is likely to be dominated by the JOLTS job openings report, which showed vacancies surging to a fifth straight monthly record of 10.934 million. The numbers may help offset some of the pessimism felt since the employment report for August on Friday, which had showed a big drop in the pace of job gains in August. The economic calendar is otherwise relatively bare, except for numbers showing that mortgage applications fell again last week, their third drop in the last four weeks. 
Among early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 1.0% after data showing that its factory in China continues to scale up production rapidly, despite recurrent problems with semiconductor shortages. One of its Chinese rivals Nio (NYSE:NIO) saw its ADRs fall 3.5% after it announced a secondary offering to finance its expansion.
Another stock hit by a secondary offering was  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL). The dating site operator fell some 1.6% after announcing a block sale of around 12% in the company by existing shareholders, led by Blackstone (NYSE:BX). They're taking cash off the table after seeing the stock rise 14% since its February listing.
Elsewhere,  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock fell 3.5% after the company said that the Securities and Exchanges Commission had threatened legal action if it launched a new product allowing customers to lend digital assets. CEO Brian Armstrong said the practice was already widespread in the sector and criticized the SEC in a thread on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for refusing to clarify its position on regulating crypto.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell another 2.2% amid the fallout from the deaths of people who had taken contaminated doses of its Covid-19 vaccine. Switches into rival  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock, which earlier this week signed a major sales contract with Japan for its rival vaccine, rose another 7.7%  Fellow biotech startup Kadmon (NASDAQ:KDMN) rose 72% after agreeing to be bought by French pharma giant  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY), which fell 2.6%."

Prominent companies in this space—PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN), and  Shoe Carnival  (NASDAQ:SCVL)—reported their quarterly results last week, surpassing consensus EPS estimates. We expect shares of these companies to soar in price on fundamental strength and industry tailwinds. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Even though U.S. consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in August due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and high inflation, the major stock market indexes are hovering near their all-time highs. This can be, in part, attributed to the solid second-quarter corporate earnings results. 
According to a FactSet research report, more S&P 500 companies beat the EPS estimates in the second quarter than on average. Also, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs last week on easing concerns about the Fed’s tapering activities.
The apparel industry has been benefiting from rising discretionary spending and increasing online and brick-and-mortar sales. So, we think it could be wise to bet on quality apparel stocks PVH Corp. (PVH), Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN), and Shoe Carnival (NYSE:CUK), Inc. (SCVL). These companies reported impressive quarterly results last week, beating the consensus earnings estimates.

Hence, we think it could be wise to add Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) to one’s watchlist because Wall Street analysts expect them to rally in price significantly. Read on.The resurgence of the COVID-19 cases, due primarily to the rapid spread of the Delta variant, has led to the resumption of restrictive measures in several parts of the world. This could dampen the airline industry’s recovery in the near term. However, increasing vaccinations and the full FDA approval of  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE’s (BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine should help the industry recover over time.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported a significant number of screenings during the Labor Day weekend due to leisure travel. Also, according to a ReportLinker report, the global airlines market is expected to reach $744 billion by 2026.
So, we think it could be wise to add relatively stronger airline stocks, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE), to one’s watchlist now. Wall Street analysts expect these two stocks to rally by more than 40% in price in the coming months.

Investing.com – Coinbase stock (NASDAQ:COIN) fell 3.6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission threatened to sue the company if it goes ahead with its plans to let users earn interest by lending crypto assets.
The latest erosion in prices of cryptos only added to the negative sentiment.
Millions of crypto holders have been lending out their funds to earn returns over the last few years, and Coinbase was about to join that momentum with its own product. But the SEC has checked that move, calling the product a security, according to Coinbase Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong, who put out a series of tweets to argue his case against SEC’s preemptive action.
“If you don't want this activity, then simply publish your position, in writing, and enforce it evenly across the industry,” he tweeted while pointing out that plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer the lending feature.


He lamented that the regulator has failed to provide any guidance on the products even as it threatens to take it to court.
The development comes amid another round of heightened news flow around cryptos. Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) fell below the $44,500-mark today before clawing back to trade above $46,300, down 9%. Ethereum ETH/USD and Cardano ADA/USD traded lower by 9% each. Dogecoin DOGE/USD fell 12%.
The latest slump in cryptos comes after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as its national currency on Wednesday."

MADRID/ROME (Reuters) -Britain is lagging the aviation recovery in the rest of Europe due to confusing COVID-19 restrictions and its airports will struggle in the coming winter, Ryanair executives said on Tuesday.
""Most European markets are recuperating ... the exception is the UK (where) there's this continued confusion,"" Eddie Wilson, CEO of Ryanair DAC, Ryanair Group's largest airline, told Reuters. ""It’s going to be a difficult winter for us - we’re stimulating (passenger numbers) with lower fares.""
While it would not be difficult to reach high passenger volumes over Christmas in Europe, British airports would likely struggle over the period, Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary told reporters in a separate event in Rome on Wednesday.
""Places like Heathrow and Gatwick (are) struggling with ... Brexit border controls and COVID,"" O'Leary noted.
Both executives referenced travel debacles this summer when the UK abruptly changed the risk classifications of destinations thousands of Britons were holidaying in, causing frustration and anger amongst tourists forced to book expensive diagnostic tests and undergo lengthy quarantines.

""People remember what happened in Portugal, and more recently Montenegro,"" Wilson said. ""They need certainty and we've seen bookings reflect almost exactly people's level of confidence.""
The Ireland-based low-cost airline announced on Monday that talks with aircraft supplier Boeing (NYSE:BA) over an order of MAX 737 planes worth billions had failed, with O'Leary saying he would wait up to 10 years for a downturn and the right prices.

PARIS (Reuters) - French energy group Engie expects to have a shortlist of would-be buyers for its Equans services unit by the end of September, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
U.S. investment firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc is among the seven firms that have submitted non-binding offers for the unit, according to the sources.
Equans provides energy and facilities management services to client companies and employs around 40% of Engie's total workforce worldwide.
The value of the deal is estimated at around 5 billion-6 billion euros ($5.94 billion-$7.12 billion), according to sources close to the deal.
The sources said the company is expecting to shortlist potential buyers by the third week in September, who will then be given access to company data. It expects binding offers around the end of November, and to select a buyer by year-end, they added.
Engie's press service declined to comment. A representative of Apollo could not be reached for comment.
French firms  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), Eiffage and Spie have each already said they have submitted offers.

Several sources close to the deal have previously told Reuters that offers were also submitted by Bain Capital,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, and CVC Capital Partners acting in conjunction with France's PAI Partners.
Bain Capital, CVC-Pai Partners and Carlyle declined to comment.

As part of a package of agreements signed by shareholders upon the tie-up between Fiat Chrysler and France's Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, former PSA investor Dongfeng was required to sell around 36 million shares in the new group by the end of 2022.
Dongfeng said it had completed the sale of 36.1 million Stellantis shares, equivalent to a 1.15% stake, through an accelerated bookbuilding process (ABB) at a price of 16.65 euros each.
No details were provided about who bought shares in the ABB. By 1220 GMT Milan-listed shares in Stellantis were down 2.6% at 16.64 euros.
The Chinese group's PSA shareholding dates back to 2014, when it joined a capital increase that was launched to save the French automaker from bankruptcy.
After the transaction, the Chinese company retains a 4.5% stake in Stellantis and has agreed a 90-day lock-up period during which it can sell no more shares. 
The merger agreements also allow the Peugeot family to further increase its current 7.2% stake in Stellantis by up to an additional 1.5% by acquiring shares from France's state lender Bpifrance, from Dongfeng or on the market. 
Asked whether it had bought shares from Dongfeng, the Peugeot family declined to comment.
Stellantis' other top investors are Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, with a 14.4% holding, and the French state with a 6.2% stake.
Dongfeng is one of Stellantis' partners in China, where they operate though a joint venture which sold 47,788 cars between January and July.

In China Stellantis also has a joint venture with former Fiat Chrysler partner GAC, which on Tuesday said it would close one of the JV's two factories in the country by next March. 
Stellantis is planning to deeply reshuffle its strategy in the world's biggest auto market, where it has struggled to sell cars.

Investing.com – Citrix Systems stock (NASDAQ:CTXS) traded more than 7% up in Wednesday’s premarket session on a report in The Wall Street Journal that hedge fund Elliott Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.
According to WSJ, Elliott recently informed Citrix it has a stake of more than 10%, and would like to work with it to improve its valuation. Such a stake is worth at least $1.28 billion, based on Citrix’s market value of $12.86 billion as of Tuesday.
Elliott is known to chase companies to take steps to increase shareholder returns. This includes moves like reshuffling top management, forcing buybacks, and demands for better capital allocation.
Citrix offers Cloud-computing services that includes enabling users to access desktops from remote locations. While those capabilities were in big demand during the pandemic and will continue to be in the work-from-home paradigm, the company has taken time to transition to a subscription model.
Second-quarter total revenue rose only 2% on-year to $812 million while subscription revenue jumped 54% to $374 million.
The company’s stock price has suffered, lagging the S&P 500. It has fallen almost 25% in one year while the Nasdaq has gained 36%.  "
8,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>",Factbox: Germany's election and the auto industry,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's federal election on Sept. 26 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/merkel-implores-germans-back-laschet-election-succeed-her-2021-09-07 will have a major influence on the future of its auto industry, already in a race against time to meet national and EU emissions targets. 
All major parties back the transition to electric vehicles, but differ on how to get there. Here are the main points from each party on the matter:
CDU
Key message: Germany's auto industry should remain a world-leader and be technologically open-minded to how emissions targets can be met.
The party rejects setting an end date for producing ICE (NYSE:ICE) (internal combustion engine) cars, or a speed limit on the motorway.
It calls for expanding public transport to alleviate road traffic, but also plans to build more roads and motorways to prevent traffic jams.
Charging infrastructure for electric vehicles should be available in all new commercial and public buildings, the manifesto says. The party's candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, Armin Laschet, said in a recent interview a charging station should always be reachable within ten minutes.
The party supports synthetic fuels and hydrogen, including for trucks.
GREENS
Key message: Cars must be “more digital, quieter, smaller and lighter, climate neutral and easier to recycle,” the manifesto reads, adding “we want to make the switch to bike, bus and train attractive for everyone and encourage it financially.""
Germany should stop producing ICE cars by 2030, the Greens say. A speed limit of 130km/h should be implemented on motorways, down to 120km/h when close to metropolitan areas and 30km/h in city centres.
To reduce dependency on cars, the party would abolish plans to build new roads and instead double the number of bike and pedestrian pathways in the next decade. It would invest 100 billion euros in rail, partly financed through truck tolls. 
Electric vehicles (EVs) should be affordable for anyone, chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock has said, calling for low-earning EV buyers to receive an additional 3,000 euros in credit on top of existing subsidies of 6,000 euros, to be repaid interest-free from savings generating by the lower cost of electric charging compared to fuel. 
Hydrogen and synthetic fuels should only be used for industrial transport, ships, and planes.
SPD
Key message: The state should support the EV transition without intervening too heavily or jeopardizing Germany's position in the auto industry.
The SPD does not support a government-determined end date for ICEs - chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz said in a recent interview that consumers would opt for EVs once they achieved price and quality parity. 
But the state should do its part in subsidising the EV transition, including speeding up the expansion of charging networks, Scholz has said. 
The manifesto also calls for expanding hydrogen pipelines, battery cell production, and recycling. As finance minister, Scholz released a billion-euro fund in August to support the EV transition until 2025.
The party supports hydrogen and synthetic fuels for heavy trucks, ships and planes.
Like the Greens, it backs a motorway speed limit of 130km/h. Scholz has also expressed support for a 50km/h limit in cities. 
FDP

Key message: The liberal party rejects ""the path of renunciation and prohibition,"" opposing an end date for gas guzzlers or a speed limit on the motorway. E-mobility is just one part of the transport mix of the future, its manifesto says.
The party opposes the EU's emissions targets as well as German subsidies for EV purchases. Still, its manifesto states charging stations should be expanded, with transparent pricing systems. It supports the use of hydrogen and synthetic fuels.

LONDON (Reuters) -Digital motor insurer Marshmallow has raised $85 million from investors, valuing it at more than $1.25 billion and making it one of the first British Black-founded unicorns, the company said on Wednesday.
The early-stage funding round was backed by venture capital firm Passion Capital, Investec Bank and reinsurer SCOR, Marshmallow said in a statement.
The tech-focused insurer will use the funding to expand into overseas markets and into other types of insurance beyond the motor segment, Chief Executive Oliver Kent-Braham told Reuters.
""We're looking across to Europe now, that's a huge market to go after. In the UK, we are looking at other personal lines.""
Insurtech, a fast-growing segment of the financial technology, or fintech, industry, has benefited from investor interest in startups, with the traditional insurance industry considered slow to change and to adopt technology.
Global insurtech funding exploded to $7.4 billion in the first half, making 2021 a record funding year already by July, according to a report from insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW).
Motor insurers have benefited from the coronavirus pandemic, as fewer cars on the roads due to government lockdowns have led to fewer claims.
Marshmallow was founded in 2017 by Kent-Braham, his twin brother Alexander Kent-Braham and David Goate.
It has expanded its staff by more than 200% in the past year to around 170 people, and also plans to use its funding to hire 400 more over the next two years. 
Insurance and technology are both sectors often lacking in diversity, but Kent-Braham said the firm was close to 50:50 in terms of its male-female split, including female software engineers. Nearly 20% of employees were Black or from other ethnic minorities.

Marshmallow underwrites its own insurance, and is facing legal action from its former underwriter Mulsanne. Kent-Braham said the case was ongoing, but that Marshmallow strongly refutes all the allegations.
The company's Series B funding round follows a $30 million Series A round in Nov 2020, which valued the company at $310 million. Passion Capital, Investec and SCOR are all existing investors in Marshmallow.

(Reuters) - Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) on Wednesday released two new tools aimed at improving the efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles.
Applied is the world's largest maker of tools for making semiconductors. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide.
Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Companies like Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) Inc and ON Semiconductor Corp are investing in making the chips.
Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard. They are bulk-manufactured on discs called ""wafers"" that are later sliced into individual chips. But wafers first must be polished perfectly smooth, or the resulting chips will have defects.
Because silicon carbide is so hard, chipmakers can polish only a relatively small wafer that is 150 millimeters (5.91 inches) wide without getting defects somewhere on the surface. 
Applied said on Wednesday its new tool will help chipmakers polish wafers that are 200 millimeters (7.87 inches) wide. The small increase in wafer size can double the number of chips that each one can hold, helping boost output and bring down prices.
""To bring this to high volume manufacturing, you need the entire wafer surface to be identical, so you can have predictable output across the wafer,"" said Sundar Ramamurthy, group vice president and general manager for an Applied group working to advance chipmaking technology for automotive chips, sensors and other devices. 

The other tool announced on Wednesday helps introduce a small amount of chemical impurity to wafers, which is a key step for all semiconductors to improve electricity conductivity. The process is difficult with silicon carbide because of the brittleness of the material.
Cree plans to use some of Applied's new tools, the companies said.

The global crunch in natural gas supplies has already sent energy prices soaring, and the shortage is being compounded in the U.K. by a series of power plant outages and low wind. Consumers are bracing for price hikes, while the regulator announced on Tuesday that two suppliers had ceased trading. 
An auction for power for Thursday cleared at 277.30 pounds ($381.55) per megawatt-hour on N2EX, up more than 100% from Wednesday’s price. 
Several unplanned halts are crimping supply, including units at  Drax  (LON:DRX) Plc’s biomass plant, RWE AG (OTC:RWEOY)’s Didcot B, EPUKI’s South Humber all halting unexpectedly. Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF)’s Heysham 1.1 nuclear reactor is due back on Thursday after an extended outage.
While it’s usual for power plant operators to carry out last minute maintenance ahead of the heating season starting in October, the U.K. has a more serious problem looming. Britain is becoming increasingly exposed to dips in wind generation a situation that will worsen as coal stations shut in the next three years and aging nuclear units close early. It’s a political issue as these high prices, even in the short-term, will feed through to consumer bills.
A lull in wind speeds in much of Europe this year has aggravated the high prices. Countries have increasingly had to increase coal generation to fill in the gap.  
U.K. peak demand is forecast to increase slightly to 33,752 megawatts at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday,  compared with 33,675 megawatts at 8 p.m. Wednesday,  National Grid  (LON:NG) Plc data show.

Investing.com – McAfee stock (NASDAQ:MCFE) traded 2.4% lower in Wednesday’s premarket on news that some of the existing investors will sell 20 million shares of the company in a block trade.
The maker of antivirus software is not selling any shares of its own nor will it receive any proceeds from the transaction. It did not name the sellers.
The sale comprises almost 12% of the company’s outstanding equity. At Tuesday’s closing price of $27.09, the transaction amounts to $542 million.
The deal size may rise by another $81.3 million if underwriters exercise an over-allotment option to buy 3 million shares from the sellers.
A sale of by shares by existing investors can depress the stock price on two counts in the short-term. One, institutional investors don’t regularly buy and sell shares and a sale by them may indicate lack of confidence in the company under the current scenario though that’s not always the case.
Sales of shares can also happen as existing investors might have generated their desired returns and may need to return the money to their own investors.
Secondly, a large sale typically requires the shares to be sold at a discount to market in order to rebalance supply and demand for the stock.  
Tuesday, UBS (NYSE:UBS) downgraded McAfee to ‘neutral’ with a target of $29, a price 7% higher than the last close. The brokerage said it likes the company's growth prospects but is wary of its ability to show strong renewal rates as PC shipments inevitably slow. The stock's valuation is also a key debate, it said.

The court dismissed an appeal against a previous ruling that found in favour of a defamation suit by Dylan Voller, a young man who had been the subject of several news reports about youth detention.
""This is a common-sense decision that accords with longstanding law on the issue of publication,"" Voller’s lawyers, O’Brien Criminal and Civil Solicitors, said in a statement after the ruling.
Voller had said that after stories referring to him were posted on the news companies' Facebook pages, a number of third-party Facebook users made defamatory comments and he alleged that the news outlets were liable as the publishers. 
Voller filed a suit against the publishers, including Fairfax Media, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, which is owned by broadcaster Nine, and others.
After a court found in favour of Voller, the media outlets lodged an appeal based on the argument that they administered a Facebook page on which third parties published their own material.
But the High Court dismissed the appeal and ordered the organisations to pay costs. 
""The acts of the (media companies) in facilitating, encouraging and thereby assisting the posting of comments by the third-party Facebook users rendered them publishers of those comments,"" Justice Rothman found. 
At the time the comments were published, Facebook did not allow page moderators to turn off comments on posts, however it has changed that. 
The case will now return to the New South Wales Supreme Court to determine if any of the comments defamed Voller.
A spokesperson for Nine said it was ""disappointed with the outcome ... as it will have ramifications for what we can post on social media in the future"".

Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) Australia told the Sydney Morning Herald the court decision was significant for anyone who maintains a public social media page.
""They can be liable for comments posted by others on that page even when they are unaware of those comments,"" he said.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Semiconductor supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is open to working with foundries in Europe if incentive programmes to boost automotive chip production on the continent attract the right partners, Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said.
Foundries in Europe are now geared towards mass production of semiconductors, Amon told Reuters at the IAA (NYSE:IAA) car show in Munich, but there is a welcome debate under way about investing in high-end production that is interesting to Qualcomm.
""There is a very constructive dialogue taking place, by the French government, the European government, I think they have an interest in attracting foundries to Europe,"" Amon said in an interview.
To tackle a chip shortage that has hit Europe's carmakers and exposed its dependence on Asia, the EU is pushing for multibillion-dollar investments to double the continent's share of global chip production over the next decade.
Also at the Munich car show, U.S. chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) flagged investments of up to 80 billion euros ($95 billion) over the next decade in two major European chip plants, with details to be announced by the end of this year.
Intel will also open up its semiconductor plant in Ireland for automakers, CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a keynote speech.
LEADING EDGE
Most of Qualcomm's manufacturing is aimed at leading-edge technology, with the majority of foundries in that area located in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States, Amon said, adding it was in full support of the EU plans to attract foundries.
""In the event that that happens with the leading process technology, Qualcomm is definitely going to be interested in utilising those foundries.""
The California-based group, the world's No.1 supplier of key semiconductors in mobile phones, has been pushing into the car sector with chips that can power dashboards and infotainment systems at the same time.
Qualcomm's commitment to the car sector is also reflected by a recent $4.6 billion bid for Swedish auto parts maker  Veoneer  (NYSE:VNE) Inc, which Amon said had been well received by the industry.
""We're in the automotive industry to stay,"" he said.
Amon, who took the helm at Qualcomm in June, said he was meeting the CEOs of all major German carmakers this week, adding Qualcomm was now working with 23 of the 26 global automotive brands.
""Today we have existing commercial relationship and future planned relationships with all the German carmakers,"" Amon said, adding it had built up a $10 billion contracted backlog in its automotive business over the past four years.
This week, Qualcomm announced a deal with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), which followed an agreement with General Motors (NYSE:GM) earlier this year.

Qualcomm works with all major global foundries, or contract manufacturers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), GlobalFoundries and Semiconductor Manufacturing International.
Amon said the company had done a lot in the past 12 months to build new manufacturing facilities with its suppliers to counter the global chip shortage: ""We expect to enter 2022 with the majority of this problem behind us.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Delaware judge ruled on Tuesday that Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s board of directors must face a lawsuit from shareholders over two fatal 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people in less than six months.
Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn ruled Boeing stockholders may pursue some claims against the board, but dismissed others.
Zurn's ruling in the Court of Chancery said the first of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes was a ""red flag"" about a key safety system known as MCAS ""that the board should have heeded but instead ignored.""

In January, Boeing was charged by the Justice Department https://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-737max-justice-int-idUSKBN29D07Q with 737 MAX fraud conspiracy and agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement and settlement worth more than $2.5 billion.
Zurn's ruling found some evidence submitted by Boeing supported the shareholders' allegations. ""That the board knowingly fell short is also evident in the board's public crowing about taking specific actions to monitor safety that it did not actually perform,"" the ruling said.
In a lengthy summary of the shareholder's case, Zurn said the board ""publicly lied about if and how it monitored the 737 MAX's safety.""
The opinion also cited comments by Dave Calhoun, then lead Boeing director, who became Boeing chief executive in January 2020 after the board ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg.
It cited Calhoun's comments that ""the board had been 'notified immediately, as a board broadly,' after the Lion Air crash and met 'very, very quickly' thereafter.""
It added that after the second crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX in March 2019, Calhoun represented that the board met within 24 hours of the crash to discuss potentially grounding the 737 MAX.
""Each of Calhoun's representations was false,"" Zurn's ruling said.
The crashes have cost Boeing some $20 billion.
Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said the ruling clears the way for additional discovery and potentially a trial, although he considered that very unlikely.

""Right now everything is lining up where the board of directors are telling their attorneys I don't want to go to trial. You need to pay them whatever it costs and I cannot as a director admit liability,"" he said.
In that scenario, the directors' insurance would likely pay any settlement, he said.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>","With GameStop earnings on tap, options traders bet on muted moves","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Options traders are expecting comparatively subdued moves in GameStop (NYSE:GME) Inc shares around its earnings report, as the company that helped spark the so-called meme stock phenomenon prepares to report quarterly results on Wednesday.
Traders are pricing a 14% swing for GameStop's shares by Friday, according to pricing in options expiring at the end of the week. By comparison, the video game retailer’s shares have moved about 30% on the day after each of its last two earnings reports.
The expectations for smaller stock swings comes as the daily moves in GameStop’s shares have also grown tighter. The company’s shares have logged average daily moves of around 3.6% in either direction over the last month, compared with average daily moves of 12% for the first half of the year. 
One reason for the toned-down moves may be that the company’s shares - which stand at around $200 compared with around $16 in early January - may be growing less attractive to investors looking to get in on cheaper stocks in the hopes of catching a big rally, said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe.
A recent batch of meme stocks that rallied last month included names like Support.com, which went from trading at around $8 in mid-August to as high as $59.69 in late August, and Vinco Ventures, which went from around $2.50 in late August to as high as $7.89 earlier this month.
""GameStop has been eclipsed by a lot of other names,"" Schwartz said.
GameStop is up about 950% for the year and down 8% so far this quarter. The stock's 1-month average daily options trading volume is at about 111,000 contracts, down from about 820,000 contracts in early February, according to Trade Alert data. Similarly, the stock's 1-month average daily volume is at 3.3 million shares, down from about 77 million shares in early February. 
The Grapevine, Texas-based company is expected to post a rise in second-quarter revenue on Wednesday as its brick-and mortar business is slowly recovering.
With the company pushing for e-commerce growth, investors will also look for comments regarding its future plans. Hardcore proponents of the stock on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets have famously pledged to hold its shares until they go ""to the moon.""
Indeed, a look at implied volatility - an options-based measure of how much traders expect a stock to move - suggests that some are betting on the shares to snap a four-quarter streak of post-earnings declines. 
Implied volatility on Friday-expiration calls that would come into play if the stock rises 15% stood at 230% on Tuesday afternoon, compared with 210% for puts that come into play if the stock falls 15%, according to Refinitiv data.

Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and are typically bought by bullish investors, while puts provide the right to sell shares at a set price in the future.
""The marketplace is willing to pay up for the calls in the near-term cycle,"" said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at Ally Invest.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening a little lower Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s weakness as investors reassess the economic growth outlook amid worries about the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 wave.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 10 points, or less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded largely unchanged, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 10 points, or 0.1%.
Wall Street returned from the Labor Day weekend to losses of over 260 points, or 0.8%, in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average amid worries of slowing growth, exacerbated by the disappointing August jobs report.
Concerns are growing that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is hurting the country’s economic recovery, just as the Federal Reserve considers pulling back its bond-buying program.
Data collated by Reuters showed that more than 20,800 people have died in the United States from Covid-19 in the past two weeks, up about 67% from the prior two-week period, as children head back to school and companies try to confirm return-to-office plans. The seven-day average death count fell for the first time in seven weeks on Tuesday, but it remains to be seen whether this is a statistical quirk due to the Labor Day holiday weekend.
Influential investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wednesday downgraded its recommendation on U.S. equities to underweight, citing “outsized risk” to growth through October.
Investors will study the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, at 1000 AM ET (1400 GMT), for further clues of the state of the U.S. labor market, with employers expected to have posted 10 million jobs in July compared with 10.073 million the previous month.
In corporate news, GameStop (NYSE:GME), a meme stock favorite, will release its second-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, and is expected to announce another hefty loss.
 Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) is also due to report its second-quarter earnings, and investors will be looking for the company’s outlook given the shift back to office life, gradual though it may be at the moment.
Elsewhere, Nio (NYSE:NIO) will be in the spotlight after the Chinese electric vehicle maker announced plans to sell up to $2 billion in new American depositary shares to fund its expansion. 
Rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) sold over 44,000 China-made vehicles in August, the China Passenger Car Association said on Wednesday, more than just under 33,000 in July and 33,155 units in June. Most were exported to Europe.
Crude prices bounced Wednesday after recent losses, with attention turning to the U.S. market as producers in the Gulf of Mexico struggle to restart operations in the wake of Hurricane Ida.
Over a week after the hurricane made landfall, more than three-quarters of U.S. Gulf production remains offline. The inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later Wednesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Thursday will be studied closely, as traders look for a more complete picture of the storm's impact on crude production and refinery output.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $69.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $72.45. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,801.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1844.

Investing.com – PayPal stock (NASDAQ:PYPL) traded 0.6% higher in Wednesday’s premarket after the digital payments company said it will buy Japan’s Paidy for 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) to expand in the world’s third largest e-commerce market.
The target company is a two-sided payments platform and provider of ‘buy now, pay later’ solutions in Japan. 
Paidy’s payment services allow Japanese shoppers to make purchases online, and then pay for them each month in a consolidated bill at a convenience store or via bank transfer. The company uses proprietary technology to score creditworthiness, underwrite transactions and guarantee payment to merchants.
PayPal will pay for Paidy primarily in cash. It expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter and to minimally dilute earnings per share on adjusted basis.
The BNPL ecosystem has seen a flurry of deals lately. That's a consequence of their rapid growth during the pandemic, which quickened the adoption of e-commerce in many parts of the world.  
Last month, Square (NYSE:SQ) agreed to buy Australia's Afterpay in a cash and share deal that valued the loss-making payments group at $29 billion.
In another agreement, Affirm tied up with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to offer its ‘buy now, pay later’ option to the online retailer’s customers.
The ‘buy now, pay later’ option has been the mainstay of credit card companies for decades. However, most fintech BNPLs don't charge interest. Instead, they make their money on the difference between what they pay the merchant and what they subsequently recoup from the buyer. While the user-friendly model may juice sales for the merchant, concerns about the model have arisen due to the widespread lack of credit checks involved - despite the fact that the payments company is, effectively, providing credit.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering allowing foreign institutional investors to buy up to a total of 20% in state-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), a government source said on Wednesday, as it presses ahead with a stake sale. 
The listing of LIC is set to be India's biggest ever initial public offering (IPO), with the government aiming to raise up to 900 billion rupees ($12.2 billion) from its stake sale.
At present, even though foreign institutional investors are allowed to hold up to 74% of private insurance companies and up to 20% of state-owned banks, they are not permitted to own shares in LIC.
Enabling this would allow foreign pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds to participate in the IPO of India's largest life insurer.
The government is keen to complete the listing this financial year to help with budgetary constraints and late last month selected 10 merchant banks out of the sixteen that had bid to kick-start the process.
In total, the merchant banks will earn a fee of around 100 million rupees ($1.36 million), higher than the token fee charged on some IPOs of state-owned firms in the past, but still significantly lower than fees for private listings. 
For instance, food delivery startup Zomato paid $31 million in fees for listing earlier this year, according to Dealogic.

The low fee, however, has not been a deterrent, with nearly all the major banks barring  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) queuing up.
""We can’t care less about what is the money that is being offered. It is the biggest IPO in recent times and will be probably the biggest, say for another 5 years,"" said a merchant banker.

Shareholders led by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) will sell 15 million shares - around 12% of the company's entire equity. That may rise by another 2.25 million shares (1.9% of shares outstanding) if underwriters exercise an over-allotment option.
At Thursday's closing price, the 15 million share block was worth around $866 million.
The company, whose chief site is a rarity in the world of dating apps in as much as it only allows women to initiate contact, has seen its stock rise by around one-third since listing in February. That's despite ongoing losses and an apparent slowdown in revenue growth as pandemic-related tailwinds faded.
Bumble expects third-quarter revenue between $195 million and $198 million and annual revenue in a range of $752 million to $762 million. As such, its current valuation is over nine times expected annual sales, according to data compiled by Investing.com."

The Frenchman, who led the ECB from 2003 to 2011, sees a chance that the Governing Council might slow down emergency bond-buying to levels seen earlier in the crisis when it meets on Thursday. But he doesn’t foresee officials following the path of the Federal Reserve, which is looking to start phasing out stimulus this year.
“We are in a different universe, it seems to me, in the U.S. and in Europe,” Trichet said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “In the U.S. you had a commitment to purchase exactly the same amount every month, and this is a clear-cut commitment. Tapering means something. In Europe there is flexibility.”
Trichet warned that inflation pressures across the two regions can’t be compared, in particular when looking at indicators that strip out the effect of volatile energy and food prices. Yet ECB policy makers have been publicly debating whether the improving outlook warrants a discussion on when to end their extraordinary crisis support.
“In Europe, we are not yet in terms of core inflation at a level which would be alarming in my own reading,” Trichet said. “Whatever decision they take, what is rejoicing to see is that the European economy is growing faster than was anticipated.”

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has struck a deal to buy a majority stake in German car giant Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s payments business ahead of a planned rollout of in-car technology that allows drivers to automatically pay for fuel or tolls.
The U.S. bank has agreed to buy close to 75% of Volkswagen Payments S.A. for an undisclosed sum, subject to regulatory approvals.
The Luxembourg-based business was founded in 2017 and operates across 32 countries. It offers car purchase and leasing, in-vehicle payments, fuelling and electric vehicle charging and subscription services such as insurance and in-vehicle entertainment.
JPMorgan said it plans to invest in and rebrand the payments business and expand its mobility-focused payments to other industries.
""One of the fastest-growing platforms is the connected car marketplace, whereby the car acts like a wallet for purchasing goods, services or subscriptions,"" Shahrokh Moinian, EMEA head of wholesale payments at JPMorgan, told Reuters. 
Non-finance companies, including car manufacturers, have stepped up expansion into financial services in recent years.
Volkswagen's financial services division will retain a 25.1% stake in the payments business, JPMorgan said. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022. 

Volkswagen Group did not provide a breakdown of earnings for the payments business in its half-year results in July, but said sales at its financial services arm were 22.6 billion euros ($26.77 billion), up 18% on the prior year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global private equity firm Carlyle said on Wednesday it led a $312 million funding round for Japanese biotech company Spiber Inc, joining other global investors in betting on a growing number of late-stage Japanese startup firms.
Carlyle's 10 billion yen ($91 million) stake in Spiber represents the group's first non-buyout, minority investment in an unlisted startup in Japan, where startup funding is soaring.
The round, which also includes investments from fund managers Fidelity and Baillie Gifford, will be made through a combination of the allotment of new shares and a capital infusion at a valuation of about 135 billion yen ($1.22 billion). 
Spiber makes plant-based protein polymers through microbial fermentation, which can be spun into animal- and plastic-free fibres for clothing, auto parts and other uses.
The 14-year-old company plans to use the proceeds to build a mass production facility in Iowa and to prepare itself for an initial public offering that it targets in several years, Spiber co-founder Kazuhide Sekiyama told Reuters in an interview.
Fuelled by excess global liquidity, funding raised by Japanese startups exceeded $3 billion in the first six months of the year, a half-year record, according to startup data provider INITIAL.
Some of the biggest funding deals this year involved global investors such as KKR and Sequoia Capital, helping expand the list of promising Japanese startups capable of raising large capital in the private markets. 
Japan has less than a dozen unicorns - startups with a valuation in excess of $1 billion - partly because the relaxed listing criteria of the Tokyo bourse's emerging market section allows startups to go public in early stages.
Carlyle, a cornerstone investor in Spiber, plans to allocate about 10% of its $2.5 billion Japan-focused buyout fund to similar funding deals for startups.

""We believe we can help them grow their businesses, through M&As and overseas expansions,"" to an extent they are large enough to debut on the Tokyo bourse's main board or overseas, Carlyle managing director Yusuke Watanabe said in the same interview.

TOKYO(Reuters) - As the world rushes to cut carbon emissions, hydrogen fuel cells may offer global telecoms an environmentally friendly solution to power energy-hungry remote networks, experts say. 
Telecoms run vast arrays of relay stations, data centres and other infrastructure that need reliable, constant power. Hydrogen fuel cells, invented in the 1800s and used in U.S. and Russian space programmes, can replace noisy, polluting diesel generators that sometimes run 24 hours a day, their proponents say.
The cells are quiet, have few moving parts and only emit water. With the UN in August sounding ""code red for humanity"" over global warming, such power sources are attractive for a sector that accounts for 3% of global energy consumption.
""They are a great concept and I think that diesel generators are on their way out,"" said Uwe Lambrette, a partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman, who focuses on telecommunications. 
Emissions from powering networks and IT make up nearly a third of the carbon footprint of telecom companies, Lambrette said, based on a survey of 19 global operators.
Telecoms need generators that can quickly power up during electricity outages, and in remote locations they are often the sole power supply. Solar and wind, which do not always provide stable power levels, are not workable, experts say.
Fuel cells strip electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst, combining the resulting gas with oxygen. This produces electricity, heat and water. 
But the technology still has barriers to overcome. The fuel is difficult to store and little infrastructure is in place for transporting it long distances from where it is produced. The cost of hydrogen is also high: roughly 10 times as much as diesel in some markets.
In Japan, hydrogen enjoys strong government support, including subsidies for technology and infrastructure. Hydrogen-fuelled buses and cars are increasingly common and Toyota is building a prototype city powered by the gas near Mt. Fuji. Many companies see an opportunity.
""In Japan, fuel cells are usually used as a combined heat and power source or for transport,"" said Mike Benner, a Tokyo-based consultant on electricity grids and power systems, who has also worked in Japan's mobile phone industry.
Benner said that ""there are lots of reasons why hydrogen has not been a backup power application,"" including that the fuel is ""notoriously difficult to store."" 
GenCell, a small Israeli company that went public last year, is working with one of Japan's major telecoms operators to test its G5 fuel cell unit, CEO Rami Reshef told Reuters. The company's shareholders include Japan's TDK (OTC:TTDKY) Corp. 
Reshef declined to identify the Japanese company. It announced in July that Germany's Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) is also testing its fuel cells, and the G5 is in commercial use in 14 countries, including the U.S. and Japan, Reshef said.
Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) said it was working on fuel-cell projects but declined to provide details. 
""Our pure hydrogen fuel-cell generators are still at the testing stage, not only for the telecoms sector but also for other industries,"" a Panasonic spokesperson said.
Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) has considered hydrogen fuel cells as backup power units for data centres but is not adopting them because of ""difficulty in securing and storing hydrogen fuel in a stable manner"" and not being able ""to sufficiently confirm (their) safety,"" a spokesperson said.
Other companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) either declined to comment or did not respond to multiple inquiries.
Reshef said backup power from the G5 in Japan would cost about $0.83 per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with $1.22/kWh for diesel generators, a calculation Benner said ""seems reasonable"". 
""There's no doubt fuel cells can work,"" said Tomas Kåberger, affiliate professor at Chalmers University of Technology.""But where does the hydrogen come from? If transported, it would likely increase costs even compared to diesel.""
In Japan, hydrogen gas is usually produced by refineries and chemical makers as a byproduct or through steam or gas reforming processes and is transported in high-pressure tanks. 
Hydrogen has an energy density nearly three times that of diesel but costs about 1,100 yen ($10.00) per kilogram in Japan, while the fossil fuel costs an average of 133 yen a litre, or roughly 1 kilogram, for consumers. 
To produce the same amount of energy for the same cost, the price of hydrogen would have to fall to roughly twice that of diesel, according to U.S. government data.

Most hydrogen comes from fossil fuels and is called brown or blue hydrogen because it is not emissions-free. But more companies are investing in electrolysers powered by renewables to produce ""green"" hydrogen.
The United States aims to reduce the cost of green hydrogen to $1 per kilogram by 2030, while $150 billion in projects for producing the fuel were announced globally in 2020, compared with none five years earlier.

In Japan, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) estimates more than half of its 700,000 tonnes of carbon emissions in the year through March 2020 came from its 230,000 base stations. Softbank has 1,000 diesel generators and is not testing or using hydrogen fuel cells. 

The other two main telecoms in Japan, KDDI (OTC:KDDIF) and NTT DoCoMo, did not respond to written requests for comment. The three operators are building nearly 70,000 new base stations to handle the ever higher loads of data on mobile networks. More than 20,000 of those need continuous, reliable backup power, according to GenCell.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Wednesday, as investors fretted that the resurgence of Covid cases would result in slowing growth, particularly in the U.S., the main global economic driver.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.8%.
The declines in Europe followed volatile trading on Wall Street Tuesday, as the holiday-shortened week started with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 260 points, or 0.8%.
Worries of slowing growth, exacerbated by the disappointing August jobs report just as the Federal Reserve considers pulling back its bond-buying program, have prompted a more risk-averse mood.
In European corporate news, WM Morrison (LON:MRW) stock rose 0.5% after the British supermarket group confirmed earlier Wednesday that it is in talks with its two suitors and the U.K. Takeover Panel over the potential for an auction to settle its future ownership.
The supermarket chain, the fourth largest in the U.K., agreed a 7 billion pound ($9.6 billion) offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice last month, but a rival consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress Investment is still thought to be interested.
Additionally,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) stock fell 1.5% after the French drugmaker announced plans to buy U.S. biopharmaceutical company Kadmon (NASDAQ:KDMN) in a $1.9 billion deal.
Halfords (LON:HFD) stock fell 3.4%, with Britain's largest cycling retailer stating that supply chain issues were dragging on its business, even as it stuck to its full-year guidance.
Elsewhere, Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) stock fell 5.3% to its lowest level in a month after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cut its recommendation on the wind turbine maker to neutral from outperform. Chief executive Andreas Nauen had said last week the company would exit certain markets, such as onshore generation in China, and also said it would have to raise its prices by up to 5% to offset higher input costs.

Crude prices stabilized on Wednesday after recent losses, with attention turning to the U.S. market as producers in the Gulf of Mexico struggle to restart operations in the wake of Hurricane Ida.
Over a week after the hurricane made landfall, more than three-quarters of U.S. Gulf production remains offline. The inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later Wednesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Thursday will be studied closely, as traders look for a more complete picture of the storm's impact on crude production and refinery output.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will give about $3.5 billion in incentives to auto companies over a five-year period under a revised scheme to boost the manufacturing and export of clean technology vehicles, two sources aware of the latest proposal told Reuters.
The government's original plan was to give about $8 billion to automakers and part manufacturers to promote mainly gasoline technology, with added benefits for electric vehicles (EVs). 
The scheme was redrawn to focus on companies that build electric and hydrogen fuel-powered vehicles, Reuters reported on Friday https://reut.rs/3jIuxm5, with the shift just as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is gearing up to enter India https://reut.rs/3hWd2Ok. 
It was not immediately clear why the allocation had been revised, but one of the sources said that since the focus had changed to clean and advanced technology fewer companies would be eligible for the incentives. 
India sees clean auto technology as central to its strategy to reduce its oil dependence and cut the debilitating pollution in its major cities, while also meeting its emissions commitment under the Paris Climate Accord. 
Domestic automaker  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) is the largest seller of electric cars in India, with rival Mahindra & Mahindra and motor-bike companies TVS Motor and Hero MotoCorp firming up their EV plans. 
India's biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, has no near-term plan to launch EVs as it does not see volumes or affordability for consumers, its chairman said last month.
A government official with direct knowledge of the matter said the initial allocation over the five-year period has been reduced but that up to $8 billion could be made available if the scheme is successful, initial funds are spent, and certain conditions are met. 
The official did not specify those conditions, and India's industry and finance ministries did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
Details of the scheme, part of India's broader $27 billion programme to attract global manufacturers, could be made public as early as next week, the two sources said. 
Under the revised scheme, companies that qualify will get cashback payments equivalent to around 10%-20% of their turnover for EVs and hydrogen fuel cell cars, one of the sources said.

Carmakers would need to invest a minimum of about $272 million over five years to qualify for the payments. 
Auto parts makers will get incentives to produce components for clean cars and for investing in safety-related parts and other advanced technologies like sensors and radars used in connected vehicles.

The regulators' remarks on Monday came amid heightened market concern over regulatory activity across a range of sectors, from technology to private tutoring.
Tianyan Capital, which employs fast computers that use mathematical and statistical analyses to trade, said it had suspended fresh fundraising on Sept. 7 after prudent considerations.
""Recently, the company has actively curbed growth in assets under management (AUM) using various methods, but we think we're still growing too fast,"" Tianyan said in a statement to clients on Tuesday. 
The fundraising suspension is aimed at safeguarding investors' interest, and ""managing the size cautiously has become a key part of our long-term success,"" said Tianyan, whose AUM has tripled so far this year to 30 billion yuan, according to its website. 
A Shanghai-based official of the company confirmed that quant fundraising had been suspended, but declined to say if the decision was a result of pressure from regulators.
Tianyan's decision came days after rival quant fund manager Evolution Asset Management announced it would not launch new quant products this year, and suspended fundraising in some existing funds. 
Another hedge fund manager, Starvast, made a similar announcement in late August in a bid to manage its pace of growth. 
Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said on Monday the rapidly growing number of ""quants"" was a challenge to stock exchanges. 
In mature markets, such quantitative and high-frequency trading had led to better liquidity, but also fueled herd behaviour, greater volatility and unfairness, he added.
A senior executive of a quant fund manager, who declined to be identified, said regulators have been in constant communication with the industry, and collecting information on Chinese quant funds.
China's quantitative private funds totalled nearly 1 trillion yuan ($154.6 billion) at the end of June, according to Citic Securities. That is almost ten times their size in 2017.

Halfords, Britain's largest cycling retailer, said it expected the cycling supply chain issues, which include factory production constraints, raw material inflation, freight disruption and driver shortages, to continue for some time. 
British retailers, cafes and restaurants are struggling to cope with a shortage of drivers, and in particular heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers, and food processing staff after COVID-19.
The problem is not unique to Britain - the United States and other European countries also have truck driver shortages, while across the world, there is also pressure on the wider supply chain due to COVID-19 and a shortage of container vessels and high raw material prices. 
Halfords said on Wednesday that it was sticking to its full-year target for pretax profit to come in at above 75 million pounds ($103 million), buoyed by higher sales in its retail motoring arm, which were helped by the trend for staycations this summer. 
For the 20-week period to Aug. 20, Halfords said underlying sales in cycling were down 23% compared to last year, although it noted that last year was unusual due to the pandemic, while sales for motoring products rose 52%. 

Last year the company benefitted from a pick up in cycling as Britons tried to avoid public transport due to COVID-19 and bought or repaired bikes instead. Halfords said it remained confident in the long-term outlook for the cycling market.

Rising cases of the delta strain of Covid-19, and tension between elevated inflation expectations and low yields and easy monetary policy are at play during a time “that has historically poor seasonality,” strategists including Andrew Sheets wrote in a note on Tuesday.
The investment bank’s caution on U.S. equities comes as the S&P 500 Index has outperformed global equities this year to make new records, even as coronavirus infections have started rising again in many parts of the world, and as the U.S. Federal Reserve edges closer to setting a path toward tapering stimulus.  
Morgan Stanley said it prefers stocks in Europe and Japan in its global allocation. “We buy Brazil equities, sell gold and stay short U.S. duration, on the belief that all reflect too much growth pessimism,” they added.
They highlighted five key themes for investors to consider: divergences in central bank policies, vaccination drives, valuation divergence, echoes of 2004 in the credit market and a recovery in consumption of services.

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit and Italy's Treasury are set to extend discussions over the sale of state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena beyond an exclusivity deadline on Wednesday, two people close to the matter said.
Italy's second-largest bank agreed at the end of July to start exclusive talks to evaluate buying ""selected parts"" of Monte dei Paschi (MPS), which is 64% owned by the Treasury following a 2017 bailout. 
The two parties agreed to guidelines for an accord at the time stating a deal must leave UniCredit's capital reserves unaffected and boost its earnings per share by at least 10%.
They did not set any formal deadline for an agreement and sources had said talks would likely drag on beyond the 40-day exclusivity period and possibly extend beyond a by-election in Siena slated for Oct. 3-4.
The two people said talks would continue in the coming weeks regardless of whether the exclusivity period was extended.
UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel said in July both his bank and the Treasury were eager to reach a decision as early as possible.
An accord would allow Italy to meet re-privatisation commitments taken with European Union authorities at the time of MPS' bailout. But the cost of the deal for Italian taxpayers, including cash to fund job cuts that may affect up to a third of MPS' current workforce, complicate matters.
MPS is the biggest private employer in Siena, where Enrico Letta, the leader of the PD party - part of Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition government - is running for a seat in parliament.
UniCredit bankers led by veteran executive Andrea Maffezzoni and new hire Giacomo Marino have poured over MPS' books in the past few weeks to decide which assets to take on.

UniCredit will leave behind all of MPS' problem loans and any loans it deems likely to turn sour. The bank will also be shielded from legal risks stemming from mismanagement.
The Milanese bank wants the deal to boost its presence in Italy's centre-north, while it is expected to leave branches in the country's poorer south to state-owned peer MCC.

The world's largest miner is building out its portfolio in what it calls ""future facing commodities"", expecting demand for electric vehicles and green energy to determine the minerals that will drive profits in coming years. 
Privately held KoBold uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to hunt for raw materials. Its principal investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Jeff Bezos. 
Miners have been moving towards machine learning to find underground deposits in recent years, leading to some big discoveries, such as Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s copper project Winu. 
""Globally, shallow ore deposits have largely been discovered, and remaining resources are likely deeper underground and harder to see from the surface,"" said Keenan Jennings, vice-president of BHP Metals Exploration. 
""We need new approaches to find the next generation of essential minerals, and this alliance will combine historical data, artificial intelligence, and geoscience expertise to uncover what has previously been hidden,"" he said. 
The alliance will cover an area in Western Australia of more than 500,000 sq km (193,000 sq miles), KoBold CEO Kurt House told Reuters. 
""Exploration success rates have been declining over the last couple of decades ... because the easy things have been found,"" House said. 
The discovery zones over the next 20 years will be at depths of 200 m to 1,500 m, he said. 
""That’s the area that is very poorly explored (and) is likely to host a tremendous number of ore bodies."" 
KoBold has a dozen tie-ups across about 20 locations including Sub-Saharan Africa, North America and Australia, looking for copper, cobalt, nickel and lithium, House said. 
Australia has some of the world's best mapping data for prospective minerals, while its solid regulatory environment also make it an attractive destination, House said. 
KoBold, however, said it is closely watching development of a bill to protect Aboriginal heritage in Western Australia. Indigenous groups have protested a draft of the bill because it denies them final say-so over protection of their sacred sites, which could become a governance issue for miners and investors. 

KoBold is planning to set up an Australian office in the next 12 months and is looking for other exploration partners. 
""Inside the area of interest we are exclusive for BHP, but outside we are open for business.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp said on Wednesday detailed talks on potential take-private deals would make sense only after all strategic options are carefully reviewed, spurning calls from some shareholders to start soliciting buyout bids.
The statement comes as the Japanese industrial conglomerate has been in talks https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-toshiba-talks-with-four-investment-firms-strategic-ideas-sources-2021-08-25 with financial and strategic investors, including KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and three other global private equity firms to seek their ideas for its new strategy.
But the latest process is not meant to formally solicit buyout bids for the overall company or some of its assets, puzzling some investors who have questioned why the company has not started an official soliciting process, sources have said.
Toshiba's strategic review should first focus on understanding the approach of potential investors to enhancing corporate value, including their approach to resolving the multiple issues faced in pursuing a take-private option, the board said in a statement.
""The board believes that a meaningful and informed discussion on pricing would be most productive once discussions on enhancing value have been completed to its satisfaction,"" it said.

""As such, the board has not yet decided on the most appropriate course of action and is continuing to explore feasible strategic alternatives,"" it added.
Toshiba launched a full review of its current assets after it dismissed a $20 billion takeover https://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-ma-idCNL1N2MD0J4 bid from CVC Capital Partners as lacking detail. The results of the review will be presented when the company announces a new mid-term business plan in October.

The BlackRock China New Horizon Mixed Securities Investment Fund, launched on Aug. 30, stopped taking new subscriptions on Sept. 3, a week earlier than planned.
""We are very proud of achieving this milestone for our China fund management business, and are grateful for investors' overwhelming support,"" Rachel Lord, BlackRock's chair and head of Asia-Pacific, said in a statement. 
The fundraising by the world's biggest asset manager is being closely watched as more global players prepare to enter China's fast-growing, but highly competitive mutual fund market. 
Fidelity International is setting up its mutual fund subsidiary in China, while Neuberger Berman,  Schroders  (LON:SDR) PLC and VanEck have also applied to set up China units to sell retail funds. Beijing scrapped a foreign ownership cap in the sector on April 1, 2020. 
Writing in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Soros had called BlackRock's investment in China a tragic mistake that would damage the national security interests of the United States and other democracies.
On Wednesday, Chi Zhang, general manager of Shanghai-based BlackRock Fund Management Co, said the asset manager was committed to bringing long-term investment opportunities for Chinese investors, leveraging its track record in investing in China A-shares and its expertise.

BlackRock, which entered China more than 15 years ago, also owns a minority-owned Chinese mutual fund venture and recently set up a majority-owned Chinese wealth management venture.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with a rally in Japanese shares slowing down.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.69% by 10:33 PM ET (2:33 AM GMT), with the country’s GDP growing a better-than-expected 1.9% year-on-year and 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 10:10PM ET</span>",Factbox-What is the 'metaverse' and how does it work?,"By Joori Roh
(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked huge interest in shared virtual environments, or the ""metaverse"". Here's how it works: 
WHAT IS THE METAVERSE?
Metaverse, a term first coined in science fiction, is a combination of the prefix ""meta"", meaning beyond, and ""universe"".
It refers to shared virtual worlds where land, buildings, avatars and even names can be bought and sold, often using cryptocurrency. In these environments, people can wander around with friends, visit buildings, buy goods and services, and attend events. 
The concept has surged in popularity during the pandemic as lockdown measures and work-from-home policies pushed more people online for both business and pleasure. 
The term covers a wide variety of virtual realities, from workplace tools to games and community platforms.
Many of the new platforms are powered by blockchain technology, using cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing a new kind of decentralised digital asset to be built, owned and monetised.
WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?
A blockchain http://graphics.reuters.com/TECHNOLOGY-BLOCKCHAIN/010070P11GN/index.html is a database that is shared across a network of computers. 
Once a record has been added to the chain it is very difficult to change. To ensure all the copies of the database are the same, the network makes constant checks. 
Blockchain has been used to underpin cyber-currencies like bitcoin, but many other possible uses are emerging.
WHAT ARE NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS (NFTs)?
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a new type of virtual asset that have fuelled much of the growth in the metaverse. 
An NFT represents an intangible digital item such as an image, video, or in-game item. Owners of NFTs are recorded on blockchain, allowing an NFT to be traded as a stand-in for the digital asset it represents.
The NFT market has surged during the pandemic with $2.5 billion in sales https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-nft-data-idCAKCN2EB1I8 for the first half of 2021, compared with just $13.7 million a year ago. 
Some NFT enthusiasts see them as collectibles with intrinsic value because of their cultural significance, while others treat them as an investment, speculating on rising prices.
A digital-only artwork https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-nfts-insight-idUSKCN2AT1HG ""Everydays - The First 5000 Days"" by American artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, was sold for nearly $70 million at Christie's in March in the first ever such sale by a major auction house.
WHO ARE THE BIG PLAYERS?
The metaverse can be broadly broken down into two distinct types of platforms.
The first centres around building a blockchain-based metaverse, using NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox allow people to purchase virtual parcels of land and build their own environments.
The second group uses the metaverse to refer to virtual worlds more generally, where people can meet up for business or recreation.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sets-up-new-team-work-metaverse-2021-07-26 announced in July it was creating a product team to work on the metaverse. 
Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft, gaming platforms where users can compete and collaborate in games as well as create their own, fall into this category. 
BUYING INTO AND MAKING MONEY IN THE METAVERSE
While many metaverse platforms provide free accounts for people to join, people buying or trading virtual assets on blockchain-based platforms need to use cryptocurrencies. 
Several blockchain-based platforms require Ethereum-based crypto tokens, such as MANA for Decentraland and SAND for The Sandbox, to purchase and trade virtual assets.
In Decentraland, users can trade NFT artworks or charge entry to a virtual exhibition or concert. They can also make money by trading land, prices of which have surged over the past few years.
On Roblox, users can make money by charging other users for access to games they create.
THE FUTURE OF THE METAVERSE
It is unclear to what extent a true metaverse, which fully replicates real life, is possible or how long it would take to develop. 
Many platforms in the blockchain-based metaverse are still developing Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technology that will allow users to fully interact in the space.

Accounting and advisory giant PwC forecasts VR and AR technologies to deliver a $1.5 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, compared with $46.5 billion in 2019.
Big tech firms are jumping into the space, with Facebook Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) investing in cloud computing and VR companies in anticipation of its growth.

51,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 10:00PM ET</span>",Evergrande Slumps Below 2009 IPO Price After Fitch Downgrade,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group shares fell below their 2009 initial public offering price after a second credit-rating downgrade in as many days boosted concern the developer will default on its debt.
The stock dropped 2.8% to HK$3.47 in Hong Kong trading on Wednesday morning, breaching the HK$3.5 apiece offered on debut. Shares of the troubled developer have tumbled about 77% this year, while many of its dollar bonds are hovering below 30 cents. 
Fitch Ratings cut Evergrande to CC, saying a default seems probable as the company struggles to address its worsening liquidity issues. Evergrande has been repeatedly downgraded in recent months, reflecting the deepening crisis at the world’s most indebted developer as it scrambles to raise cash and keep creditors at bay.  
“The downgrade reflects our view that a default of some kind appears probable,” Fitch said in a statement. “We believe credit risk is high given tight liquidity, declining contracted sales, pressure to address delayed payments to suppliers and contractors, and limited progress on asset disposals.”
The move by Fitch came a day after Moody’s Investors Service cut Evergrande’s credit rating by three notches to Ca, which implies it is “likely in or very near default.” The conglomerate’s liquidity and default risk is “heightened,” Moody’s said in its third downgrade of the real estate giant since June. 
With more than $300 billion of liabilities, Evergrande may roil lenders, suppliers, small businesses and millions of homebuyers should it collapse. Chinese authorities have kept quiet about their plans for the company so far, aside from urging it to resolve its debt risks. 
Read how the clock is ticking on Evergrande’s debt 
Evergrande itself last week warned of default risks if its efforts to raise cash fall short. Its cash coverage to short-term borrowings worsened in the first half to 36% from 47% from six months earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on an earnings statement. The company hasn’t sold a dollar bond since January last year.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 09:31PM ET</span>",South Korea's 'Gen MZ' leads rush into the 'metaverse',"By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean engineer Shaun has big plans to develop the parcels of land he has snapped up for millions of won (thousands of dollars) in recent years into long-term moneyspinners. 
""I'm planning to design my building which is suitable to host K-pop live performances and K-drama screenings,"" the 30-year-old investor told Reuters. ""That can probably lead to a profitable business model in two to three years.""
And construction won't be hampered by any coronavirus pandemic-spurred labour shortages or increased costs. Shaun's grand project is all in the blockchain-based virtual world Decentraland.
The ""metaverse https://www.reuters.com/business/metaverse-bet-crypto-rich-investors-snap-up-virtual-real-estate-2021-04-19"" may be a futuristic prospect for most of the world, but it's increasingly a reality in South Korea where soaring home prices and income inequality have enticed the so-called Generation MZ, or Gen MZ, into alternative online worlds.
Their digital avatars play games, walk around with friends, host social gatherings, shop and party - and make plans to build cities and profitable businesses. 
Shaun, who declined to be identified other than by the name of his Decentraland avatar, has gradually immersed himself in the platform over the past three years.
Users can buy land in this virtual world with the aim of hosting real businesses there, like a nightclub that charges users for access. Just like in the real world, the success of the businesses and the communities around them can raise the value of your virtual land.
And investment managers, telecom firms and even the South Korean government are all plugging in.
Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management expects its Samsung Global Metaverse Fund, launched in late June, to easily beat its goal of drawing 100 billion won ($86.49 million) by the end of 2021, with around 1-2 billion won flowing in everyday.
Choi Byung-geun, Samsung Asset Management vice president, said interest in the metaverse had grown since the pandemic as people worked remotely. The Samsung fund launched just two weeks after KB Asset Management's KB Global Metaverse Economy Fund.
""With global big tech companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) seeing their business direction shifting toward the metaverse, the industry is raking in money,"" Choi said. 
SK Telecom, the country's largest mobile carrier, launched a metaverse 'ifland' in July where denizens can host and attend meetings with other animated avatars.
""As the social trend shifted to non-face-to-face due to the pandemic era, the demand (for metaverse services) jumped,"" an SK Telecom official told Reuters. ""There are thousands of rooms being created everyday and tens of thousands of daily users.""
SK Telecom is part of a 'Metaverse Alliance' launched by the South Korean government in mid-May that includes more than 200 companies and institutions. 
A Ministry of Science and ICT official told Reuters the government hopes to play a lead role in the metaverse industry. In a 604.4 trillion won budget for 2022 unveiled last week, the government earmarked 9.3 trillion won to accelerate a digital transformation and foster new industries such as the metaverse.
MZ GENERATION 
South Koreans have been especially open to the attractions of the metaverse, even though it remains unclear to what extent a full replication of real life is possible, or how long it will take to develop. 
Social experts attribute the interest to the disgruntled MZ generation - a term coined in the country that merges Millennials and Generation Z, encompassing those born between 1981 and the early 2010s.
As the coronavirus pandemic has dragged on, a new lexicon has sprung up in South Korea for the ""untact"" - the opposite of ""contact"" - economy.
""The craze for the metaverse reflects the sadness and anger of the MZ generation due to polarisation,"" said Kim Sang-kyun, an industrial engineering professor at Kangwon National University who has published two best-selling books on the metaverse since late 2020.
""They do not consider the metaverse as an alternative or replacement of reality, instead it's just another part of their lives,"" said Kim. ""They are the generation that has communicated with the world through devices since birth, unlike the older generation.""
For 37-year old Choi Ji-ung, it was frustration with real estate prices and regulations in the physical world that drove him to buy property in geolocation-based platform Earth 2.
Choi's 50 million won investment in the pricey Gangnam district in Seoul on Earth 2 is something he can only dream of in the real world.
""It was easy to purchase and not as expensive as I thought,"" he said.
Fuelling many of the metaverse platforms are non-fungible tokens (NFT), intangible digital assets encompassing everything from artworks and videos to clothes and avatars, which are purchased with cryptocurrency.
Decentraland offers a limited number of digital land parcels, or LAND, in the form of NFTs that are acquired using MANA, a fungible token that acts as the game's currency. MANA, an altcoin, can be purchased with fiat currency on limited cryptocurrency exchanges or in a swap with digital currencies like bitcoin or ether.
As in the real world, land parcels located closer to popular districts are more valuable than others. Some land parcels that sold for about $20 each when Decentraland launched in 2017 now change hands for hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
As the platform develops, Shaun and other landowners believe they will be able to make money by using their land for a variety of commercial businesses, such as building concert venues and charging admission for performances.
Changes and developments to Decentraland are overseen by the Decentraland Foundation, which was set up as a nonprofit organization to act on behalf of users.
PROPERTY DEVELOPERS
Wang Keun-il, a 36-year-old fintech entrepreneur, owns lands in North Korea's capital Pyongyang, Vatican City and Egypt on Earth 2, where he plans to build a profitable tourism or educational business. 
Earth 2, which launched in November, is not a fully-fledged metaverse environment, but rather a marketplace for selling digital tiles which represent parts of the Earth. Users cannot currently ""enter"" the land they have bought, meaning Wang has taken a gamble on a world that is yet to materialise. 
Earth 2 Chief Executive Shane Isaac told Reuters South Koreans were the most active users on the platform, based on self-affiliation, spending about $9.1 million, followed by the United States with $7.5 million and Italy with $3.9 million.
Decentraland said its platform had more than 7,067 active users from South Korea in the 30 days to Sept. 1, second only to the United States.
""People won't forget about or move away from the industry once things return to something resembling normality,"" Dave Carr, a communications lead for Decentraland Foundation, told Reuters.
""If anything, this period will define the most important, valuable or relevant entities and experiences.""
On the stock market, net purchases of gaming firm Roblox Corp made it the top foreign stock purchased in June and July, Korea Securities Depository (KSD) data showed.
Shares in local AR and VR technology firms MAXST and WYSIWYG STUDIOS have soared in recent months.

Earth 2 investor Choi is conscious of potential metaverse pitfalls but excited: ""Depending on the point of view, some could see it as a ridiculous thing or a bubble, but some see it as an opportunity.""

54,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 08:21PM ET</span>","Asia eyes Australia blueprint as $100 billion oil, gas clean-up looms","By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia has passed legislation that could set a precedent for who pays to clean up the fossil fuel industry in Asia, making former owners of oil and gas fields responsible for the costs of dismantling facilities if later owners fail.
The new law provides a blueprint for governments tussling with the oil and gas industry over the removal of hundreds of obsolete energy facilities, particularly as the world moves to a lower-carbon economy.
The cost of decommissioning offshore facilities in Australia is expected to run to $40 billion, with half of that in the next 10 years. For Asia-Pacific as a whole the clean-up bill is estimated at $100 billion out to 2050, say consultants Wood Mackenzie.
Australia's legislation steps up scrutiny of asset sales to ensure any new owner has the financial and technical capacity to handle decommissioning. Most controversially, it introduces trailing liability, modelled on the UK's North Sea regime, holding former owners of assets liable for decommissioning if a current owner goes bust. 
Selling mature oil and gas fields to niche players with low overheads who can prolong the lives of the fields profitably has been standard practice at ageing sites around the world, especially in the North Sea, U.S. Gulf of Mexico and off Australia.
However, Australia acted after being left to handle the decommissioning https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/australia-oil-industry-up-arms-over-proposed-decommissioning-levy-2021-06-29, estimated at up to A$1 billion ($725 million), of the Laminaria-Corallina oil fields in the Timor Sea, abandoned by a small company when it collapsed in 2019.
Stricter criteria are expected to deter those kinds of sales in Australia at a time when several oil and gas fields are nearing the end of their lives off southeastern and Western Australia, to the chagrin of the industry.
""If you get everything else right, one would hope you would never find yourself in a position where trailing liability has to be exercised,"" said Andrew McConville, chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the industry's main lobby group.
Already,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and partner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) pulled the sale of assets off southeastern Australia after a warning from government to be careful in choosing buyers. BHP last month agreed instead to merge its petroleum business with Australia's top independent gas producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum. (Graphic: Australia’s main oil & gas fields, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lbpgnnxbwvq/AustraliaOilBasins.png) 
AGEING ASIAN FIELDS
Around Southeast Asia there are hundreds of platforms nearing the end of their lives, but countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have no overarching decommissioning rules. Companies operate as contractors with production sharing contracts with the state.
Older contracts did not give much consideration to abandonment, and as those contracts have expired or international oil companies have exited, there has been legal uncertainty over who should pay for decommissioning, Wood Mackenzie research director Andrew Harwood said.
In Thailand,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) is trying to resolve a dispute which has held up the handover of operations at the Erawan gas field in the Gulf of Thailand to Thailand's PTT Exporation and Production Pcl (PTTEP).
Thailand wants Chevron to pay the full rehabilitation costs of around $2 billion for the Erawan field, including assets it is due to hand over to PTTEP.
""The Gulf of Thailand situation is a challenge,"" Harwood said. ""And it could perhaps delay PTT's efforts to invest in those blocks.""
In Malaysia, if a company's operating contract has expired before decommissioning work is done, the work is picked up by state-owned Petronas, exposing it to issues such as currency risk, which can blow out rehabilitation costs.
""Given the trend of the large oil and gas companies exiting the region and the entry of smaller players who are less financially secure ... principles such as trailing liability could be something which the country and Petronas explore in order to mitigate some of these risks,"" said Fariz Aziz, a partner at Malaysian law firm Skrine.
Indonesia, the most proactive on tackling abandonment issues over the past several years, requires operators to set aside funds for decommissioning.
The country's oil and gas regulator, SKK Migas, said in July it has prepared a decommissioning roadmap for 100 platforms no longer in use, and is considering reusing facilities, including as reefs, to monitor weather or for border security.
WoodMac's Harwood said Southeast Asia will likely see more examples of arbitration when there's a disagreement on who foots the bill, but trailing liability is set to become a feature of new contracts.

""It can be done and we'll definitely see that being included in contracts going forward,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing $2.3 trillion in assets on Wednesday called for more than 1,000 private companies to provide environmental data through non-profit disclosure platform CDP to address a gap in transparency with their listed peers.
CDP said the group, including Neuberger Berman and Nuveen, had helped create a questionnaire for private firms that would be used to benchmark them - a crucial step as they increasingly snap up high-carbon assets from listed companies.
Those deals, such as oil major BP (NYSE:BP)'s $5.6 billion sale of its Alaska Oil and Gas business to Hilcorp Energy, risked hindering investors' handling of climate change risks given private firms' reduced reporting requirements, the group said.
Other investors to back the initiative, dubbed the Private Markets Pilot, include M&G, Beach Point Capital, Coller Capital and Intermediate Capital Group.
The project comes as record amounts of capital are put to work in private equity and debt markets by investors. Private equity net asset value has grown three times as fast as public markets since the turn of the century, the group said.
""Encouraging more private companies to actively measure and disclose their carbon impacts - and also their water and possible deforestation impacts - is no longer a nice to have - it is essential to the low carbon transition,"" said Adam Black, Partner and Head of ESG & Sustainability at Coller Capital.
""Moreover, it will better enable investors to make much more informed investment management decisions when it comes to the private markets.""

Claire Elsdon, Joint Global Director of Capital Markets at CDP, said the data from private companies was crucial to ensure investors could meet their own commitments to reach net-zero emissions across their portfolios by 2050.
""This pilot is essential to avoiding “emissions leakage” between asset classes such as public companies selling high-carbon intense assets to private companies in a bid to avoid scrutiny and transparency,"" she added.

The move is part of a partnership the companies announced with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google to track SAF test batch emissions data using cloud-based technology.
Delta has pledged to replace 10% of its jet fuel with SAF by 2030. Sustainable aviation fuel is made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fat and can be three or four times more expensive than making traditional jet fuel. 
The Biden administration is quietly discussing a target date of 2050 for weaning aircraft off fossil fuels as part of the White House's broader push to fight climate change, Reuters reported last month citing sources.

Through the project, Chevron expects to produce the SAF at its El Segundo Refinery for Delta and Google Cloud plans to build a framework to analyze the emissions data.
The companies expect to create a more transparent model for analyzing potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions that could be adopted by organizations considering SAF programs.

(Reuters) -The head of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s car project, Doug Field, is going to work for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to lead the automaker's advanced technology and embedded systems efforts, a hiring coup for Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley.
Field most recently served as vice president of special projects at Apple and was previously senior vice president, engineering at Tesla (O:TSLA). Earlier in his career, Field worked at Ford.
In his new role, Field will report to Farley, leading software and connectivity strategy, and working in partnership with Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product platform and operations officer, Ford said. Thai-Tang oversees the development and design of cars and trucks, as well as supply chain and other operations, Ford said on Tuesday. 
The hire of Field and the management structure created to accommodate him underscore the rising importance of software and digital connectivity in the auto industry. 
“This is a watershed moment for our company,” Farley said on a call reporters.
Since taking over as Ford CEO last October, Farley has stressed the importance of developing stronger digital services and connections to generate continuing revenue from consumer and commercial customers. 
""The entire customer experience of the future goes through the embedded system,"" Farley said. 
He compared the auto industry to the mobile phone industry when the first iPhone was introduced, and customers saw that a phone could do far more than make a voice call. 
Field's move to Ford was first reported by Bloomberg.
It was not clear what Field's decision to leave Apple means for the iPhone maker's efforts to develop a vehicle for its brand. 
Industry sources told Reuters last year that Apple was aiming to launch an electric car with advanced battery technology by 2024. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY
Since then, however, Apple has not disclosed specific plans. Meanwhile, the field of start-ups and established automakers chasing Tesla Inc in China, the United States and Europe has only grown, with the investment of billions of dollars. 
Field said on Tuesday he would not talk about his work at Apple.
Apple said in a statement ""we’re grateful for the contributions Doug has made to Apple and we wish him all the best in this next chapter."" 
Field now will take on the challenge of constructively blending Silicon Valley software culture and the auto industry's manufacturing mindset that has frustrated many other executives at established automakers and at tech industry startups, including Tesla. 

Field said he plans to keep houses in Silicon Valley and Michigan, the better to have access to talent and technology in the technology sector.
In developing a new digital platform for Ford's future vehicles, Field said he is open to partnerships with technology industry partners, but ""we have to control the experience we give to our customers and we have to have control over our destiny.""

This sector momentum is being bolstered by rising in-person shopping. As a result, both eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are expected to continue growing. But which of these stocks is a better investment now? Read more to find out.eBay Inc. (EBAY), which is based in San Jose, Calif., operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's marketplace platforms include its online marketplace at ebay.com and a suite of eBay mobile apps. In comparison, Walmart Inc. (WMT) is the world’s largest retail chain. The company operates through three segments: Walmart U.S.; Walmart International; and Sam's Club.
Demand for online and in-person shopping is increasing rapidly due to improving consumer sentiment and a recovering job market. In the first half of 2021, e-commerce sales hit $408.51 billion, up 21.9% year-over-year, while offline sales increased 15.4% year-over-year in the same period. With persistent demand, the retail industry should witness a substantial increase in sales in the coming quarters also. This should bode well for both EBAY and WMT, considering their high market shares.
EBAY has gained 40.2% in price over the past six months, while WMT has returned 17% over this period. Also, EBAY’s 52.3% year-to-date gains compare with WMT’s 3.5% returns. Furthermore, in terms of the past year’s performance, EBAY is the winner with 44% gains versus WMT’s 3.3%.

Let’s find out.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Unilever PLC (UL) in London are leading players in the global consumer goods market. PG sells packaged goods through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, and department stores.

UL is a fast-moving consumer goods company that operates through Beauty & Personal Care; Foods & Refreshment; and Home Care segments.
Consumer goods stocks have seen strong sales growth in the second quarter of 2021, owing to rising commodity prices and an improving job market.

63,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",Illinois House inches closer to saving two nuclear plants,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Illinois House plans to consider an energy bill on Thursday, the House speaker said, that could prevent two  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) nuclear power plants from shutting in coming days and months. 
""I am pleased to see negotiations moving forward on a comprehensive energy proposal that prioritizes a greener future for Illinois, as well as meaningful ethics reform and maintaining our current workforce,"" House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday. 
The Illinois Senate on Sept. 1 passed a bill that contains more than $600 million in carbon mitigation credits for nuclear plants, which generate virtually emissions-free electricity.
The state has been working on the bill for nearly two years but it has been delayed on concerns of Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, some lawmakers and environmentalists that coal plants would not be phased out quickly or allowed to keep running with unproven carbon-capture equipment.
Public and political anger toward Exelon's Commonwealth Edison unit also delayed action. In 2020, the Chicago-based utility agreed to pay $200 million to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice probe over inappropriate lobbying practices.
U.S. nuclear plants have been struggling to compete with wind and solar farms and plants that burn low-cost natural gas. Exelon has said it will close its Byron nuclear plant on Sept. 13 and its Dresden plant in November if a state or federal program does not come to the rescue.
Preventing nuclear plants from closing has been a priority for the administration of President Joe Biden, which has supported tax incentives for nuclear in federal infrastructure legislation and sees the plants as important to its goal of decarbonizing the power grid by 2035.
Exelon has said the federal incentives alone could not come fast enough to save the plants. The company said it has authorized uranium fuel shipments to Byron for use if the legislation passes. But Exelon said the fuel will be shipped to another plant if no action is taken and Byron will permanently shut.

WASHINGTON/MILAN (Reuters) -U.S. shares were mixed and global equities retreated from record highs on Tuesday as investors balanced mounting worries over the slowing pace of economic recovery and hopes the Federal Reserve will delay tapering its bond purchases.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.76% to end at 35,100 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.34% to 4,520.03. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.07% to 15,374.33, as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) both hit record highs.
The MSCI world equity index retreated from a an all-time high overnight, following seven consecutive days of gains to all-time highs. Earlier in the session, hopes of extra stimulus in Japan and strong China trade data had boosted Asia shares.
""The combination of exorbitant expectations, nosebleed valuations and slowing macro environment make the go-forward reward/risk outlook less attractive,"" said Jeffrey Carbone, managing director at Cornerstone Wealth in Huntersville, North Carolina.
European stocks retraced ahead of an ECB policy meeting on Thursday. The STOXX 600 benchmark fell 0.5% but was not far from last month's lifetime peak.
Data on Friday showed the U.S. economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months as hiring in the leisure and hospitality sectors stalled, reducing expectations that the Fed will opt for an early tapering of its monthly bond purchases.
The market took the surprisingly soft U.S. payrolls report on Friday ""in stride, with the assumption that the COVID-19 Delta variant had an impact on economic activity in August,"" Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at brokerage National Holdings in New York, said in a market note.
Speeches by a number of U.S. policymakers later this week will be closely watched for any indication about how the weak jobs report has impacted the Fed's plans on tapering its bond purchases and keeping its expansive policy for the near-term. 
The recent equity rally started after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium in August.
""Given that before Jackson Hole many FOMC members had come out in favor of tapering on a tight timetable, we'll see if they confirm, or align with Powell's more moderate message,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia. 
U.S. government bond yields rose on Tuesday, continuing the climb seen on Friday in the wake of the jobs report and ahead of a fairly busy week of Treasury auctions. [US/]
Japanese shares rallied further on hopes the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will offer additional economic stimulus and easily win an upcoming general election after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would quit. 
Tokyo's Nikkei crossed the 30,000 mark for the first time since April, also helped by an announcement on its reshuffle, and the broader Topix index climbed 1.1% to a 31-year high.
Anthilia's Sersale said investors had a defensive positioning on Japanese stocks that led to a short squeeze.
""I was positive on Tokyo (stocks) and remain so, but perhaps at this point it is better to look for a less overbought entry point,"" he said.
Mainland Chinese shares extended gains, with the Shanghai Composite rising 1.5% to its highest level since February, helped by Chinese trade data showing both exports and imports grew much more quickly than expected in August.
A rout in bonds and shares of China Evergrande Group deepened on Tuesday after new credit downgrades on the country's No. 2 developer.
The euro retreated 0.24%, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 0.46%.
The ECB is seen debating a cut in stimulus, with analysts expecting purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to fall, possibly as low as 60 billion euros a month from the current 80 billion euros.
Germany's 10-year yield hit its highest level since mid-July. 
The Australian dollar briefly rose after the central bank went ahead with its planned tapering of bond purchases, but quickly gave up those gains after the bank reiterated its need to see sustainably higher inflation to raise interest rates. 
The Aussie was down 0.7%, off its 1-1/2-month high set on Friday. 
The U.S. dollar rose 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies, pressuring gold prices. Spot bullion prices were down 1.6% by 4:10 p.m. EDT (2010 GMT). U.S. gold futures settled 1.9% lower at $1,798.5 an ounce. [GOL/]
Elsewhere in commodities, oil prices slid on concerns over weak demand in the United States and Asia. Saudi Arabia's sharp cuts to crude contract prices for Asia had earlier revived demand concerns. [O/R]

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people marched in El Salvador's capital on Tuesday to protest the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, amid a bumpy initial rollout of systems to support the digital currency.
The protesters burned a tire and set off fireworks in front of the Supreme Court building around noon local time, as the government deployed heavily militarized police to the site of the protest. 
""This is a currency that's not going to work for pupusa vendors, bus drivers or shopkeepers,"" said a San Salvador resident who opposed the adoption of the cryptocurrency. Pupusas are a traditional Salvadoran corn-based food.
""This is a currency that's ideal for big investors who want to speculate with their economic resources.""
The protest came as El Salvador's government was rushing to iron out technological snags https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/el-salvador-leads-world-into-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-09-07 in bitcoin's first-day rollout.
Earlier on Tuesday, Salvadorans trying to download the Chivo digital wallet found it was unavailable on popular app stores. Then Bukele tweeted that the government had temporarily unplugged it, in order to connect more servers to deal with demand. 
A group of people in Chivo tee-shirts at a stall to train people interested in using the app milled around waiting for it to be reconnected.
It later appeared on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei's stores, and Bukele used Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to ask users to let him know how it was working. 
Polls indicate many Salvadorans are wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency, which can shed hundreds of dollars in value in a day. That view is shared by many economists worried at how it will affect economic stability. 

However, others have embraced it as a way ordinary people in a poor country can invest in financial markets. 
Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive the price of the currency above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, however, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 8.84% at $47,327.32. [L8N2Q927A]

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks were mixed on Tuesday with less than an hour of trading to go after the extended holiday weekend, with tech stocks gaining against a fall in the broader market.
Industrials and real estate sectors fell on worries about a slow down in the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve is set to meet later this month but could postpone a decision on tapering its bond purchases until later in the year given the recent lackluster economic data.
Disappointing jobs data last week raised concerns that the economic recovery was slowing down. Still, stocks have hit record highs in recent weeks after soothing commentary from the Fed. 
Monetary stimulus -- in the form of low interest rates and bond buying -- have been balanced against rising Delta coronavirus infections and their potential to halt the economic recovery.
In company news,  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) dropped on Tuesday after Ireland's Ryanair said it had ended talks over the purchase of 737 MAX 10 jets worth tens of billions of dollars.
And in crypto-land, Bitcoin tumbled nearly 11% on Tuesday, and a number of other digital currencies also fell. El Salvador announced it would be the first sovereign country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, which means its citizens can use it to buy everything from groceries to homes.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. King of the memes
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), everyone’s favorite meme stock, will release its second-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday. The video games retailer is expected to announce a loss per share of 66 cents on revenue of $1.12 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Pandemic darling
 Lululemon Athletica  Inc (NASDAQ:LULU), which benefited from the at-home comfort trend during last year’s Covid lockdowns, is seen posting revenue of $1.33 billion and earnings per share of $1.18 for the second quarter this year. Analysts will be listening for the company’s outlook given the shift back to office life, gradual though it may be at the moment.
3. JOLTs data
Employers are likely to have posted 10 million jobs in July compared to 10.073 million job openings in June. The Labor Department will release its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -Chinese dissident and artist Ai Weiwei has said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) told him it was closing his foundation's bank account in Switzerland earlier this year citing his ""criminal record"" in China, despite the activist never being convicted of a crime. 
One of China's most high-profile artists and political activists, Ai, who now lives in Portugal, wrote in an opinion piece for website Artnet how he was first told by the Swiss bank that it would close the account in the spring of this year. 
""Credit Suisse initially informed me that they had a new policy to terminate all bank accounts which are related to people with criminal records,"" Ai told Reuters in an emailed statement, adding the foundation had been asked at the time to move the funds before September. 
The bank declined to comment. 
Ai helped design the 2008 Beijing Olympics' famed Bird's Nest stadium before falling foul of the communist government, which detained him for 81 days in 2011. He said he has never been formally charged or convicted of a crime.
Ai said Credit Suisse then called him on June 24 to say the bank would like to close the account, which belonged to a free speech and arts foundation he started in 2016, ""as soon as possible"". He said managers then referred to an interview he had done with a Swiss newspaper several days before, in which he criticised Swiss people for voting in favour of tighter ""anti-immigrant policies"" as a reason for the closure. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment on any of his allegations, saying it does not discuss ""potential or existing client relationships"".
Ai told Reuters the account was currently in the process of being closed and could only be used in a very limited manner, but funds still needed to be moved out of it.
CHINA STRATEGY 
Many major Western banks, including Credit Suisse, have made winning business from China's ever-growing ranks for the ultra-wealthy a central part of their strategies. However, this has thrown up geopolitical issues for several of them when trying to stay in favour with Beijing.
Last year Reuters reported that global wealth managers, including Credit Suisse, were examining whether their clients in Hong Kong had ties to the city's pro-democracy movement, in an attempt to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of China's new national security law.
Like other wealth managers, Credit Suisse has made its sponsorship of the arts a selling point with its collecting-savvy clientele, acting as a patron to numerous museums in Switzerland and internationally, while also building up its own collection of more than 8,000 artworks focussed particularly on emerging artists.

Ai said he had previously faced similar actions from a bank in Germany and another in Hong Kong, but in neither instance had an explanation been given.
""You know, these banks are very arrogant,"" Ai said, adding he did not believe Credit Suisse would reverse its decision. ""Even if they do reverse this decision, I am not willing to be associated with a bank which has such a strange relationship with China.""

Rising investor optimism about the industry’s growth prospects has caused quality big-box stocks Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (COST), and BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ) trade near their all-time highs. These three stocks also currently have an overall B (Buy) rating in our POWR Ratings system. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Retail sales declined over the past few months as the resurgence of the COVID-19 cases again restricted people from the outdoor activities that they only recently resumed after a long period. According to Trading Economics data, U.S. retail sales fell 1.1% in July 2021, versus a consensus estimate of a 0.3% decline.
However, the big-box retail industry is expected to grow in the near term as more people get vaccinated, and the foot traffic in stores again picks up. Gus Faucher, the chief U.S. economist at PNC, said last month, “Although retail sales fell in July, the outlook for consumer spending remains positive.” Furthermore, according to a Forrester report, despite online growth, stores will still account for three-fourths of retail sales in 2024.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 02:12PM ET</span>","Airbus maintains lead over Boeing in deliveries, lags on orders","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus delivered 40 jets in August to bring supplies of its new jets to 384 since the start of the year, remaining broadly on course to meet an annual goal of 600 deliveries that would preserve its crown as no.1 aircraft manufacturer.
The European planemaker also sold 269 planes in the first eight months of the year, or 132 after cancellations, company data showed on Tuesday.
Fresh sales included 28 narrowbody jets to Latam Airlines, though South America's largest carrier simultaneously cancelled an order for two A350-1000 wide-body jets.
On deliveries, which drive most aerospace revenues, Airbus remains well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co which is gradually clearing a backlog of undelivered jets following the almost two-year safety grounding of its 737 MAX https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/exclusive-boeing-faces-new-hurdle-737-max-electrical-grounding-issue-sources-2021-05-05.
However, after a lull caused by the MAX crisis and then the industry-wide impact of COVID-19, Boeing remains ahead in the number of new orders as U.S. carriers renew their fleets.
As of the end of July, Boeing had sold 630 planes or 270 after adjusting for actual and possible cancellations. Orders included more than 524 Boeing 737 MAX by the end of July, compared to Airbus's Jan-August tally of 234 A320-family jets.
Boeing nonetheless took a knock from one of its largest customers on Monday when Ryanair said it had halted talks https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ryanair-ends-talks-with-boeing-737-max-10-order-2021-09-06 to buy up to 250 of the largest variant, the 737 MAX 10, because of a difference with Boeing over prices.
On Tuesday, Boeing shares fell over 2%.
While the coronavirus pandemic has upended many assumptions about the travel industry, analysts cautioned a shock defection by Ryanair to Airbus faces numerous obstacles. 
The European firm already has a long waiting list for its competing A321neo and it claims to be commanding higher prices, meaning a price war over Ryanair could upset existing customers.
Airbus dominates the large single-aisle segment at the centre of the Ryanair-Boeing standoff, while the U.S. planemaker has been leading contests against the smaller A320.
After the unusual public spat, Ryanair and Boeing are widely expected to wait each other out before seeing in which direction COVID pushes the battered aviation market this winter, with most market sources predicting a compromise deal next year.

But in a reminder of the unusual row involving its rival, Airbus data issued on Tuesday confirmed the sale of 36 A321neo jets to Boeing customer Jet2 - a move that much larger Ryanair has held up as evidence that Boeing needs to cut prices further.
Boeing responded on Monday that it would maintain a disciplined approach in airplane negotiations.

If a stock is cheap, or undervalued, then it means that the company’s revenues and profits are unlikely to explode higher… barring some sort of outside catalyst.

And because demand is expected to continue rising with the Senate’s passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, Wall Street analysts expect steel stocks Gerdau S.A (GGB) and  Schnitzer Steel  (SCHN) to gain more than 50% in price. Read on.
The fast-paced global macroeconomic recovery and resumption of industrial and manufacturing activities have revived the demand for steel worldwide. In addition, steel import tariffs in the United States and reduced steel production volume in China, which is the world’s largest steel manufacturer, have resulted in steel prices rising more than 200% since March 2020, as of July 9.
A recent, Senate-approved $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which allocates $110 billion for building roads and bridges, is expected (if passed into law) to drive steel demand in the United States over an extended period. Also, to make the U.S. steel industry more competitive, domestic steelmakers have asked President Biden to remove the import tariffs.
Steel prices are expected to increase in the coming months, given the rising market demand and current supply bottlenecks. Thus, Wall Street analysts expect shares of steel manufacturers Gerdau S.A. (GGB) and Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) to rally by more than 50% in the near term.

While Datadog is a data observability service for cloud-scale applications, Unity is a video-game software development company founded in Denmark. Taylor Dart explains why these stocks are a buy.It's been an incredible year thus far for the Nasdaq Composite (COMPQ), with the index up more than 16% year-to-date and many tech stocks up as much as 50%. This relentless rally has made it difficult to find growth at a reasonable price and also challenging to find names that aren't extended from recent breakouts. However, while most names are un-investable at current levels, this is an opportune time to begin building shopping lists. This is because it's quite possible we could see a correction before year-end to wring out some of the excess bullish sentiment, and it's always better to be prepared ahead of time. In this update, we'll look at two attractive tech names with industry-leading growth rates and ideal buy points if we do get a sharp correction:
(Source: TC2000.com)
Unity Software (U) and Datadog (DDOG) are both in the Software industry group, and both have posted strong quarter-to-date performance, easily outperforming their tech peers. While Datadog is a data observability service for cloud-scale applications, Unity is a video-game software development company founded in Denmark. With revenue growth rates of 67% year-over-year and 48% year-over-year, respectively, both companies are seeing exceptional growth and are in the sweet spot from an institutional investment standpoint. This is because Datadog just turned profitable last year with positive annual earnings per share [EPS], and Unity will flip to positive EPS in early 2023. From an investment standpoint, the move to profitability should lead to continued institutional accumulation, given that some growth funds wait for stocks to post positive earnings growth before building positions. This is evidenced by recent fund flows, with funds holding Unity up more than 50% from Q1 to Q2, and Datadog ownership up sharply as well (997 funds vs. 964 funds). Let's take a closer look at both companies below:

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 0.5% after the company revealed plans to invest up to 80 billion euro ($94.77 billion) to boost its chip manufacturing capacity in Europe.
The company will announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of the year, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, speaking at Munich's IAA (NYSE:IAA) auto show.
Possible production sites include Germany, France and Poland, where the chip giant has a presence. It also plans to establish committed foundry capacity at its fab in Ireland.
The company will also launch the Intel Foundry Services Accelerator to help automotive chip designers transition to advanced nodes.
Intel is currently building two chip manufacturing plants at Arizona in U.S., targeting $20 billion on the project.
The company is betting big time on demand from automakers to supply chips from the proposed plants in Europe.
Gelsinger predicts the “digitization of everything” will push the share of semiconductors in the total cost of a vehicle to 20% by 2030 – up five-fold from 4% in 2019.
The total addressable market for automotive silicon will more than double by the end of the decade to $115 billion – approximately 11% of the entire silicon market, according to estimates given by Intel.
The company’s manufacturing plans haven’t come a day soon as chipmakers struggle to meet burgeoning demand from automakers and makers of digital devices like mobiles, laptops and printers.
Work-from-home need for digital devices and rising demand from vehicle makers as automobiles get embedded with more technology has led to an unprecedented shortage of supplies and a surge in product prices.

Since 2013, Apple has delivered new iPhones around September like clockwork. The tech giant, which launched a redesigned iPhone with 5G connectivity last year, is not expected to make radical changes this year, with most analysts pointing to small technical updates to the phone's processor and camera system.
""Upgrades rates peaked in 2021 on 5G, we expect upgrade rates to moderate but still drive high volumes in 2022,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note, adding that he still expects a record year thanks to higher sales of the lower priced iPhone SE.
The new line of smartphones are expected to expand the Portrait mode feature to video and also have higher-quality video recording format, according to a Bloomberg report.
The Portrait mode uses the phone's depth sensor to focus on faces while blurring the background, allowing amateur photographers to produce high-quality snaps.
Apple was not immediately able to comment beyond the invitation sent to the media.
The mid-September launch results in a sales surge in the last week of Apple's fiscal fourth quarter as millions of avid shoppers snap up the newly releases iPhones.
Last year, however, the event got delayed by a month because of the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning opening-weekend iPhone sales were not included in fourth-quarter results.

The event also helps Wall Street analysts model their sales projections for the holiday shopping season in Western markets, typically Apple's largest sales quarter.
Known for its splashy phone launches packed with hundreds of journalists at its sprawling campus in Cupertino, California, Apple has turned to virtual events since last year because of the pandemic.

(Reuters) -Intel Corp on Tuesday said it could invest as much as 80 billion euros in Europe over the next decade to boost the region's chip capacity and will open up its semiconductor plant in Ireland for automakers.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger, speaking at Munich's IAA (NYSE:IAA) auto show, also said the company would announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of the year.
There is speculation about possible production sites, with Germany and France seen as leading contenders while Poland, where Intel also has a presence, also in the picture.
The CEO said the aim was for a ""total project of 80 billion euros ($94.77 billion) over the next decade that would be a catalyst for the semiconductor industry... a catalyst for the entire technology industry."" 
Intel, the biggest maker of processor chips for PCs and data centres, in March said it planned to open up its chip factories for outsiders to use. 
Gelsinger told Reuters in April https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-talks-produce-chips-automakers-within-six-nine-months-ceo-2021-04-12 that the company wanted to start producing chips for automakers within six to nine months to help alleviate a shortage that has disrupted vehicle production around the world.
It is unclear whether the latest announcement means Intel will meet that goal.
""Cars are becoming computers with tires. You need us and we need you... The aim is to create a centre of innovation in Europe, for Europe,"" Gelsinger said. 
The ""Intel Foundry Services Accelerator"" is aimed at helping automakers learn to make chips using what Intel calls its ""Intel 16"" chip manufacturing technology and later move to its ""Intel 3"" and ""Intel 18A"" technologies.
Those manufacturing processes would be far more advanced than most of the processes currently used in the automotive industry. Intel said that nearly 100 automakers and key suppliers - including BMW AG, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Bosch - had expressed support for its programmes. An Intel spokesman declined to confirm whether any had committed to becoming customers.
Gelsinger has been quoted saying Intel wants the EU to commit state aid to Intel's proposed European investment drive. 

Intel views automakers as a key strategic priority. Gelsinger said Tuesday that the company believes chips will make up 20% of the cost of vehicles by 2030, a five-fold increase from 4% of the cost in 2019.

Apple, like many other tech companies, is struggling with persuading its employees to return to office. It’s much-speculated plans to launch a smart electric car remain under wraps.
A report in The Wall Street Journal last week said the company is working on new health-related features for its smartwatch, including a tool to tell users when their blood pressure is increasing. The Apple Watch could also host a thermometer to help with fertility planning, the report said.
Also last week, Arizona and Georgia signed up to adopt driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet. Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah will follow the two states.

Investing.com -- U.S, stock markets started the holiday-shortened week on a subdued note, as a high-profile downgrade of U.S. growth forecasts weighed on sentiment amid a broad lack of any more concrete news.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 173 points, or 0.5% at 35,195 points, while the S&P 500 was down by 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up by 0.1%, as investors once again sought relative safety in longer-dated growth plays. 
Earlier. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its growth forecasts for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter to 5.5% from 6.5% earlier, a move that followed hard on the heels of its second downgrade to the outlook for the current quarter in as many weeks. Having originally expected the U.S. economy to expand at an annualized rate of 8.5% through the summer quarter, Goldman now sees growth of only 3.5%, thanks to the spread of Delta variant Covid-19 and the fading effect of fiscal stimulus. 
The downgrade came after August's labor market report showed a much bigger-than-expected hit to hiring from the latest wave of the pandemic. The U.S. economy created only 235,000 net nonfarm jobs through the middle of the month, less than a quarter of July's gains and well below the 750,000 expected. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 1.9% after a decision by Ryanair, the company's biggest customer outside the U.S., to end talks over a large order for the 737 MAX 10, its largest single-aisle model. 
However, there were still notable bright spots: AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock rose 6.6% to its highest in a month after news that Disney's new Marvel superhero movie, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, had taken in over $90 million on its debut weekend at the box office in North America. CEO Adam Aron said via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the company beat its own record for Labor Day weekend revenue as a result, adding that the figures topped comparable figures for 2019 for the first time. 
Other big gainers included Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) stock, which rose by 6.5% after S&P Dow Jones said it will include the dating site operator's stock in the S&P 500. That will force passive investors benchmarked to the index to include it in their portfolio.
Going in the other direction,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 0.4% after news of a third death in Japan among people who had received its Covid-19 vaccine from a contaminated batch. The stock also suffered a little from comments over the weekend by U.S. health supremo Anthony Fauci saying that it was lagging  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech in readying materials to support booster shots of its vaccine.  Rival vaccine maker  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 7.0%, meanwhile, after Japan sealed a deal for 150 million doses of its Covid-19 drug.
Elsewhere in the pharma world, Genmab ADRs (NASDAQ:GMAB) fell 2.2% and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock fell 1.9% after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts downgraded both to Equal Weight on valuation concerns after their recent rallies."

94,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 12:07PM ET</span>","European stocks slip from recent highs, telecom deals in focus","By Sruthi Shankar and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European stocks ended lower on Tuesday as caution kicked in ahead of a European Central Bank meeting later this week, while focus turned to a flurry of telecom deals led by Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY). 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.5% after coming close to a record high in the previous session. Utilities, healthcare and chemical stocks were among the top decliners.
Spurring moves in telecoms, Deutsche Telekom struck a share-swap deal with SoftBank Group to increase its stake in U.S. unit T-Mobile. The stock fell slightly.
The company and Swedish telecoms operator Tele2 also agreed to sell their Dutch unit to private equity groups for an enterprise value of 5.1 billion euros ($6.05 billion).
Dutch peer KPN rose 4.1%, leading gains on the STOXX 600, while UK's BT fell 0.1% on news Deutsche Telekom is weighing options for its 12% stake in BT.
The wider telecoms index rose 0.1%. 
Caution prevailed ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday, with a recent surge in euro zone inflation and improving economic data driving bets of tighter monetary policy.
""It's believed that the ECB is discussing tapering their PEPP purchases. If it is, then investors will look for signs that they are going to compensate by making purchases through other schemes,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.
""The reason they wouldn't want to get ahead of the Fed is because any hawkish remark by Lagarde or the ECB would cause even more strength in the euro, which would be negative for European growth.""
The benchmark STOXX 600 has gained almost 19% so far this year, slightly lagging New York's S&P 500, as relatively high rates of vaccination brightened the recovery outlook, with many people returning to offices following sweeping restrictions last year. 
Hopes of more economic stimulus for China and Japan, as well as growing views the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to delay the start of tapering its asset purchases pushed world stocks to record highs earlier.
British engineering firm  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) fell 12.1%, and was the worst performer on the STOXX 600 after aerospace parts maker TransDigm bowed out of a $8.7 billion takeover battle for the firm.

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) climbed more than 6% Tuesday as Takeda Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TAK) said the Japanese government will purchase 150 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine it will produce using the American company’s formula.
Japan's biggest drugmaker will make 250 million doses of the vaccine domestically and distribute it in early 2022, pending approval from regulators, according to a company statement today and previous announcements.
Novavax is licensing and transferring manufacturing technologies to enable Takeda to manufacture the vaccine, according to the statement.
Takeda is also distributing imported  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines in Japan. It plans to import 50 million doses of those shots.
Almost two weeks ago, the discovery of fragments of stainless steel some batches led to the suspension of as many as 2.6 million doses of Moderna’s 'messenger RNA'-based vaccine in Japan. So far, three people have died in Japan after taking Moderna doses though the actual cause of the deaths is yet to be ascertained. The vaccines were found to be from the suspended batches.
The world’s third largest economy is battling its worst wave of the pandemic.
After a slow start, 58% of the population has now received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",London takes aim at New York with five-year financial plan,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain needs to ease taxes on banks and make it easier to hire staff from abroad, its financial and professional services lobby said in a blueprint to help London unseat New York as the world's top international financial centre within five years.
The strategy paper on Tuesday from TheCityUK reiterated some ideas already aired in government-backed reports and elsewhere in recent months as the City of London looks to recoup ground lost following Britain's departure from the EU.
""By some metrics, the UK is losing ground: London is currently slipping further behind New York each year while other centres are strengthening,"" the paper said.
The U.S. financial capital overtook London in 2018 in a leading annual survey, it said, adding that New York dominated in stock market listings.
""The UK therefore needs to adopt a relentless focus on strengthening its international competitiveness to win back the prize of being the world's leading international financial centre,"" TheCityUK lobby group, which promotes the wider financial sector abroad, added in the paper.
Britain's departure from the European Union effectively closed London off from its biggest financial services customer, adding further pressure to catch up.
The finance ministry has already set out reforms to make London's capital market more competitive, and TheCityUK set a five-year target for London to ""out-compete its rivals"" by amending tax, visa and other rules.
Britain's financial services minister John Glen said competitiveness is core to all the government is doing and it shared TheCityUK's ambition to grow the financial market as freedom from the EU offered a clear opportunity.
""It won't be about deregulation and looking to a race to the bottom as perhaps some anticipated,"" Glen told a launch event for the paper, adding that people were looking for incremental rather than radical changes in capital markets.
""We can be more nimble,"" Glen said.
Becoming the global hub for financial data, sustainability investing and investment and risk management will also be crucial in helping Britain overtake New York, TheCityUK said.
The total tax rate for a London bank is 46.5%, 13% higher than a New York based bank, it added.
Glen said he recognises that taxing banks needs to be competitive alongside the United States and elsewhere.

The single most important issue for financial firms is being able to hire globally, TheCityUK CEO Miles Celic said.
""In conversations we have had with government, I think that is something that is absolutely understood,"" he told reporters.

And, since uranium prices are expected to continue moving higher in the near term, we think energy ETFs exposed to uranium stocks Global X Uranium ETF (URA) and North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM) should soar in price. Read on.The COVID-19-pandemic-induced halt in the construction of new plants, a series of mine closures in Canada, and declining secondary supplies have limited the growth of the uranium industry. However, according to GlobalData, global uranium production is expected to grow at a 6.2% CAGR to 65.2kt by 2025. Resumption of production at Cigar Lake Canada, which accounts for 12-13% of the global uranium output, and several other mines, should drive the growth.
Furthermore, last week the spot uranium price hit $35/lb for the first time in six years, when Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) started buying and storing physical uranium in expectation of a sustainable recovery. The optimism surrounding the industry’s recovery is based on a combination of current demand from the world's 445 currently operational nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 10% of global electricity, and the development of new reactors as demand for carbon-free electricity grows.
Given this backdrop, we think ETFs exposed to uranium stocks—Global X Uranium ETF (URA) and North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM)—could be solid bets now because they are well-positioned to witness significant upside.

The joint venture, which has capacity to make 328,000 vehicles a year, sold only 12,288 in the first seven months this year, all Jeep-branded sport-utility vehicles. 
It will transfer production from Guangzhou to Changsha to ""increase (the) utilisation rate of plants and lower cost"", GAC said in a statement. The Changsha factory has capacity to make 164,000 vehicles a year, still far more than the venture sells.
The joint venture was launched by GAC and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), which merged with PSA to become Stellantis.
A Stellantis spokesperson declined to comment.
As well as the GAC partnership, Stellantis operates a joint venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group, which sold 47,788 cars between January and July. 
It earlier closed two plants to tackle overcapacity. Both joint ventures are exporting China-made vehicles.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the firm was studying a new China strategy, which will be in place by the end of the year. It plans to introduce its Opel brand in China, offering fully electric vehicles. 
As competition heats up in China, where more than 25 million vehicles were sold last year, several joint ventures between international automakers and local partners cut operations due to declining sales. 

Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) ended its joint venture with FAW last month, and Hyundai Motor's tie-up with BAIC has sold one factory to electric vehicle maker Li Auto.
Last year, Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) shut its venture with Dongfeng less than five years after they started production. In 2018, Suzuki Motor exited its only Chinese joint venture with Changan.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is optimistic that there are sufficient funds, internal or external, to pull off its ambitious plan to build six large battery factories across Europe with partners by the end of the decade, its chief executive said.
""The required capital is available in the market. Northvolt has shown this,"" Herbert Diess said on the sidelines of the IAA (NYSE:IAA) Munich car show.
Swedish battery cell maker Northvolt, in which Volkswagen owns a 20% stake, raised $2.8 billion in June in one of the biggest private placements in Europe this year that was led by four Swedish pension fund and OMERS Capital Markets.
""Today, the returns that can be earned with battery production are high. It is a demand-driven market and stays a demand-driven market for the foreseeable future,"" Diess said.
Building new battery cell plants, which usually cost around 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) apiece, are a key requirement for Volkswagen's vision to become the world's leaders in electric vehicles (EV).
Volkswagen in March outlined its battery cell push, which it plans to pull off with partners, but has so far not specified exactly how much it will cost and what share the carmaker plans to fund on its own.
The six European factories will have joint production capacity of up to 240 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year, with the first 40 GWh coming from Northvolt from 2023.
The second plant will be built in the city of Salzgitter by 2025 in partnership with China's Gotion High-Tech, in which Volkswagen owns a 26% stake, with Spain and eastern Europe possible locations for a third and fourth plant.
Two more plants are to be built in subsequent years but Volkswagen has not specified where in Europe they will be located.

Diess in May said that parts of Volkswagen's battery activities could be separately listed in an initial public offering.

Ted Baker, which has 560 stores and concessions, pointed to a rebound in North American and UK shopping malls as consumer confidence picked up, helping retail sales - comprising in-store and online sales - jump 30% during the period. Online sales alone, however, dropped by 25% as consumers headed back to stores.
Overall sales, including wholesale and licensing as well, were up 50% from a year earlier when stay-at-home orders hammered demand for formal wear, forcing Ted Baker to cut hundreds of jobs and raise money to weather the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Retail sales during the second quarter, however, were still a third lower compared to pre-pandemic levels, the company said.
Ted Baker's shares, which surged more than 8% on Monday in anticipation of Tuesday's update, were flat in early trading on the London bourse. With a year-to-date rise of 45%, they look to end 2021 with an annual gain after five straight years of losses.
Aside from the pandemic, Ted Baker has been working on regaining investor trust under fresh management after former boss Ray Kelvin left in 2019 following misconduct allegations. He has denied the allegations and still owns nearly 12% of the company he founded in 1988 in Glasgow, Scotland. 
Ted Baker is now valued at 319 million pounds ($441.56 million) compared to 1.3 billion pounds in 2015. 
Current CEO Rachel Osborne, a former Debenhams executive, has been overseeing a three-year turnaround plan focussed on cutting costs, revamping the company's product range, and increasing its digital presence.
""We have made encouraging progress, with trading over the second quarter in line with expectations, albeit the speed of recovery is different across store locations and regions,"" Osborne said in the company's statement.

Ted Baker said certain technical aspects have taken longer than expected to resolve, adding its new eCommerce platform will now go live early next year given the current proximity to the key Christmas and end of year holiday season.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Federer-backed shoemaker On aims for over $6 billion valuation in U.S. IPO,"(Reuters) - On Holding AG, a shoemaker backed by Swiss tennis star Roger Federer, is eyeing a valuation of more than $6 billion in a U.S. initial public offering (IPO), a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1858985/000119312521265974/d175570df1a.htm showed on Tuesday.
The IPO comes at a time when athletic gear, especially shoes, has been flying off the shelves at most retailers as COVID-induced gym closures push more people to take up running to keep themselves fit. 
On was founded in 2010 by running enthusiasts Olivier Bernhard, David Allemann and Caspar Coppetti, with Federer investing an undisclosed sum in the company in 2019.
The 20-times Grand Slam winner teamed up with the company earlier this year to develop the Roger Pro tennis shoe.
On also makes a 100% recyclable brand of running shoes, called Cyclon, made from castor beans. The shoes are available only on a subscription basis and have to be returned to the company for new ones once they wear out.
The company, which is aiming to raise $622 million in the IPO, counts North America as its largest market, accounting for nearly 49% of its total sales, followed closely by Europe. 
Reuters had reported https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/federer-backed-shoe-firm-running-targets-autumn-ipo-sources-2021-05-28 in April that the shoemaker was targeting a listing in autumn that could fetch it a valuation of between $4 billion and $6 billion.

On's existing shareholders are offering around 5.66 million shares in the IPO. The company will not get any proceeds from the sale of those shares.
Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and J.P. Morgan are among the underwriters for the offering. On plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ONON""

Ardan Livvey said in a statement to Reuters that Deutz's guidance on its second-quarter results ""lacks clarity and transparency over the short-term"" and accused management of ""kicking the ball down the road"" on margins.
The criticism comes after Deutz disclosed in May that Ardan Livvey had amassed a stake of nearly 4%. In its release, the investor described Deutz as a highly asymmetric investment opportunity, with its shares still trading at attractive levels.
""But the company’s management is failing to provide appropriate disclosure and transparency in its financial reporting guidance,"" it added, calling for detailed analysis on the profitability of each of its verticals, capital allocation decisions and its profitability in Asia.

Investing.com – Biomarin stock (NASDAQ:BMRN) fell 8% Tuesday as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a clinical hold on of its gene therapy study.
The study evaluated a gene therapy in adults with phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder caused due to a deficiency of the enzyme PAH.
The enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If the active enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability and seizures.
The FDA's clinical hold was based on interim safety findings from a pre-clinical study. The company is also pausing further enrollment of participants outside the U.S.
""More than 3,000 patients have been treated with gene therapy, and there are no reports of cancers emerging as a consequence,” the company said in a note, after cases of malignancy were found in a study on mice.
The company has only dosed humans in the Phearless phase 1/2 clinical study with lower doses, it said.  Due in part to the risk previously identified by historical rodent studies, it said the liver health of Phearless study participants is regularly monitored.

So, banking giants  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan (JPM) should benefit from the industry’s rebound. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.One of the leading financial services companies, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), provides diversified banking, investment, mortgage products and services, and consumer and commercial finance. It operates through four segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. In comparison, established financial services company JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) operates in four segments: Consumer & Community Banking; Corporate & Investment Bank; Commercial Banking; and Asset & Wealth Management.
Even though the near-zero interest-rate environment remains unchanged amid concerns over the pace of economic recovery, most banking stocks have rebounded this year, with rising financial transactions and capital market activities driving the non-interest component of their revenues. Furthermore, the Fed signaled two interest rate hikes as soon as late 2023. In addition, it recently indicated its willingness to reduce asset purchases before the end of the year, which should help banking companies expand their interest income. According to Globe Newswire, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to $22.5 trillion this year. Consequently, both WFC and JPM should benefit.
WFC’s shares have gained 17.2% in price over the past six months, while JPM’s shares have returned 4.3%. Also, WFC’s 80.1% gains over the past year are significantly higher than JPM’s 57.4% returns. Moreover, WFC is the clear winner with 51.5% gains versus JPM’s 31.5% over the past nine months.

These 3 Are Great Buys,"After a rotation into value stocks earlier this year, growth stocks have rebounded and are showing bullish momentum due to a strong economy and the transitory nature of inflation, which is why investors should consider growth stocks such as HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA), and Dillard's, Inc. (NYSE:DDS).Unless you're a very conservative investor, allocating at least a part of your portfolio to growth stocks is a smart idea. Growth stocks provide investors with the potential for solid gains. While many retreated late last year as we saw a rotation into value stocks, growth stocks have come roaring back.
Since March 8th, the SPDR S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) has gained over 28%, compared to an 18.4% gain for the S&P 500. As the second-quarter earnings season came to an end, one thing we learned is that many companies are rapidly accelerating their earnings or sales growth. Even as the Delta variant of COVID is wreaking havoc on some states, the economy continues to move along. 
The Fed's assertion that inflation is transitory also appears to be correct, which is great news for growth stocks. That's why investors should consider growth companies such as HCA Healthcare, Inc.

While retail traders’ bets against short sellers could potentially help the prices of such stocks to rally, they possess high investment risks. As such, popular Reddit stocks GameStop (GME), SoFi Technologies (SOFI), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), and Tattooed Chef (TTCF) could witness a downtrend in the near term. So, we think they are best avoided now. Read on.With more than 10 million users, subreddit r/wallstreetbets (WSB) has propelled several fundamentally weak stocks to impressive price gains this year. The WSB community has successfully squeezed short sellers out of their positions and gained significantly from this earlier this year. However, the fundamental weaknesses in most of the Reddit plays have caused their rallies to be short-lived, and the stocks have declined quickly after hitting their price highs.
Though the market has been witnessing a relentless rally despite the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, experts believe the stock market is currently raising red flags similar to the dotcom bubble, which saw stocks soar in price despite their poor fundamentals. Consequently, we think investors should remain cautious and shift their strategies to survive a potential pullback in the near term.
Therefore, we think fundamentally weak stocks  GameStop Corp . (NYSE:GME), SoFi Technologies Inc. (SOFI), Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), and Tattooed Chef Inc. (TTCF), which are favorites of investors on the Reddit forum, are best avoided now.

The 49-year-old man received his second dose of the vaccine on 11 August. It came from one of the three batches since identified as contaminated.  
Japan’s health ministry said it was yet to establish if the fatality was linked to the vaccine. Last week, Moderna said “The rare presence of stainless steel particles in the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine does not pose an undue risk to patient safety and it does not adversely affect the benefit/risk profile of the product."" Moderna made the joint statement with local distributor Takeda Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TAK).
Almost two weeks ago, the discovery of fragments of stainless steel in the batches led to the suspension of as many as 2.6 million doses of the company's 'messenger RNA'-based vaccine in Japan. The world’s third largest economy is battling its worst wave of the pandemic.
Two men in their 30s with no known health conditions died last month within days of their second dose of the Moderna vaccine. In the case of the latest death, the person was known to be allergic to buckwheat, the health ministry said Monday.

However, given investor concerns related to the company’s Form 10-K filing delinquency and the potential for the company to face NYSE delisting procedures, is it worth betting on the stock at the current price level? Let’s find out.Independent oil and natural gas company Camber Energy, Inc.

CEI holds interests in active oil & gas properties in the onshore Gulf Coast region.

BERLIN/TOKYO (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) has struck a $7 billion share-swap deal with SoftBank Group to increase its stake in U.S. unit T-Mobile and sold its Dutch unit in a major shake-up that strengthens the German group's transatlantic focus.
As a result of the two deals announced on Tuesday, Deutsche Telekom will raise its stake in T-Mobile U.S. by 5.3% to 48.4%, bringing CEO Tim Hoettges closer to his goal of securing direct control over the $170 billion U.S. telecoms operator.
SoftBank will in return receive cash and a 4.5% stake in Deutsche Telekom, establishing a direct shareholding relationship after the Japanese group sold its U.S. Sprint unit to T-Mobile in a deal that closed in early 2020.
The latest transactions seek to lock down that deal by bringing Deutsche Telekom within touching distance of majority ownership over T-Mobile U.S. - which accounts for three-fifths of group sales and is its most profitable unit.
""This is a very attractive transaction for Deutsche Telekom and its shareholders to further benefit from the value creation potential in T-Mobile U.S. and beyond,"" Hoettges said. 
As part of the complex transaction, Deutsche Telekom will trigger option agreements, enabling it to lock in an average price of $109 per share for the 65 million T-Mobile shares it is acquiring, below last week's closing price of $136.
Deutsche Telekom had options to lift its stake in T-Mobile U.S. above 50%, Hoettges told a briefing, either by exercising further options or sitting out the $60 billion in share buybacks that the U.S. company plans in the coming years.
Potential proceeds from a deal to sell its telecoms infrastructure unit, which is worth 15-20 billion euros $17.8-$23.7 billion), could also be deployed in pursuit of that goal as early as 2022, said one person close to the matter.
For SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, the share swap deal substitutes a residual stake in the U.S. business for a strategic holding in Deutsche Telekom, which is also present in a dozen European countries.
""I'm a big believer that Deutsche Telekom stock has material upside,"" said SoftBank's chief operating officer, Marcel Claure, highlighting potential collaboration in areas such as digital payments, where SoftBank has broad exposure.
SoftBank has agreed not to sell its Deutsche Telekom shares before the end of 2024.
Shares in SoftBank, the world's biggest tech investor through its Vision Fund portfolio, rallied 10% on the news in Tokyo, while Deutsche Telekom erased initial gains to trade little changed.
DUTCH EXIT
Separately, Deutsche Telekom sold its Dutch unit T-Mobile Netherlands to a consortium of private equity houses Warburg Pincus and Apax for 5.1 billion euros ($6.1 billion).
Warburg Pincus' lead executive on the deal, Rene Obermann, a former Deutsche Telekom CEO, said he would support the unit's expansion of ultra-fast wireless internet by investing in people and next generation networks.
""The wireless revolution has only just begun,"" he said. 
Deutsche Telekom acquired control of the Dutch business from Sweden's Tele2 in 2018 but never considered the unit, which ranked a distant third behind KPN and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Ziggo, as a core asset.
It will invest some of its 3.8 billion euros in proceeds from the Dutch deal to raise its stake in T-Mobile U.S. Tele2, which had retained a 25% stake in T-Mobile Netherlands, also sold out.
Following the Sprint deal, Deutsche Telekom had under a shareholder agreement held the right to cast votes on SoftBank's residual stake in T-Mobile U.S. It also struck option deals with SoftBank locking in the right to raise its stake in T-Mobile U.S.
Still, with Deutsche Telekom carrying a debt load of nearly 130 billion euros, the extent of its existing leverage meant it was always going to be hard to pay cash to gain majority control over T-Mobile U.S.
Under the share swap deal, Deutsche Telekom will issue 225 million new shares valued at 20 euros - 12% above their current market price - to SoftBank.
In return, SoftBank will sell around 45 million T-Mobile U.S. shares to Deutsche Telekom at an average price of $118 per share. Deutsche Telekom will buy a further 20 million shares in T-Mobile U.S. from SoftBank with $2.4 billion of the proceeds from the Dutch sale.
The average purchase price over the entire transaction, reflecting the premium on the share swap and the reinvestment of proceeds, works out at $109 per share, Deutsche Telekom said.
The sale of T-Mobile Netherlands followed a deal to sell Deutsche Telekom's Dutch telecom towers assets to Spanish infrastructure specialist Cellnex.
A similar deal for its main towers unit Deutsche Funkturm is one likely route to raising fresh funds, while a stake sale to an infrastructure investor or an initial public offering are further options, the person close to the matter said. 

Hoettges reiterated Deutsche Telekom's medium-term guidance, updated at a recent capital markets day, that adjusted earnings per share would reach 1.75 euros in 2024 compared to 1.20 euros last year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Deutsche Telekom on the deal.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",China's 'quant' traders fend off regulatory flak,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese hedge fund managers parried criticism of their trading techniques and market impact on Tuesday, a day after the country's top securities regulator said the rapidly growing number of ""quants"" was a challenge to stock exchanges.
Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said on Monday bourses should be paying attention to a surge in quantitative trading on the mainland. Quants, as traders and funds that engage in such trading are known, employ fast computers that use mathematical and statistical analyses to trade.
In mature markets, such quantitative and high-frequency trading had led to better liquidity, but also spawned herd behaviours, greater volatility and unfairness, Yi said.
Fund managers were quick to deflect that criticism, which comes at a time of heightened market concerns as China launches a series of regulations against sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. 
Yi's remarks also come as analysts debate the role of China's 'flash boys' -- the data-driven, fast-paced hedge fund traders -- in a thriving stock market.
""You cannot just blame quants, without blaming long-only funds"" for causing market problems, said Yuan Yuwei, a hedge fund manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management.
""Actually, long-only funds do more harm to markets"" in China, where short selling of shares is restricted, he said.
Xueming Zhang, head of Antifragile Investment at China iFund Asset Management Co Ltd, distanced his company from the type of funds potentially being targeted by regulators.
""Our quantitative strategy is different from the mainstream these days, which is high-frequency trading,"" Zhang said.
""It's understandable that regulators don't want to see barbaric growth of the sector triggering excessive volatility."" 
China's quantitative private funds totalled nearly 1 trillion yuan ($154.6 billion) at the end of June, according to Citic Securities. That's almost ten times their size in 2017. 
The chief executive of a major high-frequency hedge fund in China said the asset manager had been in constant contact with regulators, who are studying the business. 
""High-frequency trading under China's stock trading mechanism is different from that in U.S. and European markets,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the topic. Under China's system, stocks cannot be sold on the same day of purchase. 
""But it's a trend for regulators to set up an effective management framework, which we support.""
The spotlight on 'flash boys' coincides with an explosion in China's stock trading volumes. Daily turnover has exceeded 1 trillion yuan for over 30 consecutive sessions. 
Estimates of how much quant funds contribute to this turnover vary. Citic Securities puts the figure between 10%-15%, while Guosen Securities estimates it's over 20%. 
Some of the biggest players include High-Flyer Quant, Ubiquant Investment and Shanghai Minghong Investment Management Co. The market has also attracted global hedge fund houses such as Winton Group and Man Group, as China presses on with opening its capital markets.

Instead of imposing tighter regulations on hedge funds, China should improve its shorting mechanism and allow intraday trading of stocks, said Yuan of Water Wisdom. 
""It's time to reform the trading mechanism of A-shares,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian car-sharing company Delimobil and real estate database Cian are hoping to raise around $350 million each in U.S.-based initial public offerings this autumn, financial market sources said on Tuesday, leading the Russian IPO charge in New York. 
Russia is experiencing an IPO boom after several barren years following the imposition of sanctions against Moscow after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. UBS earlier predicted a Russian IPO flurry of at least $10 billion this year. 
Three sources told Reuters Delimobil was targeting an offering this autumn, with two of them saying the company was eyeing a $350 million listing on the New York Stock Exchange and a dual listing in Moscow. Delimobil has previously said it was looking at New York for the offering.
Delimobil, one of Russia's biggest car-sharing providers along with  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX).Drive and others, declined to comment. 
Three sources said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citi were among the banks picked to arrange the offering. Two sources said UBS, as well as Russia's Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital and Renaissance Capital were the other banks selected.
Bank of America, Citi, VTB Capital and Renaissance Capital declined to comment. UBS and Sberbank CIB did not immediately respond to requests. 
VTB in July said it had purchased a 13.4% stake in Delimobil. In June, Delimobil said VTB's minority stake was worth $75 million.
Delimobil, which operates a total fleet of more than 16,000 vehicles in Russia, first announced IPO plans in 2019, saying it would float a 40% stake. The sources did not say whether the $350-million target for this autumn corresponded to 40% of the business.
Cian, one of the country's largest real estate databases, is very close to holding a U.S. IPO, three financial market sources said on Tuesday, with two suggesting Nasdaq would be the likely exchange.
Cian's offering could be in the region of $300-400 million, two sources said. The company has hired banks to arrange the deal, sources said last month.

Other firms targeting imminent U.S. listings include food retailer Vkusvill and the Saint Petersburg Exchange, four sources told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, reported on Tuesday that Vkusvill could be valued between $3-5 billion and the exchange at $2 billion. 
Three banking sources on Tuesday said agriculture company Prodimeks was considering an IPO, with one saying the firm was hoping to raise between $500-$750 million. Prodimeks had no immediate comment.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A first insurance claim has been filed and more are being prepared in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s efforts to recover funds from its insolvent supply chain finance linked to Greensill, the Swiss bank said on Tuesday.
The collapse of Credit Suisse's $10 billion worth of supply chain finance funds in March kicked off a tumultuous period for the bank, which together with a multi-billion dollar loss related to family office Archegos prompted a raft of executive oustings.
""A first insurance claim has been filed and (Credit Suisse Asset Management) is currently preparing to file additional claims through Greensill Bank and with the assistance of Greensill Capital UK,"" the bank said in a document on its website. A spokesperson said no further information could be provided regarding the insurance claims at this time.
Credit Suisse has been working with advisors and external experts to help recoup the funds, some $7.0 billion, or 70%, of which have now been recovered, the bank said on Tuesday, up from $6.1 billion in early July.
Around $5.9 billion of that has been returned to investors so far after the last payment in August.
Even so, the pool of late payments had grown during the period, with the bank saying roughly 85% of the outstanding notes related to payment that had not been made on time. 
As of end-August, the funds had accumulated some $2.5 billion in late payments, Credit Suisse said, $2.2 billion of which were related to three single counterparties, the biggest of them steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, which are experiencing repayment issues.
The bank expects the funds to accrue around $145 million this year in recovery costs, it said on Tuesday, as it focuses on some $2.3 billion in loans provided by Greensill to the three counterparties, GFG, Katerra and Bluestone.

It said talks were ongoing regarding the refinancing and restructuring of GFG's assets in the United States and Britain, while discussions with West Virginia governor Jim Justice's coal company Bluestone Resources were unlikely to yield any payments or agreements before the fourth quarter.
Tokio Marine's Australian unit has provided insurance to speciality finance firm Greensill, but the Japanese group has said it is investigating the validity of those policies and, as of May, expected no material impact on its earnings from the matter.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said on Tuesday it expected to spend more than $13.5 billion by 2030 to develop batteries and its battery supply system, in a bid to take a lead in the key automotive technology over the next decade.
The world's largest automaker by volume, which pioneered hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles with the popular Prius, is moving rapidly to deliver its first all-electric line-up next year. 
Considered a leader in developing batteries for electric vehicles, Toyota said it aimed to slash the cost of its batteries by 30% or more by working on the materials used and the way the cells are structured.
""Then, for the vehicle, we aim to improve power consumption, which is an indicator of the amount of electricity used per kilometer, by 30%, starting with the Toyota bZ4X,"" Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda told a briefing, referring to an upcoming compact SUV model.
The company is also the front runner to mass produce solid-state batteries - a potential game changer for automakers because they are more energy dense, charge faster and are less prone to catching fire. If developed successfully, they could replace liquid lithium-ion batteries.
While it was still struggling with the short service life of these cells, Maeda said there was no change in Toyota's target to begin manufacturing solid-state batteries by the mid 2020s.
""We are still searching for the best materials to use,"" he said.
Efforts to mass produce solid-state batteries have stumbled as they are expensive to manufacture and are prone to crack when they expand and contract during use. 
Toyota also planned to use solid-state batteries in hybrid electric vehicles such as the Prius, it said. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world's second-largest automaker, said on Tuesday it might have to spend more to deliver its planned transformation towards autonomous driving and EVs.
The German firm, which plans to invest 150 billion euros ($178 billion) in its business by 2025, has repeatedly said it could fund this transition based on current cash flows.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>","Major U.S. insurers jump on distribution platforms to gain customers, sales","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. insurers are joining new digital exchanges to sell not only their own policies but also those of rivals, a fresh twist in an industry known for fierce competition.
The powerful new platforms, including Semsee, bolttech, Bold Penguin and Uncharted, pull data from many carriers, allowing agents to see multiple quotes for policies, much the way travel agents see competing air fares.
Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd, Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) Inc and Liberty Mutual have signed on recently as have agencies that also sell policies, executives said. 
""The eyeballs are enormous and important to them,"" said Philip Charles-Pierre, New York-based co-founder and chief executive officer of Semsee, which focuses on commercial policies. Many insurers have recognized that ""if a large agency is using the platform, you need to be on that platform.""
The growth of digital distribution represents a shift in how insurers compete in markets for auto and homeowner coverage as well as business and commercial lines worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually, experts said.
Carriers also benefit from being able to meet more of a customer's needs, even if they are not selling their own policy.
""It's all about who owns the customer relationship,"" said Mark Breading, a partner at Strategy Meets Action, a management consulting firm in New York.
The industry has been moving away from ""captive"" agents who sell only one firm's policies, but digital exchanges are accelerating the trend, said Matt Leonard, an Oliver Wyman partner who works on insurance.
""The whole process is now supercharged by technology and a broader marketplace of players,"" he said.
Partnerships with the exchanges have grown over the past five years. Despite digital revolutions in other industries, many insurance customers – especially small businesses – prefer to work with agents who can explain policies and find the best prices. As a result, the online tools insurers created on their own did not take off as expected.
The exchanges now allow agents to offer customers better prices and satisfy a wider range of needs without necessarily harming profits, executives and experts said.
""Chubb is actively engaged with a number of partners in this channel including bolttech and Bold Penguin,"" said Sean Ringsted, chief digital officer at Chubb. 
Rob Schimek, bolttech's CEO, offered an example: A company that writes policies for autos but not homes can use bolttech to offer homeowner coverage from other carriers. That keeps customers from shopping elsewhere. The auto-policy company earns a sales commission on the homeowners policy while the other insurer gets the premium revenue. 
""Carriers are dying for access to distribution,"" Schimek said. If insurers don't want to offer policies through the exchange, they will not have access to the customers of other insurers on the exchange, he said.
Bolttech, backed in part by Chinese billionaire Richard Li, recently closed on a $180 million funding round and expanded its reach to 26 countries from 14.

While exchanges bring more customers, they pose a threat by allowing smaller insurers with specialized policies to reach a large market, said Matteo Carbone, founder and director of IoT Insurance Observatory, a research group.
""This, for me, is the biggest risk"" to big insurers, he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, off recent highs after the disappointing August jobs report, with Boeing (NYSE:BA)in the spotlight after losing out on aircraft orders.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded basically unchanged, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 13 points, or 0.1%, in thin trading following Monday's public holiday.
Major indices retreated from record highs on Friday after nonfarm payrolls only increased by 235,000 in August, a sharp drop from over one million jobs gained the previous month. Although this has increased expectations the Federal Reserve will delay the start of its bond-buying tapering, it has also raised concerns about the strength and pace of the country’s economic recovery.
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has downgraded its forecast for growth in the U.S. economy this year, now seeing GDP expansion in 2021 of 5.7%, compared with 6% at the end of August. 
“The hurdle for strong consumption growth going forward appears much higher: the Delta variant is already weighing on Q3 growth, and fading fiscal stimulus and a slower service sector recovery will both be headwinds in the medium term,” said Goldman analysts, in a note Monday.
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock traded lower premarket after European budget airline Ryanair (LON:RYA), one of the U.S. aircraft manufacturer’s largest customers, ended negotiations about an order for 737 MAX jets due to differences over price.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) will also be in focus after the cinema chain benefited from positive reaction to the release of Marvel’s ‘Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings’ movie, which rang up an estimated $90 million on its debut weekend in North American cinemas, a record for a Labor Day weekend debut.
Crude prices sold off Tuesday, continuing Monday’s selloff after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top exporter, sharply cut its prices for Asian buyers over the weekend, suggesting slowing demand.
Earlier Tuesday Chinese trade data showed stronger than expected exports, but imports of crude were still running at more than 1 million barrels a day below February levels in August, despite rising 8% from July.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",U.S. workplaces look to college fights as return to work 'turning point' looms,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A legal battle is brewing over remote work between administrators at U.S. colleges committed to in-person classes and some faculty with disabilities. Experts warn it is a precursor of what awaits employers that order staff back to the office amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employment lawyers said higher education provides a key test of who can work remotely because it is a profession traditionally associated with in-person work.
But COVID-19 lockdowns proved what disabled teachers have argued for years -- that online teaching can be a successful way to accommodate them.
Working from home during the pandemic allowed teachers with conditions ranging from epilepsy to genetic diseases to eliminate the need for specialized transport, add periods of rest to their day and ensure easy access to medicines.
As the new academic year begins, many are finding themselves fighting with administrators and having remote work requests denied, an early indication of tension awaiting big companies including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) that have said they want workers to return to offices. 
Under the law, employers have to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prevents discrimination against anyone with a disability, defined as an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. 
Employees with a disability can request an accommodation, but the employee must still perform what the business decides are the essential job functions, which can change from lockdown to reopening. 
""The key question: Is presence in the workplace an essential function?"" said Jeffrey Nolan, an employment lawyer Holland & Knight, which represents businesses.
Alice Freifeld, a history professor, asked the University of Florida if she could teach remotely last year and was denied because the school said her chronic cough and allergies did not qualify as a disability. 
She planned to take advantage of the school's proposal for the academic year that just started to allow classes to be taught remotely for the first three weeks before going in person. But just as the school year was about to start, the online proposal was withdrawn and she was told she would have to come into school to teach.
""I felt powerless. I felt the only answer was to quit,"" she said. She retired after 27 years at the university.
The university said in an email that it does not comment on individual accommodation matters and that it reviews each request on a case-by-case basis.
Employment law specialists said fear of contracting COVID-19 is not likely to be considered a disability, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has encouraged remote work for those over 65.
""I have heard from dozens and dozens and dozens of disabled faculty members,"" said Lydia Brown, who advocates for disability rights nationally. ""And every person, who requested remote work accommodations because of a very real and legitimate fear of an increased risk of transmission and severe illness of COVID, have been denied.""
Brown and others said they hope the disputes in academia over remote work find their way to the courts and begin to reshape the law. Legal experts said it will take many months before courts hear the current remote work disputes.
Court rulings over the past 15 years on remote work often sided with employers without requiring much evidence that telecommuting was unreasonable, said Arlene Kanter, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law. She expects that to change, thanks to the pandemic.
""What I think we'll see now is courts will not just defer to the employer's judgment,"" she said. ""Employees should have the right to explain how they can perform their job remotely, and how they just did it if they were working remotely during COVID. That's why I think we're at a turning point."" 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates about 4% of the workforce is disabled while advocates said the actual number might be many times higher as people often do not disclose an impairment.
There is limited data on accommodation requests, but Ohio State University told Reuters that requests for disability-related remote work jumped 2.5 times to 510 in the year to June 30 from the prior fiscal year. 
Cornell University said on Aug. 11 that in-person instruction was essential for faculty and said it would not approve disability-related requests for remote work, touching off a wave of criticism.
The university clarified its policy days later to say it would allow some remote work where it best served faculty and students.

Many schools such as Widener University require vaccines for employees and students as the school returns to in-person teaching. The president said they have used flexible schedule arrangements to attract and retain staff.
""We’ve done everything we can to make this work for people,"" said Widener's President Julie Wollman. ""But at some point you have to say that’s not a legitimate reason.""

133,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: How will solid-state batteries make electric vehicles better?,"By Tim Kelly and Sayantani Ghosh
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Solid-state batteries could be game changer for electric vehicles (EVs) by storing more energy, charging faster and offering greater safety than liquid lithium-ion batteries, helping accelerate the shift away from fossil fuel-powered cars.
HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM LIQUID LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES?
Solid-state batteries use thin layers of solid electrolytes, which carry lithium ions between electrodes.
Lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries use liquid electrolytes and have separators that keep the positive electrode from coming in contact with the negative electrode.
Currently, solid-state batteries are used in devices such as pacemakers and smart watches.
Mass market production of these batteries for EVs is three to five years away, experts say.
WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF SOLID STATE BATTERIES?
They are likely to be safer and more stable than liquid li-ion batteries in which the electrolyte is volatile and flammable at high temperatures. This makes electric vehicles that use li-ion batteries more vulnerable to fires and chemical leaks. 
Increased stability means faster charging and reduces the need for bulky safety equipment.
They can hold more energy than liquid li-ion batteries, helping speed up a switch from gasoline vehicles to EVs because drivers would not need to stop as often to charge their cars.
WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO MASS PRODUCE SOLID STATE BATTERIES?
Carmakers and technology companies have produced solid-state li-ion battery cells one at a time in a lab, but have been unable so far to scale that up to a mass production. 
It is hard to design a solid electrolyte that is stable, chemically inert and still a good conductor of ions between the electrodes. They are expensive to fabricate and are prone to cracking because of the brittleness of the electrolytes when they expand and contract during use.
Currently, a solid-state cell costs about eight times more to make than a liquid li-ion battery, experts say.
WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE THEM?
Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp is one of the front runners to mass produce solid-state batteries. It has said it is struggling with their short service life but still intends to start making them by mid 2020s.
In addition to Toyota's in-house research, it has teamed up with Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp to develop these powerpacks with their Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc venture.
Close on their heels, Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has invested in Bill Gates-backed U.S. battery firm QuantumScape Corp, which aims to introduce its battery in 2024 for VW's EVs and eventually for other carmakers.
VW says the battery will offer about 30% more range than a liquid one and charge to 80% capacity in 12 minutes, which is less than half the time of the fastest charging li-ion cells now available.
Stellantis, formed in January by the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, has a venture called Automotive Cells Co with TotalEnergies and a partnership with China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL). Stellantis intends to introduce solid-state batteries by 2026.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and BMW AG have invested in startup Solid Power, which says its solid-state technology can deliver 50% more energy density than current lithium-ion batteries. Ford expects to cut battery costs by 40% by mid-decade.
South Korea's Hyundai Motor, which has invested in startup SolidEnergy Systems, plans to mass produce solid-state batteries in 2030.

Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, is working on developing solid-state batteries. 
EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has so far not said it wants to develop or use solid-state cells in its cars.

134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>","Evergrande Rout Worsens With Moody’s Cut, Goldman Sell Call","(Bloomberg) -- An investor exodus from China Evergrande Group deepened after its bond and stock ratings were cut further, pushing the developer’s shares down toward the 2009 initial public offering price. 
Evergrande’s Hong Kong-traded shares closed 7.8% lower at HK$3.57 on Tuesday, near the HK$3.5 apiece offered on debut. The stock has plummeted 76% this year, while many of its dollar bonds are hovering below 30 cents. 
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Evergrande’s credit rating by three notches to Ca, which implies it is “likely in or very near default.”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). cut the stock to sell from neutral, slashing its target price to HK$3 from HK$15.6. 
Evergrande has been repeatedly downgraded in recent months, reflecting the deepening crisis at the world’s most indebted developer as it scrambles to raise cash and keep creditors at bay. Two trust companies have demanded immediate repayment of some loans, people familiar with the matter said last week.
“Evergrande will have to rely on asset sales or investments from potential investors to generate funds for debt servicing,” Cedric Lai, a senior analyst at Moody’s, said in a statement. “But these fundraising activities entail high uncertainties.” 
With more than $300 billion of liabilities, Evergrande may roil lenders, suppliers, small businesses and millions of homebuyers should it collapse. Chinese authorities have kept quiet about their plans for the company so far, aside from urging it to resolve its debt risks. 
Heightened Default Risks
Evergrande’s liquidity and default risk is “heightened,” Moody’s said in its third downgrade of the developer since June. The real estate firm has insufficient cash on hand to cover short-term debt and borrowings maturing in the next 12 months, Moody’s said, adding that it’s unlikely to be able to raise enough new funds for refinancing given its deteriorated funding access. 
Evergrande itself last week warned of default risks if its efforts to raise cash fall short. Its cash coverage to short-term borrowings worsened in the first half to 36% from 47% from six months earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on an earnings statement. The company hasn’t sold a dollar bond since January last year.
While Evergrande’s bonds won’t face maturity or potential investor demand for early repayment this year, its liquidity pressure is likely to intensify starting next year, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Wang Yi wrote in their report. 
Clock Ticks for Evergrande as $7.4 Billion of Bonds Due 2022
Evergrande is resorting to heavy discounts to sell homes and raise cash. The company’s average selling price slid 11.5% in August from a month earlier to the lowest since July 2016, according to Bloomberg calculations. The strategy wasn’t enough to prevent contracted sales from falling 26% from a year earlier.

“We have a disciplined track record of not paying high prices for aircraft,” Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary said in a note.
The airline said that without the new MAX 10, it still has “more than sufficient order pipeline” to grow its fleet to more than 600 and cover its five-year expansion plan. This includes taking delivery of over 200 B737 aircraft through 2025.
Ryanair’s statement came as a surprise since airlines don’t usually publicly announce walking off talks over potential deals with vendors. It also surprised by naming other airlines, Delta and Jet2, who have recently called off talks with the American company.
“We do not share Boeing’s optimistic pricing outlook, although this may explain why in recent weeks other large Boeing customers such as Delta and Jet2, have been placing new orders with Airbus, rather than Boeing,” the Ryanair note said."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German regulators have launched an investigation into the country's biggest financial company, Allianz (DE:ALVG), after the demise of some of its U.S. investment funds last year, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The move heightens the pressure on the insurer, which is already facing a slew of investor lawsuits over its Structured Alpha Funds and related investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The German insurer is one of the world's biggest money managers with 2.4 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) in assets under management through bond giant Pimco and Allianz Global Investors, which managed the funds at the centre of the probes.
The investigation by Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, is across multiple departments of the institution, several sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the investigation is ongoing.
BaFin officials are examining the extent to which Allianz executives outside the fund division had knowledge of, or were involved in, events leading up to the funds racking up billions of dollars of losses, the people said.
An Allianz spokesperson on Tuesday said that the company was in regular contact with BaFin on all matters, including Structured Alpha. ""It is an absolutely normal process,"" the spokesperson said.
The sources said the German investigation was currently in a fact-finding phase and involved multiple people, but had picked up pace since Allianz announced the DOJ probe on Aug. 1.
The insurer said last month that it had reassessed the risks related to the funds after being approached by the DOJ and had concluded that the matter could materially hit its future financial results.
The various investigations and lawsuits revolve around Allianz Global Investor's Structured Alpha Funds, which catered to U.S. pension funds for workers such as teachers and subway employees. The funds were also marketed to European investors.
After the coronavirus pandemic sent markets into a tailspin, the funds plummeted, in some cases by 80% or more. 
The losses from bad bets on options were so extreme that Allianz closed two funds in March 2020 which were worth $2.3 billion at the end of 2019. Losses at others caused some investors to withdraw what was left of their money.

Investors have now lodged 25 lawsuits claiming $6 billion in damages, saying Allianz strayed from its strategy of providing downside protection for market crashes. Allianz's lawyers have said the investors were sophisticated and aware of the risks.

The employee, identified by his surname Wang, was detained by police last month after a female Alibaba employee posted an 11-page account https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/rocked-by-sexual-assault-allegation-alibaba-launches-investigation-suspends-2021-08-08 on Alibaba's intranet saying a manager and a client sexually assaulted her during a business trip to eastern China's Jinan city. 
She said superiors and human resources did not take her report seriously, triggering a fierce public backlash against the e-commerce giant, which later fired Wang and suspended other executives. 
Prosecutors, however, have approved the arrest of the client who has been identified by his surname Zhang.
Jinan police have accused both men of committing acts of forcible indecency but have not provided details of the acts. The female employee in her account said she was mostly unconscious during the incident and woke up with her clothes removed.
Reuters was unable to reach Wang or Zhang for comment. Alibaba said in response to the decision by prosecutors that it has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual misconduct. Jinan Hualian Supermarket, Zhang's former employer, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Chinese law says those using violence or coercion to act indecently against others can be sentenced to as much as five years in prison but does not define an indecent act.

Since first surfacing in August, the female Alibaba employee's allegations have triggered much online discussion about sexual harassment in China as well as the country's culture of heavy drinking during business meetings.
Alibaba dismissed 10 employees for sharing screen shots of the female colleague's account of sexual assault allegations, Bloomberg News reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter.

""We have a lot of optionality in the BT business. It's too early to make a decision. We are entertaining all options,"" Hoettges told a news briefing.

BT is at the centre of speculation after telecoms and cable company Altice acquired a 12.1% stake in June, saying at the time that it did not intend to launch a takeover offer. Deutsche Telekom holds the BT stake in its pension fund.
""I would say that in the next 12 months something is going to happen with the asset because the shareholder side is changing rapidly,"" Hoettges said in response to a question from an analyst.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) may have to spend more to deliver its planned transformation, the German carmaker's supervisory board chairman said, particularly a shift towards autonomous driving.
The world's second-largest automaker, which plans to invest 150 billion euros ($178 billion) in its business by 2025, has repeatedly said that it can fund the transition towards electric vehicles and autonomous driving based on current cash flows.
""We are in a phase where substantial free cash flows are being generated. That means we can pay out good dividends as well as comfortably fund our business going forward,"" Hans Dieter Poetsch told Reuters at the IAA (NYSE:IAA) Munich car show.
""But of course we are in an environment in which we cannot rule out that larger sums, for example in the field of autonomous driving, have to be invested,"" Poetsch, who is also chief executive of Porsche SE, which is Volkswagen's largest shareholder.
""It is therefore recommendable to think one or two steps ahead,"" Poetsch added, without specifying details.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said on Tuesday it expects to spend more than $13.5 billion by 2030 to develop batteries and a battery supply system as the world's largest automaker moves to deliver its first all-electric line-up next year.
Poetsch declined to comment on a potential initial public offering of luxury car division Porsche AG, which sources told Reuters in May is a scenario Volkswagen has contemplated should it require more money to pay for its strategy.
""From today's point of view our financial situation is relatively comfortable. And as part of our planning rounds, which we are holding each year, we are regularly reviewing where there is a need,"" Poetsch said.
Analysts reckon that a partial IPO of Porsche, speculation over which has regularly lifted Volkswagen's stock, could value the unit at 45 billion euros to 90 billion, a major lever Volkswagen could pull to fill its coffers.

""The clever finance executive will always have a list with options for how to provide extended financial flexibility for the company,"" Poetsch added.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Television aggregator Roku Inc said on Monday it would launch its streaming players in Germany later this year, its second big European rollout, seeking to capitalize on a pandemic-driven shift towards watching more video on demand.
Roku will offer content from local partners Seven.One Entertainment Group, RTL Deutschland and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Sky Deutschland, as well as big names Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Prime and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+.
San Jose, California-based Roku started in 2008 by marketing streaming players before developing a proprietary operating system that, it says, offers a smooth and easy interface for choosing what to watch on TV.
In Germany, Roku would compete with rivals including the Amazon Fire TV stick and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecast. 
Building on its core U.S. franchise, Roku entered the UK market https://www.reuters.com/article/tech-ifa-roku-idCNL3N25Y038 two years ago as a software partner for smart TV maker Hisense, but is taking a different approach in Germany by going in first with its plug-in player. 
""There is a very big secular shift to streaming - that's a trend that was accelerated last year by the pandemic,"" Arthur van Rest, the executive leading Roku's international expansion, told Reuters in an interview.
Instead of passively consuming scheduled programming, viewers increasingly watch what they want, when they want to. ""TV and the way that it's being consumed are shifting dramatically - and we are right at the heart of that,"" he added.
Roku's focus on offering the best platform for viewing video on demand means, said van Rest, that it expects to displace existing smart TVs as the software installed by the manufacturer fails to keep pace.

At the same time, offering an attractive interface is interesting both for publishers and advertisers as they seek to tap in to a German market where nearly half of households already have one or more subscription video deals.
Details on pricing of its streaming players and its retail distribution partners will follow, Roku said. It sells its streaming player for 29.99 pounds ($41.48) in Britain, with users paying for subscription channels like Netflix on top.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In glass-paneled conference rooms, members of the Shanghai-based esports team Rogue Warriors tap away at their phones as they train from 11 a.m. till late, occasionally breaking for food.
""I spend 15 of 24 hours a day playing video games,"" says 19-year-old Zhang Kaifeng who plays Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's online battle arena game ""Arena of Valor"" professionally, adding that the long hours are necessary to remain competitive.
China is the world's biggest esports market with an estimated 5,000-plus teams, but the government's tough new rules https://www.reuters.com/world/china/why-how-china-is-drastically-limiting-online-gaming-under-18s-2021-08-31 aimed at curbing gaming addiction are set to make careers like Zhang's hard to emulate.
Provoking an outcry https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-shares-fall-more-than-2-after-china-tightens-rules-young-video-gamers-2021-08-31 from many Chinese teens, the changes task gaming companies with limiting online games for under 18s to just three hours a week. Even before the changes, minors were restricted to 1.5 hours on weekdays and three hours on weekends.
Top esports players are typically discovered in their teens and retire in their mid-20s, and experts compare the intensity of their training to that of Olympic gymnasts and divers. One of the world's most well-known players of Riot Games' ""League of Legends"", Wu Hanwei, also known as Xiye, began playing at 14 and joined a club at 16.
""The new regulations almost kill young people's chances of becoming professional esports players,"" said Chen Jiang, associate professor at Peking University's School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science.
In doing so, the rules also undermine the big business of esports in China, where tournaments are often played in billion-dollar stadiums and livestreamed to many more. Chinese esport fans are estimated to number more than 400 million, according to the state-run People's Daily, while the domestic esports market was worth some 147 billion yuan ($23 billion) last year, says Chinese consultancy iResearch.
Rogue Warriors, a club of 90 gamers who train in a three-floor building that includes dorms and a canteen, declined to comment on the expected impact of the new rules. 
An executive at another major Chinese club said the new rules will mean many talented people will miss out on being discovered.
""The real top players are usually gifted and don't necessarily play long hours before joining the club. Others can be very good eventually but they need a lot of practice to get there,"" said the executive, who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the issue.
The new rules are not laws per se that punish individuals but place the onus on gaming companies which will be compelled to require logins with real names and national ID numbers. Experts note that determined Chinese teenagers can still circumvent the rules if they have their parents' support and are able to use adult logins.
Chinese authorities have not addressed the impact of the new rules on the esports industry, but Chen at Peking University said they have the leeway to grant some young esports players exemptions.

""The country can still introduce corresponding policies,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged broadly lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s strong gains ahead of the week’s European Central Bank meeting, while the telecoms sector outperformed.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%, while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%.
The major indices in Europe posted gains of approaching 1% on Monday, helped by orders for German factory goods unexpectedly surging in July, hitting a post-reunification high.
The positive economic news continued Tuesday as German industrial production climbed 1.0% on the month in July, while stronger than expected August export data out of China pointed to resilience in global demand despite the headwinds caused by delta variant-driven Covid-19 outbreaks and high raw material prices.
However, investors are cautious Tuesday ahead of not only Germany’s closely-watched ZEW survey of economic sentiment for September, but more importantly Thursday’s policy-setting meeting of the European Central Bank.
Concerns are growing that the increasingly vocal hawkish members in the central bank’s governing council may start to get their way in terms of reducing the bond-buying program, especially after annual consumer inflation soared to 3.0%, way above the bank’s target.
In corporate news, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) stock rose 1.8% after announcing a share-swap deal with Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) to increase its stake in U.S. unit T-Mobile, while also selling its Dutch unit. Dutch telecoms rival KPN (AS:KPN) stock climbed 3.4%.
Steelmakers were broadly higher after data showing China imported record amounts of iron ore by value in August, suggesting domestic Chinese demand, the main driver of world steel prices, is still strong.
Elsewhere,  Ted Baker  (LON:TED) stock climbed 0.9% after the clothes retailer said second-quarter sales surged 50%, the end of Covid-19 restrictions in the U.K. boostng demand for its occasional wear.
On the flip side, Allianz (DE:ALVG) stock slipped 0.5% after Reuters reported that regulators have launched an investigation into the German financial services company after the demise of some of its U.S. investment funds last year.
Crude prices were mixed Tuesday, helped by the strong growth in China's exports, but gains are limited following Monday’s move by Saudi Arabia, the world’s top exporter, to sharply cut prices for October cargoes destined for Asia. 
Markets are also contending with the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, to continue adding crude to the global market, as well as the ongoing impact on U.S. supply from Hurricane Ida.
By 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $69.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $72.51. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,819.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1875.

144,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 03:50AM ET</span>",British sportscar maker Lotus plans China sales expansion to take on Porsche,"BEIJING (Reuters) - British sportscar maker Lotus plans to open up to 70 showrooms in China by 2024 and start production at its new Wuhan factory next year to ramp up competition with rival Porsche, Chief Executive Feng Qingfeng told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Premium and luxury car sales are growing in China as coronavirus pandemic travel restrictions leave consumers in the world's biggest car market with more money to spend. 
Feng said Lotus, which is owned by Chinese firm Geely and Malaysia's Etika Automotive, will begin production at its Wuhan factory next year, producing around 2,000 compact SUVs. 
The plant, which is still under construction, would ramp up to full production of 20,000 cars in 2023, Feng told Reuters in a telephone call from Hangzhou, where Geely is headquartered.
The cars will be positioned in a similar segment to rival Porsche and higher than BMW and Audi, Feng said. Porsche has said it sold 88,968 cars in China last year thanks to demand for its Macan compact sports-utility vehicle.
Feng said Lotus will open more than 20 showrooms next year, first targeting major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. It will expand the network further over 2023 and 2024 to include cities like eastern Suzhou and Ningbo for a total of 50-70 showrooms around the country.
Lotus, the maker of the Lotus Esprit, famously driven by James Bond in 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", has four showrooms in China, according to its website.
Lotus said its Wuhan-based technology unit recently received an undisclosed investment from Nio (NYSE:NIO) Capital, an investment firm founded by the chief executive of leading Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio Inc. The technology unit is valued at 15 billion yuan ($2.32 billion). 

Lotus Technology is studying a possible initial public offering, potentially in New York, Hong Kong or London, as soon as 2023 when it would start mass-production in its Wuhan factory, Feng said.

The study, among the first analyses in China combing different COVID-19 vaccines, comes as the country said it would use booster shots in specific groups amid concerns over vaccines' waning protection over time.
Participants who received a CanSinoBIO booster dose three to six months after a second Sinovac shot showed a 78-fold jump on average in neutralizing antibody levels two weeks later, according to a paper published on Monday before a peer review.
By contrast, those who received a Sinovac booster shot showed a 15.2-fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, researchers from local disease control authorities, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutions said in the paper.
One dose of Sinovac followed by a CanSinoBIO booster at intervals of one or two months led to a 25.7-fold increase in neutralising antibody levels, while two doses of Sinovac induced a 6.2-fold increase.
The study analysed data from about 300 healthy adults aged 18-59. 
The study did not assess the boosters' protection against COVID-19 and did not test the neutralising antibody against the more transmissible Delta variant, the paper said.

More than 1.4 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been administered globally, about three quarters of them in China.
China, which has kept local infections under control, has fully vaccinated around 69% of its population as of Sept. 6. It said on Tuesday a total of 2.1 billion doses had been administered as of Monday.

(Reuters) - Alphonso David, the president of Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the United States, was fired on Monday after a New York Attorney General report said he had advised former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on how to handle sexual harassment allegations, the organization's board said.
His dismissal was announced by the co-chairs of HRC's board, Morgan Cox and Jodie Patterson, in a statement that said that his actions in assisting Cuomo's teams had violated the campaign's mission.
It also accused David of making statements that included ""significant untruths"" about the investigation and his role in the organization.
""At HRC, we are fighting to bring full equality and liberation to LGBTQ+ People everywhere. That includes fighting on behalf of all victims of sexual harassment and assault,"" the statement said. 
David said the Human Rights Campaign board had ""unjustly"" terminated him. 
""As a Black, gay man who has spent his whole life fighting for civil and human rights, they cannot shut me up. Expect a legal challenge,"" David said in a statement. 
According to David's LinkedIn profile, he was president of HRC for over two years, having spent over eight years prior to that working for Cuomo's office - first as counsel for civil rights and then as chief counsel.
The report by Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, described allegations of sexual harassment by Cuomo, and efforts by his aides to retaliate against the former governor's accusers. 
David was identified in the report as involved in efforts to undermine Cuomo's first accuser, Lindsey Boylan.
Andrew Cuomo, 63, stepped down as governor in August after a state investigation concluded that he sexually harassed women who worked for him. He said it was ""unfair"" that he had to resign. He at times expressed regret for making young women uncomfortable, but denied criminal wrongdoing.
The HRC board said that David's conduct had violated the group's ""conflict of interest"" policy and that it resulted in ""material damage"" to the reputations of David and of the group.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group said on Tuesday it plans to offer hydrogen fuel cell versions for all its commercial vehicles by 2028 and will cut the price of fuel cell vehicles to battery electric levels two years later.
The group, which comprises Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp, currently has one fuel cell bus and one fuel cell truck, the Xcient Hyundai, on the market. There are 115 of the buses on the road in South Korea and 45 of the trucks in operation after they were rolled out in Switzerland last year.
The two South Korean automakers together offer 20 models of commercial vehicles including trucks, buses and vans, and sold about 287,000 last year.
The group, whose only other fuel cell vehicle on the market is Hyundai's Nexo SUV, also said it will develop fuel cell vehicles for Kia and its premium Genesis brand, which could be launched after 2025. It did not mention specific targets for fuel cell versions of passenger vehicle models.
The plans are measured ambitions to push ahead with hydrogen technology despite its relative niche status, while the automakers also expand their battery electric vehicle line-up.
Advocates assert that hydrogen fuel cells are cleaner than other carbon-cutting methods as they only emit water and heat, but the technology has only seen limited usage in the auto industry amid concerns about high costs, the bulky size of fuel cell systems, the lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions.
Industry-wide, some 10,000-15,000 fuel cell vehicles are produced globally a year compared to 4-5 million electric vehicles, Hyundai said. 

Other major automakers pursuing hydrogen fuel cell technology include  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, BMW and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF). They have been encouraged as Europe and China have set ambitious emission reduction targets and talk of hydrogen infrastructure support increases.
Hyundai Motor Group also said it also plans to employ hydrogen fuel cell technology in other areas such as autonomous container transport.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s strong gains, but losses are likely to be small as China’s trade data pointed to solid global demand.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%.
Data released earlier Tuesday showed China’s exports rose at a faster-than-expected rate of 25.6% in August from a year earlier, from a 19.3.% gain in July. Economists had forecast growth of 17.1%, and the beat suggested resilience in global demand despite the headwinds caused by delta variant-driven Covid-19 outbreaks and high raw material prices.
The major indices in Europe posted gains of approaching 1% on Monday, helped by orders for German factory goods unexpectedly surging in July, hitting a post-reunification high.
The positive economic news continued Tuesday as German industrial production climbed 1.0% on the month in July, and attention will quickly turn to the release of the country’s closely-watched ZEW survey of economic sentiment for September for further guidance.
Investors will also look to the open on Wall Street later in the session, after Monday’s holiday, for further reaction in the wake of Friday’s disappointing September U.S. payrolls report, with just 235,000 jobs created compared with 750,000 expected.

Crude prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by the strong growth in China's exports, but gains are limited following Monday’s move by Saudi Arabia, the world’s top exporter, to sharply cut its prices for Asian buyers over the weekend.
Markets are also contending with the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, to continue adding crude to the global market, as well as the ongoing impact on U.S. supply from Hurricane Ida.

Two units of German insurer Allianz were on Monday fined a total of A$1.5 million ($1.12 million) in a civil case https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-regulator-allianz-idUSKBN26L14J brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in September last year.
The units, Allianz Australia and AWP Australia, committed A$10 million in October last year to compensate around 31,500 customers who were sold potentially incorrect travel insurance through Allianz's own website and Expedia, ASIC said. 
Allianz Australia issued the travel insurance while AWP handled its sale.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - The leaders of a military coup in Guinea promised on Monday to set up a transitional government of national unity after ousting President Alpha Conde and dissolving his cabinet.
Sunday's coup, in which Conde and other top politicians were detained or barred from travelling, is the third since April in West and Central Africa, raising concerns about a slide back to military rule in a region that had made strides towards multi-party democracy since the 1990s.
The takeover was widely condemned by international powers, placing pressure on the new military leaders to offer a plan beyond the toppling of the old order, and to reassure investors that Guinea's significant ore exports would not be cut. 
""A consultation will be carried out to define the major framework of the transition, then a government of national unity will be put in place to lead the transition,"" coup leader Mamady Doumbouya, a former French legionnaire officer, told a meeting of Conde's ministers and senior government officials. 
""At the end of this transitional phase, we'll set the tone for a new era for governance and economic development,"" he said, flanked by armed soldiers in red berets.
Doumbouya did not say what the transition would entail or give a date for a return to democratic elections. 
His seizure of power was buoyed by widespread disaffection with Conde, 83, who promised stable democracy but once in power violently silenced opponents, failed to reduce poverty and last year decided to run for a third term in power - a move many said was illegal. 
The coup was welcomed by many, but spooked the mining sector. Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves, an ore used to produce aluminium. Prices of the metal shot to a 10-year high on Monday, though there was no sign of supply disruptions. 
In an effort to quell fears, Doumbouya said sea borders would stay open so mining products could be exported. A nightly curfew now in place does not apply to the mining sector, he said. 
""I can assure business and economic partners that activities will continue normally in the country. We are asking mining companies to continue their activities,"" he said. 
POLITICIANS ARRESTED
Light traffic resumed, and some shops reopened around the main administrative district of Kaloum in Conakry that witnessed heavy gunfire throughout Sunday as the special forces battled soldiers loyal to Conde. A military spokesman said on television that land and air borders had also been reopened. 
Still, a crackdown was evident. Doumbouya prohibited government officials from leaving the country and ordered them to hand over their official vehicles. 
The politicians who attended Monday's meeting were later escorted by soldiers in red berets through a jeering crowd to the army unit's Conakry headquarters. 
Two diplomatic sources said Prime Minister Ibrahima Kassory Fofana, Presidential Affairs Minister Mohamed Diané and National Assembly Speaker Amadou Damaro Camara had been arrested. 

Amnesty International, in a statement on Monday, called on the coup leaders to clarify the legal basis for Conde's detention, and to free those Conde had arbitrarily detained in the months surrounding last year's election.
Regional experts say however that unlike in landlocked Mali where neighbours and partners were able to pressure a junta there after a coup in August 2020, leverage on the military in Guinea could be limited because it is not landlocked and also because it is not a member of the West African currency union.

MUNICH (Reuters) - As carmakers gathered in Munich on Monday to launch almost exclusively zero- or low-emission vehicles, an ongoing semiconductor shortage cast a long shadow over the first major car show since before the pandemic began.
Forced to shut down plants last year, carmakers now face increasing competition from the consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries. That problem has been compounded by a series of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.
Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.
Speaking during the launch of a couple of electric vehicles (EVs) on Sunday evening, Ola Källenius, CEO at premium German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), said that while the company is hopeful its own supply will improve in the fourth quarter, soaring demand for chips means the industry could struggle to source enough of them into 2023 - though the shortage should be less severe by then.
""Several chip suppliers have been referring to structural problems with demand,"" Källenius said. ""This could influence 2022 and (the situation) may be more relaxed in 2023.""
Joerg Burzer, head of supply chain at Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s carmaking unit Mercedes-Benz, said he was hoping the situation would stabilise in the fourth quarter. ""Relaxation will come later.""
The IAA (NYSE:IAA) Mobility show in Munich is the first major motor industry event worldwide since the global coronavirus pandemic.
Despite the ongoing shortage, Daimler board member Britta Seeger said the carmaker does not believe its long-term electric vehicle goals will be affected.
Automakers from U.S. group General Motors (NYSE:GM) to India's Mahindra and Japan's Toyota have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
Just last week, Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc cut its delivery forecast for the third quarter due to uncertain and volatile semiconductor supplies.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) CEO Luca De Meo said on Monday the chip shortage had been tougher than expected during the current third quarter, but said the situation should improve in the fourth quarter.
Major auto supplier Bosch said it expects the shortage will ease somewhat in the coming months, but supplies will remain constrained into next year.

BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said the premium carmaker expects supply chains to remain tight well into 2022.
""I expect that the general tightness of the supply chains will continue in the next 6 to 12 months,"" he said.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - While the race for ruling party leader remains wide open, the Japanese stock market has emerged as a clear winner of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's abrupt departure, with the broad Topix index soaring to 31-year highs.
Suga said on Friday he would not seek reelection at the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race this month and would step down, setting the stage for a new premier. Suga's one-year tenure as prime minister was marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response and dwindling public support.
Since Suga's shock announcement, the Nikkei has gained almost 4% to its highest level since mid-April while the Topix vaulted nearly 3% to a level not seen since 1990, even though there is no clear front-runner. The LDP's majority in parliament guarantees the winner will become prime minister.
""Basically his party, the LDP, is market-friendly, but Suga is not well liked due to the handling of the pandemic,"" said Dave Wang, a portfolio manager at Nuvest Capital in Singapore.
""With him stepping down, LDP's chances of winning (lower house elections later this year) go up, and markets are happier.""
As Suga's departure removes a major source of concern for Japanese markets, market participants say they expect Japanese shares to catch up to other stock markets, given the steady rise in Corporate Japan's earnings. 
(Graphic: Japan earnings recovery - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplggogxvb/21906D.png) 
World stock prices have surged 15% so far this year, reaching record highs, on hopes of a strong global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 8% gains in the Nikkei. 
Many investors regard vaccine minister Taro Kono and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida as two leading candidates. 
Former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi could also enjoy a boost after local media reported former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be backing her.
""Kono is seen as a reformist and could be positive for stocks while there are some uncertainties on Kishida given his penchant for fiscal tightening. But these views could change depending on the policies they adopt,"" said Ryota Sakagami, chief equity strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities.
Kishida has called for the reduction of income disparities, pledged support to the economically vulnerable, and said an economic stimulus package worth ""tens of trillions of yen"" was needed to combat the coronavirus.
Kono is thought to focus more on pro-business policies such as deregulation, while Takaichi, a member of the party's most conservative wing, has said she wants to work towards achieving 2% inflation. 
""For the time being, dealing with the coronavirus and economic normalisation would be the top priority for anyone and therefore their policy differences will probably not become evident,"" said Sakagami.
Sakagami expected the Topix to rise to 2,100-2,200 by year-end, a 2.9% to 7.8% increase from current levels.

The stock rise also comes as Japan has made progress in vaccine rollouts, with 58% of the population now having received one COVID-19 dose.
""I think stock prices will keep rising. Our vaccination is likely to reach to the top-group levels soon,"" said Masaru Ishibashi, joint general manager of trading at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) faces a standoff with one of its biggest customers after Ireland's Ryanair said it had ended talks over a purchase of 737 MAX 10 jets worth tens of billions of dollars due to differences over price.
The rare decision to go public over big-ticket airplane negotiations comes after months of wrangling that had already delayed a deal for the largest version of the 737 MAX when Ryanair re-ordered a smaller model in December.
A large new Ryanair order would provide a boost to the U.S. planemaker as it rebuilds confidence in the MAX, grounded for 20 months until November after two fatal crashes. It would also speed a tentative industry recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Europe's largest budget carrier is already the region's largest MAX customer with 210 of the 197-seat MAX 8-200 on order. It has dangled a fresh order potentially worth $33 billion at list prices for up to 250 of the 230-seat MAX 10.
Even after steep industry-wide discounts such a deal would still be worth well over $10 billion, analysts estimate.
But last week, Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary poured cold water on chances of a quick deal, saying he would be surprised if agreement was reached this year.
On Monday, he said talks had collapsed.
""We are disappointed we couldn’t reach agreement,"" O'Leary said. ""However, Boeing have a more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not paying high prices for aircraft.""
Boeing also vowed to exercise discipline.
""Ryanair is a long-standing partner. We value their business and are committed to supporting them,"" a Boeing spokesperson said. ""At the same time, we continue to be disciplined and make decisions that make sense for our customers and our company.""
Ryanair shares rose 1.8%. U.S. markets, where Boeing is listed, were closed for the Labor Day holiday.
HIGHER VALUES
While Ryanair has nominally ended talks, analysts said it is gambling that public pressure will lure Boeing to the table with an improved offer as the planemaker juggles the fallout from the MAX crisis, uncertainty over COVID-19 and industrial woes.
Boeing, however, appears to believe the market is finally moving in its direction after winning a series of orders including 150 MAX 10 from United Airlines.
Industry experts say Ryanair is one of two budget kingpins alongside Southwest that can insist on best prices from Boeing.
The spread of COVID-19 variants and public acceptance of the MAX will help determine whether prices have further room to fall or whether Ryanair, one the industry's toughest negotiators, has missed the bottom of the market for the largest MAX model.
""MAX values have increased very slightly as inventory declines,"" said Rob Morris, chief consultant at Ascend by Cirium. ""We are hearing less about some of the low prices.""
The MAX 10 has yet to enter service but estimated values for the slightly smaller MAX 9 have risen 2% recently, though are still 9-10% below levels before the MAX crisis, he said.
Despite the rift with Boeing, O'Leary has repeatedly played down the prospect of a dramatic defection to rival Airbus due to a long waiting list for its hot-selling A321neo. The two companies have had tense relations in the past.
On Monday, O'Leary did however pointedly refer to the fact that other Boeing customers had done deals with Airbus.
Britain's Jet2 last week closed a deal for 36 A321 neo aircraft worth about $4.9 billion.. Delta, which buys from both suppliers, in August added 30 A321neo to its order book with Airbus. 
Still, industry sources said Airbus may be wary of diluting what it sees as a price advantage for its A321neo by getting dragged into a price war over Ryanair that few expect it to win. 

""It is likely Boeing and Ryanair will eventually cut a deal,"" one industry veteran said.
Airbus declined comment.

CrossTower India has already hired 35 people and plans to increase headcount to 100 in six to nine months, the company said. The company is following in the footsteps of market leader Binance, which entered India in 2019. 
India's digital currency market has grown from $923 million in April 2020 to $6.6 billion in May 2021, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. Among 154 nations, India ranks 11th in cryptocurrency adoption, it said.
""India will play a pivotal role and we plan to use the country as a hub to expand into other geographies,"" Kapil Rathi, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of CrossTower, told Reuters. 
As a late entrant to India, the company plans to increase its market share by providing competitive pricing and relying on advanced technology infrastructure, Rathi added.
Several other global exchanges are considering coming to India despite the lack of regulations on crypto and concerns about an unfavourable regulatory environment.
""We believe we are taking a calculated risk,"" said Rathi.

The government was set to present a bill to parliament by March that proposed a ban on cryptocurrencies, making trading and holding them illegal. But the bill was not tabled in the session and there is uncertainty about the government's plans.
The central bank is planning to launch its own digital currency by December, however.

MUNICH (Reuters) - BMW is confident that sales in China will increase next year, finance chief Nicolas Peter told Reuters on Monday, attributing high demand for premium cars to travel restrictions that have left consumers with more money to spend.
Car sales in China have fallen in recent months as floods, COVID-19 outbreaks and a semiconductor shortage hit the domestic market, but BMW has bucked the trend, reporting a 12% rise in sales there in its second-quarter.
""The market will not grow as quickly as it did over the last 12 months - that was when the catch-up effects after the corona disruption made themselves felt,"" Peter said. ""But we do expect it to grow.""
BMW was also profiting from travel restrictions that have left more money in people's pockets in China for discretionary spending, he said on the sidelines of Munich IAA (NYSE:IAA) auto show, the first such industry event since before the pandemic.
STOCKED ON BATTERIES
Peter said BMW had struck enough contracts for the raw materials needed to produce batteries for two to three years via its third-party suppliers, even as carmakers face shortages across supply chains of everything from lithium to chips.
Still, BMW has no plans to invest in battery production of its own as rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) are doing as it is too early to know which battery technology will prevail in the future, Peter said.
The Munich-based automaker is also investing heavily in its recycling capabilities, he said, a move that ticked the boxes both of its sustainability goals, and cost cutting.
Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said last week that BMW would cut carbon emissions across the life cycle of its vehicles - including production - by at least 40% from 2019 levels through 2030, up from a previous target of a third.
""If we manage to reduce our need for raw materials through recycling, we save money,"" Peter said. 

On software, however, BMW's finance chief urged collaboration between carmakers to build operating systems that could be implemented across brands, drawing a comparison between cars and smartphone technology.
""It's not so black and white, because there are functions in a car which are proprietary to a manufacturer,"" he said. ""But it would be no bad thing for the industry, if we worked together more closely,"" Peter told Reuters.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Prices for aluminium ore bauxite from Guinea hit their highest in almost 18 months in top metals consumer China on Monday as buyers fretted about supply after a coup in the West African country, though no mines reported any disruption.
Guinea is the world's second-biggest producer of the raw material that is refined into alumina, a substance used to make aluminium metal, and is the top supplier to China. 
Guinean bauxite for delivery to China was last assessed by Asian Metal at $50.50 a tonne, up 1% from Friday and the highest since March 16 last year. Prices are up about 16% this year.
The ousting of Guinea President Alpha Conde by an army unit on Sunday also extended a rally in aluminium prices to multi-year highs and boosted shares in aluminium producers Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY) and Rusal.
The unrest did not have any immediate impact on bauxite operations, which are key to Guinea's economy as its main foreign currency earner. The country produced 88 million tonnes of bauxite last year, according to mines ministry statistics. 
""It is highly unlikely that the coup will have any major short-term impact on exports, which are always at the lowest part of the cycle in September with stockpiles depleted as the rainy season comes to an end,"" said Guinea bauxite industry specialist Bob Adam.
""Any incoming government will want to make sure that it doesn't jeopardise future earnings and investment.""
Coup leader Mamady Doumbouya on Monday said that a curfew imposed in mining areas had been lifted.
Guinea's top bauxite producer Société Minière de Boké (SMB) did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
A spokesperson for Aluminium Corp of China (Chalco), the world's biggest producer of alumina, said its bauxite business in Guinea was operating normally.
Singapore's TOP International Holding, which owns two bauxite mines in Guinea, said operations were continuing ""with minimal disruption"" and the situation at sites in Boke and Boffa was stable.
A Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) spokesperson said its mines had not been affected by the turmoil. 
U.S. aluminium giant  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA), joint owner of CBG, said it is monitoring the situation closely and is not aware of disruption to bauxite exports.

AngloGold Ashanti said its Siguiri gold mine in Guinea was operating normally.
""We're monitoring the situation and are in close contact with the leadership of our mine in Guinea, which is operating normally,"" the gold miner said in a statement. Siguiri produced 117,000 ounces of gold in the first six months of this year.

Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), which is developing part of Guinea's huge Simandou iron ore project alongside Chinalco, declined to comment on how the overthrow might affect its plans in the country. 
Andrew Gadd, senior steel analyst at CRU Group, said: ""Sourcing the finances for Simandou has proved very difficult and the uncertainty generated by the current developments will challenge the commitment of interested parties.""

167,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",European stocks end near record highs as tech rallies,"By Sruthi Shankar and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European shares climbed on Monday to end near record levels, led by technology stocks which surged to their highest this year as a surprise rise in German factory orders pointed to improving global demand and boosted sentiment.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.7% to 475.19, just below its all-time high of 476.16 hit on Aug. 13.
Still, trading volumes were muted throughout the day due to a public holiday in the United States. 
After Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index hit a record high on Friday, European tech stocks jumped 1.7%, with shares in chip equipment maker ASML and Dutch tech investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) providing the biggest boost.
The tech index ended at 829.31 points, its peak so far in 2021 and its highest since December 2000.
Recent uncertainty over monetary policy and rising COVID-19 cases has pushed investors into technology stocks, which have been the best-performing sector through the pandemic. 
German stocks rose 1.0% after a rise in July German factory orders boosted sentiment by suggesting there was strong demand for goods from Europe's biggest economy.
Investors are also focusing on the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting this week as some of its hawkish policymakers are calling for it to start paring back bond purchases with inflation surging and the growth in euro zone resilient.
Last week, BofA Securities upgraded its euro area growth and inflation forecasts, predicting the bloc's economy would expand 4.8% this year, up from its previous forecast of 4.2%.
""Our base case scenario is that the ECB will announce a moderation of asset purchases in Q4 amid a solid economic growth backdrop, easier financing conditions, higher inflation forecasts and lower net issuance of government bonds,"" Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analysts said.
Media and retail stocks were also among the best performing European sectors for the day. 
Italian defence group Leonardo gained 2.3% after its chief executive officer said the company still aimed to list its U.S. unit DRS when the right market conditions are in place.

French supermarket group  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) rose 1.9% on news that France could ease health pass restrictions that are hurting the activity of large shopping malls.
French engineering group Spie fell 4.3% after it confirmed it had submitted a non-binding offer to buy Equans, the newly created services unit of French energy group Engie.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - French waste and water management companies Veolia and Suez will seek EU antitrust approval this month for their tie-up to create a national champion better able to compete with Chinese rivals, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Another source close to the matter, however, said an EU filing could come in the second half of October. The European Commission typically requires a massive amount of information on complex deals which could delay companies' filing plans.
Veolia and Suez announced the deal, worth nearly 13 billion euros ($15.4 billion), in April after a months-long spat.
They have already tried to address EU competition concerns by spinning off Suez's French water activities and some international assets, including in Italy, the Czech Republic, India and Australia into a new entity called New Suez.
The main shareholders of New Suez are Meridiam, Ardian and Global Infrastructure Partners, as well as state-backed Caisse des Depots and employees.
The move and other possible minor asset sales could help Veolia and Suez secure the green light from the European Commission following its preliminary review, the person said. 

The deal has already won U.S. antitrust clearance.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares posted their longest winning streak in three months on Monday, aided by hopes U.S. interest rates would stay low for longer and talk of more stimulus in Japan and China.
A holiday in the United States made for thin trading conditions, but MSCI's all-country world index gained 0.3%, touching a new record level and on course for its seventh consecutive closing high.
In Europe the STOXX index of 600 European companies was 0.8% higher, inching closer to August's record peaks.
Shares in Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY) rose as much 5% to a more than 13-year peak and Rusal jumped more than 4% to its highest on record after aluminium prices hit a more than 10-year high as a coup in Guinea raised supply concerns. No producers reported being affected, however. 
Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange rose as much as 1.8% to $2,775.50 a tonne, its highest since May 2011.
Guinean bauxite for delivery to China was last assessed by Asian Metal at $50.50 a tonne, up 1% from Friday and the highest since March 16, 2020. 
The coup added to the bullish market mood, primarily fuelled by supply concerns around carbon neutrality pledges from China and the European Union, said Carsten Menke, head of next generation research at Julius Baer.
""We are convinced that the current impact of carbon neutrality on aluminium is overstated and that prices are detached from fundamentals,"" said Menke. ""That said, short-term price risks remain skewed to the upside.""
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.6% overnight to the highest since late July.
Japan's Nikkei gained 1.8% to a five-month top, extending a rally on hopes a new prime minister there would bring added fiscal spending.
Hopes of fresh stimulus from Beijing through fiscal and monetary policy lifted Chinese blue chips 1.9%.
Nasdaq futures inched up 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.3%. 
Investors were still assessing the fallout from the September payrolls report, which showed a much smaller increase in jobs than expected, but also a pick-up in wages.
The latter was enough to nudge longer-dated Treasury yields higher and steepen the yield curve, even as markets speculated over whether the Federal Reserve might not start tapering until later than previously thought.
""Employment decelerated sharply in August, with little indication of a pickup in labour supply,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Jonathan Millar. 
""This puts the Fed in a quandary as it balances risks of a sharp demand slowdown against those of tight supply and inflation.""
""We still expect the Fed to signal tapering in September, but now expect it to begin in December, not November. QE will likely end by the middle of 2022.""
The rise in U.S. 10-year yields to 1.33% limited some of the pressure on the dollar from the poor payrolls print, though its index still touched a one-month low before steadying at 92.26.
The dollar was changing hands versus the yen at 109.85 , while the euro stood at $1.1866 after hitting a five-week top of $1.1908 on Friday.
The European Central Bank holds its policy meeting this week and a number of policy hawks have been calling for a step back in the bank's huge asset-buying programme, though President Christine Lagarde has sounded more dovish.
Euro zone sovereign bond yields was little moved Monday, with Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield steady at -0.37%. 
""We expect the ECB to announce a reduced pace of Q4 PEPP (pandemic emergency purchase programme) at its September meeting on the back of easier financial conditions,"" said analysts at TD Securities.
""All other policy levers are likely to be left on hold, with inflation forecasts revised sharply up this year and next. Communication risks are high, and Lagarde will want to avoid sounding overly hawkish, instead emphasising 'persistence'.""
The prospect of a later start to Fed tapering proved only fleetingly positive for non-yielding gold, which stood at $1,821 an ounce, having reached its highest since mid-June at $1,833.80.
Oil prices stabilised after sharp falls following Saudi Arabia's slashing of prices of all crude grades to Asian customers, while leaving prices to northwestern Europe and the United States steady. [O/R]

177,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2021 09:55AM ET</span>",Schroders among asset managers failing to make best practice list,"By Huw Jones, Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and M&G are among 125 firms endorsed under Britain's tougher best practice code to stop ""greenwashing"" by asset managers, though  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and 63 others failed to make the grade, the Financial Reporting Council said on Monday.
Asset managers are under greater scrutiny from securities regulators globally to prevent greenwashing, or exaggerating the climate-friendly credentials of their products to investors.
The FRC beefed up its decade-old stewardship code in 2020 to stop ""boiler plate"" statements about investment decision-making that it said did little to show if investors were getting value for money. 
The code is enforced on a comply or explain basis, meaning firms must say publicly why they are not applying it.
The revised code says asset managers should not only spell out their actions in selecting investments, such as meetings with companies or voting at annual meetings, but also provide evidence on what the outcomes of those actions were.
As Britain seeks to promote London as a global centre for sustainable investment, there is a strong emphasis on taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into account when investing.
The volume of money going into ESG products has risen significantly, raising fears among regulators of greenwashing.
All 300 asset managers who were signatories to the old code had to reapply. The FRC said it received 189 applications, with an inability to provide proper evidence on outcomes a key reason why 64 firms failed to become signatories.
The 125 signatories have a combined 20 trillion pounds ($27.7 trillion) under management, while the total for all 189 applicants was 32 trillion pounds.
NEXT TIME LUCKY?
Several blue-chip names, like T. Rowe Price, Columbia Threadneedle,  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management and Pimco, are not among the signatories, but it is unclear if they all applied.
Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors said it will be applying next year, and Columbia Threadneedle said it would be applying in October. 
Some who failed to make the grade are also expected to reapply in October, or April next year, after which not being among the signatories could raise awkward questions from clients.
Schroders said it was frustrated not to be a signatory, saying FRC feedback had put this down to the format rather than the substance of its submission.
""We are confident we will be a signatory again soon,"" Schroders said.
T. Rowe Price and Morgan Stanley Investment Management had no comment.

Citing unidentified sources, Bloomberg News on Friday reported that China's capital city is considering taking Didi under state control and has proposed that government-run companies invest in Didi.
Didi had issued its own denial of the report on Saturday.

Beijing-based Didi completed a New York initial public offering in June but has been caught up in China's regulatory crackdown on technology companies in the past year to improve market competition, data handling and their treatment of employees.
Didi is controlled by the management team of co-founder Will Cheng and President Jean Liu. SoftBank Group Corp, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) are among investors in the company.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's JD (NASDAQ:JD).com said on Monday founder and chief executive Richard Liu will switch his focus to the e-commerce giant's long-term strategy, creating the new role of president to run the company's day-to-day operations.
The move comes as several other founders of China's tech companies have gradually relinquished the top job, such as at  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ByteDance, although Liu, 48, will retain his title as chief executive and his board seat.
The new role of president will be filled by Xu Lei, currently CEO of JD's biggest division, who has taken on a more prominent public role at the company in recent years.
Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, will also spend more time mentoring younger management and contributing to the revitalisation of rural areas, JD said in a statement.
""Looking to the future, the correct long-term strategic design, the growth and development of young talents, and the healthy and coordinated development of various business units will continue to be the driving force for JD, in doing the hardest and most challenging, but right and most valuable things for the industry,"" Liu said in the statement.
Liu owns nearly 80% of JD's voting power, according to its 2020 annual report, and some investors have previously raised concerns his tight control, coupled with the lack of an obvious successor, had posed a management risk.
His control of the company became a focus after he was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in 2017 following a rape allegation, which he denied. Liu was not charged https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-ceo-idUKKCN1OK278 but the incident caused a storm on Chinese social media.
Citi analysts said Xu's promotion reflected the way he had proven his leadership and management skills in spearheading JD Retail's operations and he was a potential successor to Liu. 
""We believe if Mr. Xu further proves his management capability, we would not be surprised if he is positioned as a potential successor to Mr. Richard Liu should Mr. Liu decide to step down one day,"" they said in a Monday note. 
Xin Lijun, who previously headed up JD Health, will take over from Xu as JD Retail's chief while Jin Enlin will become JD Health's new CEO. 
Following Xu's promotion, Liu will retain his board seat and position as CEO of JD.com, a company spokesperson confirmed.
In 2019, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd co-founder Jack Ma formally stepped down as chairman of the e-commerce giant, handing over reigns to Daniel Zhang.

In 2021, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming announced he would step down from his role as CEO, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc founder stepped down as chairman following an earlier resignation of his CEO title.
Chinese authorities have also launched a wave of new industry regulations and penalties since late 2020, many of which have targeted the internet sector in particular.

Taylor is competing with Austin, Texas to land the plant which is expected to create about 1,800 new jobs. Samsung (KS:005930) has also said it is looking at other potential sites in Arizona and New York.
Other potential sites have yet to disclose planned tax breaks. 
A proposed resolution posted on the city's website shows that for the land Samsung will use, it is set to be offered a grant equivalent to 92.5% of assessed property tax for 10 years, 90% for the following 10 years and then 85% in the 10 years after that. 
Other measures include a 92.5% tax waiver on new property built on the site for 10 years and the repayment of development review costs.
The proposed resolution will be considered on Wednesday by the Taylor City Council and Williamson County Commissioners. 

The Taylor site is located about 25 miles (40 kilometres) from Austin. It is about 1,187.5 acres (4.81 square kilometres)in size, much bigger than the Austin site. Samsung last year purchased more than 250 acres in Austin, which is in addition to 350 acres it owns that includes its sole U.S. chip factory.
If Samsung decides on Taylor, it plans to break ground by the first quarter of next year with production due to start by end-2024, a document previously filed with Texas state officials has said. [nL4N2OS0M5

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Bonds issued by indebted developer China Evergrande Group slumped on Monday after a ratings downgrade led to restrictions on their use as collateral, prompting China's stock exchanges to halt trade.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended trading in China Evergrande Group's 6.98% July 2022 corporate bond following ""abnormal fluctuations."" The exchange had also suspended trading in the bond on Friday.
Shanghai exchange data showed the bonds sliding more than 25% to a low of 40.18 yuan after the resumption of trade on Monday afternoon. The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond, which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.
The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading.
Rules governing pledged repos require bonds issued after April 7, 2017 and pledged as collateral to be rated AAA, while issuers must have credit ratings of AA or higher. Bonds issued before that date - including Evergrande's July 2022 bond - need only be rated AA or higher.
China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI) downgraded Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on Thursday, and placed the company and its bonds on a watchlist for further downgrades.
On Friday, China Securities Depository and Clearing Co. (CSDC) reduced the ""conversion ratio"" of the July 2022 bond to zero, effective Sept. 7. Other Evergrande bonds were not included in CSDC's table of conversion ratios on Friday as they no longer qualified for inclusion.
The conversion ratio determines leverage limits for repo financing given a specific bond pledged as collateral. CSDC is owned by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
A director at a local brokerage said that the reduction in the conversion ratio was a ""grey rhino"" - a highly obvious yet ignored threat. ""It was bound to happen.""
Evergrande declined to comment. But in a statement on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday, it acknowledged the impact of the rating downgrade on the bonds' use as pledged repo collateral. It said the bonds had previously been deemed appropriate only for qualified institutional investors, and the downgrade had no impact on investor suitability.

Worries surrounding Evergrande, which has been scrambling to raise funds to pay lenders and suppliers, have grown into broader concerns that a debt crisis could send shockwaves through China's banking system.
On Friday, an index of high-yield Chinese dollar issuers fell to its lowest level since spring 2020.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Great Wall Motor will launch an electric compact car and a plug-in hybrid SUV in Europe in 2022, it said on Monday, joining a growing number of Chinese carmakers trying their luck on the continent with low or zero-emission vehicles.
The company said at the IAA (NYSE:IAA) car show in Munich it will start taking orders for the Coffee 01 plug-in SUV for the German market at the end of 2021. Deliveries of the vehicle, which will have an electric range of 150 kms (93.2 miles) and will be marketed under Great Wall's WEY brand, will start in the first half of 2022.
The IAA show is the first major motor industry event worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Chinese carmaker said it will announce other European markets besides Germany for the Coffee 01 soon. The company will also launch its first European ""brand experience center"" in Munich in early 2022.
Great Wall said the compact electric car, which will fall under its ORA brand and have a range of up to 400 kms, will also come to Europe in 2022. Orders will open for the ORA CAT toward the end of 2021, but the company did not specify in which markets it will be sold.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine Airlines will return 22 aircraft, mostly Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets, to lessors as it pursues a financial restructuring programme to survive after the pandemic has decimated global travel, executives said on Monday.
Philippine Airlines last week filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy https://www.reuters.com/article/philippine-airlines-bankruptcy-idUSL1N2Q600A in the United States, allowing it to continue operations and generate fresh capital.
With the company not expecting a return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024 to 2025, the carrier will return 22 aircraft to lessors, Philippine Airlines President Gilbert Santa Maria told a news conference.
Philippine Airlines will end with 70 aircraft after cutting about a quarter of its fleet of 92 planes.
The flag carrier has also negotiated with Airbus for the postponement of the delivery of 13 narrow-body Airbus aircraft, with an option to cancel some orders beyond 2026 to 2030, said Nilo Thaddeus Rodriguez, the company's chief financial officer.
After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Philippine Airlines said on Friday it was pursuing a financial restructuring plan.
""The chance that this will fail is very small,"" Santa Maria said.

The proposed rehabilitation plan will cut $2 billion in borrowings. It also includes $505 million in long-term debt equity and debt financing from the airline's majority shareholder, PAL Holdings Inc., and $150 million of additional debt financing from new investors, the company said.
PAL Holdings is partly owned by Japan's ANA Holdings Inc.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) plans to float the assets of its Petershill Partners unit, hoping to cash in on a private equity boom with an IPO valuing the investment vehicle at more than $5 billion.
Petershill, which takes minority stakes in alternative assets managers including private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, will be a standalone company operated by the Goldman Sachs Asset Management team, it said on Monday.
The deal will consist of a sale of around $750 million of new shares as well as existing ones to give Petershill a free float of at least 25% and make it eligible to be included in FTSE indices.
Goldman Sachs declined to give an estimated market value for the unit, but a source close to the deal said analysts put it at in excess of $5 billion. 
The listing is slated to take place around a month from now, the source said.
The U.S. bank chose London to list because Petershill was founded in the British capital and because the financial centre's vibrant capital markets offer a strong fundraising opportunity, the source added.
The London Stock Exchange has had a strong run of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the first half of this year, with new companies raising $12.77 billion in the first seven months of 2021, the highest in seven years, Refinitiv data shows. 
PE BOOM
Private equity funds have soared in value over the past year as money pours in from investors looking for higher returns when interest rates are so low. 
In July, British buyout firm Bridgepoint listed in London, with its shares now up more than 40% from its debut price, while France's Antin Infrastructure Partners launched its own IPO last week.
For investors, such companies offer an attractive hedge against the traditional stock and bond markets and give them access to private deal activity, which has exploded in recent years. 
""The environment is quite fortuitous for private equity at the moment, especially with rates looking likely to stay lower for longer,"" Susannah Streeter, an analyst with  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said. 
""PE firms have also been swooping on UK assets and there might be real interest in getting in on that action without taking on the risk individually,"" she added. 
The Petershill business takes advantage of its relationship with Goldman Sachs to source attractive acquisitions in alternative asset management.
Profits from Petershill will go to its institutional investors, while Goldman Sachs will earn an operator fee for managing the company.

Petershill itself has no fixed assets but holds positions in 19 alternative asset managers with combined assets under management of $187 billion.
It pivoted its investment strategy to focus on technology in 2017 and is now shifting to focus on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by investing in areas such as healthcare, balance sheet repair and environmental, social and governance (ESG).

Trudeau, when asked about criticism that his government had not done enough to free the two Michaels, said on Sunday when dealing with citizens in trouble abroad, ""we use all the tools at our disposal, usually not shouting in the public square.""
He said the government over the past 1,000 days had put forward all the different range of tools to put pressure on the Chinese government to return the two men. 
""We will not rest until the two Michaels are once again home with their families,"" he told reporters.
Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau, who joined the rally, said in statement that years have been cruelly stolen from both men and their families.

Sielaff, who also worked for Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), will be based in Sweden's Gothenburg and lead design the domestic Geely, Zeekr, Lynk & Co and Geometry brands, the company said in a statement.
He will not manage design for its Volvo and Polestar brands.
Chinese car companies historically rolled out models that looked similar to foreign brands. But as sales increased, many - including Geely, Great Wall and BYD - built up their own studios, usually led by international designers, to create fresh designs.
Hangzhou-based Geely, which owns Volvo Cars and a 9.7% stake in Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), has turned to more sporty designs to boost car prices. Sales at rival Changan jumped this year thanks to its more futuristic designs, while Great Wall's off-road sports utility vehicles are also popular.

The increased focus comes as auto design is becoming more challanging, with the move to electric cars and smarter driving systems that include more exterior sensors.

Honda said it sold 91,694 vehicles in China last month, down 38.3% from a year earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a shortage of components.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2021 04:07AM ET</span>",BGI prenatal gene test under scrutiny for Chinese military links,"By Clare Baldwin and Kirsty Needham
(Reuters) - Health regulators in five countries are examining a prenatal test that collects the DNA of women and fetuses for research, while some doctors that promoted it and clinics that sell it say they were unaware the company that produces it also conducts research with the Chinese military.
The test, made by Shenzhen-based BGI Group and marketed under the brand name NIFTY, is sold in at least 52 countries. It screens for Down syndrome and more than 80 other genetic conditions, and has been taken by 8.4 million women globally.
The regulators' concerns, raised in response to a Reuters report, highlight the challenges of regulatory oversight when genetic data is sent from one country to another. Canada's privacy commissioner said the report raised important questions about ""highly sensitive"" information and it is looking into the matter. Two regulators in Europe - in Slovenia and in Germany - said they were examining the test in light of European Union data protection rules.
The data privacy regulator in Slovenia, where one of BGI's regional partners is based, said it was concerned by the exporting of data from the BGI tests and would examine data protection issues. But it added that Slovenia has not yet adopted the changes to its national laws to make Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fully applicable, so it cannot issue fines in the event of GDPR breaches.
Reuters reported in July that more than a dozen scientific studies - including clinical trials - showed BGI developed and improved the test in collaboration with People's Liberation Army hospitals. BGI uses the pregnant women's genetic data for research into the traits of populations. It also collaborates with the PLA in other areas of research.
BGI rejects any suggestion that it developed the NIFTY test in collaboration with the military, and says working with military hospitals is not equivalent. It said it works with thousands of healthcare providers, that other prenatal test providers in China work with military hospitals, and that many companies worldwide work with militaries. It said it takes data privacy seriously, complies with applicable laws and regulations, and only 5% of its NIFTY tests have been conducted on women overseas.
Consent forms signed by women outside China seek permission for their blood samples and genetic data to be sent abroad to BGI and used for research. The privacy policy on the test’s website also says data can be shared for national security purposes in China - though BGI says it has never been asked to do so.
Regulators in Germany, Australia, Estonia and Canada called for transparency in BGI's use of women's genetic data, and said even if data was sent abroad, BGI's local vendors are responsible for ensuring data privacy. The European Data Protection Supervisor said it was monitoring the situation.
""It is vital that the patient is provided with clear information,"" said Beverley Rowbotham, chairperson of Australia's National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council.
A regulator in Ontario told Reuters it is now advising women to seek tests from providers in Canada, or places where data security is ""comparable"" to the protections mandated in Canada. The regulator in Quebec said prenatal tests - like consumer genetic tests - can result in people losing control over their genetic information. Canadian privacy and genetic disclosure laws can impose maximum fines of C$250,000 to C$1 million for breaches, and set strict conditions for exemptions for scientific research.
""Genetic information is not only valuable to marketers and data brokers, but also to foreign states and cybercriminals as well,"" the Office of the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario told Reuters.
Fertility Partners, a clinic network in Canada, said it had no prior knowledge of BGI's work with the PLA, and had stopped selling NIFTY through its clinics in April for unrelated reasons.
Reuters has previously reported that BGI's joint research with PLA medical institutes is wide ranging, from efforts to protect soldiers from altitude sickness to mass testing for pathogens. U.S. government advisers warned in March that a vast bank of genomic data that BGI is amassing and analyzing with artificial intelligence could give China a path to economic and military advantage. 
The same military hospital that ran clinical trials for NIFTY also collaborated with BGI to send pathogens into space under a military equipment research program, according to 12 scientific papers, which has not previously been reported. BGI did not respond to a request for more information about that research program.
In the United Kingdom, where NIFTY tests are only sold through private clinics, the government said BGI would need to register its test before Sept. 1 to continue selling them. BGI told Reuters it submitted a voluntary registration to the UK medical regulator in August. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Reuters it had received BGI’s registration but said the application had not yet had data validation and scrutiny by the regulator's registration and software team.
NIFTY tests are sold overseas through three business models: local clinics collect blood samples to send to BGI in Hong Kong; labs sequence the DNA from blood samples locally and share the data with BGI in Hong Kong where it is stored for five years; or labs complete the entire process locally using BGI technology.
Labs in Spain and Slovenia each told Reuters the genetic data of a client had been used by BGI in mainland China for research, with informed consent.
Slovenia-based GenePlanet, which says it sells NIFTY tests across Europe and also offers its own-branded test using BGI's technology, said the Slovenia customer gave consent for a ""research test.""
GenePlanet says it operates according to EU regulations and has an agreement with BGI that ""none of the GenePlanet patient data generated from (the) NIFTY process is going to mainland China.""
The Slovenian and Spanish women's data was among that of 542 women stored in China's National GeneBank, which BGI also runs. BGI said the data of the 542 women has not been used for other purposes, and its ""scientific research only uses anonymised data.""
Eluthia GmbH, a laboratory in Germany which sells BGI's test, said its transfer of women's blood and patient data to BGI had been suspended by the data protection regulator for the Hesse region while it investigates whether the rules had been violated. 
Eluthia said it did not know when it could resume sending tests to BGI. Its Chief Executive Ramon Enriquez Schaefer said doctors had called the suspension ""excessive"" since patients had ""expressly consented to the shipment to Hong Kong."" He also said Eluthia hasn't been able to make ""concrete progress"" on the regulator's concerns about BGI's military collaboration.
BGI told Reuters it is providing information to Eluthia and relevant government authorities to demonstrate it complies with data protection laws.
DOCTORS' VIEWS
One UK doctor who promoted BGI's test in an online video when it first became available said he would now advise women not to take the BGI test, due to privacy concerns.
""My personal view now would be to advise anybody not to use the BGI NIFTY test - not from a clinical point of view - but because the data from it might be misappropriated or used for reasons that neither the clinician nor the patient would ever have imagined,"" said Bryan Beattie, a fetal medicine consultant.
Reuters contacted Beattie and two other UK doctors who also promoted the test on BGI's YouTube channels in 2014 for their reactions. The doctors said they were unaware of BGI's military links. BGI said the doctors were not paid to participate and it had told them the videos were for educational and marketing purposes.
The NIFTY test captures more genetic information about the mother and the fetus than the results patients see, said Beattie, which has previously been reported by Reuters and BGI has confirmed. 
""If you were able to link that to large numbers of patients in a foreign country, you would have a fairly good idea of their health profile over the next sort of 20 or 30 years,"" said Beattie. 
Beattie said he had supported the relatively new technology because it was an improvement on previous methods, but his clinic had switched to a different supplier for reasons unrelated to privacy.
An Estonian scientist who turned down an offer from BGI in 2020 to replace a test developed by his lab with NIFTY said he was concerned European health services, whom he declined to name, were choosing BGI's test because of its cheaper cost and not considering data security. 
""It is a stupidly easy way to earn money for taking a blood sample,"" said Kaarel Krjutskov, who runs the Estonian lab.

BGI declined to sell his lab a DNA sequencer unless it also began selling NIFTY, email correspondence seen by Reuters showed.
BGI's marketing material promotes its sequencing of genes as the lowest cost in the industry. BGI told Reuters it was ""always striving to make our NIFTY pricing even more affordable,"" without providing further details.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Monday, boosted by strong German industrial orders as well as the disappointing U.S. jobs report pointing to a delay in Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5%.
Helping the tone at the start of the week was the news that orders for German factory goods unexpectedly surged in July, climbing by 3.4% on the month, hitting a post-reunification high.
The release had been expected to fall 1.0% on the month, and while it was foreign orders that surged with domestic orders falling, it still pointed to a solid start to the second half in Europe's largest economy and major growth driver. 
Investors are also still digesting Friday’s U.S. payrolls report, which showed a much smaller increase in jobs than expected, likely delaying the timing of the tapering of the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program as the U.S. central bank gauges the impact on the economy of the growth of Covid-19 cases.
This also puts the focus on the European Central Bank, as the region’s central bank is expected to debate whether to scale back its stimulus at Thursday’s meeting.
Inflation in the euro area has surged to a 10-year high of 3%, prompting calls from the more hawkish members of the governing council for the bank to begin slowing its huge asset buying program. 
Corporate news is thin on the ground, particularly with the U.S. on holiday, but Spie (PA:SPIE) stock fell 3.6% after the French engineering group confirmed it has bid for Equans, the newly created services unit of French energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE). 
Crude prices traded sharply lower Monday after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top exporter, cut its prices for Asian buyers over the weekend, suggesting an uncertain demand outlook.
State oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) said on Sunday that it will cut October prices for all crude grades sold to Asia, the region that consumes the bulk of its oil, by at least $1 a barrel, significantly more than had been expected.
These concerns about demand, with Covid-19 cases still on the rise, came in the wake of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, confirming its intention last week to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply in October.
By 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $68.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $71.75.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar on Monday clawed back some of the losses sustained after last week's poor U.S. jobs report, helped by firmer U.S. Treasury yields in a big week for major central banks. 
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six rivals, edged 0.1% higher to 92.23, after dipping to 91.941 for the first time since Aug. 4 on Friday, when a closely watched U.S. labour report showed the world's largest economy created the fewest jobs in seven months in August.
But the weak jobs report did not spark a new wave of dollar selling on Monday as the greenback spent the Asian session pushing higher against its rivals, prompting some major currencies including the euro and the Australian dollar to move back to pre-Friday jobs report levels.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields firming to more than one-week highs also boosted the dollar. U.S. markets are shut for a holiday, contributing to lower volumes.
While analysts remain bearish on the outlook for the greenback with Citibank strategists expecting it to weaken in the coming months as the Fed postpones tapering plans to November, hedge funds have quietly ramped up bullish bets.
Latest data showed they have increased bets on the greenback versus the euro for a second consecutive week, boosting net bets to their highest since March 2020.
Most of the dollar's gains was focused on the Australian dollar which weakened 0.17% to $0.7435 ahead of a central bank decision on Tuesday where analysts remain divided on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will call time on its stimulus plans.
National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) predicts the central bank will reduce asset purchases again, ""although the optics of tapering amid protracted lockdowns means it is likely to be a close decision,"" NAB analyst Tapas Strickland wrote in a report.
The euro also failed to extend its gains on Monday after rising above the $1.19 levels for the first time since the end of July. It was trading 0.1% weaker at $1.1873 before an European Central Bank policy decision on Thursday.

Economists reckon it is still too early for the ECB to call time on emergency stimulus, but it could agree to slow the pace of its bond buys after euro area inflation surged to a 10-year high at 3% last week.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was about flat at $51,785.60, after earlier touching $51,920, a level not seen since May 12. Smaller rival ether traded little changed at $3,942.77 after topping $4,000 last week for the first time since mid-May.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2021 02:20AM ET</span>",Column: Hedge funds in historic double-down on higher U.S. yields - Jamie McGeever,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Not only are hedge funds ramping up their bets on a higher 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, they are doing so on a historic scale.
The latest move in Commodity Futures Trading Commission positions suggests speculators were undeterred by the market's reaction to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech, or were banking on a bumper August U.S. jobs report. 
Before Powell's Jackson Hole address the 10-year yield was 1.35%, and before Friday's non-farm payroll data - which showed a huge downside miss on job creation but a punchy spike in average earnings - it was 1.30%.
It closed U.S. trading bang in the middle of that narrow range at 1.325%. Clearly, the market lacks conviction to push it lower on the back of slowing growth, or lift it higher on any near-term inflation concerns.
The latest CFTC positioning data released late on Friday, however, suggest conviction among the fund and speculative trading community, at least, is strengthening. 
In the week to Tuesday, Aug. 31, funds and speculators flipped their position in 10-year futures to a net short 29,819 contracts from a net long 113,312 contracts the week before. 
This marks the first net short in eight weeks. But more significantly, the position shift of 143,131 contracts marked the biggest weekly swing against Treasuries in three years, and the seventh biggest ever.
Funds also accelerated their selling of 2-year Treasury futures, swelling their net short position to 20,750 contracts from 9,366 the week before. That is light positioning, historically, but still the heaviest bet on higher short-term yields for five weeks. 
Again though, this bet on rising short-term yields has yet to bear fruit, as the two-year yield drifted lower in that week to around 21 basis points.
The huge swing in favor of shorting the 10-year points and more modest short position in the two-year space suggests speculators continue to expect the yield curve to steepen. 
In recent weeks, at least, this has happened. The spread between two- and 10-year yields on Aug. 20 was around 100 basis points, and on Friday it was around 112. It steepened a sizeable 4 bps alone on Friday.
""Inflation concerns and a less hawkish Fed can push the curve steeper, and we continue to like 2s10s steepeners,"" Citi's rates strategy team wrote in a note on Friday. 
If hedge funds doubled down on their bearish view on Treasuries, they also strengthened their bullish on the dollar.
The value of funds' net long dollar position against a range of G10 and emerging currencies rose to $10.7 billion from $8.4 billion the week before. That marks the seventh consecutive week of net long positions, and the biggest since March last year just before the pandemic-triggered lurch to a 16-month bet against the dollar.
The refusal of yields to move higher, deteriorating U.S. economic data, renewed COVID-19 concerns and the Fed likely delaying its taper announcement have all weighed on the dollar. It has fallen steadily since hitting a nine-month high against a basket of currencies on Aug. 20, losing 2% in that time. 
But as Jonathan Peterson at Capital Economics points out, other developed countries also face slowing growth and rising number of cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant. This may force these central banks to tighten policy more gradually than investors expect. 

""This, combined with our view that inflationary pressures in the U.S. will remain stronger than in other major economies and more persistent than generally anticipated, continued to underpin our forecast for higher U.S. bond yields and a stronger dollar,"" he said. 
According to industry data provider Preqin, macro strategy hedge funds gained 0.06% in August, bringing year-to-date gains to 5.18%. They are significantly under-performing Preqin's broad hedge fund all strategies index, which rose 1.44% in August and is up 12.69% in the January-August period.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Refinitiv examines changes to key daily FX fixing window,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Refinitiv is considering a series of changes to its daily foreign exchange (FX) fixing, including lengthening the trading window used to calculate it, a senior company executive said, amid industry concerns over the global benchmark which used to value trillions of dollars of assets.
The 27-year-old WM/R benchmark, which is calculated by its owner Refinitiv, has a five-minute trading window, known as the ""fix"", at 4:00 p.m. in London each weekday when investors and banks flood the market with buy and sell orders.
The WM/R is by far the most popular benchmark and baked into contracts such as those used by U.S. fund managers wanting to buy European stocks, who would sell dollars and buy euros at exchange rates set at the fixing.
One concern among some asset managers, who move billions of dollars through the window, is that more nimble hedge funds can spot and trade off large transactions, leaving investors with worse exchange rates.
A European Central Bank-organised FX group said in April 2020 its members were concerned that concentrating end-of-month trading at particular FX fixings was ""likely to create additional volatility and pressure on market functioning"".
Unusual price swings at the fixing were reported during 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic raised currency market volatility, and most recently on July 27 when sterling suddenly surged alongside a spike in trading volumes.
""We are very focused on making sure (the benchmark) evolves, and aligns with changes in the market structure,"" Shirley Barrow, Global Head of Benchmarks and Indices at Refinitiv, said, adding that it was open to lengthening the window, but had not decided what was ""insufficiently wide"".
Beyond expanding the trading window, Barrow said other possible improvements include sourcing trading data from more than the current three platforms, Refinitiv Matching, EBS and Currenex, which could make prices more representative of the $6.6-trillion-a-day FX market.
Concerns about the fixing and whether investors were getting a good deal have existed for years but resurfaced during the pandemic, encouraging Refinitiv to assess its options.
Refinitiv began gathering data on the benchmark's performance and asking clients for feedback on potential changes last year, Barrow told Reuters.
This revealed that some users want the window widened to address concerns, including that computer-driven algorithmic traders are taking advantage of slower-moving asset managers.
By widening the window, large buy or sell orders should have less market impact as transactions can be spread out, making it harder for algorithms, or so-called algos, to track investor order flows.
However, some asset managers say the current system works well and that lengthening the window would solve little because when putting a large order through a defined period, there will always be a 'market impact' others can spot.
These managers say there are already measures the funds can take, such as not executing the whole order within a single window.
""You are going to have impact whether it's a 20-minute window or a five-minute window. There's a cost to trading,"" said Mike Eyre, Global Head of FX trading at asset management giant Vanguard. ""There are some orders where the best outcome is to take more time, to do the order over multiple days.""
Refinitiv will publish a white paper this month asking for more feedback on a list of possible improvements, Barrow said.
""Our focus is on getting that optimal, the size of the window versus still having our objective of a price at a specific point in time,"" she said.
Refinitiv is owned by the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) and is the largest customer of Reuters News.  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in the LSE.
The fix has become more important in recent years, with more currency trading coalescing around it, possibly as equity market turnover is concentrated towards the end of the trading day.
Some rivals have sought to capitalise on concerns and in April a benchmark called Siren was launched by Raidne, a company which provides analytics and trade surveillance.
This is calculated using an algorithm over a 20-minute window. Raidne says it will save users execution costs compared with ""the legacy 4 p.m. fix"", claiming the longer window and its algorithm can limit the adverse impact on prices that users get when they transact big orders.

Unlike stocks, currencies are traded across dozens of platforms, making the market highly fragmented. Hedge funds and high-frequency traders deploying so-called algos are particularly active on platforms that feed into WM/R.
Barrow said WM/R offered a series of regulated benchmarks that fix at different times, adding that investors who use the 4 p.m. window and are worried should ""consider other times"".

Investing.com -- European stock markets are expected to edge higher Monday, as investors digest a disappointing U.S. jobs report and the potential impact on Federal Reserve monetary policy as well as the global growth outlook.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
The lackluster start to trading in Europe on Monday, exacerbated by an U.S. public holiday, comes in the wake of the September U.S. payrolls report, which showed a much smaller increase in jobs than expected, but also a pick-up in wages.
The Federal Reserve has been looking for an improvement in employment numbers before starting to rein in its extraordinary monetary stimulus. This miss, with 235,000 jobs created compared with 750,000 expected, looks likely to delay the timing of the tapering of its bond-buying program as the central bank gauges the impact on the economy of the growth of Covid-19 cases.
This also puts the focus on the European Central Bank, as the region’s central bank is expected to debate whether to scale back its stimulus at Thursday’s meeting.
Inflation in the euro area has surged to a 10-year high of 3%, prompting calls from the more hawkish members of the governing council for the bank to begin slowing its huge asset buying program. 
That said, the region’s PMI data have shown confidence in the recovery slipping, and there will be concerns about the single currency rising strongly if the ECB was to begin tapering before the Fed, and the impact that would have on exports.
Crude prices traded sharply lower Monday after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top exporter, cut its prices for Asian buyers over the weekend, suggesting an uncertain demand outlook.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds remain keen on China, despite regulatory crackdowns, planning standalone investment strategies and piling into venture capital and real estate, according to data and analysts.
Investors in China have been shaken in recent weeks by a slew of regulations targeting sectors ranging from gaming to education https://www.reuters.com/article/china-regulation/factbox-from-tech-to-entertainment-chinas-season-of-regulatory-crackdown-idUSL1N2Q40KQ.
Sovereign wealth funds are not immune but, given their long-term investment outlook, they are not expected to pull back from a bet that China will provide the engine of global growth for years to come.
""Long-term investors like sovereign funds won't adjust their allocation to the second-largest economy down to zero overnight,"" said Winston Ma, former managing director of China Investment Corp, Beijing's own sovereign fund. ""Their strategic asset allocation cannot be that tactical.""
Norway's fund, the world's largest, has 4.5% of all investments in China and Hong Kong.
Singapore's Temasek Holdings in June bought 33 million American Depository Receipts in Didi Global Inc, before regulators announced a probe of the ride-hailing company that the city of Beijing is now considering taking under state control, according to a Bloomberg News report on Friday https://www.reuters.com/technology/beijing-city-looking-take-didi-under-state-control-bloomberg-news-2021-09-03.
Several funds have positions in giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, whose shares are down 30% year-to-date, and New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc, which has tumbled 88%.
Chinese companies have been caught in a pincer this year, with increasing U.S. scrutiny on one side and a domestic regulatory crackdown on the country's massive internet sector.
ONSHORE STRATEGIES
In a sign of recent wariness, sovereign funds pulled $2.35 billion from onshore China A-shares equity strategies managed by third-party fund managers in the second quarter, the most since at least 2017, showed eVestment data.
But that may prove temporary. Several were considering setting up standalone exposure to China within equities and fixed income, said Elliot Hentov, head of policy research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors (SSGA).
""The regulatory push has accelerated such considerations given that China policy is now running acyclically compared to other EM countries,"" he said.
Chinese equities should form a much larger chunk of global equity portfolios - potentially as much as 50% of the weighting in MSCI's emerging market index once A-shares are fully represented.
Next month, China will be added to the FTSE World Government Bond Index, setting it up for potential inflows of some $130 billion.

ESG RISK
Like other investors, sovereign funds have become used to political risks in China, with flare-ups between the United States and China weighing on equity markets in recent years.
Similarly, environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues have also undermined sentiment.
A recent Invesco survey highlighted that 45% of sovereign funds saw lack of ESG data as a challenge to investing.
""We believe this (regulatory action) could be positive for sovereign funds investing in China,"" said Rod Ringrow, Invesco's head of official institutions.
The regulatory crackdown was being waged to build a prosperous economy, fight against monopolies and protect workers, state-backed tabloid Global Times said last week https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-media-defends-wave-industry-regulation-says-reforms-west-stuck-silence-2021-09-02.
DEALS
There has also been a stepping up in deals within private markets, including property, specifically offices, logistics and rental housing, where Beijing has been wooing capital to help provide accommodation.
Sovereign funds closed 26 deals at a value of $2.8 billion year-to-date, compared with $4.9 billion via 28 deals across all of 2020, Global SWF data showed.
PitchBook data showed funds participated in a record 25 venture capital deals in China and Hong Kong year to date.
CBRE has already seen a more than threefold increase in property transaction volume from sovereign funds, reaching 10.6 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in 2020, up from 3 billion yuan in 2019.
""We expect more SWFs to increase their allocation to China, riding on confidence in its mid-to-long term economic growth trends like continued urbanisation and consumption growth,"" said Greg Hyland, CBRE's Asia Pacific head of capital markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - European investment manager Candriam said its total assets rose 7.1% to 150 billion euros ($177 billion) in the first six months of the year, boosted by net inflows into its environmental, social and governance-focused funds.
Demand to invest in ESG-related funds has surged over recent years as the world looks to move to a low-carbon economy in the fight against climate change, and as social issues such as diversity take on greater importance for investors.
Candriam, part of privately held insurance firm New York Life, said the gains meant it had hit its five-year asset growth target six months ahead of schedule, rising more than 50% since the goal was set in 2016.
""The main reason (for the growth) is the ESG trend,"" Candriam Chief Executive Naim Abou-Jaoude told Reuters. ""In 2021, 90% of the net sales came from ESG products,"" compared with 50%-60% over the previous three years.
""The trend is accelerating,"" he added, with some clients shifting out of vanilla actively managed funds to sustainable funds, and demand from private clients increasing.
Net inflows accounted for 4.2 billion euros of the 10 billion-euro half-year asset gain, with the balance from positive investment performance. Total assets at the end of December 2020 were 140 billion euros.
Of the inflows, 1.9 billion euros went into sustainable-focused global credit and high-yield funds, 1.1 billion went into equity funds, of which 600 million euros was sustainable equity, 800 million euros went into thematic funds and 400 million into absolute return.
Among the most in demand thematic funds during the period were the 1.9 billion-euro Oncology Impact Fund, with inflows of 180 million euros, and the 1.07 billion Climate Action Fund, with inflows of 250 million euros.
The Candriam Sustainable Medium Fund, which invests in both equities and bonds, took in 629 million euros.
Candriam assets dedicated to ESG investing now totalled 98 billion euros, with the majority of its European fund range classified as sustainable under the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), it said.

The approval is based on operators including Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd complying with airworthiness directives and additional flight crew training requirements, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement. 
Singapore grounded the 737 MAX in March 2019 following two fatal crashes. The approval for its return comes months after the model returned to service in the United States and Europe, and follows more recent lifting of grounding orders https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-allows-boeing-737-max-planes-fly-ending-an-over-2-year-ban-2021-08-26/#:~:text=NEW%20DELHI%2C%20Aug%2026%20(Reuters,travel%20market%20for%20the%20planemaker.&text=It%20has%20more%20than%20100%20of%20the%20planes%20on%20order in other countries, including Australia, Fiji, Japan, India and Malaysia. 
China is the biggest market in the region that has yet to approve the return of the 737 MAX, though Boeing last month conducted test flights in the country. 

Singapore Airlines has six of the planes and it plans to take delivery of another eight in the financial year ending March 31, 2022, the carrier said in a presentation in May.
Singapore Airlines said on Monday it would continue to work closely with CAAS and other relevant regulators in the coming weeks to meet the requirements to return its 737 MAX planes to service. Further details on its 737 MAX operations will be announced at a later date, the airline added.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, with a rally in Japanese stocks with the imminent resignation of the prime minister countered by Friday’s disappointing U.S. jobs report.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.83% by 9:53 PM ET (1:53 AM GMT), with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s planned resignation triggering hopes that his successor would better manage the country’s COVID-19 outbreak and increase spending.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.12%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.63%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia due to hand down its policy decision on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.52%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.43% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.68%, with the country releasing trade and inflation data later in the week.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China also plans further regulatory tightening in the e-commerce sector, and the People’s Government of Beijing Municipality proposed an investment in ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI).
Investors continue to recover from the shock of the latest U.S. jobs report. Non-farm payrolls were at 235,000, the smallest gains in seven months, while the unemployment rate was 5.2%, for August. The report could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to delay beginning asset tapering when it meets later in the month.
U.S. President Joe Biden could, however, make his decision on whether to re-nominate Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term within the week, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan will speak on Wednesday. U.S. markets are closed Monday for a holiday, thus there will be no Treasuries cash trading.
“It reinforces the delta variant impact on current economic conditions and therefore policymakers have to pivot and be agile,” K2 Asset Management head of research George Boubouras told Bloomberg.
“It reinforces that some form of stimulus will remain in the system for the foreseeable future.”
In Japan, there will be more upside with an “Abenomics variation” post-Suga, which will include more targeted fiscal stimulus and blended monetary policy, according to Boubouras.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank will hand down its policy decision on Thursday."

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to take a more proactive approach to determine what types of content violate its cloud service policies, such as rules against promoting violence, and enforce its removal, according to two sources, a move likely to renew debate about how much power tech companies should have to restrict free speech. 
Over the coming months, Amazon will expand the Trust & Safety team at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division and hire a small group of people to develop expertise and work with outside researchers to monitor for future threats, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.
It could turn Amazon, the leading cloud service provider worldwide with 40% market share according to research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT), into one of the world's most powerful arbiters of content allowed on the internet, experts say.
AWS does not plan to sift through the vast amounts of content that companies host on the cloud, but will aim to get ahead of future threats, such as emerging extremist groups whose content could make it onto the AWS cloud, the source added.
A day after publication of this story, an AWS spokesperson told Reuters that the news agency’s reporting ""is wrong,"" and added ""AWS Trust & Safety has no plans to change its policies or processes, and the team has always existed.""
A Reuters spokesperson said the news agency stands by its reporting.
Amazon made headlines in the Washington Post on Aug. 27 for shutting down a website hosted on AWS that featured propaganda from Islamic State that celebrated the suicide bombing that killed an estimated 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops in Kabul last Thursday. They did so after the news organization contacted Amazon, according to the Post.
The discussions of a more proactive approach to content come after Amazon kicked social media app Parler off its cloud service shortly after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot for permitting content promoting violence.
Amazon did not immediately comment ahead of the publication of the story on Thursday. After publication, an AWS spokesperson said later that day, ""AWS Trust & Safety works to protect AWS customers, partners, and internet users from bad actors attempting to use our services for abusive or illegal purposes. When AWS Trust & Safety is made aware of abusive or illegal behavior on AWS services, they act quickly to investigate and engage with customers to take appropriate actions.""
The spokesperson added that ""AWS Trust & Safety does not pre-review content hosted by our customers. As AWS continues to expand, we expect this team to continue to grow.""
Activists and human rights groups are increasingly holding not just websites and apps accountable for harmful content, but also the underlying tech infrastructure that enables those sites to operate, while political conservatives decry what they consider the curtailing of free speech.
AWS already prohibits its services from being used in a variety of ways, such as illegal or fraudulent activity, to incite or threaten violence or promote child sexual exploitation and abuse, according to its acceptable use policy.
Amazon investigates requests sent to the Trust & Safety team to verify their accuracy before contacting customers to remove content violating its policies or have a system to moderate content. If Amazon cannot reach an acceptable agreement with the customer, it may take down the website.
Amazon aims to develop an approach toward content issues that it and other cloud providers are more frequently confronting, such as determining when misinformation on a company's website reaches a scale that requires AWS action, the source said.
A job posting on Amazon’s jobs website advertising for a position to be the ""Global Head of Policy at AWS Trust & Safety,"" which was last seen by Reuters ahead of publication of this story on Thursday, was no longer available on the Amazon site on Friday.
The ad, which is still available on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/global-head-of-policy-aws-trust-safety-at-amazon-web-services-aws-2706375665, describes the new role as one who will ""identify policy gaps and propose scalable solutions,"" ""develop frameworks to assess risk and guide decision-making,"" and ""develop efficient issue escalation mechanisms.""
The LinkedIn ad also says the position will ""make clear recommendations to AWS leadership.""
The Amazon spokesperson said the job posting on Amazon’s website was temporarily removed from the Amazon website for editing and should not have been posted in its draft form.
AWS's offerings include cloud storage and virtual servers and counts major companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Capital One as clients, according to its website.
PROACTIVE MOVES
Better preparation against certain types of content could help Amazon avoid legal and public relations risk.
""If (Amazon) can get some of this stuff off proactively before it's discovered and becomes a big news story, there's value in avoiding that reputational damage,"" said Melissa Ryan, founder of CARD Strategies, a consulting firm that helps organizations understand extremism and online toxicity threats.
Cloud services such as AWS and other entities like domain registrars are considered the ""backbone of the internet,"" but have traditionally been politically neutral services, according to a 2019 report from Joan Donovan, a Harvard researcher who studies online extremism and disinformation campaigns.

But cloud services providers have removed content before, such as in the aftermath of the 2017 alt-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, helping to slow the organizing ability of alt-right groups, Donovan wrote.
""Most of these companies have understandably not wanted to get into content and not wanting to be the arbiter of thought,"" Ryan said. ""But when you're talking about hate and extremism, you have to take a stance.""

207,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2021 04:15PM ET</span>","Volkswagen CEO: smart cars, not e-cars, are 'gamechanger'","By Christoph Steitz and Jan Schwartz
MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) head Herbert Diess on Sunday said autonomous cars, not electric vehicles, were the ""real gamechanger"" for the auto industry, which is facing the end of combustion engines in Europe by 2035.
Diess' comments signal the pace at which the 62-year old tries to transform Europe's largest carmaker by basically saying that the shift towards battery-powered electric vehicles (EV), which still needs to be backed up by actual sales, was sealed.
""Autonomous driving is really going to change our industry like nothing else before,"" Diess said in Munich ahead of the official opening of the IAA (NYSE:IAA) car show, adding the shift towards electrified cars was ""kind of easy"" in comparison.
""The real gamechanger is software and autonomous driving.""
Diess spoke as environmental pressure on the auto sector is ramping up, with the European Commission in July proposing an effective ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.
On Friday, Greenpeace and German environmental NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) said they would take legal action against German carmakers, including Volkswagen, if they failed to step up their policies to tackle climate change.
Diess, who was confronted by Greenpeace activists before entering the venue on Sunday, is therefore not only aiming to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and turn Volkswagen into the world's largest seller of electric vehicles by 2025.
He also wants to make software services for autonomous cars a key pillar of the group's future business, which is why Volkswagen has bought into self-driving software startup Argo AI, a competitor to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo.
Traditional carmakers and tech firms have poured billions of dollars over the past decade to realise the vision of driverless cars, but robotaxis remain elusive due to technical and regulatory hurdles that require continued human presence.
Volkswagen expects 1.2 trillion euros ($1.43 trillion) of software enabled sales in the car sector by 2030, accounting for about a quarter of the global mobility market, which is expected to more than double to 5 trillion euros as a result.
""By 2030 ... about 85% of our business is cars, private cars, privately owned, shared rental cars. And about 15% of mobility should be shuttles, mobility as a service,"" Diess said.

This ties into the group's recent move to lead a consortium in an acquisition of car rental firm Europcar, a bet on potentially lucrative mobility services that still need to become reality.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany's biggest motor show, taking place in Munich this week, is no longer just about cars.
This year's IAA (NYSE:IAA) show, the first major motor industry event worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, wants to be about mobility in general, from bikes to e-scooters to cars.
""Climate-friendly engines, the digital connectivity of transport - that's what this fair is about,"" Hildegard Müller, president of industry association VDA, which organises the bi-annual show, said at a pre-event press conference last week. ""The goal of climate protection is guiding us.""
The show, which has shifted this year from Frankfurt to Munich and is themed ""Mobility of the Future"", is a far cry from its usual format showcasing the biggest and mightiest cars on the market. The pandemic and growing concern over climate change have cast an uncomfortable shadow over the event, already under pressure from waning attendance numbers in previous years - from 930,000 in 2015 to just 560,000 in 2019.
Indeed, many industry stalwarts have decided against showing up: Toyota, Jaguar's Land Rover, Stellantis - including its German brand Opel - and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), to name a few.
Yet, as construction workers scrambled on Sunday to put up remaining exhibition booths ahead of the official opening on Tuesday, cars were clearly still the dominant feature. A lone CANYON e-bike tent was distinctly outnumbered by far larger, glitzier carmaker stands from Mercedes-Benz, Audi, MINI and others.
Activists and environmental groups, too, point out that for all the talk of mobility and diversified transport, automakers still make the vast majority of their money from fossil-fuel emitting SUV sales.
""Adding 'mobility' to the event's name and pushing their e-models to the fore won't do the trick as long as they keep selling primarily gas-guzzling combustion engines,"" Marion Tiemann, transport expert for Greenpeace in Germany, said, branding the event a ""greenwashing bonanza"".

Environmental groups including Friends of the Earth Germany and Greenpeace plan a major demonstration on Saturday against the greenwashing of the auto industry and for a faster shift to sustainable mobility. Activist organisation Sand im Getriebe ('Sand in the Gears'), which smashed up 40 luxury vehicles at a dealership near Frankfurt before the last IAA in 2019, has promised ""mass civil disobedience"" at this year's event.
Up to 4,500 police will be on site during the show which ends next Sunday, the biggest police presence for an event in Munich in 20 years.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2021 03:05PM ET</span>",Israel to present COVID-19 booster shot data to FDA experts,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel this month will present data from an extensive rollout of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is weighing White House plans to begin a booster drive in the United States. 
Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, said the ministry had been asked by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to brief its advisors at a Sept. 17 meeting.
The virtual session will consider a third booster shot of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE vaccine, and may discuss others.
""We have been asked to come and present Israel's experience and our data so that we can truly help the whole world to learn,"" Alroy-Preis told Israeli Channel 12 TV news.
A week ago Israel began offering a Pfizer COVID-19 booster to people as young as 12 in a campaign that began in July among seniors. Israeli health officials said the drive has slowed a rise in severe illness caused by the Delta variant.
Officials have said the effectiveness of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine waned five months after administration, making a booster necessary. A third dose, they said, restored the level of protection of the second shot.

So far 2.6 million people out of a population of 9.3 million have received three doses of the Pfizer vaccine in Israel.
U.S. President Joe Biden had been expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on Sept. 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorisation for an additional dose.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that officials were likely to soon get the regulatory go-ahead to administer COVID-19 vaccine booster shots made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), although  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) booster could take a little longer.
Asked on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" about President Joe Biden's goal to give booster shots starting Sept. 20, Fauci said that ""in some respects"" that remained the plan.
But he said that while Pfizer-BioNTech has submitted the necessary data on booster shots to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Moderna has yet to complete the process. Fauci said he hopes to give both vaccines when boosters doses roll out, but if Moderna does not complete the process before Sept. 20, then Moderna boosters will be given later. 
Moderna and the FDA did not immediately return emails seeking comment. In a statement released Wednesday, Moderna said it had ""initiated its submission"" of booster data to the FDA.
How - or even whether - to administer boosters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fda-vaccine-advisers-face-thorny-question-are-covid-19-boosters-needed-2021-09-03 has emerged as a thorny issue as COVID-19 continues to kill unvaccinated people around the world https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi.
Last month the Biden administration announced it would start offering boosters to Americans by Sept. 20, usurping the process https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fda-vaccine-advisers-face-thorny-question-are-covid-19-boosters-needed-2021-09-03 by which the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually decide on such issues, current and former FDA scientists and CDC advisory panel members have told Reuters.
Scientists are still debating how much additional immunity boosters provide and whether all Americans should get another shot, rather than just those at high risk of severe illness.

Speaking Sunday, Fauci emphasized that both boosters were assumed to be safe, but that the FDA and other officials would study the data to make sure.
""When you're dealing with allowing the American public to receive an intervention, you want to make sure you're absolutely certain,"" he said.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Soaring demand for semiconductor chips means the auto industry could struggle to source enough of them throughout next year and into 2023, though the shortage should be less severe by then,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s CEO said on Sunday.
Carmakers, forced by the COVID-19 pandemic to shut down plants last year, face stiff competition from the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries, hit by a series of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.
Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.
""Several chip suppliers have been referring to structural problems with demand,"" Ola Källenius told reporters during a roundtable event ahead of the Munich IAA (NYSE:IAA) car show. ""This could influence 2022 and (the situation) may be more relaxed in 2023.""
The IAA show is the first major motor industry event worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said last week it expected significantly lower third-quarter sales at its Mercedes unit due to a global semiconductor shortage, becoming the latest in a string of automakers to take a hit to revenues. Automakers from U.S. group General Motors (NYSE:GM) to India's Mahindra and Japan's Toyota have slashed output and sales' forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs. 
Källenius said on Sunday that despite the ongoing chip shortage, the German carmaker hopes its own supply of semiconductors will improve in the fourth quarter. 
As part of its plans to electrify its model range, Mercedes-Benz will show off several fully electric vehicles at the show in Munich. These will include global premiers for the EQE, the first fully electric for the premium carmaker’s high-performance AMG brand and a concept car for its luxury Maybach brand. The company will also introduce a fully electric SUV, the EQB, to the European market. 
In July Daimler said it will spend more than 40 billion euros ($47.5 billion) by 2030 to take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in an all-electric market, but warned the shift in technology would lead to job cuts. 

Outlining its strategy for an electric future, the German carmaker said it will build eight battery plants as it ramps up electric vehicle (EV) production and from 2025 all new vehicle platforms will only make EVs.
Källenius said the company's plan to spin off its trucking unit Daimler Trucks by the end of 2021 remains on track. ($1 = 0.8416 euros)

Next Digital is owned by jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai and was the publisher of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that closed in June after its newsroom was raided by police officers investigating whether some articles breached a national security law introduced in Hong Kong by Beijing last year.
The company's assets were frozen as part of the national security investigation and its shares have been suspended from trading since June 17.
In a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Sunday, Next Digital said the best interests of shareholders, creditors, employees and other stakeholders will be served by an orderly liquidation. 
Ip Yut Kin had tendered his resignation as a non-executive director and chairman, while Louis Gordon Crovitz, Mark Lambert Clifford and Elic Lam have tendered their resignations as independent non-executive directors, the company said.
The company's CEO, who was arrested at the time of the raid related to the security law breach investigation, and its chief financial officer had resigned in July. 
Next Digital said it hoped the resignations of the remaining board members will result in liquidators being allowed by the Hong Kong government to authorize payments that directors were banned from approving, including for creditors and for former staff.
It also said it hoped that liquidators will be able to conclude value-creating transactions that would generate funds to benefit creditors.
The company said the Hong Kong government has never indicated which articles published by Apple Daily allegedly violated the national security law, and the uncertainty created a climate of fear, resulting in many resignations including those responsible for the regulatory compliance duties of the publicly traded company. 
""We observe that the events affecting the company and its people following the invocation of the National Security Law occurred despite there having been no trials and no convictions,"" it said. ""Under this new law, a company can be forced into liquidation without the involvement of the courts.""
""As Apple Daily often observed, Hong Kong people have a collective memory of what life was like elsewhere when freedom of speech was denied: No other rights are safe,"" it said.

Critics of the national security law, introduced in June 2020, say it has been used to muzzle dissent and erode fundamental freedoms, including those of the media, in the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Authorities have denied the erosion of rights and freedoms, including the media, in Hong Kong, but said acts that endangered China's national security crossed a red line. Security officials have said law enforcement actions are based on evidence and have nothing to do with an individual's background or profession.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong late-summer back-to-school sales could provide U.S. retailers some needed momentum after many sector shares lagged the broader market in recent months.
The S&P 500 retailing index, which includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , is up just about 2% for the quarter so far, compared with a 6% gain in the S&P 500.
Some retailers, including Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, cited upbeat back-to-school data recently as they increased annual U.S. sales forecasts, but further sales data and the U.S. August retail report are expected later this month.
With the help of advance child tax credits and stimulus checks related to the pandemic, some consumers have had extra cash to load up on backpacks and other supplies.
Most U.S. schools are returning this year to in-class instruction after months of remote learning. New York City's public schools reopen Sept. 13, and many New York metro area schools begin in the days after the Labor Day weekend, when parents typically continue to pick up school supplies.
Retail shares along with some other value-related sectors tied to the economy have underperformed growth sectors in recent months, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), in New York. The S&P value index is up about 2% for the quarter, while the growth index is up more than 8%.
But that trend is likely to change, and retail is among the groups that will ""catch a second wind here and run through the end of the year ... into the beginning of next year,"" he said.
Holiday sales and back-to-school sales have a strong correlation, he noted.
Investors have been optimistic about back-to-school sales given the comparisons with last year, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""I don't think there's any question that back-to-school is going to be far stronger than last year,"" he said.
""That's been somewhat factored into expectations,"" he said, noting that retail stocks are still higher than six months ago.
Also, supply chain issues could be a drag for some retailers, said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.
""Our operating assumption is that it doesn't get worse. ... They are working hard on the supply chain to get products on the shelf,"" he said.
Shares of some bigger retailers have outperformed, so investors may need to look for bargains, Kuby said.
""We haven't sold any (retail shares) ... but our favorite pick in the retail area is  Target , and that's a great stock but it's not inexpensive,"" he said.
Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) shares are up about 39% for the year to date, compared with about a 14% gain in the S&P 500 retailing index over that same period.

Shares of products-related companies might have more room to run, Kuby said, such as ACCO Brands (NYSE:ACCO) Corp, which his firm owns.
""Investors' attention will pivot more to holiday sales,"" he said. ""That's where focus is going to be.""

(Reuters) - Three large U.S. drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will proceed with a proposed $26 billion settlement resolving claims that they fueled the opioid epidemic after ""enough"" states joined in, the companies said on Saturday.
The companies had until Saturday to decide whether enough states back the $21 billion proposed settlement with McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and a $5 billion agreement with J&J.
The distributors said 42 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., signed on to their agreement. 
Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Washington, West Virginia are not participating in the settlement, a person familiar with the matter said. New Hampshire agreed to settle only with the distributors, while Rhode Island joined only J&J’s deal, the person said.
The companies will make their first annual settlement payment into escrow on or before Sept. 30, the distributors said. The final amount will depend on several factors, including the final participation rate of states and political subdivisions, they added.
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead settlement negotiator, called the support level a ""remarkable showing of unity and commitment across the country to address this problem.""
The settlement's complex formula envisioned at least 44 states participating, but ultimately the companies got to decide whether a ""critical mass"" had joined and whether to finalize the deal.
Cities and counties within participating states have through Jan. 2 to join as well. Ultimately, $10.7 billion is tied to the extent localities participate.
The deal, unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21, is designed to resolve more than 3,000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction.
The money would fund treatment and other services.

The companies deny wrongdoing, saying the drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with doctors, regulators and others.
The deal is separate from a settlement resolving similar claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners. A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved that deal, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's federal health regulator Anvisa on Saturday suspended the use of over 12 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd that were produced in an unauthorized plant, it said in a statement.
Anvisa said it was alerted on Friday by Sao Paulo's Butantan institute, a biomedical center that has partnered with Sinovac to locally fill and finish the vaccines, that 25 batches, or 12.1 million doses, sent to Brazil had been made in the plant.
""The manufacturing unit ... was not inspected and was not approved by Anvisa in the authorization of emergency use of the mentioned vaccine,"" the regulator said. The ban was ""a precautionary measure to avoid exposing the population to possible imminent risk,"" it added.
Butantan also told Anvisa that another 17 batches, totaling 9 million doses, had been produced in the same plant, and were on their way to Brazil, the regulator said. 
During the 90-day ban, Anvisa will seek to inspect the plant, and find out more about the security of the manufacturing process, it said.

During Brazil's vaccine rollout earlier this year, the vast majority of administered vaccines were from Sinovac. More shots from other manufacturers have since come online.
Brazil on Saturday reported 21,804 new coronavirus cases, and 692 COVID-19 deaths.

""There is no divorce. On the contrary, we have been discussing it for a few months. Bernard Arnault continues to believe in the future of the Lagardere group, in its ability to bounce back, and in its strategy,"" Lagardere said in an interview with weekly Le Journal du Dimanche, which he owns.

Arnault came to Lagardere's rescue in May 2020 with an investment to help fight off an activist fund and mop up personal debts.
Last week Arnault restructured his holding in the media and publishing group, however, becoming a straightforward shareholder with a 10% stake rather than an investor in Lagardere's personal holding company.

Lagardere told the weekly that the scope of the Lagardere group would remain ""intact"".

The FAA confirmed on July 12 that some undelivered Boeing 787s have a new manufacturing quality issue the company needs to fix before shipment.
Airlines pay most of the purchase price upon delivery.
Boeing met with FAA on Aug. 2 to persuade the agency to approve an inspection method that would speed deliveries with targeted checks rather than nose-to-tail teardowns, the newspaper said.
The regulators flagged internal company disagreements over the aircraft sample size, and repeated that Boeing's employee group that acts as an in-house regulator needs to concur with the company's proposals, the report added. 
An FAA spokesman said the agency continues to engage with Boeing and will not sign off on the inspections ""until our safety experts are satisfied.""

Boeing's 737 MAX and 787 have been afflicted by electrical defects and other issues since late last year, and it only resumed deliveries of the 787 in March after a five-month hiatus.
A Boeing spokesperson said the company was committed to providing full transparency with regulators and working with the FAA through the rigorous process to resume 787 deliveries.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2021 05:05PM ET</span>","U.S. companies lash out at Texas law changes, including abortion ban","By Tina Bellon and Jessica DiNapoli
AUSTIN, Texas/NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. companies including  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and Silicon Laboratories (NASDAQ:SLAB) Inc voiced their displeasure on Friday at new Texas laws on abortion, handguns, and voting limitations, a fresh sign of increased efforts by some firms to signal their commitment to social responsibility.
Lyft and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc said they will cover all legal fees for the ride-hail companies' drivers sued under a law that puts in place a near-total ban on abortion.
Lyft will also donate $1 million to women's health provider Planned Parenthood, chief executive Logan Green said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/logangreen/status/1433872421254098945?s=20.
""This is an attack on women's access to healthcare and on their right to choose,"" Green said of the new Texas law.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted https://twitter.com/dkhos/status/1433894081487273987?s=20 in response to Green's announcement that his company would cover drivers' legal fees in the same way, thanking Green for taking the initiative.
The ban https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-declines-block-texas-abortion-ban-2021-09-02, which took effect Wednesday, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks. This potentially includes drivers who unknowingly take women to clinics for abortion procedures.
On Wednesday, Tinder-owner Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s CEO and rival dating platform Bumble Inc said they were setting up funds to help Texas-based employees seeking abortion care outside the state.
Website hosting service GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) Inc on Friday, meanwhile, shut down a Texas anti-abortion website that allowed people to report suspected abortions.
The reaction to the law change in Texas comes at a time when many companies are seeking to burnish their corporate and environmental governance credentials with consumers.
Companies also reacted to the Texas legislature this week passing the final version of a bill that outlaws drive-through and 24-hour voting locations and gives poll watchers more power, widely seen as restricting voting access.
""We hoped for a different outcome for this legislation, and we're disappointed by this result,"" an American Airlines spokesperson said in an email.
A spokesperson for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co, based in Texas, said, ""As a global company of 60,000 team members, HPE encourages our team members to engage in the political process where they live and work and make their voices heard through advocacy and at the voting booth.""

Meanwhile, a law allowing people to carry concealed handguns without any permit went into effect in Texas on Wednesday.
""Looking at the abortion law, or the gun law, or the voting law, it's a form of vigilante justice, where you're empowering individuals to enforce the law,"" said Tyson Tuttle, the CEO of Austin-based Silicon Laboratories. ""It's been a rough week in Texas and a harbinger of what's to come across the country.""

221,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Investors grow wary as stocks hit new highs,"(In Sept. 3 story, corrects S&P 500 year-to-date gain to 21% instead of 20.4%, paragraph 8)
By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are girding their portfolios for potential stock market volatility, even as equities hover near fresh highs after logging seven straight months of gains.
Utilities are the S&P 500's best-performing sector so far this quarter with a 10.2% gain. They have been followed by other popular destinations for nervous investors, including real estate and healthcare.
In derivatives markets, the gap in price between the front month Cboe Volatility Index futures contract and the VIX index itself is higher than it has been about 85% of the time over the last five years. This suggests some investors expect the calm in stocks to give way to more pronounced price swings in the coming weeks and months. 
Meanwhile, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc - viewed as havens during uncertain times - have outperformed most G10 currencies this quarter. 
""It's been a year of positive market returns, but it's a bull market which has pretty defensive undertones,"" said Saira Malik, head of global equities at money manager Nuveen Investments.
The demand for downside protection illustrates a conundrum that has bedeviled investors at various times during the market's post-pandemic surge. 
Ultra-low yields on fixed income have left few alternatives to equities, and betting against stocks has been a disastrous strategy in the last year-and-a-half. 
Stocks demonstrated their resilience on Friday, when the S&P appeared to shrug off a big miss on August U.S. employment data, as some market participants bet a weaker economy could undercut the case for the Federal Reserve to unwind its market-supportive easy money policies in coming months. The benchmark index is up nearly 21% this year.
At the same time, many have grown antsy in a market that has gone 292 calendar days without a decline of 5% or more, nearly three times the average since World War II, according to data from CFRA's Sam Stovall. Rising valuations, ebbing economic growth and signs of speculative excess have only added to their concerns.
""It's been a wonderful ride for U.S. equities ... but moving forward we think it is going to be a little bit of a different picture,"" said David Grecsek, managing director in investment strategy and research and partner at Aspiriant, which manages about $14.5 billion.
Concerns over equity valuations have prompted Grecsek to take profits in some of his equity positions and shift some money into non-U.S. stocks, including emerging markets.
The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio on a forward 12-month basis stands at 21.3, a 35% premium to its 20-year average, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Investors next week will be keeping an eye on quarterly results from video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), whose wild ride this year put a spotlight on retail investors' mania for so-called meme stocks that some say is one sign of irrational exuberance in markets.
On the macro front, next week's U.S. August producer price index data could provide some clues on how inflation is shaping up after July showed the largest annual increase in over a decade.
With the Delta variant of the coronavirus continuing hindering growth, ""a lot of investors are seeing maybe some headwinds and positioning more defensively,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in the past week cut their view on third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product to a gain of 2.9%, from a 6.5% increase.
Some of the flows into defensive sectors may have more to do with investors hunting for yield rather than worries over an impending market crash.
The S&P 500 Utilities index sports a yield of about 3%, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note stood at around 1.33% on Friday. 
""The wall of worry does loom on the horizon ... but the main reason defensive (stocks) are holding up relatively well is because of the income stream attached to them,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

Sandven, Nuveen's Malik and Baird's Mayfield all remain bullish on stocks, despite the market's defensive undertone. 
History may be on their side: the S&P has held on to a double-digit annual gain in eight of the last 10 years that it rose by 20% or more in the period from January through August, as it has in 2021, according to a report from BofA Global Research. The exceptions were 1929 and 1987, which were both marked by historic market crashes.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",Why Hurricane Ida crippled the New Orleans power grid,"By Tim McLaughlin and Stephanie Kelly
(Reuters) - Hurricane Ida's 150-mph winds crippled a Louisiana electric grid already vulnerable from aging transmission lines, electricity bottlenecks and $2 billion worth of damage caused by three hurricanes that hit last year.
Ida’s landfall on Sunday left a wake of destruction and suffering. More than 1 million customers were without electricity immediately after the storm - a hardship that, for some, could last weeks.
 Entergy Corp  (NYSE:ETR), the largest Louisiana utility, is facing tough questions on whether it had done enough to harden the electric system, which lost eight major transmission lines delivering power to the New Orleans metropolitan area.
Entergy was in the midst of upgrades throughout its system after Hurricane Laura in 2020. From 2017 to 2019, Entergy's Louisiana subsidiary spent about $1.2 billion on numerous projects to improve its transmission system.
A pivotal question now for Entergy and its consumers is how well those capital improvements survived the hurricane’s wrath compared to the company's older infrastructure. Entergy declined to detail the age of the eight New Orleans-area transmission lines that failed.
“The reason the lights are out is not because we aren’t building a resilient system,” said Rod West, Entergy’s group president of utility operations. “The lights are out because Mother Nature is still the undisputed, undefeated heavyweight champion of the world.""
Hurricane Laura in southwest Louisiana highlighted how Entergy operates a transmission network with two different design standards for resisting wind damage. Transmission lines and infrastructure built in recent years are rated to withstand 140-mph winds, and in some cases up to 150 mph gusts, according to Entergy disclosures with Louisiana utility regulators.
But large sections of Entergy’s Louisiana network were designed to withstand wind speeds far below what Ida delivered. About one-sixth of Entergy Louisiana's transmission system, covering about 900 miles, consists of 69-kilovolt lines, the majority of which are only rated at 95 mph, according to Entergy disclosures to regulators.
The 1970s-era design standard, which was used in building part of the network that feeds New Orleans, is a holdover from when Gulf States Utilities operated the transmission system, according to Entergy disclosures to Louisiana regulators. 
Many structures on the legacy system were destroyed last year during Hurricane Laura, according to testimony submitted by Entergy executives this year to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The company has asked regulators to approve more than $500 million to repair and rebuild damaged transmission lines from 2020 hurricanes, a cost that would be shouldered by ratepayers in their monthly electric bills.
Three years after Entergy merged with Gulf States in 1994, the company implemented a more robust design for the transmission network that met or exceeded the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) standard. But the network still includes lines built to the older, lower standard because they complied with NESC codes at the time they were constructed.
That leaves the network more vulnerable to outages, said Praveen Malhotra, an engineer and expert on catastrophe risk who has studied hurricane effects on transmission systems.
“The whole system is only as strong as the weakest link,” Malhotra said. 
Entergy said in a statement that much of the damage from Ida was related to the high winds, causing several lines to become detached from their structures. The eight transmission tie lines that were rendered inoperable are vital because they connect the integrated transmission system in the greater New Orleans area to the larger national grid.
MORE POWERFUL STORMS
Just weeks before Ida hit, Entergy and construction firm Burns & McDonnell began rolling out helicopters and swamp equipment to rebuild and upgrade an old 16-mile transmission line that delivers electricity from the Waterford 3 nuclear reactor in Killona, La. to a substation on the outskirts of New Orleans. As of Friday, the transmission line was disconnected from the grid and the Waterford plant was listed as producing no power, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission website. 
It’s the second time in a year the $52 million transmission line upgrade has been foiled by a hurricane. When Hurricane Laura hit in August 2020, Entergy and Burns & McDonnell pulled crews off the upgrade job so they could work on restoring power to more than 200 transmission lines damaged by the storm. They also moved transmission towers slated for the Waterford line to areas damaged by Laura, according to a July 13 Burns & McDonnell news release touting the re-start of the project upgrade. 
When Ida made landfall, Entergy was in the midst of spending $86 million in Lafourche Parish, which includes Port Fourchon, to rebuild a line originally constructed in 1964. That project was due to be completed next year, according to Entergy’s website. 
Hurricane Laura, which hit the Lake Charles area in southwest Louisiana, mostly damaged Entergy’s weaker legacy infrastructure. Michelle Bourg, an Entergy vice president, said in testimony submitted to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April that legacy systems were damaged or destroyed by that storm while more modern work was ""largely unaffected"" by Laura.
The failures of older lines still left the city of Lake Charles without power for 13 days. 
Some customers affected by Ida could be without power for a similar period or longer, particularly in outlying areas. When Ida struck, Jim King, 75, was one of the only people in Grand Isle, a small beach community where most homes are built on stilts at least 15 feet high. He said he expects to be without power for months.
The total number of homes and businesses without power in the state fell to about 823,000 on Friday, after Entergy said it had restored service to about 225,000 customers. Entergy estimated Friday that most communities should have power restored by Sept. 8.
In the wake of the destruction, utility companies are under intense pressure and scrutiny to repair lines and infrastructure quickly to avoid prolonged suffering by their residential and business customers. 
The company ""is required to expend large sums very quickly,"" Entergy Louisiana LLC Chief Executive Phillip May said in recent testimony to regulators, adding that the company has to also worry about its liquidity and credit rating as it issues more debt to fund restoration. 
EXTREME STORM 
The challenge for Entergy in the New Orleans area is circumventing multiple bodies of water that limit the corridor for more transmission lines that could take on power distribution in the wake of another powerful storm. Lake Pontchartrain is to the north; the Gulf of Mexico lies to the east; and the Mississippi River meanders through the city.
Logan Burke, executive director of nonprofit Alliance for Affordable Energy in New Orleans, said Entergy is trying to solve the city’s transmission problem by building more generation capacity in the area. But the company is not doing enough, she said, to relieve the electricity bottleneck leading into greater New Orleans.
New Orleans' dense population and surrounding bodies of water provide a limited number of transmission line corridors. Without sufficient capacity, the transmission lines cannot deliver all the available power generated outside the city. Part of Entergy's solution has been to build generation capacity that is physically within the New Orleans area while rebuilding and redesigning sections of the transmission network.
Louisiana has access, through Entergy, to multiple nuclear plants, said Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute, adding that New Orleans partially receives power from a nuclear facility in Arkansas. ""But if you can't get power to the city then it doesn't matter.""
In the meantime, severe weather events are becoming more frequent. Experts at ICF, a global consulting firm based in Virginia, estimate that U.S. utilities will have to spend $500 billion to address vulnerabilities from more frequent and severe weather patterns caused by climate change. ICF said in a recent report that the U.S. experienced 119 billion-dollar disasters in the 2010s, compared with 111 total from the previous two decades. 

That's a problem for companies still dealing with legacy systems that date to the 1950s and 1960s.
“My sense is this hurricane had extreme conditions even by extreme hurricane standards,"" said Larry Gasteiger, executive director of WIRES, a trade group that advocates for investment in needed transmission. ""You may not be able to build a system that can withstand absolutely anything.""

The agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had in July issued a so-called show cause notice to Flipkart, its founders and some investors asking them to explain why they should not face a penalty of $1.35 billion for alleged violation of foreign investment laws between 2009 and 2015, Reuters reported last month.
Court records and media reports on Saturday showed Sachin Bansal has urged a state court in the southern state of Tamil Nadu to quash the agency's notice, arguing that it was issued after an inordinate delay.
The judge in the case, R Mahadevan, heard the matter on Friday and asked the Enforcement Agency to file a response, reports said.
Sachin Bansal, the Enforcement Directorate and Flipkart did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Flipkart has previously said it was ""in compliance with Indian laws and regulations"" and would cooperate with authorities.
The Enforcement Directorate has been investigating e-commerce giants Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for years for allegedly bypassing foreign investment laws that strictly regulate multi-brand retail and restrict such companies to operating a marketplace for sellers.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) took a majority stake in Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018, its biggest deal ever. Sachin Bansal sold his stake to Walmart at that time, while the other co-founder, Binny Bansal, retained a small stake. 

The case concerned an investigation into allegations that Flipkart attracted foreign investment and a related party, WS Retail, then sold goods to consumers on its shopping website, which was prohibited under the law, Reuters has reported. 
In February, a Reuters investigation based on Amazon documents showed it had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers, publicly misrepresented ties with them and used them to bypass Indian law. Amazon says it gives no preferential treatment to any seller.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai-based Saudi state-owned media companies will start moving staff this month to the capital Riyadh, sources said, as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presses ahead with plans to remould the kingdom as a regional business hub.
The move follows a Saudi government decision earlier this year to stop giving state contracts to companies and commercial institutions that base their Middle East headquarters in any other country in the region. 
State-owned Al-Arabiya and Al Hadath TV channels informed their employees this week about plans to start broadcasting 12 hours a day from Riyadh by next January, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
They added that it could take up to two years to complete the relocation. 
MBC Group, the Middle East's largest media company, and Asharq News, a newly created television news channel, have also internally discussed plans to move to Riyadh, the sources said.
The Saudi government took ownership of a majority stake in MBC Group when authorities acted to seize assets from those caught up in an anti-corruption investigation in 2018.
MBC, Arabiya and Hadath are based in Dubai Media City, the United Arab Emirates' media hub that hosts hundreds of media companies and most of their Middle East headquarters. Asharq News is based in Riyadh but has a large hub in Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).
Arabiya and Hadath did not respond to requests for comment. 
MBC said in a statement sent to Reuters that back in February 2020 the MBC Group chairman publicly announced the intention to establish a new headquarters in Riyadh which would involve creating a business and production hub. 
""Our plans are on track,"" the statement said.
Asharq News, owned by Saudi Research and Marketing Group, said that since its inception Riyadh was the main hub for the network operations, with regional offices, including in Dubai.
""Back in February 2020, the company that owns Asharq ... signed an agreement to be a part of the intended Media City/Creative Zone in Riyadh,"" it added. 
Bloomberg reported about the media companies' relocation plans earlier this week.

Despite being close allies, Saudi Arabia and the neighbouring UAE are competing to attract investors and businesses as they both pursue plans to diversify their economies in a post-oil era.
Their national interests have diverged increasingly over the past few years, as well as their views on regional issues such as in their relations with Israel and Turkey.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>",Victim of Tesla crash in Texas had alcohol level exceeding legal limit,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - One of the two victims of a fatal crash involving a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) car in Texas had a blood-alcohol level that exceeded the legal driving limit, according to an autopsy report. 
No one was found in the driver's seat in the April accident where a Model S caught fire after hitting a tree, killing the two people in the car, according to the police at the time.
William Varner, who was found in the back left passenger seat, had 0.151 g/100mL of ethanol - grain alcohol - detected in his blood after his death, according to the report by Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.
The legal blood alcohol level for driving in Texas is 0.08%. 
The cause of Varner's death was ""blunt force trauma and thermal injuries with smoke inhalation,"" the report said.
The police declined to comment on the report, saying the investigation is still under way.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened 33 investigations into Tesla crashes involving 11 deaths since 2016 in which advanced driver assistance systems are suspected of being used, including the Texas crash. 

A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board, which is also probing the Texas crash, said testing showed that the vehicle's automated steering system was ""not available"" on the road where the accident occurred but the car's cruise-control function could still have been in operation.
Tesla markets its advanced driver assistant system as ""Full Self-Driving"" capability, but says that those features do not make the vehicle autonomous and require active driver supervision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating a July 26 fatal crash in New York involving a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle that might have been using an advanced driver assistance system, they disclosed on Friday.
New York City police confirmed on Friday an ongoing investigation into the July 26 death of a 52-year-old man attempting to fix a flat tire on his vehicle on the Long Island Expressway when he was struck by a Tesla.
A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday the agency was aware of the ""July 26 incident involving a Tesla vehicle on the Long Island Expressway in New York, and has launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash.""
NHTSA's probe into the New York crash was first reported by Reuters.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. investigations come amid increased scrutiny of Tesla's Autopilot and other driver assistance systems. Tesla's Autopilot handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods.
Last month, NHTSA said it opened a formal safety probe into Autopilot after 11 crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
On Wednesday, NHTSA identified a 12th crash involving a Tesla vehicle using an advanced driver assistance system that struck an emergency vehicle in Orlando, Florida.

On Friday, NHTSA released an updated list of special crash investigation crashes that it is reviewing, in which advanced driver assistance systems are suspected of being used including the New York crash involving a 2021 Tesla Model Y as well as a crash in Florida.
NHTSA has opened 33 investigations into Tesla crashes involving 11 deaths since 2016, in which use of advanced driver assistance systems was suspected. NHTSA has ruled out Autopilot use in three of those non-fatal crashes.

On the other hand, Flora Growth (FLGC) is expanding its business through distribution partnerships and joint ventures. Which cannabis stock is the better buy right now?.Canadian cannabis stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in 2021. That’s because these stocks carry significant risks, given that a majority of them are grappling with massive losses with a high cash burn rate.
Canada legalized marijuana at the federal level back in October 2018 but demand remained subdued due to the slow rollout of retail stores in major provinces. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues which meant pot stocks have grossly underperformed the broader markets since the start of 2019.
However, as the demand environment normalizes and companies improve their cost structures, it might be time to look at this beaten-down sector once again. Here, we compare two Canadian cannabis companies, Sundial Growers (SNDL) and Flora Growth (FLGC), to see which is a better investment right now.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 06:50PM ET</span>",Tech drives Nasdaq to record finish but Wall Street mixed on jobs report,"By David French
(Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended Friday at a new peak but the other main Wall Street indexes fell, reflecting the mixed sentiment stemming from a disappointing U.S. jobs report which raised fears about the pace of economic recovery but weakened the argument for near-term tapering.
On the final day of trading before the Labor Day weekend, both the S&P 500 and Dow benchmark posted marginal declines, tempering the former's positive weekly performance and extending the latter's run of losses to four in the last five sessions.
For the Nasdaq though, registering a fifth win in the last six sessions and a weekly gain of 1.6%, investors' support of heavyweight technology stocks - which tend to perform better in a low interest-rate environment - continues to drive it higher.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all rose between 0.3% and 0.4%.
""Tech has become bullet-proof,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners.
""It's the anti-COVID sector, where you want to be if you think COVID or a lack of growth is going to be an issue.""
The virus, and its impact on the pace of economic recovery, was evident in the Labor Department's closely-watched report which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 jobs in August, widely missing economists' estimate of 750,000. Payrolls had surged 1.05 million in July.
""The number's a big disappointment and it's clear the Delta variant had a negative impact on the labor economy this summer,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston.
""You can tell because leisure and hospitality didn't add any jobs and retail actually lost jobs. Investors will conclude that perhaps this will put the (Federal Reserve) further on hold in terms of the timing of tapering. Markets may be okay with that.""
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had scaled all-time highs over the past few weeks on support from robust corporate earnings, but investors have remained generally cautious as they watch economic indicators and the jump in U.S. infections to see how that might influence the Fed and its tapering plans.
The labor market remains the key touchstone for the Fed, with Chair Jerome Powell hinting last week that reaching full employment was a pre-requisite for the central bank to start paring back its asset purchases.
Among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 were cruise ship operators, whose businesses are highly susceptible to consumer sentiment around travel and COVID-19. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises all fell between 3.4% and 4.4%.
A majority of the 11 S&P sectors closed down, with the utilities index the worst performer at 0.8% lower. Economically-sensitive manufacturing and industrials slipped 0.7% and 0.6% respectively.
Banking stocks, which generally perform better when bond yields are higher, dropped 0.4% even as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped following the report. [US/]
""I get the overall market reaction, because it feels a little bit like pricing in a potential policy error from the Fed, but I don't understand some of the sectors' reactions today,"" said Boston Partners' Mullaney. 
Despite a Labor report number well outside the consensus estimate, the overall reaction of investors was muted, continuing a trend over the last year of a decoupling of significant S&P movement in the wake of a wide miss on the payrolls report.
The S&P 500 lost 1.52 points, or 0.03%, to 4,535.43 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.73 points, or 0.21%, to 35,369.09. The Nasdaq Composite added 32.34 points, or 0.21%, to 15,363.52.
For the week, the S&P rose 0.6% and the Dow dipped 0.2%.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.37 billion shares, compared with the 8.99 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 123 new highs and 21 new lows.

(Reuters) -A U.S. federal judge ruled on Friday that Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp may conduct excavation work at its Thacker Pass lithium mine site in Nevada, denying a request from Native Americans who said the digging would desecrate an area they believe holds ancestral bones and artifacts.
The ruling from Chief Judge Miranda Du was the second victory in recent weeks for the project, which could become the largest U.S. source of lithium, used in electric vehicle batteries. 
The court is still considering the broader question of whether former President Donald Trump's administration erred when it approved the project in January. That ruling is expected by early 2022. 
Du said the Native Americans did not prove the U.S. government failed to properly consult them during the permitting process. Du in July denied a similar request from environmentalists.
Du said, though, that she was not dismissing all the Native Americans' arguments, but felt bound by existing laws to deny their request.
""This order does not resolve the merits of the tribes' claims,"" Du said in her 22-page ruling.
Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said it would protect and preserve tribal artifacts. 
""We've always been committed to doing this the right way by respecting our neighbors, and we are pleased today's ruling recognizes our efforts,"" Lithium Americas Chief Executive Jon Evans told Reuters.
No digging can take place until the U.S. Bureau of Land Management issues an Archeological Resources Protection Act permit. 
The Burns Paiute Tribe, one of the tribes that brought the lawsuit, noted that the bureau told the court last month that the land holds cultural value for Native Americans. 

""If that's the case, well then there's going to be harm if you start digging into the landscape,"" said Richard Eichstaedt, an attorney for the Burns Paiute.
Representatives for the bureau and two other tribes who sued were not immediately available to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has temporarily locked down an unspecified number of Afghan government email accounts, according to a person familiar with the matter, as fears grow over the digital paper trail left by former officials and their international partners.
In the weeks since the Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan from a U.S.-backed government, reports have highlighted how biometric https://theintercept.com/2021/08/17/afghanistan-taliban-military-biometrics and Afghan payroll https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points databases might be exploited by the new rulers to hunt their enemies.
In a statement on Friday, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google stopped short of confirming that Afghan government accounts were being locked down, saying that the company was monitoring the situation in Afghanistan and ""taking temporary actions to secure relevant accounts.""
One employee of the former government has told Reuters the Taliban are seeking to acquire former officials' emails. 
Late last month the employee said that the Taliban had asked him to preserve the data held on the servers of the ministry he used to work for.
""If I do so, then they will get access to the data and official communications of the previous ministry leadership,"" the employee said. 
The employee said he did not comply and has since gone into hiding. Reuters is not identifying the man or his former ministry out of concern for his safety. 
Publicly available mail exchanger records show that some two dozen Afghan government bodies used Google's servers to handle official emails, including the ministries of finance, industry, higher education, and mines. Afghanistan's office of presidential protocol also used Google, according to the records, as did some local government bodies.
Commandeering government databases and emails could provide information about employees of the former administration, ex-ministers, government contractors, tribal allies and foreign partners.
""It would give a real wealth of information,"" said Chad Anderson, a security researcher with internet intelligence firm DomainTools who helped Reuters identify which ministries ran which email platform. ""Just even having an employee list on a Google Sheet is a big problem,"" he said, citing reports of reprisals against government workers. 
Mail exchanger records show that  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s email services were also used by several Afghan government agencies, including the ministry of foreign affairs and the presidency. But it isn't clear what steps, if any, the software firm is taking to prevent data from falling into the hands of the Taliban.

Microsoft declined comment.
Anderson said the Taliban's attempt to control U.S.-built digital infrastructure was worth keeping an eye on. Intelligence drawn from that infrastructure, he said, ""may be far more valuable to a fledgling government than old helicopters.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker Porsche and sportswear maker Puma will join the nation's premier DAX stock index, as it expands to 40 from 30 companies in the biggest overhaul of its 33-year history, the exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said on Friday.
The expansion, contemplated for years, got a push in reaction to the collapse of German payments company Wirecard, which dramatically fell from grace in 2020, just two years after promotion to the benchmark index.
A bigger index means greater diversification and potentially more stability for investors. (Graphic: DAX's climb, https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBOERSE-DAX/egpbkkxekvq/chart.png) 
The move promotes an array of companies to an index previously reserved for German corporate titans like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Siemens.
Other new entrants include the plane manufacturer Airbus and the online fashion retailer Zalando.
The changes are effective on Monday, Sept. 20.
Wirecard's demise embarrassed the German government and stained the nation's reputation as a safe haven investment, accelerating the reform imitative backed by Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer. 
Deutsche Boerse announced the overhaul plans last November, saying the changes would improve quality of the DAX indexes and align them with international standards..
Over the past year, Deutsche Boerse has also imposed more stringent membership criteria in financial reporting and profitability. 
Manfred Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), portfolio manager at Starcapital, said he doubted the expansion would make the index more attractive.
U.S. indexes are more attractive than their European counterparts because they have a high portion of future-oriented industries like technology and communication, he said. 
""The DAX doesn't get that through the overhaul because those industries simply don't exist here,"" he said

The remaining new entrants include: health technology company Siemens Healthineers, flavour and fragrance maker Symrise, lab equipment maker Sartorius, chemicals distributor Brenntag, meal-kit company Hellofresh, and genetic testing specialist Qiagen (NYSE:QGEN).
The number of constituents in the mid-cap index will shrink to 50 from 60.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Big tech shares edged higher on Friday, helping a benchmark world stock index post a sixth consecutive closing high, after a weak U.S. jobs report likely pushed back the timetable for when the Federal Reserve reduces its massive support of the economy.
Labor Department data that showed wages increasing more than expected in August raised inflation fears and led longer-dated Treasury yields to jump, while gold advanced to a more than a 2-1/2-month high as the dollar eased.
MSCI's all-country world index, which is heavily weighted to big U.S. tech, notched a new record as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) advanced. The tech gains also helped the Nasdaq set a fresh closing high.
The Dow Industrials and S&P 500 fell as slower U.S. jobs growth raised questions about the pace of the recovery. But a Fed taper announcement is off the table in September, said Lee Ferridge, North American head of multi-asset strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
""Support from the Fed for these markets is going to persist. Taper starts later rather than sooner. That's positive for equities, that's positive for risk,"" he said.
""As long as the Fed is printing, then that means that the equity markets are supported by the whole QE liquidity argument,"" Ferridge said.
U.S. employers created the fewest jobs in seven months in August as the Delta variant hurt the leisure and hospitality sector, but a 0.6% increase in wages showed underlying strength in the economy, the jobs report showed.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 in August, well short of the 728,000 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. But the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July. 
MSCI's ACWI, which is 60% U.S. equities, rose 0.11% to 746.46, while the Nasdaq gained 0.21%.
The S&P 500 index edged 0.03% lower and the Dow Jones Industrials fell 0.2%. The broad STOXX Europe 600 index of pan-regional stocks closed down 0.56%.
Euro zone business activity, meanwhile, remained strong last month, IHS Markit's survey showed, suggesting the bloc's economy could be back to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end despite fears about the Delta variant.
The European Central Bank meets next week amid callsfrom several hawkish members to slow its pandemic-era asset purchase program. A Reuters poll sees the bank announcing acut to its asset purchases, given a recent spike in inflation.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3 basis points to 1.324% as the U.S. labor report showed a jump in hourly earnings, a potential sign of future inflation.
The dollar index dropped to a low of 91.941, its lowest level since Aug. 4, and was last down 0.09% at 92.1320. 
The euro traded flat at 1.1875. Markets are starting to react to the potential for more sustained euro zone inflation and reduced stimulus from the ECB.
The yen slid 0.19% to 109.72.
JAPAN JUMPS, CHINA EASES
Japanese shares jumped after officials said Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga would step down, setting the stage for a new premier after a one-year tenure marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response and rapidly dwindling public support.
Japan's TOPIX stock index rose to a 30-year high and was last up 1.61%, with the Nikkei gaining 2%. Asian shares are still off their peaks from earlier in the year however, and lagging those elsewhere. 
Meanwhile, Chinese blue chips were down 0.5% and Hong Kong was off 0.72% after activity in China's services sector slumped into sharp contraction in August, a private survey showed on Friday, hurt by restrictions imposed to curb the Delta variant.
Oil prices slipped on the U.S. labor report showing a patchy recovery from the pandemic, but losses were capped by concerns U.S. crude supply would continue to be limited in the wake of Hurricane Ida, which cut offshore U.S. production. 
Brent crude futures fell 42 cents to settle at $72.61 a barrel. U.S. crude slid 70 cents to settle at $69.29 a barrel. 

Gold advanced more than 1% to its highest in 2-1/2 months as weak U.S. jobs growth drove the dollar lower and cast doubts on the Fed's tapering timeline.
U.S. gold futures settled 1.2% higher at $1,833.70 an ounce.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff have been pressing firms for details on how they determine these classifications, two sources with direct knowledge said. Earlier this year, the regulator said https://reut.rs/3yHrpLx it had found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing in ESG issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

(Reuters) -Chevron Corp is looking to sell its oil and gas assets in the Eagle Ford Basin in south Texas, according to sources familiar with the matter and a marketing document seen by Reuters.
A spokesperson confirmed that the company was marketing the assets for sale, adding the oil major regularly reviews its portfolio.
At $70 oil and $4 gas,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) estimated the assets' total proved developed resources - the amount of oil and gas with a 90% or greater probability of profitable extraction - were worth around $1 billion, according to the document. 
Including undeveloped inventory, the assets could be valued as high as $3.8 billion at those prices, according to the document. U.S. crude prices were trading at around $69.5 a barrel on Friday, while natural gas was around $4.69 per million British thermal units.
Prospective buyers are likely to bid between $1 billion and $2 billion for the assets, two of the sources said.
Oil companies have been unloading properties from Texas to California, taking advantage of a more than 40% surge in crude prices to shore up cash for future investments and returns to shareholders.
Chevron, which plans to resume share buybacks in the current quarter, stepped up its sales program in June by marketing two collections of conventional oil and gas fields in the Permian Basin, together valued at more than $1 billion.
""From Chevron's perspective, a sale further streamlines their upstream operations as they narrow their focus to the largest and most economic oil and gas projects while further diversifying their business to stay abreast of changes in the industry,"" said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus.
""They are likely hoping to capitalize on a resurgent Eagle Ford M&A market largely driven by interest from private equity buyers."" 
The basin has seen over $2 billion in deals so far this year, compared to just $500 million in 2020 and $1 billion in 2019, Dittmar added. 

Chevron's Eagle Ford assets, which the company acquired as part of its takeover of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) last year, span 30,440 net acres and had net production of 30,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021, with 45% of it being natural gas, according to the marketing document.
The divestment plans come as Chevron reportedly held talks with activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 to detail its plans to cut carbon emissions. Engine No. 1 won three board seats at rival  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) in June, using the top U.S. oil producer's ""inadequate"" response to climate change as its rallying point.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong late-summer back-to-school sales could provide U.S. retailers some needed momentum after many sector shares lagged the broader market in recent months.
The S&P 500 retailing index, which includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , is up just about 2% for the quarter so far, compared with a 6% gain in the S&P 500.
Some retailers, including Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, cited upbeat back-to-school data recently as they increased annual U.S. sales forecasts, but further sales data and the U.S. August retail report are expected later this month.
With the help of advance child tax credits and stimulus checks related to the pandemic, some consumers have had extra cash to load up on backpacks and other supplies.
Most U.S. schools are returning this year to in-class instruction after months of remote learning. New York City's public schools reopen Sept. 13, and many New York metro area schools begin in the days after the Labor Day weekend, when parents typically continue to pick up school supplies.
Retail shares along with some other value-related sectors tied to the economy have underperformed growth sectors in recent months, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), in New York. The S&P value index is up about 2% for the quarter, while the growth index is up more than 8%.
But that trend is likely to change, and retail is among the groups that will ""catch a second wind here and run through the end of the year ... into the beginning of next year,"" he said.
Holiday sales and back-to-school sales have a strong correlation, he noted.
Investors have been optimistic about back-to-school sales given the comparisons with last year, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""I don't think there's any question that back-to-school is going to be far stronger than last year,"" he said.
""That's been somewhat factored into expectations,"" he said, noting that retail stocks are still higher than six months ago.
Also, supply chain issues could be a drag for some retailers, said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.
""Our operating assumption is that it doesn't get worse. ... They are working hard on the supply chain to get products on the shelf,"" he said.
Shares of some bigger retailers have outperformed, so investors may need to look for bargains, Kuby said.
""We haven't sold any (retail shares) ... but our favorite pick in the retail area is  Target , and that's a great stock but it's not inexpensive,"" he said.
Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) shares are up about 39% for the year to date, compared with about a 14% gain in the S&P 500 retailing index over that same period.

Shares of products-related companies might have more room to run, Kuby said, such as ACCO Brands (NYSE:ACCO) Corp, which his firm owns.
""Investors' attention will pivot more to holiday sales,"" he said. ""That's where focus is going to be.""

In a Friday filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, a federal prosecutor said ""the government will not now proceed with the prosecution of ZKB"" because of the lender's ""full compliance"" with the August 2018 agreement.
ZKB had admitted to helping U.S.-based clients hide hundreds of millions of dollars from the Internal Revenue Service by using undeclared Swiss bank accounts.
Prosecutors said more than 190 U.S. taxpayers conspired to conceal accounts at the bank between 2002 and 2009.
The case was part of a broad U.S. crackdown on offshore tax evasion by wealthy Americans.

Two ZKB bankers each pleaded guilty to a related misdemeanor conspiracy charge and were sentenced to one year probation.
The $98.5 million payment included a $35.1 million fine, plus restitution and forfeiture, court papers show.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine potash mine PRC will open a tender on Monday for investment banks to help find a partner to restart operations, a top company official said, a decade after Brazil's Vale shelved the project when prices crashed for the crop nutrient and the firm clashed with the country's government over tax breaks.
The state-controlled entity PRC, previously Potasio Río Colorado, is looking to restart the project with new outside investment that would likely be around $1-1.2 billion, the company's general manager Emilio Guiñazú told Reuters.
The most likely outcome would be to produce 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes of potash per year. The government of Canada, the No. 1 producer of potash at about 21 million tonnes annually, says the global market is 66 million tonnes per year.
The investment could rise to as high as $5 billion, however, Guiñazú said, depending on the scope of the project at one of the world's largest potassium deposits in western Mendoza province. Prices of potash have climbed over the last year on high food prices.
Guiñazú said that the mine hoped to have selected an investment bank by the end of October to lead the process to identity a partner for the project. He hoped to have the new partner on board within around 18 months.
In a statement from the province, which took control of the mine earlier this year after an agreement with Brazilian miner Vale, it said it had been looking at identifying potential partners interested in ""investing, associating or purchasing"" the project and had spoken with a number of unnamed companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Markets always look to the Labor Department's monthly employment report with great anticipation. But whether the data disappoints or surprises to the upside often has only a modest effect on overall stock index moves.
Friday's report missed consensus by a mile, for example, showing the economy added a paltry 235,000 jobs instead of the 728,000 expected by economists.
But Wall Street seemed to largely shrug off the disappointment. The S&P 500 was essentially flat.
""Today it’s as simple as ‘bad news is good news’ because the weak number gives the Fed cover to maintain its dovish outlook and likely push back tapering,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Detrick also pointed to strengthening yields as a reason the stock market is not terribly worried.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose about 4 basis points to 1.3257% Friday afternoon on data in the jobs report showing wages heating up even more than feared. Even so benchmark Treasury yields are well below the highs earlier this year when traders were most worried about the U.S. recovery kindling durable inflation.
""This was on the disappointing side of things, but the bond market isn’t overly concerned,"" Detrick added. ""If the bond market was worried about the economy, yields would be lower and that’s not the case."" 
The term ""Goldilocks"" is often used to describe data that hits the sweet spot; not so dire as to herald economic deterioration or so robust as to cause the Federal Reserve to tighten its dovish monetary policies.
And as markets tend to prefer not to be surprised, it might stand to reason that stocks would perform well when the actual number comes in close to estimates.
But neither appears to have been the case over the last year. The graphic below shows the monthly payrolls surprise against the movement of the S&P 500 on the day of the report's release:
On a more granular level, a clearer picture emerges.
This graphic charts payrolls surprise against the tech sector which tends to respond well to disappointing economic data as it tends to ensure the Fed will keep key interest rates low, and Dow transports that is seen by many as a barometer of economic health:

Finally, this graphic pits payrolls surprise against the rise and fall of benchmark Treasury yields, in basis points, during the session of the report.

The central thrust of the city government's proposal is to regain control over one of its largest corporations, and particularly the data it holds, Friday's Bloomberg report said.
Chinese authorities have stepped up their regulation of technology firms in the past year to improve market competition, data handling and their treatment of employees.
Under the preliminary proposal, some Beijing-based companies including Shouqi Group, part of the state-owned Beijing Tourism Group, would acquire a stake in Didi, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
Other scenarios being considered include the consortium taking a nominal share, accompanied by a so-called ""golden share"" with veto power and a board seat, it added.
Didi, Beijing's city government, Beijing Tourism Group and Shouqi Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares in Didi rose 1.7% to $8.96 in New York in early-afternoon trading. Some investors welcomed the news, arguing it could remove the overhang of further regulatory uncertainty on Didi's stock.
""A better outcome than going bust like private education,"" Dave Wang, a portfolio strategist at Nuvest Capital in Singapore, said.
In July, China barred for-profit tutoring in core school subjects, stepping up regulatory oversight of a $120 billion industry that investors had bet billions of dollars on in recent years. 
Some investors, however, raised questions over how Didi could pull off such a move while remaining a U.S.-listed company, abiding by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The SEC declined to comment. NYSE has not responded to a request for comment.
""We were expecting some action but not to this level of magnitude. The big question is what will happen to Didi's investors?"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment advisor United First Partners in Singapore. 
Legal experts said Beijing had never taken control of a U.S.-listed company. One option would be to assume control of an entity in China that holds Didi's operations but not the holding company of Didi, which is based in the Cayman Islands.
It is unclear whether such a move would require Didi shareholder approval. If it did, its founders could push it through because they own dual-class shares with 51.9% voting control.
""It would depend on which jurisdiction controls that entity. I'm unaware of another situation where a government would take a stake in a publicly listed company in the United States,"" said William Rosenstadt, a capital markets and securities lawyer at Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP.
The ""golden share"" arrangement considered for Didi would be similar to an investment the Chinese government has made in TikTok-owner ByteDance's key Chinese entity, Bloomberg said. Unlike Didi, however, ByteDance is not publicly listed. 
Shouqi Group owns ride hailing service Shouqi Yueche, and Bloomberg said it would play a role in helping operate its larger rival under the proposal.
Didi faces a cybersecurity investigation by Chinese authorities after its New York initial public offering in June.

Reuters reported in August, citing people familiar with the matter, that Didi is in talks with state-owned information security firm Westone to handle its data management and monitoring activities.
Didi is controlled by the management team of co-founder Will Cheng and President Jean Liu. SoftBank Group Corp, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) are among other investors in the company.

Chevron engages regularly with shareholders and looks forward to discussing its lower carbon future with them later this month, a company spokesman told Reuters.
Engine No.1 held a stake worth about $600,000 in Chevron, as of June 30, according to regulatory filings.
The fund has been in touch with other investors about organizing a group to purchase Chevron shares, hinting at interest in launching a second major campaign, according to the report.

Energy companies are under pressure from the Biden administration's climate change agenda, which seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions and work towards reducing the sector's carbon footprint.

CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) -Italian defence group Leonardo still aims to list its U.S. unit DRS when the right market conditions are in place, Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo said on Friday. 
The state-controlled group postponed an initial public offering of a minority stake in DRS in March, due to uncertainty over U.S. defence spending and investors' concerns about a potential rise in interest rates to fight a surge inflation.
""We have filed for the listing of DRS and we keep updating the documents for the IPO ... when market conditions for a successful transaction are there, we will do it,"" Profumo told reporters on the sidelines of an annual event in Cernobbio, on Lake Como.
The Italian group had offered 22% of DRS at a price of $20 to $22 per share.
""The valuation's range for the unit remains unchanged,"" Profumo said, adding the group could test the IPO market again, in the coming months. 
Profumo said the group still planned to sell its small automation business and declined to comment on a possible disposal of its OTO Melara unit, which makes defence systems for ships.

(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) shareholders should reject founder and CEO Fred Smith's $54 million pay package because the logistics company gave him stock options after scrapping a cash bonus in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, only to reinstate it later, the Teamsters labor union said on Friday.
Smith, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $5.8 billion, was given a special option award ""for motivation and retention purposes"" in June 2020 after FedEx canceled a $3.4 million cash bonus for him, citing uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic.
Those options were worth $6.4 million as of the end of May, the close of FedEx's fiscal year, more than doubling in value since Smith received them. As more people shipped and received items during the pandemic and FedEx's business rebounded, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company reinstated Smith's $3.4 million cash bonus in December, but also allowed him to keep the special stock options.
This amounted to ""double-dipping"" that undercuts the pay-for-performance structure of Smith's compensation, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is bargaining on behalf of FedEx employees at a freight facility and is an investor in FedEx through pension and benefit funds, argued in a letter to shareholders on Friday, which was seen by Reuters. 
""Having founded the company, been chief executive since 1998 and holding an 8% equity stake, surely CEO Smith has the appropriate incentives to drive shareholder value,"" the Teamsters general secretary-treasurer, Ken Hall, wrote in the letter.
The union is urging shareholders to vote against the company's executive pay plan at the company's annual meeting on Sept. 27. As with most companies, the vote at FedEx is non-binding. 
FedEx declined to comment beyond what it has disclosed on executive pay in securities filings. In its informational disclosure to investors, FedEx said a significant portion of executive compensation is ""at risk"" and dependent on the company hitting performance goals and share price targets. 
FedEx Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Subramaniam, the company's highest paid executive after Smith, also had his $2 million cash bonus reinstated after he received a similar special option award and stock grant worth approximately $6 million at the end of May. 
Many U.S. companies tweaked the pay of executives during the pandemic, easing performance targets and even giving them pay rises. Investors then voted down a record number of CEO pay packages at their annual shareholder meetings earlier this year. [L2N2NL2O2]

Although most shareholder votes on pay are non-binding, some companies have tweaked executive pay when faced with investor opposition. For example, in 2018 Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co renegotiated the compensation of its chief executive at the time, Bob Iger, to toughen performance targets after shareholders voted down his pay. 
The Teamsters acknowledged in the letter that Smith's options had yet to vest and that there was still uncertainty over the value of that grant. Smith also accepted a 91% cut in his annual salary during some of the last fiscal year. His salary was $966,125.

In the letter filed on Friday, Match said it believes that enough time has passed that the Dutch regulator is legally required to have reached a decision. The company asked the regulator to adopt a decision and make it known to Match within two weeks. 
The ACM did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside of normal business hours.

Therefore, we believe stocks with strong fundamentals and solid growth attributes—Gates Industrial Corporation (NYSE:GTES) and Oceaneering International (NYSE:OII)—could be wise bets now. Read on.The S&P 500 has risen more than 20% this year—nearly double its long-term historical average annual gain. However, investors have traditionally made shifts in their holdings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season as the stock market enters what has historically been its weakest month of the year. Furthermore, according to payroll services firm ADP, U.S. companies added fewer jobs than projected in August. Private payrolls increased by just 374,000 in August, considerably less than the 600,000 the Dow Jones expectation.
This, along with the Fed’s statement on its coming plans and any change in the momentum of economic recovery, is expected to lead to increased market volatility in the coming weeks. However, we think growth stocks could be ideal for investors looking to dodge market fluctuations because they are well-positioned to outperform the overall market in the long run. Investors’ interest in growth stocks is evident in the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 14.7% returns over the past three months.
Given this backdrop, fundamentally strong growth stocks  Gates Industrial Corporation plc  (GTES) and Oceaneering International Inc. (OII) could be great additions to one’s portfolio now.

So, we think it could be wise to bet now on fundamentally sound shipping stocks Costamare (NYSE:CMRE) and Safe Bulkers (NYSE:SB). Conversely, shippers Golden Ocean Group (NASDAQ:GOGL) and Castor Maritime (CTRM) look significantly overvalued at their current price levels. So, they are best avoided now. Read on.The shipping industry plays a crucial role in transporting goods and raw materials around the globe. Some 80% of goods globally are transported by ships. And it is telling that several industries were negatively affected recently when the Ever-Given, one of the world's largest container ships, got stuck in the Suez Canal.
The recent closure of the Ningbo-Zhoushan port in China also highlighted the importance of the shipping industry. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) recently declined from a more than 11-year high but recorded its second monthly gain in August due to global shipping constraints and robust demand. Because the need to transport goods is expected to remain high in the coming months, the shipping industry should achieve decent growth.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of fundamentally sound shipping stocks  Costamare Inc . (CMRE) and Safe Bulkers, Inc. (SB). However, since the prices of shares of Golden Ocean Group Limited (GOGL) and Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM) have far exceeded their intrinsic values, they are best avoided now.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>","Tyson Foods, unions strike deal over COVID-19 vaccine mandate","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc said on Friday that labor unions have agreed to support its requirement for U.S. employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by November, and the company will offer new benefits to workers including paid sick leave.
Companies have been working to incentivize employees to get vaccinated through bonuses and other benefits as the highly contagious Delta variant drives an increase in U.S. coronavirus infections. In some instances, employees who do not get shots face penalties like higher insurance costs.
Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said on Aug. 3 that U.S. employees must get vaccinated, though the requirement for unionized plant workers was subject to negotiations.
The company has now won support from the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represent more than 80% of Tyson's 31,000 unionized workers in the United States, it said in a statement.
Tyson runs slaughterhouses in rural areas where some residents have been reluctant to get vaccinated. In Iowa, where Tyson operates pork plants, 49% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to state data. Nationwide, 53% of the total population and 62% of people eligible for vaccines have been fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The UFCW, America's largest meatpacking union, said it secured 20 hours of paid sick leave per year for Tyson employees as part of negotiations over the mandate. It is the first national U.S. agreement to provide paid sick leave to meatpacking workers, the union said.
All Tyson employees can begin earning the 20 hours starting on Jan. 1, the company said. 
The UFCW initially expressed concerns over the mandate because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not fully approved vaccines, instead granting approval for emergency use. Last week, the FDA granted full approval to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE's shot.

Tyson said more than 90,000 employees, or 75% of its U.S. workforce of 120,000, have received at least one dose of a vaccine, up from about 56,000 before the mandate.
Some workers can be exempt from the mandate for religious or medical reasons, according to the UFCW.

(Reuters) - European stocks slipped on Friday as U.S. employment data pointed towards slowing growth in the world's largest economy, with retail and travel stocks exposed to American markets suffering the most.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.6%, marking its worst fall in two weeks after data showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in seven month in August. Global equities also tumbled after the data. 
Retail stocks were among the worst performers for the day, dropping 0.9%. Bookseller WH Smith, which makes at least a quarter of its earnings from U.S. customers, was the worst performer in the sector, down 3.4%. 
Travel stocks sank 1%. 
The laggard U.S. data was attributed to a rise in the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. But analysts saw a bright side in the reading, specifically that weakness in the job market would give less impetus to the Federal Reserve to rein in liquidity measures. 
""Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs puts less pressure on the Fed to taper its stimulus, which is likely to provide a short-term boost for stocks. The stock market loves stimulus and any indication that the Fed will remain fully accommodative is good news for investors,"" said Jay Pestrichelli, CEO of ZEGA Financial. 
European technology stocks were the best performers for the week, up nearly 2% as investors fled to sectors most resilient to disruptions caused by the pandemic. 
A private survey also showed activity in China's services sector contracted sharply in August as restrictions to curb the COVID-19 Delta variant threatened to derail the recovery.
But euro zone business activity remained strong last month, IHS Markit's survey showed, suggesting the bloc's economy could be back to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end despite fears about the Delta variant of the coronavirus and widespread supply chain issue.
The European Central Bank will meet next week amid calls from several hawkish members to slow down its pandemic-era purchases programme. A Reuters poll sees the bank announcing a cut to its asset purchases, given a recent spike in inflation.
Payments company Nexi (MI:NEXII) slipped 0.8% after Italy's competition watchdog said it had opened an investigation into the company's planned merger with domestic rival SIA.

Spanish fund distribution firm Allfunds jumped 11.7%, and was the best performer on the STOXX 600 after its maiden first-half results beat expectations.

Read on.Even though data security breaches and increasing cyberattacks remain a concern for the fintech industry, the surge in digital financial transactions makes its prospects bright. Investors’ optimism about fintech stocks is evidenced by the Global X FinTech ETF’s (FINX) 8.4% gains over the past month, versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.6% returns.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as early as 2023, and recently indicated its willingness to reduce asset purchases before the end of the year, which should help Fintech companies expand their profit margins. In addition, the Fintech industry holds immense growth potential over the long run due to the increasing adoption of advanced technologies and innovative solutions. According to an The ExpressWire report, the fintech market is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR between 2021 - 2024.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 11:03AM ET</span>",Emerging market corporate bond sales scale record high this year,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Emerging market firms have flocked to bond markets to cash in on low interest rates and have raised a record amount of money to fund expansion plans as they look beyond the coronavirus pandemic, data showed. Companies in developing nations have raised a record $249 billion in the first eight months of this year, overtaking the $243 billion borrowed in the same period last year, Refinitiv data shows. 
""Lower rates have been an incentive for issuers, and for investors EM high-yielding debt has been attractive, given value considerations,"" said Buddhika Piyasena, head of Asia-Pacific at Fitch Ratings. 
""There is some early refinancing happening as well, adding to volumes in 2021, with issuers wanting to take advantage of the today's interest rate environment given possible Fed moves going forward.""
Companies from India, Brazil, Thailand and Malaysian led the surge in bond sales this year. Indian firms sold bonds worth nearly $40 billion to end-August, the other three saw corporate bond sales of more than $20 billion each over the same period. 
The distribution across sectors showed energy and industrial firms in the developing world at the forefront. 
Among top issuers, Qatar Petroleum (QP), one of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, raised $12.5 billion for operational and investment purposes, while Saudi Arabia's Aramco (SE:2222) locked in $6 billion.
""The fundamentals of EM corporates still remain strong,"" said Chanakya Dissanayake, head of investment research at Acute Knowledge Partners. 
Despite higher spreads, net leverage of high-yield issuers in emerging markets was around three times compared to five times for their U.S. counterparts in 2020, Dissanayake calculated. The default rate across emerging market high yield corporate debt stood at 3.5% - about half that of their U.S. peers, he added. 
However, some analysts expect the borrowing bonanza might be disrupted if the Federal Reserve unwinds its monetary stimulus measures and U.S interest rates starts to rise.
In late August, U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the bank could start to dial back its massive asset purchase programme this year.
Jose Perez-Gorozpe, head of credit research for emerging markets at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, said any Fed tapering announcement would probably lead to more stringent financing conditions and volatility over the coming quarters.
""Issuers are taking advantage at still-favourable financing conditions to refinance their debt and cover future financing needs,"" he said.
Also, profits at emerging market firms are pressured as many developing economies lag the recovery enjoyed by developed markets due to slow vaccinations and less stimulus. Higher input costs and supply disruptions are also squeezing margins.
Asia's biggest firms are likely to post their first quarter-on-quarter profit decline in six quarters in July-September, falling 6.19%, showed a Reuters calculation based on Refinitiv Eikon analyst data of 1,069 companies with market capitalisation of at least $1 billion.

""Delayed economic recoveries can be especially harmful for those entities linked to tourism and related services, which have not yet recovered,"" S&P's Perez-Gorozpe said.
""In Latin America, restaurants, airlines and airports, gaming, and leisure continue to suffer from the abrupt contraction in demand last year and likely won't recover until immunisation programmes across the region.""

Hyundai Motor, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 biggest automakers by sales, plans to internally develop a silicon carbide technology based power chip, the newspaper said, citing an unnamed industry source.
A shortage of chips made by semiconductor companies, fuelled by pandemic interruptions and production issues at chip factories, have forced automakers halt production and reduce work shifts amid concerns that shortages could continue.
Hyundai's research centre and its auto parts affiliate Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd led the chip design process and cooperated with multiple companies, including system chip manufacturer Magnachip Semiconductor Corp, the newspaper said. 
“We are aiming to apply our internally developed power chip to a new car to be launched in the second quarter of next year,” an unnamed Hyundai Motor official told the newspaper, without naming the vehicle. 
The Seoul Economy Daily said the new vehicle model adopting the chip could be the Ioniq 6, Hyundai's dedicated electric car expected to be launched next year. Hyundai told the newspaper that the chip production date has not been decided

Hyundai Motor did not have immediate comment. 
In June, Reuters reported that Hyundai and its affiliates are in talks with local chip companies to reduce reliance on foreign supplies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Company and two former executives have agreed to pay more than $62 million to settle charges they falsified supplier contracts to achieve cost savings in a multi-year accounting scheme, the U.S. securities regulator said on Friday. 
The food company engaged in an array of accounting misconduct from the last quarter of 2015 to the end of 2018 during which it improperly inflated key earnings for investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday. 
The alleged misconduct began as a result of a ""cost savings gap"" leading up to Heinz's 2015 merger with Kraft and continued for years amid pressure to make good on promises the new company would ""deliver on certain cost savings,"" according to SEC documents.
Kraft restated its financials in June 2019 after the launch of an SEC probe, correcting $208 million in improperly recognized cost savings from nearly 300 transactions, the regulator said.
Kraft, which did not admit or deny the SEC's findings, said in a statement that it fully cooperated with the SEC's investigation and has taken ""remedial action and proactive steps"" to boost its policies and controls for financial reporting. 
The Chicago-based company agreed to pay a $62 million civil penalty and not commit future violations as part of its agreement with the SEC. Kraft recorded the penalty in the second quarter of 2021, the statement said.
Former chief operating officer Eduardo Pelleissone, who was accused of negligence-based anti-fraud and other controls violations, agreed to pay a penalty of $300,000 and another $14,000 in disgorgement. 
Former chief procurement officer Klaus Hofmann agreed to pay $100,000 and was barred from serving as a public company officer or director for five years in a settlement that is pending court approval.

Neither executive admitted or denied the SEC's findings. Lawyers for both did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc owns about 26% of Kraft Heinz. Prices of Kraft shares were little-changed on Friday.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s promise last month to check U.S. customer phones and computers for child sex abuse images sparked a global backlash from a wide range of rights groups, with employees also criticizing the plan internally.
Critics argued the feature could be exploited by repressive governments looking to find other material for censorship or arrests and would also be impossible for outside researchers to determine whether Apple was only checking a small set of on-device content.
Apple countered that it would allow security researchers to verify its claims, but the company on Friday said it would take more time to make changes to the system. 
""Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,"" the company said in a statement on Friday.
Matthew Green, a cybersecurity researcher at Johns Hopkins University who had criticized Apple's move, said the Apple's move was ""promising.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened slightly lower on Friday in response to a hugely disappointing labor market report for August, which showed job creation at its slowest rate in six months. 
The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls expanded by only 235,000 through the middle of the month, missing consensus forecasts by over half a million. The upward revision of July's data to show an extra 100,000 jobs gained was scant consolation.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 123 points, or 0.3%, at 35,323 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%. The latter two indices are still on course for yet another weekly gain, however.
The market appeared unsettled by hints of stagflation in the report, as the spread of Covid-19 puts the brakes on growth while wages continued to grow above expectations. Average hourly earnings growth accelerated to 0.6% from 0.4% in July. Analysts had expected earnings growth to moderate to 0.3%. However, that development appeared due more than anything to the lack of low-paying service jobs created in the leisure and hospitality sectors, which brought average earnings up.
While the Covid-19 infection curve has started to flatten in recent days, the average number of deaths hit its highest since March over the last seven days. Hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector ground to a halt in August as a result, while the retail sector shed a net 28,000 jobs, reversing some of the gains since the economy began reopening in the spring.
Among individual movers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock drifted down 0.1% after saying it would delay the rollout of new features in its iOS operating system to help root out child sexual abuse material. The new tools had been criticised by privacy groups and others. 
Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock fel 4.7% after the Federal Aviation Administration grounded its planes while it investigates alleged violations of safety protocols during its debut commercial flight earlier in the summer.
Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) ADRs rose over 8% after Bloomberg reported that the city of Beijing is considering taking the company under state control, in ways that may or may not affect the ride-hailing share count but will very probably affect its governance. The move reflected expectations that the government would at least partially compensate sharerholders who have lost money since the company's IPO in July. The stock is still down over 30% from its IPO price.
Also gaining was Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock, which rose 1.6% after the chipmaker said it didn't expect the pandemic trends that have accelerated demand for its semiconductors to ease off any time soon. DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock, which has been supported by some of the same trends in recent months, also gained 6.1% after it, too, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors have swept into assets perceived to perform on slowing growth and rising inflation, a weekly round-up by BofA showed on Friday, with tech stocks seeing their biggest inflows in six months and large outflows from U.S. government debt.
At $2.5 billion, tech stocks saw the biggest inflows since March 2021, while outflows from U.S. Treasuries rose to $1.3 billion for the week - their highest since February 2021 - as ""stagflation"" trades gathered momentum.
Emerging market equities enjoyed inflows of $4.4 billion, the data from BofA also showed. Private clients of the U.S. investment bank, holding $3.2 trillion in assets, increased their allocation to stocks to a fresh record high of 65.2% but cut bonds to an all-time low of 17.7%.
Stagflation is characterised by weak growth and persistently high inflation. It is usually seen as a particularly vicious period in the economic cycle, when very few asset classes perform well.
The investment bank's bull and bear indicator held well below a February high as lower bond yields and less exuberant global equity inflows weighed on sentiment.
""Our view is long quality (major stocks) as that is the best market and macro hedge in backdrop of stagflation and waning fiscal and monetary policy stimulus,"" analysts led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at the bank said in a note.

While global markets have recorded a string of highs over the summer period, market sentiment has become increasingly cautious due to rising inflation. Tuesday's data showed euro zone inflation increased to 3% year-on-year in August, the highest in a decade.
In notable milestones, BofA said the U.S. stock market recorded a string of 53 closing highs in 2021, the fifth most in the past 100 years. The previous four episodes were followed by heavy market declines.

Read ahead to learn more.Private aviation company Wheels Up Experience Inc. (UP), which is headquartered in New York City, provides on-demand flights across various private aircraft cabin categories, aircraft acquisitions and sales, commercial travel, and a suite of other services. On July 14, 2021, UP went public through an SPAC merger. A substantial increase in demand across all cabin classes and a compelling membership model have contributed to the company’s accelerating revenue growth in its last reported quarter.
However, closing yesterday’s trading session at $7.74, UP’s stock is trading 48.4% below its 52-week price high of $15. In addition, the stock has lost 4.5% in price over the past month and 23.6% year-to-date, indicating bearishness. Indeed, UP is currently trading lower than its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $8.74 and $9.83, respectively, which indicates a downtrend.
Although pandemic-related anxieties have fostered a growing consumer preference for flying by private aircraft, the pricing may be a deterrent for many.

Investing.com - Ford (NYSE:F) stock and General Motors stock (NYSE:GM) traded a tad lower in Friday’s premarket following the companies’ decision to cut production, as shortages of chips continue to play havoc with their targets.
GM on Thursday said it is idling its two main pickup plants, in Silao, Mexico, and Indiana. Production at three other factories is also being suspended for a couple of weeks. The decision will affect production of GMC Sierra pickups, Chevrolet Silverados and Chevy Traverse.
Ford will not make pickups at its Kansas City plant for the next two weeks. Shifts will be cut at two truck plants in Michigan and Kentucky.
The announcements illustrate how the shortage of chips has reached a level where automakers are forced to cut production of even their most profitable models. Earlier in the year, they had stressed that they would be able to continue making SUVs and pickups without too much ado.
The crisis has deepened as unending waves of the pandemic have hit Asian markets, where most of the manufacturing happens.
Automakers have had to compete for chips with gadget- and household appliance makers, which have grabbed a bigger share of consumer spending resources in a locked-down world.
The shortage has affected more than just U.S. carmakers. Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the two largest carmakers in the world, have also curtailed production. "
286,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",Energy CEOs Warn of Difficult Winter Ahead as Gas Rallies,"(Bloomberg) -- European energy executives warned of a difficult winter ahead as natural gas prices soar to records, a grim prospect for households and businesses recovering from the global pandemic.
Gas prices in Europe are breaking records day after day as economies reopen and people return to the office, boosting demand just as supplies are falling short. That’s fueling inflation and boosting concerns energy-intensive industries from fertilizers to steel and even food makers will need to slow down.
“High gas prices today are a problem for Europe,” Francesco Starace, chief executive officer at Italian utility giant  Enel  (MI:ENEI) SpA, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday.
Prices are rallying even though it’s summer, when demand is usually low. That’s because a long winter left gas storage sites across Europe depleted, with inventories currently at their lowest level for this time of year in more than a decade. Austria’s energy company OMV AG said it’s still trying to catch up from last year’s deep chill.
“We’ve been running behind the storage delay all summer,” CEO Alfred Stern said late Thursday at a briefing in Vienna. “It will now depend on how cold this winter is.”
Soaring energy prices have already sent German inflation to its highest since 2008. Prices soared 3.4% in August, higher than the 2% rate the European Central Bank is targeting for the euro area. Things could still get worse as electricity prices are now at the highest since 2008 and just about 50 euro cents shy of a record.
Europe is struggling to get the extra gas it needs to refill storage sites as top supplier Russia is facing a crunch of its own, holding back additional deliveries. Outages in the North Sea are disrupting the continent’s own production just as cargoes of liquefied natural gas are being diverted to meet Asian demand.
Soaring gas prices are likely to become a problem for Asia too, Starace said.
The rally also poses a threat to companies banking on gas as a bridge fuel to the transition to low-carbon energy sources, he said. The gains have also helped drive the price of pollution permits in Europe to a record, a move meant to discourage companies from burning more coal.
“Price of gas today is somehow related to CO2 prices, so gas companies, rather than electricity companies, have to be realistic” about the role of gas in the energy transition, he said. 
Europe may get some relief later this year if the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany starts. The current crunch shows why such infrastructure projects are critical, said Stern, whose company helped finance the link.
Russian Energy Minister Nikolay Shulginov said Thursday it’s possible that Nord Stream 2 will start sending more gas to Europe soon as the pipeline is almost complete.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 07:52AM ET</span>",Britain's trucker shortage jams post-pandemic recovery,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Two furloughed jumbo jet pilots and a burnt-out finance worker have been among the more unusual candidates to learn how to drive 44-tonne trucks at Laurence Bolton's school in south London during the pandemic.
""You get people from all industries, and think: 'Blimey, I never saw you here before 2020',"" Bolton said. ""There are more people that have been displaced from retail, with the high street closing or certainly running down, and from hospitality.""
Business is brisk for truck driving schools as Britain emerges from its COVID-19 crisis. The country is facing an acute shortage of lorry drivers, and haulage companies are raising starting salaries and offering sign-on bonuses to entice candidates in the post-pandemic economy.
Bolton, managing director of the National Driving Centre, said he had seen a 20% rise in the number of people seeking to become truckers compared with before the pandemic. 
It's not enough, though. Britain needs 100,000 more drivers if it is to meet demand, according to the UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA). The signs are already there: sporadic gaps on supermarket shelves, pubs running low on beer, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) suspending milkshakes.
The shortfall, mirrored to a lesser degree in other countries like the United States and Germany, spells potential trouble on the inflation front. Truckers are a central cog in the global economy, carrying almost all our goods. If there aren't enough of them, it is likely to drive up prices.
Wesley Van Tonder, who delivered food for Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Deliveroo during the pandemic, is among those workers who have sought to change course in the new reality - he has cashed in his motorbike to fund truck-driving lessons at Bolton's school. 
""Now everything is starting to open back up so there's more people on the road, and on the bike it's a bit dangerous,"" he said. ""I'd rather drive a truck.""
'SUPPLY CHAIN CAN'T COPE'
The Bank of England expects British inflation to hit a 10-year high of 4% this year. How fast it might fall thereafter depends in part on how quickly people who have lost their jobs in the pandemic switch to sectors such as logistics where workers are badly needed.
UK manufacturers said shortages of raw materials and delivery delays disrupted production last month, leading to slower growth and a marked increase in costs. 
Britain is not alone with its driver shortage. United States trucking firms want more visas for foreign drivers and German logistics bodies estimate a 45,000-60,000 driver shortage there.
But the gap is bigger in Britain, where post-Brexit immigration rules since Jan. 1 have cost the industry 20,000 drivers from the European Union, the RHA told Reuters.
Normally nearly 40,000 people a year pass tests to drive a lorry in Britain, but this fell by almost two-thirds last year at the height of the pandemic when many driving schools were closed for long stretches in an already aging industry.
""We do not have enough fresh blood coming in,"" said RHA policy director Rod McKenzie. ""Britons will not get the things they want. That is the position we're in now. And it's getting worse between now and Christmas.""
This was echoed by Bolton at the National Driving Centre.
""You've got to make sure that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deliveries arrive at people's doors,"" he said. ""People have the expectation that everything is 'click to buy', with the expectation 'I want it here tomorrow'. But the supply chain can't cope with it, with the amount of drivers that are left in the industry.""
Britain's government has rejected industry calls to temporarily ease visa restrictions for EU lorry drivers, and instead told the sector to improve pay and conditions.
$7,000 SIGNING-ON BONUSES
The demand has driven up wages: salaries for new drivers in Britain rose by 5.7% between February and July compared with a 0.8% increase across all types of jobs, according to Jack Kennedy, an economist at recruitment website Indeed.
The shortage has also led companies such as Gist, a division of U.S.-German Linde (NYSE:LIN) which delivers food to British supermarkets Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), to offer 5,000-pound ($6,900) sign-on and retention bonuses.
Yet it's an industry where trade unions have long criticised pay and conditions.
The average hourly wage for truck drivers in 2020 was 11.80 pounds an hour, or 30,820 pounds a year, according to official data. 
While the annual salary is roughly in line with the national average, hours are longer and often anti-social - a typical full-time truck driver was paid to work for 47 hours a week, compared with 37.5 hours for the average job.
The sector in Britain is dominated by small haulage companies which operate on thin margins, pressured by big customers in the retail and industrial sectors, according to Adrian Jones, a national officer at trade union Unite. 
Unite wants an industry-level agreement on minimum pay rates, as in some other European countries and more regulated sub-sectors such as petrol and chemical delivery.
Big signing-on bonuses from some large employers were not translating into broader pay rises, and instead suggested that they thought the current shortage would blow over, Jones said.
""That's just a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. That is not a solution to the problem,"" he added. 
'I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT'
A big question mark for Britain's central bank is whether the recruitment difficulties mark the start of a longer-term, more broad-based rise in the country's wages, which have been weak since the 2008 financial crisis.
Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has highlighted a mismatch between new jobs created during the pandemic in areas such as logistics and IT, and the skills of people in sectors that suffered such as high-street retail and hospitality.
However, in an ominous sign for the Bank and inflationary pressures, Indeed economist Kennedy said the flow of new drivers from outside the sector appeared to slow in the three months to June, as job options widened.
For some, though, the lure of the open road is irresistible. 
London bus driver Nick Fuller is among those training at Bolton's National Driving Centre and plans to get a licence to drive an articulated lorry up and down motorways.
He said he couldn't turn down the prospect of better pay and a bigger vehicle - plus the absence of aggressive passengers. 

""I always wanted to do it. But hearing about these labour shortages – yes, maybe it gives me an incentive to get it now rather than later,"" the 37-year-old added.
""With lorries, you've got no passengers hollering at you or trying to get to you through the cab – and a bit more money to help feed my family as well.""

""Utility disruptions caused by lack of power, mobile data services, and water, could lead to Ida becoming a long-tailed event when it comes to claims reporting, payouts,"" the consultancy said.
Catastrophe modeling company Karen Clark & Co on Wednesday estimated about $18 billion of losses in the United States and the Caribbean, while CoreLogic expected insured flood loss for properties in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama of between $6 billion and $9 billion, with additional wind losses of $8 billion to $12 billion.
Industry sources have said that total losses could be close to $30 billion after flash flooding killed at least 44 people in four Northeastern states.

""The remnants of Hurricane Ida passing through the Northeast has caused significant water damage... We expect the bulk of those claims to come in over the next several days as businesses access and assess the impact,"" William Liebler, U.S. Chief Claims Officer at broker Marsh, said.
Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide on Friday estimated insured losses, including wind and storm surge, in the range of $17 billion-$25 billion from the storm.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Drought forces North American ranchers to sell off their future,"By Rod Nickel and Tom Polansek
WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO (Reuters) - When Canadian rancher Dianne Riding strides across her brown pasture, sidestepping cracks and popping grasshoppers, she has less company than usual.
Record-setting heat and sparse rain left Riding with too little grass or hay to feed her cattle near Lake Francis, Manitoba. She sold 51 head at auction in July, about 40% of her herd. The sales included 20 heifers, young cows that have not given birth, that were potential breeding stock.
""That's your future. As my herd goes down, so does my income,"" Riding said. ""It's gut-wrenching.""
Such liquidations of breeding stock are expected to limit cattle production in the coming years, tightening North America's beef supply and driving up consumer prices, according to two dozen ranchers and cattle experts.
The drought spanning much of western North America - from western Canada to California and Mexico - has cooked pastures and hay crops that fatten cattle. The ranchers' plight is one impact of many from the punishing drought, which has also damaged wheat across North Dakota and cherries in Washington state, weakened bee colonies, and forced California to shut a major hydroelectric plant. In British Columbia, an entire town burned, while California is expected to see a record number of acres go up in flames this year.
Climate scientists say global warming makes extreme heat and drought occur more frequently, but some ranchers interviewed by Reuters dispute the link to climate change. They view the current drought as an unremarkable shift in the weather from which the industry will recover.
Riding said she is tired of scientists blaming agriculture, among other industries, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions. 
""I know climate change is our latest buzzword, but I think this is a cycle,"" said Riding, 60, whose farm northwest of Winnipeg sits in one of hardest-hit drought areas. ""Sometimes the cycles are longer than normal.""
Gloria Montaño Greene, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official who works to reduce risks to farming, said the connection between the West Coast drought and climate change is clear. ""There is an increase in heat. We're seeing various wildfires,"" she said. ""We're seeing climate change.""
Adding to ranchers' problems, prices of feed alternatives such as corn, soy and wheat are the highest in years. There is so little feed available that Manitoba farmers have bought 280 tons of hay from as far away as Prince Edward Island, some 3,400 kms (2,000 miles) to the east.
In a normal year, 10% to 12% of breeding stock in western Canada, the country's top beef-producing region, are culled due to age or other routine reasons, and farmers replace most of it, said Brian Perillat, senior analyst at CanFax.
This year, ranchers are likely to cull 20% to 30%, reducing the size of herds, according to industry group Alberta Beef Producers. That would be an unprecedented reduction of the breeding stock, based on records going back to 1970, Perillat said. 
In the United States, the world's third-biggest beef exporter, analysts expect a smaller impact because the herd is more spread out. Still, a third of U.S. cattle are in drought areas, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, and producers are making the painful decision to send animals to slaughter early.
New Mexico rancher Pat Boone, 67, slashed his herd of mother cows by half, to about 200 head, over the past year.
""Our land is hurt, and it's hurt badly,"" said Boone, who lives in Elida, a town of about 200 people in eastern New Mexico. ""We're not going to be in any hurry to restock.""
FEWER COWS, HIGHER BEEF PRICES
Sending female cows to slaughter in 2021, instead of keeping them for breeding, will reduce market-ready cattle inventories in 2023, economists say. The animals have long gestation periods and take time to fatten after birth.
""When we liquidate cow herds, these supply impacts last years,"" said Mike von Massow, associate professor of food, agricultural and resource economics at University of Guelph, Ontario. ""You have this hangover.""
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said in a recent earnings call it expects operating margins for its booming beef business to decline next year amid herd liquidation, though results should still be strong.
Riding says she will need four years to rebuild her herd. If the drought abates, she might retain or buy heifers next year, but the animals don't produce their first calf until they turn two years old.
Consumers will also feel the pinch, analysts said. The USDA in August trimmed its estimates for U.S. beef production this year and next as ranchers are raising animals to lighter weights.
After a 2014 drought, beef prices in Canada rose about 25% over the following year, and stayed elevated for at least two years, von Massow said, citing Statistics Canada data. Beef prices are likely to increase as early as this fall, reflecting the higher prices to feed cattle, he said.
In Mexico, the northern state of Chihuahua has gone from around 1.2 million breeding cows in 2019, to about 700,000 because of drought, said Fernando Cadena, head of Mexican ranching company Carnes Ribe based in Ciudad de Chihuahua, just south of Texas. 
Cadena said other major northern Mexican ranching states like Sonora, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Durango, saw similar rates of drought-induced slaughter, in addition to cows that died on parched land due to lack of food or water.
The hardest hit ranchers in northern Mexico will likely need two to four years to recover herd levels, he said.
Fewer cows in Mexico could impact the U.S. beef supply, as more than a million cows are imported across the southern border each year.
""We'll just have to wait for the pasture land to recover,"" Cadena said. ""For months, it just didn't rain. There wasn't anywhere for the cows to graze.""
Feedlots, which buy cattle from ranchers and fatten them for slaughter, are also worried about their businesses. Greg Schmidt, who feeds 15,000 cattle near Barrhead, Alberta, expects to pay more for available cattle next year after herds are reduced.
""This is going to ripple through our industry for years,"" said Schmidt, chair of the Alberta Cattle Feeders' Association.
PONDS TURN TO CRACKED DIRT
Steve Arnold, a rancher in Pozo, California, said 12 of the last 15 years have brought less than half of normal rainfall to his area about 200 miles northwest of Los Angeles. But Arnold, 67, said this drought is the worst he has seen. Grass never grew this year due to the lack of rainfall, Arnold said. He has reduced his herd about 30% to about 70 head. 
""We've had dry stuff but not like this,"" he said.
Ponds that used to provide drinking water for cattle are dried up in parts of California, said Tony Toso, 58, who raises cows and calves in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
""I'm seeing ponds that usually may get low, but not where they're cracked dirt,"" said Toso, president of the California Cattlemen's Association. ""There's nothing in them.""
With grass in short supply, Toso expects prices for alfalfa hay to top $300 per ton, up from $200 to $220 per ton last year.

The rancher said he did not retain any calves to replace his herd of mother cows as he normally would because of the drought and outlook for limited feed. Instead, the animals all went to market to be slaughtered for beef.
""We're just kind of hunkering down,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, remaining around record levels ahead of the release of the August job’s report, which may cement growing expectations of a delay to the Federal Reserve’s tapering plans.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 14 points, or 0.1%. 
The major indices closed higher Thursday, starting the new month on a strong footing, with the broad-based S&P 500 rising 0.3%, to a new record closing high. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, also an all-time closing high.
Investors are focusing Friday on the nonfarm payrolls release for August, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), as improvements in the U.S. labor market are seen as vital for the Federal Reserve to start the withdrawal of its massive bond-buying program. 
Economists are looking for 750,000 jobs to have been created last month, a drop from July’s hefty 943,000 addition. However, in the wake of last week’s cautious economic assessment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Wednesday’s disappointing ADP private payrolls release and rising Covid-19 cases there is room for disappointment.
Also due for release later Friday, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI is likely to have dropped to 61.5 in August from 64.1 in July. 
In corporate news, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will be in the spotlight after the chip maker reported record revenue in the third quarter late Thursday and said positive momentum in its domains of Cloud, wireless, broadband and 5G infrastructure will continue.
On the flip side, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock is set to struggle Friday as the business software company forecast a drop in its impressive revenue growth rate as the boost it received from the pandemic-influenced working conditions eases.
Crude prices edged higher Friday, heading for a back-to-back weekly gain, supported by the idea that the disruption caused by Hurricane Ida could last longer than previously imagined.
Of interest later will be the release of the Baker Hughes rig count data, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s data on net positioning will also be studied for clues about the future direction of the market.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $70.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $73.45. Both contracts gained around 2% Thursday, putting both on track for small gains this week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,816/oz, while EUR/USD traded marginally lower at 1.1871.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry is ready to back  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC)'s bid to merge with memory chipmaker Kioxia provided control of cutting edge technology stays in Japan, two sources with knowledge of the industry regulator's internal discussions said.
The tie-up could give Japan greater leverage in geopolitical rivalries increasingly dominated by technology, including over shortages of chips. It could also help Japan forge deeper semiconductor industry ties with its U.S. ally, a commitment that President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Suga made in April.
""We will give our support to the indispensable, important semiconductor capacity innovation in Japan,"" one of the sources told Reuters. Western Digital would need to present a plan that both Japan and the United States ""can celebrate,"" the source added, without giving details. 
A Western Digital spokesperson in Japan wasn't able to immediately comment. 
The U.S. firm needs Japanese government acquiescence for any merger with Kioxia in order to forge a company able to rival South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) in the NAND flash memory market.
Trade and industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama has not yet publicly said whether he would back the San Jose, California-based company.
Long seen as hostile to foreign acquisitions, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) is shifting its position, the other source privy to internal discussions said.
""Our strategy on semiconductors means it no longer has to be 100% Japanese. The stance is no longer to reject everything, but to apply conditions instead,"" the source said. ""Kioxia by itself has its limits.""
IPO PLANS
A separate source last month told Reuters a merger agreement may be possible by this month, with Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler seen likely to manage the combined firm. 
But for now, Kioxia says it is sticking to a plan to sell itself in an initial public offering (IPO).
""We have said we are preparing to hold the IPO at an appropriate time, and our stance hasn't changed,"" a Kioxia executive told Reuters this week. The company, he added, was in talks with METI officials, which included discussions about support for semiconductor makers.
Kioxia, which relies on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) for around a quarter of its sales, is planning to hold an IPO in November the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Friday, citing unidentified sources.. 
It cancelled an IPO last year over concerns that Washington-Beijing tensions would squeeze sales to Chinese customers. 
Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp sold Kioxia in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion. The Japanese industrial conglomerate still owns about 40.6% of the chip company.
Whichever course the chipmaker and its owners choose, it will face stiff competition to capture more of a burgeoning market that is being driven by pandemic purchases of electronic devices from people spending more time at home, and by longer-term demand from the advent of 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence and an explosion in data storage.
Kioxia and Western Digital already jointly produce NAND chips, which don't need power to retain data and are commonly used in devices such as smartphones, TVs and data servers.
A combined Kioxia-Western Digital would control 34% of the NAND flash market, putting it on a par with Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics. South Korea's SK Hynix Inc and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) are the other large players. 
SK Hynix is waiting on regulatory approval to acquire Intel's NAND chip business for $9 billion, a hurdle that any Kioxia-Western Digital deal would face not only in Japan and the United States, but from China's State Administration for Market Regulation too. The Chinese antitrust regulator has scuppered semiconductor deals in the past, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's $44 billion bid for  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) in 2018.

""Chinese companies need memory chips from Western Digital and Kioxia. I don't think that the Chinese government will say definitely no,"" the first source said.
Both sources asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to talk to the media.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>",Not my pay! Some tech workers bemoan China's crackdown on compulsory overtime,"By Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government's campaign to improve conditions for workers has spurred companies, particularly some of its hardest-driving tech giants, to cut down on long hours of compulsory overtime but not all employees are happy about it.
Some employees at TikTok-owner ByteDance were shocked to find their August paychecks slashed 17% after the company ended its policy of requiring its China-based staff to work a six-day week every second week.
""My workload hasn't actually changed,"" a product manager at ByteDance told Reuters, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the topic. ""But unfortunately the salary is lower."" 
For the past decade, Chinese tech firms were known for ""996"", a gruelling business culture that usually means work hours from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. But 996 was also seen as a badge of honour and was hailed as a competitive advantage over U.S. and European rivals.
It was also a guarantee of high pay as Chinese law stipulates that employees are entitled to double pay for working overtime on weekends and triple pay for public holidays.
ByteDance declined to comment on the pay cuts which were widely discussed on social media. A separate company source said staff can still be paid overtime on weekends if they need to meet deadlines, adding that some employees in its gaming unit had done so recently. 
Some workers in the tech sector began pushing back against 996 about two years ago - a movement that has gathered support from authorities keen to promoting socialist values and workers rights as they push through with wide-ranging regulatory reforms. China's top court last month described 996 as illegal.
Other tech companies such as short-video platform Kuaishou and food-delivery giant Meituan have also cut compulsory weekend overtime recently.
In another boon for workers rights, ride-hailing giant Didi Global and e-commerce powerhouse JD (NASDAQ:JD).com have set up government-backed unions https://www.reuters.com/technology/didi-workers-get-union-groundbreaking-move-chinas-tech-sector-2021-09-01 in the past few weeks - a groundbreaking development in the tech sector where organised labour has to date been very rare. 
Authorities are also working to mandate more breaks for workers, especially in the food delivery sector where companies have been accused of pushing drivers to make tight deadlines at the expense of safety. 
Meituan has said it will introduce such breaks. The southern city of Xiamen has also requested that companies implement a ""20-minute break for every four hours of work"" for delivery workers, the state-run People's Daily said this week. 
Concerns remain though about unintended consequences.
""Won't this restrict their earnings?"" said one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), citing how these drivers are paid per order. ""This will cause more problems, won't they drive even faster to deliver?"" said another. 

Reduced pay could also spell trouble for staff retention and the topic of whether companies should be raising salaries to compensate workers for their loss of overtime became one of the most viewed on Weibo this week, with over 120 million views.
“After receiving my paycheck this month, I want to know - are there other companies that still practice 996 in Shanghai?” posted a ByteDance employee.

297,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",City of Beijing Said to Seek Taking Didi Under State Control,"(Bloomberg) -- Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in Didi Global Inc. that would give state-run firms control of the world’s largest ride-hailing company, according to people familiar with the matter.
Under the preliminary proposal, Shouqi Group -- part of the influential Beijing Tourism Group -- and other firms based in the capital would acquire a stake in Didi, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Scenarios under consideration include the consortium taking a so-called “golden share” with veto power and a board seat, they added.
Didi’s shares spiked 8% before paring gains to about 3% higher in pre-market trading in New York. It’s unclear how large a stake the city is eyeing and whether its proposal will be approved by senior government officials. Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank Group Corp. and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.
Representatives for Didi didn’t respond to a written request for comment. The Beijing municipal party committee press office didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment, while repeated calls to a phone number provided by Shouqi staff went unanswered. And the Beijing Tourism group didn’t reply to a request for comment faxed to a general office number provided by a receptionist.
Local governments have traditionally had a big say in the restructuring of companies on their turf, and the envisioned solution dovetails with Xi Jinping’s priorities of redistributing wealth and curbing the influence of the internet sector. The city’s proposal could entail taking a sizeable slice of Didi or a nominal stake accompanied by a golden share and board seat, the people said. The latter model would be akin to an earlier investment by the government in ByteDance Ltd.’s Chinese unit, which gave the state entity veto-rights over important decisions.
The takeover proposal comes alongside a swath of penalties Xi’s administration is considering for the country’s ride-hailing leader, which debuted in New York in June over the objections of the Cyberspace Administration of China. The internet industry overseer saw that decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority and officials from the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiated an on-site inspection at Didi’s offices in July.
It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported. They are said to include getting Didi to hand over its troves of data to a third party and a delisting from U.S. bourses.
The central thrust of the Beijing government’s proposal is to regain control over one of the city’s largest corporations, particularly data that it hoovers up from hundreds of millions of users daily -- a fount considered vital to the economy and social stability. China’s government has proposed creating a joint venture with internet firms that would oversee that kind of information, a project led by the People’s Bank of China, Bloomberg News has reported.
Shouqi, which in 2015 set up a ride-hailing service known as Shouqi Yueche that now has more than 100 million users nationwide, will play a role in helping operate its larger rival. The company is one of the most important assets of the Beijing Tourism Group, which runs a chain of travel agencies, malls, restaurants and hotels across the capital.
In addition, Chinese regulators are considering severe penalties for Didi, ranging from a fine to the suspension of certain operations, Bloomberg News has reported. Also possible is a forced delisting or withdrawal of Didi’s U.S. shares, although it’s unclear how such an option would play out. A delisting and privatization of Didi remains on the table should the central government green-light the plan envisioned by Beijing’s municipal government, the people said. 
Whatever the outcome, Beijing is likely to impose harsher sanctions on Didi than on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., which swallowed a record $2.8 billion fine after a months-long antitrust investigation and agreed to initiate measures to protect merchants and customers, Bloomberg News has reported.
Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched a swath of local and foreign investors in the process.
Its controversial June 30 IPO was the trigger for a renewed assault on internet giants that expanded beyond unfair competition in online commerce to encompass everything from private online education to social media, at one point wiping out more than $1 trillion of market value from Chinese stocks. That campaign is into its 11th month, a roller-coaster ordeal that’s prompting investors to ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. and Alibaba to food delivery giant Meituan.
It’s unclear now what lies in store for Didi, which has shed a third of its market value since raising $4.4 billion via the second-biggest American initial public offering for a Chinese company. The debut -- which followed years of run-ins with regulators after a pair of murders in its network provoked a public backlash -- turned co-founder Cheng into a billionaire and rewarded long-time backers SoftBank, Tiger Global Management and Temasek Holdings Pte.
Didi to this day relies on a large number of technically unlicensed drivers and cars to provide some 25 million daily rides. On Thursday, the transport ministry spooked investors by warning that Didi and its rivals must come up with plans to fix such violations by December -- the latest in a barrage of warnings for sharing economy giants.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs)'s top executive vowed to double down on efforts to regain market share lost in China after Sweden blocked Chinese suppliers from its 5G roll-out, a move that antagonised Beijing and has hit the equipment maker's business.
China accounted for about 10% of Ericsson's revenue last year, but that fell sharply after the company's home country of Sweden banned https://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-huawei-int-idUSKBN2750WA Huawei from its 5G networks, citing security risks - a charge that Huawei has strongly denied https://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-5g-huawei-idUKKBN28H1L0.
Ericsson was awarded https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-china-5g-nokia-idCAKBN2EP17O-OCATC about 2% of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL)'s 5G contract, down from 11% last year, and got https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ericsson-gets-5g-radio-contracts-china-nokia-disappoints-sources-2021-08-02 a 3% share in a joint 5G radio contract from China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU).
""We have been in China for 120 years and I don't intend to give up easily,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said in an interview with Reuters. ""We are going to show that we can add value to China."" 
Ericsson had lobbied the Swedish government in favour of Huawei, warning https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ericsson-quarterly-core-profit-misses-china-sales-fall-2021-07-16 of possible retaliation by China, but the ban went through and has been upheld https://www.reuters.com/technology/swedish-court-upholds-ban-huawei-selling-5g-network-gear-2021-06-22 in court.
""I don't believe we have had any help from the Swedish government to be honest,"" Ekholm said.
Analysts have warned Ericsson, based in the Swedish tech hub Kista north of Stockholm, could https://www.reuters.com/technology/ericssons-china-ambitions-jeopardy-over-swedens-huawei-ban-2021-05-19 lose a majority of its China business with contracts going to Nordic rival Nokia (NYSE:NOK). 
While Finland's Nokia, which didn't get any radio contracts in China last year, landed its first one in the second round of awards, Ericsson has been able to retain a slight edge so far. 
""If we had lost out completely then it would have put us at a competitive disadvantage from a technology point of view,"" Ekholm said.
China has been at the forefront of deploying 5G networks and accounts for more than half of the equipment used globally for the next generation network, making it a critical market for any telecom equipment maker.
Beyond the vast sales volumes, being a front runner means China provides a test bed for advanced 5G technologies which Ericsson and Nokia could tap into when deploying networks across the world.
Ericsson, a dominant supplier of gear in China for previous generations of telecom technology, had made bold steps to win contracts in the country, including taking a hit of 1.3 billion crowns ($152 million) due to writedowns of product inventory.
Writedowns are generally recouped as companies sell additional equipment and make up for the losses in the long run, but losing future contracts make the losses more significant.
""The interesting thing with bandwidth is that it is addictive. Once you have it, you want more. The large data consumption in China will be a driver of future technology needs,"" Ekholm said.

""Now we need to make sure that we regain the volume elsewhere, as well as in China.""

JD Property Group offered to buy a 26.38% stake in China Logistics for HK$4.35 per share from its top shareholder, Yupei International Investment Management.
That would take JD.com's stake in China Logistics to about 35.8%, making it mandatory under the Hong Kong takeover code for the e-commerce giant to make a general offer for the whole company.
The offer price of HK$4.35 apiece represents a 7.4% premium to China Logistics' last close of HK$4.05 on Wednesday.
China Logistics shares were halted on Thursday, pending the announcement. It has applied to the stock exchange to resume trading in its shares from Monday.

Last week, Bloomberg News reported that the Chinese e-commerce giant was in advanced talks to buy a controlling stake in China Logistics, citing people familiar with the matter.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to discuss two key questions when they meet on Sept. 17 to consider a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign this fall: Is protection from the initial shots waning, and will boosters help?
The debate will likely be heated following the Biden Administration's announcement last month - before the experts could weigh in - that the U.S. plans to start booster doses Sept. 20 if regulators approve them.
The White House move usurped the normal process in which the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention make these sort of science-based decisions, according to interviews with six current and former FDA scientists and CDC advisory panel members.
On Wednesday, the FDA set the meeting date to consider a third booster shot of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE vaccine and may discuss others.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc submitted data to the FDA for consideration of its booster and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last week said it was in discussions with the agency about one.
""The recommendation shouldn't precede the data, which is what happened here. And that's why people are so upset,"" said a source close to the FDA advisory panel who was not authorized to speak on the record. 
These experts took the FDA's decision to hold an advisory panel meeting on boosters as a promising sign that their opinions will be heeded, but said a favorable outcome is not guaranteed.
Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University in Washington and a former chief scientist at the FDA, said the agency will need to go through all the relevant data before Sept. 17 to be ready for the panel meeting.
""We need to see that there is a meaningful boost in antibody levels and there are no red flags,"" he said.
That will be challenging given that scientists still do not agree on the level of antibodies in the blood that predict vaccine protection, said Norman Baylor, chief executive of Biologics Consulting and former director of FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.
Much of the drug company argument in favor of boosters hinges on data that show antibodies wane over time and that another shot increases them. 
""One of the things that committee members have to struggle with is ... what does this mean?"" Baylor said. ""You see an increase, but is that increase sufficient? And for how long?""
'SHOW THE DATA'
A fierce debate is expected around whether most Americans should get another shot rather than just those at high risk of severe illness, such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/most-vaccinated-americans-want-covid-19-booster-shots-reutersipsos-poll-2021-09-01 this week found that most vaccinated Americans want the additional dose.
""You've got to show the data - show me that you're solving an important public health problem,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, a former FDA vaccine advisory panel member and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.
The issue, according to Poland and others, is that the current crop of vaccines were designed to prevent hospitalization and death, which the CDC says they continue to do.
The Biden Administration has taken a cue from Israel, where early data shows that a booster campaign appears to be lowering transmission of the virulent Delta variant, which has begun to cause mostly asymptomatic and mild infections in fully vaccinated people.
Boosters would increase antibody levels, which fight infections. But immune memory from other components of the immune system is what offers protection from severe disease and hospitalization, and that can last for years. 
""No matter how many booster doses you give, you cannot convert a disease-blocking vaccine into an infection-blocking vaccine,"" Poland said.

Whatever the United States decides will likely influence decisions about boosters in other parts of the world, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
""I think you'll probably see a trend in high-income countries to boost if the FDA grants them,"" he said.

The expansion by China's largest chipmaker comes as the shortage rattled the automotive and electronics industries, spurring new capacity plans by firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp Ltd and GlobalFoundries.
SMIC said it agreed to build a production line with monthly capacity of 100,000 12-inch wafers in the Lingang Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in the Pudong district of China's business hub. 
The plan will focus on integrated circuit foundry and technology services on process nodes for 28-nanometers and above, backed by a joint venture majority-owned by SMIC. 
The joint venture partner is the Lingang FTZ, and the company said it would seek other investors in the firm with registered capital of $5.5 billion. 
Other companies with plants in the zone are Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
SMIC is partly backed by China's state-affiliated chip fund.
In the last decade, the government has poured billions from the fund into helping domestic chip companies catch up with global rivals in the Japan, Korea and the United Staets, though SMIC lags counterparts there. SMIC's unveiling of the new fab follows similar expansion plans in recent months for new plants in Shenzhen and Beijing. 

The firm is also on a U.S. government blacklist that denies it advanced manufacturing equipment from U.S. suppliers. The United States cited national security concerns and SMIC has denied having ties to China's military. 
The measures disrupted the company's plans to move into high-end chip making, but its financial performance has been strong as the chip shortage has boosted demand.

China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) is seeking public advice on the draft and the amendments it makes to a 2010 version of the rules regulating such companies.
The proposed changes include requiring insurance group companies to build a clear and transparent shareholding structure and set up mechanisms to alert potential contagious risks, according to a statement on the regulator's website. 
It would also ask the insurance group companies to enhance oversight of their non-insurance subsidiaries and make disclosures accordingly. 
The regulator would implement a ""thorough, continuous and penetrating supervision"" over insurance group companies to effectively prevent their operational risks with the draft rules, CBIRC said. 

China has 12 insurance group companies including Ping An Insurance Group Co and Dajia Insurance Group Co., the revamped entity of embattled Anbang Insurance Group.
CBIRC is probing Ping An Insurance's investments in the property market, Reuters reported on Monday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter, after the firm took a big profit hit from a soured bet.

Investing.com – DocuSign stock (NASDAQ:DOCU) traded lower in Friday’s premarket as the company’s higher guidance fell short of expectations.
The company is now forecasting a maximum 39% jump in its annual revenue which, compared with 49% on-year growth in the previous financial year, reflects a slowdown from the first waves of the pandemic. 
DocuSign, like many digital-based companies, benefited immensely during the pandemic as companies embraced its solutions to onboard employees and manage workflow. With more companies going back to the office work model, that business may be past its peak for now, even if its trajectory is still higher than before Covid-19 erupted.
The company now sees its annual revenue at $2.08 billion at midpoint, an increase of some 2% from its June guidance.
In the ongoing quarter, the company sees revenue of $529 million at midpoint.
Total revenue in the second quarter was $511.8 million, up 50%.
Adjusted profit per share more than tripled to 47 cents per share. Both revenue and EPS came ahead of expectations."

Although China's securities regulator said the planned Beijing stock exchange is based on the city's existing New Third Board, and complements Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, some fear a rivalry for listing resources is inevitable.
""The Beijing stock exchange has equal footing with Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. If it prospers, the three will share the market in tripartite confrontation,"" wrote Rock Jin, economist and CEO of investment adviser PopEton.
Although it was good news for the economy, it boded ill for the market in the short term because ""after all, it diverts capital away from Shanghai and Shenzhen markets."" 
Xi unveiled plans for the new exchange in a video address at the opening of a conference late on Thursday. The bourse will serve innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and is part of a reform of Beijing's New Third Board.
Neither Xi nor the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said if the Beijing stock exchange would attract overseas-listed firms. If that is the case, ""it would increase the competition"" in listings for the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx), Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. 
HKEx shares dropped more than 2% on Friday and Shenzhen's ChiNext fell over 1%, both underperforming the broader market. 
But shares of brokerages, including Northeast Securities Co, Dongxing Securities Co and Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co jumped, as investors bet they will benefit from more initial public offerings (IPOs). 
""This is a step forward in capital market reforms, as it enhances the multi-layered capital market system and direct financing,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The bank added that the implementation of a registration-based IPO mechanism on the Beijing exchange paves the way for the rollout of the listing system on China's main boards. Currently, only Shenzhen's ChiNext, and Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market adopts the U.S.-style IPO system.
FUNDING DIFFICULTY 
China is launching the new exchange as part of efforts to channel more household savings into the stock market to fund innovation and economic recovery, while reducing the economy's reliance on bank lending. It also comes as U.S.-listed Chinese companies face the risk of delisting amid Sino-U.S. tensions.
""Funding difficulty is the main challenge facing SMEs,"" wrote Liu Hui, fund manager at Invesco.
""Supporting SMEs with direct financing helps promote China's consumption, as SMEs employ most of the labour force in China."" 
CSRC said on Friday that the new exchange will be based on the current ""select tier"" of Beijing's New Third Board, meaning all the 66 companies listed in that tier will be transferred to the Beijing exchange. 
CSRC also announced draft rules for share sales, trading and delisting on the new venue. Companies to be listed on the Beijing exchange are ""smaller and newer"" than those listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and eligible ones can also migrate to the other two bourses seamlessly, CSRC official Zhou Guihua told a press conference on Friday.
In addition, only qualified investors can trade on the Beijing exchange, which sets higher bar in line with the higher risks involved in investing in SMEs, he said. 
Zhou also vowed to crack down on insider trading, stock manipulation and false disclosures, in order to promote long-term, rational investing on the new board. 
The New Third Board, which was set up in 2013, currently houses a total of 7,299 SMEs, mostly in the ""base tier"" and ""innovation tier"". 

The board once attracted more than 10,000 companies listed in 2013-16, but the market has suffered from poor liquidity since China's spectacular 2015 market boom and bust.
Economist Jin said it was a big question mark whether the new exchange would thrive, as ""the city of Beijing doesn't have the right culture for an exchange.""

LONDON (Reuters) -French investment firm Antin Infrastructure Partners is looking to launch an initial public offering (IPO) on Euronext Paris and has hired banks to work on the deal, the company said on Friday.
The flotation will involve a capital increase of about 350 million euros ($416 million) through the issuance of new shares as well as a limited sale of existing shares by the company's co-founders, Antin said.
The deal will help Antin, one of the world's leading infrastructure investment firms with approximately 20 billion euros in assets under management, to accelerate growth and diversify its investment portfolio while also strengthening its brand.
Speaking at a news conference, Antin's co-founder Alain Rauscher declined to say what market valuation the company expected to reach with the IPO.
Asked about whether Antin might be interested in buying an asset management firm, Rauscher said the company had no plans to do so.
""For now it is not on the agenda,"" he said.
Antin's IPO comes after rival private equity firm Bridgepoint went public in July in a deal that saw its value rise by more than a fifth on its London stock market debut.
Other buyout funds including L Catterton - the private equity firm backed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault and luxury goods empire Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy - are considering tapping public markets at a time when private equity buyouts have hit record volumes with activity rising 152% in the first six months of the year to $512 billion, representing 18% of global M&A volumes. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the joint global coordinators on the Antin deal while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the joint bookrunners.
Rauscher and Mark Crosbie founded Antin Infrastructure Partners in 2007. The company has around 140 employees, including 75 investment professionals based in Paris, London and New York.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY)'s new rules for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are likely to help it attract regional funds and fast-growing firms, as it seeks to revitalise a staid market for equity listings, market participants said.
Some of them expect Southeast Asian startups, especially from the tech sector, to take advantage of SGX becoming the first Asian bourse to allow SPAC listings since the investment frenzy in SPACs started in the United States last year, although the interest is peaking there.
SPACs raise money on stock markets to buy private companies, giving those businesses a quick and cheap route to a listing.
""As long term investors in building companies, we are confident this is a useful tool to have in our quiver,"" said Loke Wai San, co-founder and managing director at Novo Tellus Capital Partners, a Southeast Asian industrial-technology focussed buyout fund.
Loke said Novo Tellus was optimistic of listing a SPAC within six months and had been studying potential targets as part of a so-called deSPAC process.
SGX's rules, which come into effect from Friday, https://www.reuters.com/article/sgx-regulation-spacs/update-1-singapore-exchange-targets-spac-hopefuls-with-relaxed-rules-idUSL1N2Q40ON follow an initial proposal it issued in late March that had stricter rules than U.S. markets.
SGX has now halved the minimum market capitalisation for SPACs to S$150 million ($112 million), and allowed warrants to be detachable from underlying shares - a move seen as making SPAC investments potentially more attractive.
Lawyers Nick Davies and Laura Luo at King & Wood Mallesons said the changes would make a larger pool of target companies eligible for deSPAC listings on SGX, and potentially enable SGX SPACs to provide much needed capital to hit a ""mid-market"" sweet spot for would-be SPAC targets.
SGX shares rose 1% in a weak broader market on Friday.
""Companies in the real estate, consumer and infrastructure space have traditionally fuelled the growth in Singapore's capital markets,"" said Vineet Mishra, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s co-head of Southeast Asia investment banking. ""By expanding the products range to include SPACs, there might be the opportunity for fast-growing companies to also access these markets.""
Hampered by a small base of retail investors, SGX has struggled to capture big regional IPOs, but as Southeast Asian startups begin to attract global attention and raise funds at huge valuations, SGX is spotting an opportunity.
The moves also come as the city-state provides funding and light-touch regulation and establishes itself as a fintech hub.
""The feedback from the market is very clear that Asian SPACs for Asian targets make a lot of sense because the investors here are more familiar with the targets and are in the same time zone,"" said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of Singapore Exchange Regulation.
Across Asia, Hong Kong and Indonesia are studying the listing of SPACs, while Britain has eased rules https://www.reuters.com/business/britain-eases-spac-rules-attract-listings-2021-07-27. But SPACs have lost some of their lustre in the United States as regulators there have been clamping down on them.

""We are actively watching SPAC sponsors that come out to list on SGX,"" said Darius Cheung, CEO of property portal 99.co, a potential IPO candidate.

The cases would be modelled on one brought against Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) in the Netherlands last year arguing the company's lack of climate action constituted a failure in its duty of care to citizens, which led to a court ruling in May mandating the company to reduce its CO2 output by 45% from 2019 levels by 2030.
Greenpeace and DUH demand that the automakers stop producing combustion engine cars by 2030 - earlier than the 2035 effective ban proposed by the EU in July - and that Wintershall Dea refrains from exploring any new oil and gas fields from 2026.
These deadlines are necessary to meet the goals of the Paris climate accords and German climate law, the NGOs argue.

They set a deadline of a few weeks for the companies to respond to their demands. Should they fail to do so, the NGOs will file lawsuits in German courts, they said.
Daimler and BMW said they were committed to the goals of the Paris climate accords and were already on the path to climate neutrality. Wintershall DEA and Volkswagen were not immediately available for comment.

The carmaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, said sales fell 10.6% from a year ago in August, despite strong underlying demand, and cautioned the potential decline in volumes in the second half could impact revenue and profit.
""But Volvo Cars' outlook for the full year 2021 still remains,"" it said in a statement, referring to a forecast of sales volume and revenue growth with improved profitability to pre-pandemic levels.
Volvo Cars said supplier shut-downs since mid-July - due to local efforts to limit the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant in South-East Asia - had worsened an already strained supply situation, forcing it to halt production.

A global chip shortage over the past year had already caused a major delay in manufacturing activity and forced several automakers to scale back output.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in tight trading ranges Friday as investors await the release of key U.S. employment data, which could influence future Federal Reserve monetary policy.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%.
The main focus Friday will be the publication of U.S. nonfarm payroll data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with hiring likely to have slowed considerably in August to 750,000, after adding 943,000 jobs in July, growing at its fastest pace in nearly a year.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has made it clear that an improvement in employment numbers is the remaining major prerequisite for the central bank to start reining in its extraordinary monetary stimulus. 
However, anecdotal evidence has suggested some slowing of the economy in recent weeks as a fresh wave of the pandemic has gained force. Investors will thus be looking to the jobs data for a better sense of the timing and pace of U.S. tapering, given that the Fed's liquidity creation has been the driving force behind the rally of the last 18 months.
Back in Europe, the final services and composite PMI readings are due out of the Eurozone later Friday, with downgrades likely as the rise of Covid-19 cases weighing on the continent’s economic recovery.
Earlier Friday, data out of China showed the country’s services sector entering contraction territory in August, with the Caixin services purchasing managers’ index falling to 46.7, the lowest level since April 2020. 
In corporate news, Berkeley Group (OTC:BKGFY) stock rose 0.5% after the U.K.-based house builder said it expects its full-year profit to be at least as good as last year's. However, it also warned that it was seeing construction cost inflation as well as supply chain and labor market issues.
Covestro (DE:1COV) stock rose 0.5% after the German chemicals maker confirmed that it plans to cut up to 1,700 of its 16,500 jobs worldwide, 
Crude prices traded largely unchanged Friday, with traders wary of taking large positions ahead of the key payrolls report.
Still, the oil market is headed for a back-to-back weekly gain, supported by a larger-than-expected reduction in U.S. crude inventories in the run-up to the disruption caused by Hurricane Ida.
These gains came even as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, confirmed its intention to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply in October. OPEC raised its demand forecasts for next year at the same time.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $69.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $73.09. Both contracts gained around 2% Thursday, putting both on track for small gains this week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,813.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1878.

Today was going to be all about U.S. non-farm payroll numbers - the gauge that might help the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell determine the timing of tapering. 
That was until Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced he would step down after failing to control the COVID-19 outbreak, setting the stage for a new premier. 
And then there's China data, showing the services sector slumping into sharp contraction in August as restrictions to curb the Delta variant threatened to derail the recovery in the world's second-biggest economy. 
However, change can be a good thing and bad data can spur hopes of more stimulus. 
Japanese stocks soared 1.5% to a three-decade peak, as Suga's departure reduces risks of a big loss for his party at elections later this month. 
Equities in Europe and the U.S. look on track to end the week on a high, though Chinese shares slipped almost 1%. 
All that optimism has knocked the dollar to one-month lows, and kept a lid on global yields while commodities continued their rebound. 
But back to payrolls: the United States is expected to have added 728,000 jobs in August, after weekly data on Thursday showed layoffs at their lowest level in almost a quarter of a century.
Nearly 1.9 million jobs were created in June and July, and economists gradually trimmed their forecasts for August in recent days. Elsewhere though, the day looks thin on data with final PMIs and retail sales due for the euro zone. 
On the corporate front, UK homebuilder Berkeley is the latest to flag construction cost inflation due to the usual labour and supply chain bottlenecks

The warning comes close on the heels of top builder  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV) on Thursday flagging a 4-5% rise in construction costs in what was the first major indication of inflationary pressures in an otherwise vibrant housing market.
Cobham-headquartered Berkeley said ""operating environment remains challenging"" but the company declined to give additional details when Reuters requested for information on the specifics of the supply chain disruptions.
The British government last week rejected calls from retail and logistics firms to temporarily ease post-Brexit immigration rules which they say are contributing to a shortage of truck drivers and acute supply chain disruption, but statements from Barratt and Berkeley point to a wider impact.

Berkeley, which operates mainly in London, Birmingham and the South of England, said it expects pre-tax profit for the year ending April 30, 2022 to be at par or ahead of the corresponding year-ago period.
The UK market has been underpinned by a temporary tax break for homebuyers set in place during the COVID-19 crisis, and prices unexpectedly bounced back strongly in August after a fall the month before when the break began to be phased out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday barred Virgin Galactic from flying its SpaceShipTwo until the agency approves its final mishap investigation report from its July flight or determines the issues do not affect public safety.
The FAA confirmed on Wednesday it was investigating a deviation in the descent of the flight of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane that carried British billionaire Richard Branson to the edge of space https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 on July 11.
The FAA, responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry, said ""SpaceShipTwo deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America"" in New Mexico.
""Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,"" the agency said.
In response to the FAA statement, Virgin Galactic said it was ""addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions.""
The company added the deviation in the July flight known as Unity 22 was ""a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger."" 
It added it has ""been working closely with the FAA to support a thorough review and timely resolution of this issue."" 
Earlier, Virgin Galactic said ""the flight did drop below the altitude of the airspace ... for a short distance and time (1 minute and 41 seconds).""

On Wednesday, Virgin Galactic said it was planning another SpaceShipTwo flight from New Mexico and targeting a flight window in late September or early October, pending technical checks and weather. That flight is to carry three crew from the Italian Air Force and National Research Council, it added.
Branson was among six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the July flight, soaring https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 more than 50 miles (80 km) above the New Mexico desert.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday it has dispatched a surveillance aircraft to an area in Louisiana hard hit by Hurricane Ida that includes a refinery where an apparent oil spill has been reported.
The aircraft dispatched from Texas will gather data on the Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) refinery and other priority sites, an EPA spokesman told Reuters.
""EPA's ASPECT aircraft – the Agency's airborne real-time chemical and radiological detection, infrared and photographic imagery platform – has been activated to support the state of Louisiana,"" the spokesman said.
Phillips 66 said earlier that flooding had occurred at its Alliance Refinery and a sheen of unknown origin in some flooded areas of the refinery had been discovered.
""At this time, the sheen appears to be secured and contained within refinery grounds. Clean-up crews are on site. The incident was reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies upon discovery"", the company said.
""A full post-storm assessment remains underway at the refinery. An investigation into the cause/origin of the sheen will be conducted. The refinery remains shut down"", it added.
The Associated Press has also reported a possible spill near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after a review of aerial images of the disaster zone taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The photographs appeared to show a miles-long brownish-black slick in the waters south of Port Fourchon, Louisiana.
The rig had Enterprise Offshore Drilling marked on its helipad. Enterprise Offshore Drilling said in a statement on its website that its rig had not suffered any damage or failure and that ""no environmental discharges had occurred from our facility"".
The U.S. Coast Guard told the AP it also had an aircraft fly over the refinery as well as to the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast Guard did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday.

Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the U.S. Gulf Coast, made landfall on Sunday in Louisiana, destroying entire communities.
The Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office said that state regulators were still in the very early stages of responding to the environmental hazards brought by Ida.

Nornickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer, had previously paid $2 billion for environmental damages from the leak of 21,000 tonnes of diesel into rivers and subsoil from a storage tank at its power plant in May 2020.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to trade cautiously higher Friday as investors await the release of key U.S. employment data, which could influence future Federal Reserve monetary policy.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%.
The main focus Friday will be the publication of U.S. nonfarm payroll data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with hiring likely to have slowed considerably in August to 750,000, after adding 943,000 jobs in July, growing at its fastest pace in nearly a year.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has made it clear that an improvement in employment numbers is the remaining major prerequisite for the central bank to start reining in its extraordinary monetary stimulus. However, anecdotal evidence has suggested some slowing of the economy in recent weeks as a fresh wave of the pandemic has gained force. Investors will thus be looking to the jobs data for a better sense of the timing and pace of U.S. tapering, given that the Fed's liquidity creation has been the driving force behind the rally of the last 18 months.
Ahead of this, European markets received a mixed handover from Asia. Japan’s Nikkei gained 2% after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Friday he would step down, ending a short reign marred by an unpopular Covid-19 response.
However, Chinese stocks were held back by the country’s services sector entering contraction territory in August, with the Caixin services purchasing managers’ index falling to 46.7, the lowest level since April 2020. 
Back in Europe, the day's main economic data are August services PMIs and July retail sales data for the Eurozone.
Crude prices were mixed Friday, with traders wary of taking large positions ahead of the key payrolls report.
That said, the oil market is headed for a back-to-back weekly gain, supported by a larger-than-expected reduction in U.S. crude inventories in the run-up to the disruption caused by Hurricane Ida.
These gains came even as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, confirmed its intention to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply in October. OPEC raised its demand forecasts for next year at the same time.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $69.95 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $73.13. Both contracts gained around 2% Thursday, putting both on track for small gains this week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,814.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1878.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A U.S. national labor agency is investigating two charges against tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed by employees, records on its website show, amid a wave of worker activism at a company known for its secretive culture.
The charges, filed on Aug. 26 and Sept. 1, are being reviewed by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board's office in Oakland, California. The agency declined to comment. 
""We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised,"" Apple, which is based in Cupertino, California, said in a statement that cited employee privacy in declining to discuss specifics. 
Ashley Gjovik, a senior engineering program manager at Apple, told Reuters that she filed the Aug. 26 charge, which cites harassment by a manager, reduction of responsibilities and increases in unfavorable work, among other complaints.
The Sept. 1 charge was filed by Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer who said the company repeatedly stopped discussions of pay among employees.
The documents she sent the agency, which she provided to Reuters, say Apple ""engaged in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.""
The labor relations agency investigates all charges it receives, and launches a prosecution against the employer if merited.
Workers in Silicon Valley, and especially those of Apple, are known to avoid publicity, reflecting companies' desire to keep new products tightly under wraps.
In recent weeks, some current and former Apple workers have critiqued company culture on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), using the hashtag #AppleToo. U.S. law allows employees to openly discuss certain topics, such as working conditions.
In addition, workers have engaged in a heated debate on the messaging platform Slack about Apple's move to scan U.S. customer phones and computers for child sex abuse images, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apples-child-protection-features-spark-concern-within-its-own-ranks-2021-08-12.
In a letter accompanying her NLRB charge, Scarlett wrote that Apple employees began a pay equity survey in April, but the company blocked them, citing privacy concerns.
It also halted subsequent surveys, including one that aimed to address the privacy issues, Scarlett added. 
In late August, Apple denied employees' request to create a Slack channel to discuss pay equity, which Scarlett told Reuters was ""the last straw"" that led her to file the complaint.
Gjovik told Reuters that after Apple started investigating her complaints, as well as accusations of sexism, her managers began re-assigning her work to colleagues and loading her up with undesirable tasks.
The company put her on paid administrative leave in early August. She said Apple had not finished its investigation.

Gjovik said she felt encouraged after seeing more employees speaking out about the company's culture in recent weeks.
""The biggest obstacle for making progress at Apple is the culture of secrecy and alienation,"" she said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian earnings season bonanza for shareholders has masked a more uncertain outlook for the corporate sector as the Delta COVID variant threatens to tip an economy that was surging only months ago back into its second recession in as many years.
Australian-listed companies delivered a record A$38 billion ($28 billion) in promised dividends to investors in the season that ended this week, driven by banks and mining companies.
However, when it came to the corporate outlook, companies had much less cheer to offer.
""Companies really pulled back on giving outlook statements given the uncertainties,"" said Brad Potter, the head of Australian Equities at Tyndall Asset Management.
""I think the resilience of the economy has been amazing but given the situation that we're in, I don't think anyone is particularly bullish.""
Earnings reported by Australia's top 200 companies in August for the 2021 year came in slightly above expectations, Eikon data shows, even as COVID-19 threw most of the country into lockdown.
However, with the Delta variant and declines in commodity prices from record highs threatening to tip the economy into a recession, buy-side analysts and investors have downgraded earnings and dividend forecasts.
Following a whopping 37% increase in aggregate reported earnings by the 156 companies covered by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in fiscal 2021, the broker cut its forecast for fiscal 2022 by 2.9% to A$124 billion.
That included a cut of about 5% for the banking sector, due to soft core earnings prospects and about 4% for mining companies, driven by sharp falls in iron ore prices. [IRONORE/]
Dividend consensus expectations for the year also fell by about 3.1%, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""It does seem that the upward revision momentum in the near term has slowed down,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) portfolio manager Mike Jenneke said. 
That would still leave a very robust expectation of 16% growth in earnings by Citi this fiscal year, as vaccination rates amongst 25 million Australians increase, and pent-up demand drives an earnings rebound in the second half, particularly in the financials, materials and consumer discretionary sectors.
By comparison, Reuters data showed profits at U.S. firms are estimated to decline 7.2% in the third quarter, after rising 12.4% in the second quarter. 
On a calendar year basis, global earnings are expected to grow 8% in 2022, after a 46% jump in 2021, according to Credit Suisse.
In Australia, over A$18 billion worth of share buybacks have been announced on top of the 80% jump in dividends declared during the reporting season, while record M&A is expected to deliver an extra windfall.
""There's a whole lot of cash that is going to be hitting investor's bank accounts over the next few months from those dividends,"" said Hugh Dive, Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Funds Management Chief Investment Officer.
""Looking ahead is a bit uncertain, even for the companies that have done very well and are tracking very strong numbers, it's going to be difficult for them to keep going.""
Diagnostics firm Sonic Healthcare (OTC:SKHHY), whose profit more than doubled to A$1.3 billion, declined to provide earnings guidance saying the pandemic had the ""potential to cause fluctuations in both COVID-19 testing revenues and the base business"". 

Others withholding explicit earnings guidance included hospital owner Ramsay Healthcare, retailer  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) and waste management firm Cleanaway Waste Management (NYSE:WM).

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian unit of U.S. commodities trader Cargill has finished building a new facility to produce pectin, a fruit by-product used in jams, beverages, dairy products and confectionery, the company said on Friday. 
The plant is Cargill's only pectin facility outside of Europe, where it owns three such units. 
It will make Cargill the world's second largest producer of the food ingredient, Laerte Moraes, Cargill's director for starches and sweeteners in South America, said in an interview. 
Located close to Brazil's orange belt - where Cargill will source orange peel as the raw material - the factory should help trim company production costs as currently two of its plants in Europe have to import orange peels for processing there.
The Brazilian unit will mainly cater to export markets, particularly clients in Asia, and will employ 120 people, the company said.
Cargill's move reflects a need to balance large-volume businesses that have lower margins while boosting its presence in market segments with smaller volumes but higher prices. 
It is also a response to evolving industrial customer and consumer dietary requirements. Global demand for pectin, a natural ingredient that can be used as an emulsifier, stabilizer and thickener agent in cooking and baking, is expected to grow by up to 4% per year, Cargill said. 
The company, one of the largest soy and corn traders in Brazil, announced construction of the new plant in 2018. Though the work was slightly delayed in 2020 due to the pandemic-related restrictions, the plant will begin operations this month, Moraes said.
The new plant can produce some 6,000 tonnes per year of the high-value product, a kilogram of which can cost between $15 and $20, Moraes said.

Cargill invested 550 million reais ($106.52 million) in the factory, according to Moraes.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning even as the latest Chinese economic data disappointed. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report which they hope will provide clues on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy moving forward.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.14% by 9:51 PM ET (1:51 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was steady at 14,277.34. The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for August was a disappointing 46.7, below the 50-mark indicating growth.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.86%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.37%, with the country’s services PMI at 42.9 in August.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.46%. In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.48%, after the release of retail sales data earlier in the day.
With labor market recovery a condition for the Fed to begin asset tapering and hikes interest rates, investors’ focus is on the U.S. jobs report, which includes non-farm payrolls and is due later in the day.
The report is another potential test of the current market calm, which so far has weathered risks to economic re-opening from COVID-19 outbreaks involving variants and a monetary policy that is potentially less expansive.
However, concerns about economic expansion are overdone, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts who pointed to possible gains in cyclical assets in the near future.

Meanwhile, a political debate over planned U.S. fiscal outlays is also on investors’ radars. Senator Joe Manchin demanded a “strategic pause” in action on U.S. President Joe Biden’s economic agenda, jeopardizing a proposed $3.5 trillion tax and spending package."
326,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 09:21PM ET</span>","Analysis-Apple's App Store concessions fail to address top concerns of regulators, lawmakers","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - In the space of a week, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) made two sets of changes to its App Store rules, which are the subject of lawsuits, regulatory probes and legislation around the world, but the tweaks do not address the biggest concerns raised.
Lawmakers and regulators are considering dismantling the App Store business model, an outcome that could cost Apple about 6% of its sales - an amount equal to $16 billion in its last fiscal year - and shave up to 15% off its profit, according to an estimate last year from analyst firm Cowen.
Among Apple's most high-profile concessions is allowing Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other subscription services to provide a link to out-of-app paid signups that avoid Apple commissions. But many of the largest such companies had already quit using Apple's payment systems long ago, so the move is unlikely to affect Apple's finances.
That is a sign that any fight over Apple's rules will likely continue even if Apple wins in the threat closest to hand - a U.S. federal judge who is due any day to announce a ruling in an antitrust case brought by ""Fortnite"" game maker Epic Games.
“Mobile technologies have become essential to our daily lives, and now just two app stores wield incredible power over which apps consumers can access and how they access them,"" U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who sponsored an app store bill, said this week. ""When you see this same issue arising all over the world, it is even more obvious that we need to take action.""
Some of the loudest cries are for Apple to allow app stores run by other companies on its iPhone, which would provide a path around the current payments system that gives developers little ability to avoid giving Apple a cut. Critics also want the company to abolish so-called steering rules that stop developers from telling their customers how to pay developers directly for their apps.
Developers could sidestep Apple's rules altogether if they were allowed to install software on iPhones without going through Apple's App Store, but Apple disallows this, saying it imperils the safety of its users. Epic seeks that change in the ""Fortnite"" antitrust case.
GLOBAL SCRUTINY
A bill introduced by Democratic U.S. Representative David Cicilline and Republican Representative Ken Buck in the U.S. House of Representatives in June would also force Apple to open its iPhone to third-party stores if the measure becomes law.
Virtually every regulator examining Apple around the world - including competition authorities in the United Kingdom, the European Union and Australia - is scrutinizing Apple's rules for in-app payments and commissions on digital goods of 15-30%. It is also key to the legal complaints filed by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology and Epic against Apple.
South Korean lawmakers this week passed a bill that would prohibit both Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from requiring use of their payment systems.
That is at the top of a wish list by Spotify, whose CEO, Daniel Ek, tweeted that Apple's changes to date ""don't solve the problem.""
The issue of ""steering rules"" was partly addressed by Apple last week when it ended a ban on communicating with users by email about alternative payments and this week said that a small sliver of ""reader"" apps that access media content purchased elsewhere can now provide a link to paid sign up page.

But game developers who generate most of Apple's App Store revenue still cannot point their users to a paid signup page or otherwise direct them to make payments that avoid Apple's commissions.
""Apple's latest announcement seems to be another attempt to protect their App Store monopoly by dividing developers into winners and losers,"" said a statement from the Coalition for App Fairness, a group that includes Epic Games.

LONDON (Reuters) - The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations is making life insurers more enthusiastic about offering cover to those with underlying health conditions - some without even knowing whether customers have been vaccinated.
Life insurers were imposing waiting periods to buy cover in the early stages of the pandemic for certain age groups, as well as for those who had been infected, saying the long-term health consequences of coronavirus were not fully understood.
But now that vaccines are prevalent in major economies such as Britain and the United States, life insurers see fewer risks.
Helen Croft, head of underwriting strategy at AIG (NYSE:AIG) Life, said the insurer had previously been more cautious in offering cover as a result of the pandemic, but the efficacy and widespread use of the vaccine meant it could provide insurance for more customers.
""The vaccine take-up has been excellent,"" she said. AIG Life did not check if individual customers have been vaccinated, with Croft pointing out the insurer did not ask customers about other inoculations, such as for flu.
""I don't think it's necessary to be asking about the vaccine - the population level take-up gives us enough comfort,"" she said.
Insurers such as LV=,  Aviva  (LON:AV) and Zurich also said they did not ask vaccination questions, with Zurich highlighting the possible limitations of inoculation, such as long-term effectiveness or the impact of new variants.
Regardless of vaccination status, customers with underlying health conditions may pay up to five times the standard rate for life insurance products, sources said. 
A reduction in the hospitalisation and death rate as a result of vaccination has meant that ""almost all"" insurers in Britain have reversed previous COVID-19 restrictions on life cover, said Phil Jeynes, director of corporate sales at insurance broker Reassured.
Britain was one of the first countries to roll out a vaccination programme and almost 80% of all over-16s are fully vaccinated, according to UK government figures. 
Premiums have stayed much the same during the pandemic, Jeynes added. Rather than raising rates, insurers postponed providing cover for those above a certain age, with some underlying health conditions or who were recovering from COVID-19, industry sources said.
Life insurance premium volumes dropped by 11% in Britain and by 0.1% in the United States in 2020, according to Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY). Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) falls in household incomes due to lockdowns and job losses hit demand for life insurance last year, the reinsurer said in a recent report.
Swiss Re expects strong life insurance growth this year and next due to the economic recovery and increased consumer awareness of risk.
In the United States, where more than half of the population is vaccinated, major life insurers Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) and Lincoln told Reuters they did not ask about vaccines.
The Insurance Compact, standards adopted by 47 U.S. states, said it did not currently allow insurers to ask vaccination questions as state insurance regulation has not yet set public policy around the vaccine and underwriting.
ASKING QUESTIONS
However, some insurers in Britain are asking customers whether they have been inoculated, particularly if their health condition makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19, and this could affect the cost or size of their cover. 
""For those that have been fully vaccinated, our risk appetite will be higher,"" said Rose St Louis, protection director at Scottish Widows. ""We may be able to offer improved terms to those who have had both vaccines."" 
Legal & General typically imposes a 12-month waiting period on customers who are clinically vulnerable and where the impact of COVID-19 may be life-threatening.
""To avoid postponing applications for this 1% of new customers, we will now ask whether or not they have had their required vaccine doses...allowing us to give cover to customers when it would otherwise not be available,"" an L&G spokesperson said by email.
Unvaccinated vulnerable customers would be declined cover for now, though allowances would be made for those who could not have the shot for medical reasons such as pregnancy, L&G said.
Insurers need to get clearance from their reinsurers for any underwriting changes they make, as reinsurers may otherwise be unwilling to provide that cover.
L&G said its reinsurers agreed with its approach, without naming them.
One global reinsurer, who declined to be identified, said it was supporting the stance of ""several insurers"" in Britain who were insuring customers in higher risk medical groups for larger amounts of cover, if the customers provided evidence that they were fully vaccinated. 

Clive Allison, director, life and pensions at consultants EY, said the need for vaccine questions may be short-lived. 
""There'll be a convergence where most adults will have been double-vaccinated,"" he said. ""The ones that haven't are most likely to be in the younger age bracket, and typically are not looking to take out insurance cover.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co will reduce production at most North American assembly plants this month because of the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage, hitting its profitable truck and sport utility vehicles, it said on Thursday.
The largest U.S. automaker will halt production next week at its Fort Wayne plant in Indiana and its Silao plant in Mexico, both of which build pickup trucks. In total, GM is cutting production at eight North American assembly plants in September.
The industry-wide chip shortage is causing massive auto production cuts around the globe and auto industry officials say the problem is getting worse.
GM shares were largely unchanged in late trading Thursday.
Earlier this week, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it will also cut truck production next week because of the chips shortage and said its August U.S. sales were down 33% on the chip shortage.  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said last month it will slash global production for September by 40% from its previous plan.
GM will halt production at its Wentzville, Missouri plant for two weeks starting Sept. 6 that builds midsize trucks and full-size vans. GM will also halt production at the CAMI Assembly in Canada and San Luis Potosi Assembly in Mexico for two additional weeks. The company builds its Equinox SUV at both plants.
The automaker is also idling production for two additional weeks at its Lansing Delta Township plant that builds the Chevrolet Traverse and the Buick Enclave.
GM will cut two weeks of production in September at the Spring Hill Tennessee plant that builds the GMC Acadia, Cadillac XT5 and Cadillac XT6. Its Ramos, Mexico plant will take two additional weeks of downtime for Blazer production, while Equinox production will be down through the week of Sept. 27.
Production of the Equinox has been down since Aug. 16.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner said the ""continuing impact of the chip shortage – epitomized most recently in the news that GM will be forced to idle plants across North America – speaks to the urgency of passing bipartisan legislation to fund new semiconductor production in the United States."" 
GM said during production downtime it will repair and ship unfinished vehicles from many impacted plants, including Fort Wayne and Silao.

Exports of the new models to North America are expected to begin by the end of this year, with European sales set to start in early 2022, the company said in a statement.
According to BMW's U.S. web page, the 2022 models' starting price will range from about $36,000 to $59,000.
BMW invested $125 million in the new production line for its San Luis Potosi factory, expanding its capacity beyond assembly of its initial model, the Series 3 sedan.

The Mexican investment comes as fears that global demand for such high-end goods could slow as new variants of the coronavirus spread and the auto industry continues to struggle with a semiconductor chip shortage.
BMW did not say in the statement how many units of the new Series 2 Coupe it plans to produce at its Mexican plant, the carmaker's only facility that will assemble the 4,000-part model.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc plans to take a more proactive approach to determine what types of content violate its cloud service policies, such as rules against promoting violence, and enforce its removal, according to two sources, a move likely to renew debate about how much power tech companies should have to restrict free speech.
Over the coming months, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will hire a small group of people in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division to develop expertise and work with outside researchers to monitor for future threats, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. 
It could turn Amazon, the leading cloud service provider worldwide with 40% market share according to research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT), into one of the world's most powerful arbiters of content allowed on the internet, experts say. 
Amazon made headlines in the Washington Post last week for shutting down a website hosted on AWS that featured propaganda from Islamic State that celebrated the suicide bombing that killed an estimated 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops in Kabul last Thursday. They did so after the news organization contacted Amazon, according to the Post.
The proactive approach to content comes after Amazon kicked social media app Parler off its cloud service shortly after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot for permitting content promoting violence.
""AWS Trust & Safety works to protect AWS customers, partners, and internet users from bad actors attempting to use our services for abusive or illegal purposes. When AWS Trust & Safety is made aware of abusive or illegal behavior on AWS services, they act quickly to investigate and engage with customers to take appropriate actions,"" AWS said in a statement.
""AWS Trust & Safety does not pre-review content hosted by our customers. As AWS continues to expand, we expect this team to continue to grow,"" it added.
Activists and human rights groups are increasingly holding not just websites and apps accountable for harmful content, but also the underlying tech infrastructure that enables those sites to operate, while political conservatives decry the curtailing of free speech. 
AWS already prohibits its services from being used in a variety of ways, such as illegal or fraudulent activity, to incite or threaten violence or promote child sexual exploitation and abuse, according to its acceptable use policy.
Amazon first requests customers remove content violating its policies or have a system to moderate content. If Amazon cannot reach an acceptable agreement with the customer, it may take down the website.
Amazon aims to develop an approach toward content issues that it and other cloud providers are more frequently confronting, such as determining when misinformation on a company's website reaches a scale that requires AWS action, the source said.
The new team within AWS does not plan to sift through the vast amounts of content that companies host on the cloud, but will aim to get ahead of future threats, such as emerging extremist groups whose content could make it onto the AWS cloud, the source added.
Amazon is currently hiring for a global head of policy on the AWS trust and safety team, which is responsible for ""protecting AWS against a wide variety of abuse,"" according to a job posting on its website. 
AWS's offerings include cloud storage and virtual servers and counts major companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Capital One as clients, according to its website.
PROACTIVE MOVES
Better preparation against certain types of content could help Amazon avoid legal and public relations risk.
""If (Amazon) can get some of this stuff off proactively before it's discovered and becomes a big news story, there's value in avoiding that reputational damage,"" said Melissa Ryan, founder of CARD Strategies, a consulting firm that helps organizations understand extremism and online toxicity threats.
Cloud services such as AWS and other entities like domain registrars are considered the ""backbone of the internet,"" but have traditionally been politically neutral services, according to a 2019 report https://www.cigionline.org/articles/navigating-tech-stack-when-where-and-how-should-we-moderate-content from Joan Donovan, a Harvard researcher who studies online extremism and disinformation campaigns. 

But cloud services providers have removed content before, such as in the aftermath of the 2017 alt-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, helping to slow the organizing ability of alt-right groups, Donovan wrote. 
""Most of these companies have understandably not wanted to get into content and not wanting to be the arbiter of thought,"" Ryan said. ""But when you're talking about hate and extremism, you have to take a stance.""

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq eked out record finishes on Thursday, while the Dow also posted a modest gain, as higher commodity prices helped energy names recover ground and the latest jobs data left investors unfazed about existing positions.
The energy sector rose 2.5%, reversing much of the loss suffered during the first three days of the week. Thursday's performance was fueled by U.S. crude prices jumping 2% on a sharp decline in U.S. inventories and a weaker dollar. [O/R]
 Cabot Oil & Gas  Corp (NYSE:COG) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) were the largest risers, up 6.7% and 6% respectively, with oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) both advancing more than 2%.
The technology index slipped into negative territory, as some of the industry's largest companies saw their recent upward momentum stall.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc all fell between 0.2% and 1.8%. A notable exception was Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which advanced 1.1% to close at an all-time high. 
U.S. stocks have regularly hit record highs over the past few weeks as a solid corporate earnings season and hopes of continued central bank support underpinned confidence.
Still, each new data set is viewed through the prism of whether the numbers might influence the Federal Reserve's tapering timetable.
""I feel like sometimes we end up trying to read the tea-leaves too hard, and the Fed has been pretty good on communicating on (tapering),"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, noting the Fed remains on the path to begin tapering around year-end.
Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, although the focus will be on the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday to set the stage for the Fed's policy meeting later this month.
""You have to see very wide beats or misses in this data to really change people's minds,"" said Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""Investors are either in this renormalization camp that thinks inflation will not happen, or they believe there will be some persistence to inflation. Really, it will be a collection of beats or misses that will move the needle for investors and the Fed, rather than a single data point.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.29 points, or 0.37%, to 35,443.82, the S&P 500 gained 12.86 points, or 0.28%, to 4,536.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.80 points, or 0.14%, to 15,331.18.
Despite deadly flash floods in New York City, trading on Wall Street was operating normally.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) rose 2.6% after three straight sessions of losses. The lender had been weighed by a report it could face further regulatory sanctions over the pace of compensating victims of a years-long sales practice scandal.

(Reuters) -Reddit Inc, the operator of online message boards that became the go-to destination for day traders chasing this year's frenzy for so-called meme stocks, is seeking to hire investment bankers and lawyers for an initial public offering (IPO) in New York, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Reddit was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round last month. By the time the IPO takes place early next year, Reddit hopes it will be valued at more than $15 billion, one of the sources said.
The sources cautioned that the timing and size of the IPO were subject to market conditions and asked not to be identified because the preparations are confidential. A Reddit spokesperson declined to comment.
Reddit's move to hire advisers for its IPO was previously unreported. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Chief Executive Steve Huffman had said the company was planning to go public but had not decided on the timing. 
Reddit was founded in 2005 by Huffman and entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian. It became known for its niche discussion groups, lagging the popularity of other major social media platforms such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).
The San Francisco-based company saw explosive growth, however, as a result of retail investors flocking to its message boards at the start of the year for tips on trading  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other meme stocks. Most Wall Street analysts deemed the meme stocks as massively overvalued.
Reddit had roughly 52 million daily active users and over 100,000 communities, or ""sub-reddits,"" as of October last year. Huffman has said it gained millions of new users earlier this year during the height of the trading frenzy, but more recent user figures have not yet been released.
The company makes most of its money through advertising. It reported $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter, an almost threefold jump from the same period last year.

Reddit's biggest investors include Fidelity Investments, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY). 
Online brokerage  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), whose trading app also became popular with retail investors, capitalized on the meme stock frenzy by launching an IPO in July. Robinhood itself became a meme stock on Reddit, and its shares have risen roughly 28% since its stock market debut.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Walmart Inc's move on Thursday to give 565,000 of its U.S. store workers raises of at least $1 puts the spotlight on the industry's tight, competitive labor market as the all-important holiday shopping season is set to kick off.
Worth nearly $800 billion last year in the United States alone, the holidays mark the busiest time of the year for stores, making up a majority of their annual sales as people shop on and around Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas.
Retailers hire tens of thousands of temporary workers across the country to keep up with crowds of people in stores and online, paying competitive wages and offering benefits. Last year, for instance, big-box rival  Target  (NYSE:TGT) provided a coronavirus health plan and paid workers $15 an hour, versus $13 an hour in 2019.
But a nationwide worker shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic has retailers concerned they will not have enough workers in stores and warehouses to handle to extra sales online and in stores.
""The biggest challenge for retailers going into the holiday season is going to be how do they get the sales associates and the warehouse workers in position to fulfill demand,"" said Greg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer practice of consultancy Kearney.
With its third wage hike over the past year, Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s U.S. average hourly wage is now $16.40, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive John Furner said in a memo to staff. The mean hourly wage for retail salespeople is $14.87, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Workers in Walmart's shop floor, food and consumable and general merchandise departments will receive the higher wages, effective Sept. 25, Furner said.
'POVERTY WAGES'
The hike in pay wasn't enough for some workers who have long fought for more money.
""When Walmart touts its average pay at $16.40 an hour, it distracts from the reality that its business model still relies on poverty wages,"" said Cynthia Murray, 65, a 20-year Walmart worker from Laurel, Maryland, and a member of labor group United for Respect. 
Murray called for Walmart's minimum wage to increase to $15 an hour at minimum, at a time when workers face ongoing risk of contracting the virus.
For others, however, it's not all about pay.
In July, Walmart said it would pay 100% of college tuition and book costs for its associates.
That policy is what is keeping Cincinnati, Ohio-based Jacob, 19, around as the retailer pays his tuition for a correspondence course in business administration at Southern New Hampshire University.
""Once I graduate college, I do plan on finding a better job,"" said Jacob, who declined to provide his last name out of fear of losing his job.
'BACK INTO THE HARNESS'
The news comes days before the national end of federal unemployment benefits, which has been anticipated by employers who hope a lot of people once scared by COVID will return to the workforce.
""This is significant. I mean, if you look at it in percentage terms it's not much, but this is Walmart - they don't really do this,"" said Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University Bloomington. ""Companies are having trouble getting people back into the harness after being out for so long and this is another sign that the labor market is readjusting.""
Smaller retailers aren't immune to the issue either. Chicago's Abt Electronics, a household name in Illinois, said it has raised its minimum wage by just over 10%.
Worker wages and benefits are the most expensive operational cost for many retailers, whose workers have long fought for higher wages through unions and organizations including Fight for $15. 
Unions have shone a spotlight this year on pay in the industry, a issue that received tremendous attention after an attempt by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers to organize at a warehouse in Alabama. A Reuters analysis https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-unions-insight-idTRNIKCN2EF0W0 of two decades of wage data showed earlier this year that workers in unions reap higher wages.

Walmart, which is not unionized, raised pay for more than 425,000 stocking and digital associates earlier this year. It said on Wednesday it plans to hire 20,000 workers at its supply chain division.
Dollar General (NYSE:DG) said this week it is looking to hire more workers and truck drivers to whom it is offering a $5,000 sign-on bonus. Target, Best Buy and other major retailers have yet to announce any holiday wage increases or benefits.

The pair suspended services in Afghanistan https://www.reuters.com/business/western-union-suspends-services-afghanistan-2021-08-19 more than two weeks ago after the Islamist militia captured Kabul at lightning speed.
But an easing of security concerns following the completion of the Taliban's conquest of the country https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-conflict-idUSKBN2FY0AR opened the way for the reopening this week of banks, which the money-transfer firms rely on to dispense and collect funds.
Jean Claude Farah,  Western Union  (NYSE:WU)'s president in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told Reuters the reopening of banks, plus a push by the United States to facilitate humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, had given the American company confidence to resume services on Thursday.
""Much of our business involving Afghanistan is low-value family and support remittances that support basic needs of the people there, so that's the grounding that we have and why we want to reopen our business,"" Farah said. 
""We've engaged with the U.S. government, which has conveyed that allowing humanitarian activities, including remittances, to continue are consistent with U.S. policy.""
The flow of funds from migrant workers overseas is a key lifeline for many Afghans and has helped the economy of one of the world's poorest nations weather years of violence and instability. The United Nations says about half of the population requires aid amid the second drought in four years.
In a statement, MoneyGram said following guidance from the U.S. government, it was resuming its services in coordination with its partners in the country and the Afghanistan Banks Association.
""We recognize that remittances play a pivotal role in the livelihood and daily needs of the Afghan people,"" MoneyGram said.
SANCTIONS ON FINANCING
One complication is that there are a broad range of sanctions on financing to the Taliban, while the Haqqani network, which has links to the Taliban, is classed as a terrorist organisation by the United States and Britain.
Yet U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said it is committed to allowing humanitarian work to continue in Afghanistan. 
""We are continuing to engage with the U.S. government and others to understand their policies and what type of longer term regulatory framework will be put in place as it relates to the Taliban,"" Western Union's Farah said.
Remittances to Afghanistan reached $789 million in 2020, around 4% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), the World Bank estimated, down from $829 million in 2019.
Such flows have historically played an important role in supporting financial stability. Along with international grants and resilient exports, remittances helped Afghanistan's current account surplus reach 14.2% of GDP in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said in June.
DO BANKS HAVE THE CASH?
In recent days, Afghanistan's central bank has provided funds of hundreds of thousands of dollars to each bank that requested liquidity, a senior banker told Reuters. But the financial system and economy could be in peril unless the Taliban can access the central bank's roughly $10 billion https://www.reuters.com/business/afghanistan-central-bank-board-member-urges-biden-imf-release-funds-2021-09-01 in assets, which are mostly outside of the country.
Farah said Western Union had been assured by the banks it partners with in Afghanistan that they had sufficient cash to pay receivers of remittances.
""Some of them have indicated at some locations that they have good liquidity in afghani and at least some liquidity in U.S. dollars as well, we allow payouts in both, to resume remittances,"" he added.

Before it shut down services on Aug. 16, around 45% of each transaction sent via Western Union to Afghanistan was $200 or less, he said.
Western Union said on Thursday that payouts of any funds sent to Afghanistan were available in select locations. Outbound services, money sent from there to other countries, remained suspended, it added.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Record-setting world stocks moved higher on Thursday after jobless claims data suggested the U.S. labor market was charging ahead even as new COVID-19 infections surge, while the risk of a upcoming sub-par U.S. payrolls report weighed on the dollar.
Economic data from Asia and Europe was largely disappointing but the Labor Department report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week to a pandemic-era low.
The decline in layoffs to their lowest in more than 24 years helped ease concerns about the state of the U.S. economy even if the closely watched employment report for August on Friday shows a slowdown in nonfarm payrolls growth.
""Right now the economic data is headed in the right direction,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange brokerage OANDA. ""There's strong optimism the Delta variant is not going to disrupt the economy - at least not as we saw the economy disrupted before.""
MSCI's all-country world index ended the session at its fifth consecutive closing high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also set new closing highs.
Energy-led value, up about 0.63%, outpaced a 0.03% gain in growth as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell, the latest twist in the ever-changing market leadership.
""We don't really have anything that you can hang your hat on and say this is where we're going, this is the sector that I need to be involved in,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. 
""You're going to continue to see this back-and-forth type of trade,"" he said.
MSCI's world stock index, which measures equity performance in 50 countries , closed up 0.28% at 745.72. In Europe, the broad STOXX 600 index gained 0.31%. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37%, the S&P 500 added 0.28% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.14%.
Overnight in Asia, uncertainty over still-low vaccination rates in many economies and China's zero-tolerance COVID-19 strategy kept Chinese blue-chips flat, though speculation about more fiscal stimulus offered some support. (G)
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.16%. Japan's Nikkei added 0.3%, South Korea fell 1%, whereas Hong Kong's battered tech index enjoyed a fourth day of unbroken gains.
The euro traded near a one-month high versus the greenback after German central bank chief Jens Weidmann cautioned against inflation risks and urged slowing the European Central Bank's bond buying.
Also on Wednesday, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the euro zone economy was recovering and only needed ""surgical"" support targeted at sectors that still struggle. 
The euro rose 0.30% to $1.1873.
The hawkish comments were in contrast to the Bank of Japan, which has shown no sign of tapering its massive purchases as the economy remains mired in a decades-long battle with deflation.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.29% to 92.221. The yen last traded down 0.024% at $109.9500. 
U.S. Treasury yields drifted lower as the market remained on hold ahead of the government's closely watched employment data on Friday, which could break yields out of a tight range. 
The benchmark 10-year yield fell 1.3 basis points to yield 1.2886%. 
Aluminium prices rose to a 10-year high on growing concerns that restrictions on Chinese production of the metal are causing supply shortages.
Oil rose more than $1, supported by optimism about the pace of the economic recovery from the pandemic, a sharp decline in U.S. crude stocks and a weaker dollar.

Brent crude settled up $1.44 at $73.03 a barrel. U.S. crude rose $1.40 to settle at $69.99 a barrel.
U.S. gold futures settled down 0.3% at $1,811.50 an ounce.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines on Thursday afternoon resumed operations at Newark Liberty International airport in New Jersey after disruptions caused by flooding https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-mayor-declares-state-emergency-after-record-breaking-rain-2021-09-02 from the remnants of Hurricane Ida.
The impact of the storm was still being felt in the northeastern United States as Amtrak and other rail services were canceled.
United, the largest carrier at the New York area airport, had canceled more than 200 flights nationwide, according to Flightaware, an aviation website.
Rival American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has also experienced delays and cancellations at the Newark airport, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it has seen roughly 80 cancellations across New York City area airports.
Flooding killed at least 21 people, swept away cars and submerged New York City subway lines after torrential rains.
Flooding halted traffic on some major roads and highways in Northeastern states. The New York State Police said traffic was diverted because of flooding on some highways and exit ramps. Some major Philadelphia-area roads also flooded.
Amtrak said all passenger train service between Washington and Boston was canceled for the remainder of Thursday. The railroad said Empire Service was canceled between Albany, New York, and New York City.
Nearly all New Jersey Transit rail service remains suspended except for the Atlantic City line.

New Jersey Transit bus service is continuing but riders were told to ""expect significant statewide delays, cancellations and extensive detours due to severe flooding and multiple vehicles blocking roadways.""
In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees subway, bus and commuter rail, said ""service across our system is extremely limited as we work to recover from last night's heavy rainfall and flooding.""

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)'s efforts to diversify revenue by ramping up investments in its software business has insulated the company from being heavily impacted by supply chain disruptions.
The company's wireless business division, which counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a major customer, also stands to benefit from the latest iPhones expected to be launched this month. 
Analysts have indicated that the 5G transition, which is still in its nascent stage, is likely to boost demand for Broadcom's radio frequency and wireless chips that help devices connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. 
Broadcom forecast current-quarter revenue of about $7.35 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose 16% to $6.78 billion in the third quarter ended Aug. 1, edging past expectations of $6.76 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan attributed the performance to demand from cloud, 5G, broadband and wireless segments.

The company also make chips for data centers and servers, which means the rapid migration to cloud and a rebound in enterprise spending will benefit Broadcom in a post-pandemic world as many companies embrace a hybrid model of working.
Excluding items, Broadcom earned $6.96 per share, topping estimates of $6.88.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 04:39PM ET</span>","U.S. pegs farm income at eight-year high amid strong corn, soy prices","CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers' net income is projected to jump 19.5% this year to an eight-year high of $113 billion, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday in a sharp reversal from a February forecast for a decline in profits.
A surge to eight-year highs in U.S. corn and soybean prices this spring has brightened the financial outlook for farmers even as aid payments from the federal government are declining. Crop prices have pulled back from peaks reached in May but remain historically high due to tight global supplies and robust imports from China.
Rising profits have increased farmers' demand for land, tractors and tools, providing an economic boost to rural towns.
The USDA's latest forecast is positive for equipment manufacturers such as Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, AGCO Corp and CPM Holdings, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said in a note.
Farmers in recent years relied on aid payments from the federal government to offset financial losses linked to the U.S.-China trade war and COVID-19 pandemic. However, direct government payments are forecast to fall by 38.6% to $28 billion in 2021 due to reduced COVID-19 relief, after increasing by 103.5% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to the USDA.

In February, the USDA predicted net farm income, a broad measure of profits, would fall 8.1% in 2021 due to lower government payments and higher expenses.
Farmers' production expenses will increase by 7.3% to $383.5 billion in nominal terms this year, according to the USDA. Spending on nearly all types of expenses is expected to rise, the agency said, as U.S. consumers grapple with inflation across a range of products.

(Reuters) -The U.S. plans to invest $3 billion in the vaccine supply chain as it continues to work to position itself as a leading supplier of vaccines for the world, a top U.S. health official said on Thursday. 
The funding, which will begin to be distributed in the coming weeks, will focus on manufacturers of the inputs used in COVID-19 vaccine production as well as facilities that fill and package vaccine vials, White House COVID adviser Jeffrey Zients said during a news conference. 
""The investments we are making, the $3 billion, are in U.S. companies that will expand their capacity for critical supplies,"" Zients said. 
He added that areas of focus will include lipids, bioreactor bags, tubing, needles, syringes, and personal protective equipment. The White House has not yet selected specific companies to receive the funds. 
U.S. demand for COVID-19 vaccines remains high as the White House prepares to begin offering a third booster shot to Americans later this month, pending a regulator greenlight. The United States also plans to give hundreds of millions of shots to other countries during the remainder of the year. 
Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci added that he would not be surprised if a third dose became standard for COVID-19 vaccines that originally were expected to require two shots. 
U.S. cases of COVID-19 have surged to a seven-day average of more than 150,000 per day, up from less than 10,000 in June, according to federal data, as the contagious new Delta variant continues to circulate. 
The daily average of COVID-19 deaths has risen this week to more than 950 from around 900 last week, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said. 

Fauci downplayed concerns about a new COVID-19 variant known as Mu, or B.1.621, that some scientists are concerned could be resistant to vaccines. 
""Even when you have variants that do diminish somewhat the efficacy of vaccines, the vaccines still are quite effective against variants of that type,"" Fauci said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Major grains crushers in Brazil began offering farmer training on Thursday for growers of crops other than soy, including wheat, corn and sugarcane, oilseed crushing group Abiove said.
The ""Soy Plus"" program renamed ""Agro Plus"" offers farmers guidance on best practices including waste management, environmental compliance and employee safety, according to Abiove, which includes major grains traders ADM, LDC,  Bunge  (NYSE:BG), Cargill, Amaggi and Cofco.
Bernardo Pires, Abiove's sustainability manager, said the expanded training to more producers, including cattle ranchers, was a response to demand from Brazil's booming farm belt. In its original format, the program helped soybean farmers boost profits by improving farm management, Pires said. 
""Due to these good results, it was natural to expand to other supply chains,"" Pires said. 
The program was jointly created in 2011 by Abiove and Mato Grosso state's soy and corn farmer group Aprosoja. In 10 years, it has trained more than 8,000 soy growers on 3,200 farms. 
Pires said Abiove wants to triple the number of farmers trained within 3 to 5 years as it revamps the program.

Over 10 years, the program has cost some 35 million reais ($6.80 million), Abiove said. As more producers become eligible, Abiove will seek out new partners to help shoulder the cost.

The tech-heavy NASDAQ Compositeand the S&P's technology index slipped into negative territory, as some of the industry's largest companies saw their recent upward momentum stall.

It’s a quiet Friday for earnings, but who cares about that when all anyone is interested in are jobs numbers?
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Jobs, jobs, more jobs
Hiring is likely to have slowed down considerably in August after growing at its fastest pace in nearly a year in July. Nonfarm jobs are likely to have added 750,000 positions compared to July’s 943,000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the data Friday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. The unemployment rate
In the process, unemployment rate is likely to have dropped to 5.2% from 5.4% in July, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
3. Services sector activity
Non-manufacturing business activity or services is likely to have expanded by 62.8 in August compared to 67 in July. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion. That report comes out at 10:00 AM ET.

But a recent rebound in oil prices, driven by fewer cases in China and the U.S. dollar’s retreat, appears to be setting the stage for a rally, which is why investors should start adding stocks such as Apache (APA), Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) to their portfolio.Two weeks ago, oil prices were on the decline. This was driven by fears of a demand slowdown caused by the continued spread of the delta variant of Covid-19, which led to new lockdowns in countries such as Japan and New Zealand. Making matters worse was terrible economic data from China, the world's largest crude importer.
But after the worst losing streak since 2019, oil prices bounced back last week as selling looked overdone. Helping matters were fewer COVID cases in China, which in itself creates a better demand environment. But secondly, the U.S. Dollar retreated from its recent highs, providing a foundation for commodities in general.
This rebound led to a golden cross on oil's weekly chart. A golden cross occurs when an asset's short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average. This occurred as crude oil's 50-week moving average crossed above its 200-week moving average. The move indicates further upside, which is why investors should consider energy stocks such as Apache Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR), and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).

“A part of retail has migrated to NFTs,” said Martha Reyes, head of research at Bequant, a crypto prime brokerage. “Let’s face it, it’s just more fun to collect jpegs of primates and penguins.”

NFTs are the latest explosion of speculative trading this year, turbocharged -- depending on whom you ask -- by stimulus checks, monetary easing, social media or the sheer boredom of pandemic life. The average price for the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT -- yes, literally a token of a monkey-themed avatar -- has skyrocketed from 8.78 ETH on July 31 to 41.4 ETH, or about $156,368, while Pudgy Penguins has soared more than 100 times to 2.6 ETH. 
That’s pushing up transaction costs on the Ethereum network which powers NFT activity, with the average so-called gas fee now at the highest since late May. Along the way, digital-token transactions are getting more expensive on the blockchain that birthed decentralized finance. 
“As NFT activity commands ecosystem attention, gas prices have risen to daily levels that price out many retail traders,” Luke Posey, a researcher at analytics firm Glassnode, wrote in a Wednesday note.
While the NFT community enjoys its moment in the sun, Reddit-fueled trades that defined the meme-market mania earlier this year are looking positively quaint. 
In the American stock market, small-option trades typically favored by Robinhood types recently dropped to just 18% of total volumes, the lowest since April 2020, UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) data show. Retail purchases of cash equities also cooled to the lowest in three months in August, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, which tracks such flows. 
Of course while their aggregate buying may have slowed, it doesn’t mean day traders have lost their sway. A new slate of meme stocks such as Skillz and Vinco Ventures have been rallying on the back of social media this week, while Vanda analysts also reckon retail buying might pick up into the final months of 2021.
Yet look at Bitcoin, once considered a fringe asset. Its rally from the June trough is failing to excite traders in the same way as the boom earlier this year. 
On the Binance exchange, funding rates, or the cost of positioning in bullish futures, have risen only modestly to less than 4%, after plunging from as high as 39% in April, Bybt data show. The number of active addresses, an indication of transactions on the blockchain, is still 29% below its peak, according to Glassnode. 
 
What’s more, just 54% of outstanding Bitcoin futures are now backed with Bitcoin itself as collateral -- compared with 70% at the peak. With more traders using stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, it’s the latest sign the speculative community is showing more restraint with the original cryptocurrency even as the NFT craze rages on.
“Open interest has been rising but is also well below its peak, as is the funding rate, suggesting a lack of froth,” said Reyes at Bequant, referring to Bitcoin trading.

The raise of at least $1 per hour will start on Sept. 25 and cover more than 565,000 workers, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer John Furner said in a message to employees. Furner said it’s the third pay rise for store workers over the past year. 
The world’s largest retailer has moved to raise pay and improve benefits in the U.S. in recent years -- a shift from its previous strategy of keeping wages low. However, Walmart’s focus on increasing average pay contrasts with the higher starting wages that have been implemented by competitors such as  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT), which has boosted starting pay to $15, and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST)., which has set it at $16. Walmart’s starting rate is $12.
The trend isn’t confined to retail: McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp.,  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG). and other restaurants are also improving wages to hang on to workers who have proven reluctant to work in public-facing jobs during the Covid pandemic.  
Higher weekly unemployment payments are being phased out across the U.S. this month.

So, read on.With the introduction of the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), which provides a 26% tax credit for systems installed in 2020 - 2022, more homeowners have been encouraged to install solar panels. Although supply constraints in critical components, such as copper, semiconductors, and other metals, have affected installations, higher demand driven by the residential home renovation boom should keep prices high.
According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight report for the second quarter of 2021, the U.S. solar market exceeded 100 gigawatts of installed electric generating capacity, thereby doubling the industry’s size over the past 3.5 years. Moreover, the Biden administration’s net-zero carbon emission goals should bolster the industry’s growth further.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) must face nearly all of a proposed class action lawsuit claiming that its voice-activated Siri assistant violates users' privacy.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said the plaintiffs could try to prove Siri routinely recorded their private conversations because of ""accidental activations,"" and that Apple disclosed these conversations to third parties, such as advertisers.
Voice assistants typically react when mobile device owners use ""hot words"" such as ""Hey, Siri.""
One Siri user said his private discussions with his doctor about a ""brand name surgical treatment"" caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while two others said their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses and ""Olive Garden"" caused them to receive ads for those products.
""Apple faults plaintiffs for not alleging the contents of their communications, but the private setting alone is enough to show a reasonable expectation of privacy,"" White wrote.
The Oakland, California-based judge said the plaintiffs may pursue claims that Apple violated the federal Wiretap Act and California privacy law, and committed breach of contract. He dismissed an unfair competition claim.
Apple, based in Cupertino, California, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests.
On July 1, another federal judge in California said users of Google's Voice Assistant, represented by the same law firms as in the Apple case, could pursue a similar lawsuit against Google and its parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Capital One Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank was hit with a $637,950 civil penalty to settle charges he broke U.S. antitrust laws when he failed to report stock compensation in 2018, the Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday.
Fairbank initially failed to report receiving more than 100,000 shares of the company's stock that year, violating a law that requires companies and individuals to report such large transactions to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. The CEO corrected the error in December 2019, the FTC said in a statement.
The compensation boosted his holdings to $168 million in 2018 and followed two prior instances in which Fairbank did not comply with the same law, the FTC said in a statement.
Fairbank failed to comply with the same requirements in 1999 and 2004, saying in a 2008 correction that they were inadvertent. At the time, the FTC gave him a ""free pass"" and he did not pay any penalty for the wrongdoing, the statement said.
""As the CEO of one of America’s largest banks, Richard Fairbank repeatedly broke the law,"" said Holly Vedova, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. “There is no exemption for Wall Street bankers and powerful CEOs when it comes to complying with our country’s antitrust laws.”

A Capital One spokesperson said the failure to report was the result of an administrative error by Fairbank's law firm, which agreed to pay the full amount of the fine.
Unlike many other chief executive officers, Fairbank earns no salary and is paid primarily in company stock. His compensation totaled $20.1 million last year, which included $16.8 million in stock awards and a $3 million bonus, according to a company filing.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",Explainer-Apple gives 'reader' apps a way around commissions. Who wins?,"By Nivedita Balu and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Wednesday made a new concession on how App Store developers work with customers: it will allow subscription and content apps that it calls ""reader"" apps, a category that potentially includes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Disney+ and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Kindle, to provide users with a direct link to their website for sign ups, avoiding an Apple commission.
The move follows some concessions to developers last week and comes as the iPhone maker contends with legal and regulatory challenges to rules it forces app makers to follow, including a closely watched antitrust lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games.
WHAT ARE 'READER' APPS?
Apple says ""reader"" apps provide previously purchased content or subscriptions for app-based magazines, newspapers, books, music and video services. It determines which companies meet that definition.
Apple does not disclose the apps it categorizes as ""reader"" apps, but eBook readers such as Kindle, video and music streaming services such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Netflix, AT&T (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max and Disney+ Hulu are likely to fall in this category.
When a user signs up for such a paid service from within an app, the subscription is considered an in-app purchase, which means Apple requires the app to use its payment system and collects a commission.
Many music and video streaming bypass those commissions, which range from 15% to 30%, by asking users to sign up and enter payment details on their websites rather than inside the app. Apple had prevented the developers from providing a link within their apps to do so.
WHAT'S NOT COVERED?
Payment for other services, such as video games, are not changed, according to Japanese authorities, whose investigation led to the new global policy, although the officials said they could investigate gaming transactions in the future. 
That means the biggest fight against Apple's policies, the antitrust court challenge by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic, continues. A judge is expected to deliver a decision soon in that case.
Apps offering physical goods or services, such as Amazon, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), do not pay any fee because Apple does not consider their sales as ""digital goods"".
WILL THE NEW DEAL SATISFY OTHER REGULATORS AND GAME MAKERS
Certainly not all. Many app developers, well beyond those making ""readers"", have expressed anger with Apple's tight rules and steep commissions, leading antitrust regulators and lawmakers in several countries to examine how the company runs its App Store. 
India launched a new antitrust case hours after Japan reached a settlement with Apple, while South Korea approved a bill to impose curbs on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple's payment policies. 
""If they opened up to this because of regulatory pressure...this could be a start to something, maybe even bigger where it is not only the reader apps but it could also include gaming and online dating apps,"" Evercore ISI analyst Shweta Khajuria said.
WHO WINS AND LOSES? 
Subscription and content companies like Netflix and Spotify will find it easy to sign up subscribers. 
Users of such ""reader"" apps will find it easier to sign up from a link in the apps, many of which currently do not offer any instructions on how to sign up outside the app and instead offer only a minimalist login screen for existing subscribers.
Apple is unlikely to lose significant revenue because many of the largest ""reader"" apps like Spotify And Netflix quit using the in-app payment systems years ago. 
Any revenue losses for Apple are mostly likely to come from up-and-coming content apps that will now have an easier time signing up paid users outside the app and so may be less likely to use Apple's in-app payment system.
Even after the change, the extra step of following a link to an external site could discourage many users from completing the sign-up process.
Analysts said the changes would allow smaller developers, who do not have the scale to reach millions of users, to maintain a direct relationship with users. 

""There probably will be some disappointment that there weren't greater concessions given,"" Susannah Streeter, a markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said.
""Apple is still in a fortress,"" she said, adding the company is not going to show any weakness as it awaits a ruling in the Epic case.

But even as the criminal trial of Theranos Inc.’s Elizabeth Holmes gets under way, and Big Oil bows to shareholder activists after a landmark governance battle, a new study of corporate directors found that they see their primary role as championing CEOs, not confronting them.
The findings, gleaned from interviews with almost 50 directors at more than 140 companies and published in the Strategic Management Journal, question how seriously boards take their traditional fiduciary responsibility to look out for shareholders. Increasingly, directors have come to think the best way to protect shareholder value is by working hand in glove with the CEO.
“Directors view their strategic collaboration with the CEO as critical to their board service, while not perceiving the monitoring of the CEO as their focus,” said the study’s four authors, all of them business-school professors. “Most directors have an implicit theory that the CEO is acting in the best interests of their firms.”
The research dismayed governance activists, who scored a historic victory in May when Engine No. 1, a tiny investment firm pushing Exxon (NYSE:XOM) to diversify its business and fight climate change, snagged board seats at the oil company. 
‘Corporate Cheerleaders’
“Usually directors at least pretend to acknowledge their legal obligation to provide oversight of CEOs on behalf of shareholders,” said Nell Minow, who advises institutional investors on corporate governance issues at ValueEdge Advisors. “This acknowledgment that directors see themselves as corporate cheerleaders instead of skeptics whose job is to push back, question, and insist on better is further proof that shareholders will need to support more Engine No. 1-style challenges.”
While prior research into the role of directors concludes that their primary role should be oversight of managers, those theories “may have failed to keep up with the realities of today’s boards,” the authors said. 
Steven Boivie, one of the authors and a professor at the Mays Business School at Texas A&M, said he started the research after getting the sense that directors didn’t view their role in the same way academics and others do. So while the conclusions didn’t surprise him, the uniformity of responses did. 
“They all feel very similarly about this,” he said. 
Not Watchdogs
Some of the directors interviewed, who served on companies of various sizes and industries, said that being a watchdog was not only not their job, but nearly impossible to do, as CEOs knew so much more about their businesses than boards did. Said one board member: “You can’t stop people from doing bad deals, and you can’t stop people from doing complicit fraud ... if people are going to screw you, they are going to do it.”
To be sure, directors still recognized their fiduciary role, but how that role is best carried out has evolved. Those seeking to keep an arm’s length relationship with managers are now in the minority, the study said, while most said directors should assist the c-suite to create value. Such assistance includes helping formulate strategic decisions, rather than voting against the CEO’s choices -- including the all-important choice of who will be the next boss. 
Directors who aggressively challenged CEOs were described as exhibiting bad behavior -- which, inevitably, could lead to trouble when the corporate chiefs start to behave badly themselves.
“Directors do not hold the implicit assumption of managerial opportunism,” the authors said. “Rather, they approach their board work with an overarching role as a strategic partner with executives rather than as a shareholder watchdog.”

It is alleged that its PayPal Credit business was non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations.
 Also, PYPL’s 48.43% and 0.35% respective trailing-12-month gross profit margin and asset turnover ratio are lower than the 49.04% and 0.65% industry averages.

The chairs of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on Energy and Commerce have requested the FDA to disclose documents related to the interactions between Biogen and the agency's staff. 
""We are concerned by apparent anomalies in FDA's processes surrounding its review of Aduhelm,"" chairs of the two committee wrote in a letter to the agency. 
The committees had launched an investigation following the drug's approval on June 7 that had sparked controversy and concerns over the FDA's process, as a panel of its outside advisers had recommended against the approval.
The letter, dated Sept. 1, also requests for details on the agency's process for approving a therapy when there is a disagreement between the FDA staff and its panel of external advisers, known as the advisory committee. 

Biogen said it was continuing to cooperate with the committees' investigation and had produced documents as and when requested. 
An independent federal review was launched last month into the accelerated approval pathway used by the drug regulator to approve the treatment, on the request of the FDA's acting commissioner Janet Woodcock.

(Reuters) -  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc's quarterly revenue missed estimates on Thursday as its online sales took a hit from shoppers returning to physical stores on easing pandemic curbs, sending the shares of the apparel chain down 10%.
The company's second-quarter digital sales fell 5% from a year earlier, also hit by stiff e-commerce competition from firms including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Poshmark, although it remained higher compared with pre-pandemic levels. 
Revenue came under pressure from back-to-school selling season and some tax-free shopping events moving to the third quarter, American Eagle executives said on the earnings call. 
American Eagle, which last month acquired logistics startup AirTerra, said it hopes to make digital sales account for half of its revenue in the longer term, up from 35% in the second quarter.

However, the owner of Aerie brand said it expects a robust holiday season by booking products early and spending more on transporting goods to its stores, even as it grapples with industry-wide supply chain issues.
Total net revenue rose 35% to $1.19 billion in the second quarter ended July 31, missing Refinitiv-IBES estimates of $1.23 billion. However, it rose about 15% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, below the median increase reported by U.S. consumer companies tracked by BMO Capital Markets analysts.

Beijing has been encouraging companies to share wealth as part of the effort to ease inequality in the world's second-largest economy. Other companies that have made similar announcements include Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), which also pledged 100 billion yuan, and Geely Automobile.
The government-backed Zhejiang News website said Alibaba's funds will go towards areas such as subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises and improving insurance protection for gig economy workers such as couriers and ride-hailing drivers. 
It will also set up a 20 billion yuan ""common prosperity development fund"", the newspaper said, with Alibaba confirming the report. 
The e-commerce giant and its tech rivals have been the target of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on issues ranging from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights. Alibaba was fined a record $2.75 billion in April over monopoly violations.
The sector has also attracted criticism for the treatment of delivery workers and ride-hailing drivers, most of whom are not covered by basic social and medical insurance. 

Food delivery platform Ele.me and supermarket operator Freshippo, both of which are owned by Alibaba, were among operators called to a meeting last month with government regulators on improving safety and labour rights for delivery workers.

Conversely,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) don’t look well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Their bleak financials make the stocks of these two companies best avoided now. Read on.Home improvement trends have changed markedly over the past year because the COVID-19 pandemic sparked an unprecedented tidal wave of housing projects, with homeowners spending more time at home than they did prior to the public health crisis. In addition, the high demand for residential properties amid a low-interest-rate environment and the increasing popularity of smart home technology features have been among the factors driving the growth of the home improvement industry.
The global home improvement services industry is expected to reach $585.3 billion by 2030, exhibiting a 6.2% CAGR from 2021. And the home improvement market is also changing its sales approach in response to the shift to digital platforms. As such, we believe fundamentally sound home improvement stocks Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) and Mohawk Industries, Inc.

Conversely, with consumer discretionary spending shifting toward entertainment and travel as pandemic restrictions ease amid a rapid vaccine rollout, we think fundamentally weak companies in this space, The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), might struggle to grow.

BERLIN (Reuters) -All-you-can-watch video products offered by Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) in Germany violated regional rules on roaming and net neutrality, the European Union's highest court ruled on Thursday.
The landmark ruling targeted popular mobile products such as Deutsche Telekom's StreamOn deal, which offered unlimited data for watching video while customers were in Germany but slowed transmission speeds when they went abroad.
Germany's BNetzA network regulator ordered https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-telekom-regulator-idUKKBN1E91VM Deutsche Telekom in 2018 to offer such products on the same terms throughout the EU, triggering a court battle. Germany's VZBV consumer association objected to a copycat product launched by Vodafone.
Zero-tariff options ""are contrary to the regulation on open internet access,"" the European Court of Justice said in a two-page ruling made after two German courts hearing the cases against Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom https://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-telekom-regulator-idCNL8N24G2WX sought its opinion.
""It follows that limitations on bandwidth, tethering or on use when roaming ... are also incompatible with EU law.""
In response, Deutsche Telekom said it had already adjusted StreamOn to remove throttling, meaning no changes were needed as a result of the European court ruling. The German regulator said, however, that such products could not stand even in their amended form.
EU rules require mobile operators to allow customers to ""roam like at home"" and to pay the same tariffs regardless of where they are located. Net neutrality bars the throttling of data speeds depending on location.
Operators counter that such rules, if applied across the EU, would encourage people from outside Germany to sign up as customers there to take advantage of unlimited video products, forcing up costs and straining networks.
Deutsche Telekom said that StreamOn no longer featured data throttling. ""In this respect, StreamOn will not change,"" it said in a statement.
The BNetzA said, however, that decisions by the German courts went beyond its own initial order.
""It is therefore to be expected that the products amended in 2019 based on the BNetzA directive cannot be maintained in their current form,"" it said.
VZBV, which had challenged the Vodafone Pass product, said the ruling ""sets an example for net neutrality"" and was a ""victory"" for consumer protection.

""In their current form, zero-rating products like the Vodafone Pass have nothing to do with free internet for all consumers,"" it said.
Vodafone said it would review the ruling and adjust its products accordingly. ""In the interest of customers, Vodafone carefully designs its tariffs in accordance with the EU net-neutrality and roaming regulation,"" it said in a statement.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Facebook's WhatsApp was fined a record 225 million euro ($266 million) by the Irish data protection regulator on Thursday after the EU privacy watchdog pressured Ireland to raise the penalty for the company's privacy breaches. 
WhatsApp said the fine was ""entirely disproportionate"" and that it would appeal. Still, the Irish fine is significantly less than the record $886.6 million euro fine meted out to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by the Luxembourg privacy agency in July.
Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems, who has taken on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in several privacy cases, said the initial fine was 50 million euros. 
Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC), the lead data privacy regulator for Facebook within the European Union, said the issues related to whether WhatsApp conformed in 2018 with EU data rules about transparency.
""This includes information provided to data subjects about the processing of information between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies,"" the Irish regulator said in a statement. 
A WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement the issues in question related to policies in place in 2018 and the company had provided comprehensive information. 
""We disagree with the decision today regarding the transparency we provided to people in 2018 and the penalties are entirely disproportionate,"" the spokesperson said.
EU privacy watchdog the European Data Protection Board said it had given several pointers to the Irish agency in July to address criticism from its peers for taking too long to decide in cases involving tech giants and for not fining them enough for any breaches.
It said a WhatsApp fine should take into account Facebook's turnover and that the company should be given three months instead of six months to comply.
Europe's landmark privacy rules, known as GDPR, are finally showing some teeth even if the lead regulator for some tech giants appears otherwise, said Ulrich Kelber, Germany's federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information.
""What is important now is that the many other open cases on WhatsApp in Ireland are finally decided on so that we can take faster and longer strides towards the uniform enforcement of data protection law in Europe,"" he told Reuters.
Data regulators from eight other European countries triggered a dispute resolution mechanism after Ireland shared its provisional decision in relation to the WhatsApp inquiry, which started in December 2018.
In July, a meeting of the European Data Protection Board issued a ""clear instruction that required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine on the basis of a number of factors contained"", the Irish regulator said. 
""Following this reassessment the DPC has imposed a fine of 225 million euros on WhatsApp,"" it said. 
The Irish regulator also reprimanded and ordered WhatsApp to bring its processing into compliance by taking ""a range of specified remedial actions"".
The Irish regulator had 14 major inquiries into Facebook and its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram open as of the end of last year.
Schrems said he would monitor the company's appeal closely.

""It is to be expected that this case will now be before the Irish Courts for years and it will be interesting if the DPC is actively defending this decision before the Courts, as it was forced to make such a decision by its EU colleagues at the EDPB,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at record highs again on Thursday, shrugging off concerns about a slowing economy, spreading Covid-19 and a hurricane lashing New York City and a good part of the Northeast of the country. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 114 points, or 0.3%, at 35,427 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both advanced 0.5% to new highs. 
Earlier, the Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell to a new post-pandemic low of 340,000 suggesting that the latest wave of Covid-19 in the U.S. is still not triggering higher lay-offs. 
However, analysts cautioned that that may overstate the actual strength of the labor market at a time when deaths from Covid-19 are running at an average of over 1,400 a day and the incidence of new cases is near record highs. 
""Claims tell us nothing about the pace of hiring, which appears to bearing the brunt of the Delta hit,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson. ""Firms always prefer to slow the pace of hiring before they take the more drastic step of laying off existing staff, and in today’s extremely tight labor market we think the bar for layoffs is even higher than usual.""
Private-payrolls processor ADP indicated that the pace of hiring may have slowed in August on Wednesday, with a monthly report that showed private-sector jobs rising much less than expected. However, a similar number from ADP last month had been followed by an official report showing nearly 1 million jobs gained. 
Among early movers, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) fell over 7% after disappointing the market with quarterly figures that suggested the pandemic-era boom in pet ownership is slowing, while ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) stock rose over 9% after its quarterly update showed electric vehicles gaining market share in the U.S. and Europe (where the group's charging infrastructure is concentrated) faster than expected.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock rose 5.8% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock rose 2.1% after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it will allow media companies to link to their own sites for payments, a step that will allow them to avoid paying Apple hefty commissions for payment services.
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) rose 1.1%, as the market took a relaxed view of news that it intends to divert some $15 billion of profit over the next five years to the government's 'common prosperity' program. The move arguably reduces the risk of more aggressive regulatory action against the e-commerce giant, while cynics suggested it might also improve the company's capital discipline. 
Hill-Rom (NYSE:HRC) stock meanwhile rose 3.4% as it confirmed its sale to medical devices group Baxter (NYSE:BAX) for just over $10 billion."

Mainland China's two major stock exchanges are in the financial hub of Shanghai and in the southern city of Shenzhen, on the mainland's border with Hong Kong.
In a video address at the opening of the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), Xi said China would continue to support the innovation-driven development of SMEs.
This would be done by ""by deepening the reform of the New Third Board and setting up the Beijing stock exchange as the primary platform serving innovation-oriented SMEs,"" he added.
Reuters reported in March that China was considering establishing a bourse to attract overseas-listed companies and bolster the global status of its onshore share markets, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.
The sources said then that upgrading Beijing's existing equity exchange for small and mid-sized firms, known as the New Third Board, was among the options being discussed.
China's securities regulator said setting up a Beijing stock exchange would help deepen financial supply-side structural reforms and improve capital market systems.
In a statement issued shortly after Xi's remarks, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said its leadership was ""excited"" at the prospect, would study the president's proposal in depth and resolutely implement it.
""Small and medium-sized enterprises can do great things,"" the CSRC added. 
In other comments in his speech to mark the opening of CIFTIS, a trade fair in Beijing, Xi said China would ""create more possibilities for cooperation by scaling up support for the growth of the services sector in Belt and Road countries.""

The Belt and Road Initiative is Xi's signature trade and infrastructure scheme. 
China will support Beijing and other localities in ""piloting the alignment of domestic rules with the ones in high-standard international free trade agreements, and in building demonstration zones of digital trade,"" the president added.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will take months to decide if banks can continue clearing derivatives in London, the EU's financial services chief said on Thursday in a sign of how Brussels is keeping up pressure to shift business to Frankfurt.
A European Commission working group looked at how trillions of euros in interest rate swaps could be shifted from London to give EU regulators a direct say over the activity.
""We will in the coming, let me say months rather than weeks, have to look again at the time horizon here, but we have made no decision,"" EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness told a Bruegel think tank event.
Industry officials who took part in the meetings say the EU executive appeared surprised by broad opposition to mandatory migration, saying it was up to customers, though some sort of face-saving solution would be needed.
Since Britain fully left the EU last December, clearing houses there have temporary EU permission to keep serving EU clients until June 2022.
LCH, the euro swaps clearer owned by London Stock Exchange, would need to serve three-months' notice to EU customers if a decision on access is not taken by March.
The EU wants to build up more ""autonomy"" in its capital market to end a reliance on the City of London, still Europe's biggest financial centre.
The EU's securities watchdog ESMA is expected to reach conclusions by year end on whether LCH or other UK clearers are so ""systemic"" that EU business should be shifted to the bloc.

""It's often suggested that everything is fine, why would you do anything?"" McGuinness said.
""Everything is fine today, but when things go wrong could we guarantee that Europe would be on the same level as the UK if there is a problem, and where do we look after our interests in making sure that we are not overly reliant on any infrastructure for our stability?""

BERLIN (Reuters) -German luxury carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said on Thursday it expected significantly lower third-quarter sales at its Mercedes unit due to a global semiconductor shortage, becoming the latest in a string of automakers to take a hit to revenues.Automakers from U.S. group General Motors (NYSE:GM) to India's Mahindra have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
""With the plant closings at semiconductor suppliers in Malaysia and elsewhere, the challenge has now become even greater, so that our sales in the third quarter will probably be noticeably below the second quarter,"" Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius told the Automobilwoche weekly in an interview.
Kaellenius did not specify how production would be affected by the shortage. The carmaker cut working hours in July at plants in Germany and Hungary because of lacking chip supply. Daimler was not immediately available for comment. 
General Motors also said on Thursday chip shortages and COVID-19 restrictions were delaying production, with the company resorting to repairing and shipping unfinished vehicles to dealers.
Still, Kaellenius said he was confident Daimler was better prepared than before the pandemic for supply chain shocks. ""We have made our business significantly more flexible and watertight,"" he said, adding customers were used to waiting for highly sought-after products. 
Daimler has extended contracts on its leasing services to ease the concerns of customers waiting for their orders of new cars to arrive, the CEO said.
Daimler left its profit margin outlook for the year unchanged in July after reporting better-than-expected second quarter earnings. Like General Motors, it said at the time it was preparing unfinished vehicles as far as it could to be ready to slot in chips upon arrival. 
Toyota said in September it was slashing production by 40% due to the lack of chips. Ford reported on Wednesday it was cutting pickup truck production.  Renault  (PA:RENA) last week extended stoppages at three Spanish plants until the end of the year.
Consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive also warned last week that U.S. auto retail sales were likely to have fallen sharply in August, with dealers holding just 942,000 vehicles in inventory, down from 3 million two years ago.

Kaellenius refrained from predicting an end to the shortage, pointing out that supply strains such as the lockdowns in Malaysia were impossible to foresee. ""What is important is that demand for cars is there,"" he said. ""At some point the chip problem will also be solved.""
Daimler is due to report third quarter earnings on Oct. 29.

Investing.com – American Eagle stock (NYSE:AEO) plunged 12% in Thursday’s premarket trading following second-quarter revenue that was below expectations as digital sales fell.
Revenue rose 35% on-year to a record $1.19 billion as more buyers shopped at its stores after they reopened. However, revenue of $1.19 billion was below analysts’ estimate of $1.22 billion.
Chief Executive Officer Jay Schottenstein said the company has room to grow, and that it will hit $600 million in operating income this year.
American Eagle said its capex for the financial year will be at the lower end of the $250 million to $275 million guidance.
Digital sales decreased 5%, a sharp reversal considering they rose 57% in the first quarter. The company said the pandemic had last year accelerated digital sales and also created a significant backlog that shifted sales from the financial year’s first quarter to its second.
The company spent more on advertising, incentives and other selling expenses as economies reopened and it tried to attract more buyers to its stores.
Inventory costs rose 20% compared to a 21% decline last year. The company said it is optimizing inventory and positioning it for fall and back-to-school shopping, while keeping the cost impact below revenue growth.

Investing.com – Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) stock traded more than 2% lower in Thursday’s premarket following a downgrade by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to ‘underweight’ from ‘neutral’.
The bank now has a target price of $57, 8.5% below Wednesday's closing price of $62.29.
According to analyst Celine Pannuti, raw material costs are likely to be substantially higher in 2022, pressuring margins. Not only that, she believes the company is in the midst of a multi-year earnings downgrade cycle and finds its portfolio “significantly underweight Beyond Beer”.
AB Inbev established the Beyond Beer unit in 2018 to focus on diversifying the group away from a beer market that was in decline in major advanced markets due to changing consumer preferences. That unit houses seltzers, canned wines and spirits, cocktails, malt-based and non-alcoholic beverages.
According to Pannuti, AB InBev is struggling to make headway in the sector.
“In the U.S., after an initial launch and heavy marketing support for Bud Light Seltzer, ABI category share has stalled at mid-teens,” she wrote in a note.

SAN FRANCISCO/TOKYO (Reuters) -Apple Inc will let some apps like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) provide links to their websites for user payments, a small concession that would allow app developers to bypass the controversial 30% App Store fee the iPhone maker charges.
The concession was part of a settlement with Japan's anti-trust regulator, which said the change was enough for it to close a five-year investigation into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that focused on video and music apps but did not consider games.
The U.S. tech giant, however, must still contend with a raft of other legal and regulatory challenges to rules it forces game makers to follow, including a closely watched antitrust lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-faces-down-fortnite-creator-epic-games-major-antitrust-trial-2021-05-03 brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games.
The ban on providing separate links on App Store apps was lifted for so-called reader apps which provide content such as e-books, video and music that does not offer a free tier of service, instead requiring payment at sign-up.
Currently, apps like Netflix and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) skirt Apple's commissions of around 15%-30% by forcing users to first sign up on their websites.
""Some of the biggest services in this 'reader' category are streamers like Netflix and Spotify which already have and rely on their own payment services,"" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said.
""(The change) will allow smaller developers to manage a direct relationship with customers in order to manage their accounts and payment."" 
The change is set to take effect early next year and will be applied globally, said Apple, which will retain ultimate say over which apps qualify as reader apps.
Some companies said the concession was not enough.
""A limited anti-steering fix does not solve all our issues,""  Spotify Technology  said in a statement. The music streaming company is pursuing an antitrust complaint https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-antitrust-regulators-charge-apple-over-app-store-restrictions-2021-04-30 against Apple with European Union competition authorities.
Its rules for game makers have been among its most contentious, particularly the practice that Epic Games is contesting of not allowing developers to take other forms of payment inside apps.
That case may determine whether Apple can retain control over what apps appear on its devices and whether it is allowed to charge commissions to developers.
Responding to Apple's latest announcement on its App Store, which forms the core of its $53.8 billion services segment, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney accused Apple of trying to appease with insufficient piecemeal measures.
""Apple should open up iOS on the basis of hardware, stores, payments, and services each competing individually on their merits. Instead, they're running a literally day-by-day recalculation of divide-and-conquer in hopes of getting away with most of their tying practices,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
An official with Japan's Fair Trade Commission stressed that the scope of its investigation did not cover games. 
""There is a possibility of there being an investigation into games too,"" he told a media briefing.
Apple has a 46.5% share of Japan's smartphone market in which more than 30 million are sold annually.
The iPhone maker's latest concession is the second in as many weeks. It reached a deal last week with a group of developers in the United States in a class-action lawsuit, ending a ban on them telling users in email messages about payment alternatives.
In one of its latest challenges, South Korea on Tuesday banned major app store operators including Apple from forcing developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commissions on in-app purchases.

The company is facing similar legislative action in the United States and Europe.
It is also facing a new similar antitrust challenge in India that has been brought by a non-profit group, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 07:59AM ET</span>",Special Report-How the Chinese tycoon driving Volvo plans to tackle Tesla,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - ""Do you know how big Volvo is?"" asked Don Leclair, finance chief at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co..
It was 2008, and Leclair was responding to an offer from a little-known Chinese businessman to purchase the Swedish carmaker, which Ford owned.
The businessman, Li Shufu, had a company with less than half Volvo's sales and a flagship model, King Kong, almost unknown outside China. He was politely shown the door of the ""Glass House,"" Ford's iconic headquarters near Detroit, according to two people who were at the meeting. Ford's Leclair did not respond to requests for comment about the episode.
Fast-forward to 2021 and Li Shufu's company, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, is one of the biggest-selling automakers in the world's biggest auto market. It controls not only Volvo Cars but also a clutch of global auto brands, and a significant stake in German giant  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz. These names are now part of its plans for a revolution in autos.
Geely is preparing Volvo for a listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange as a route towards the future of transportation: One where cars are part of an electrified network of mobility services, driving themselves, connecting to each other and - like cell phones - generating an array of data and new business opportunities.
It's a vision more Silicon Valley than Detroit, where traditional automakers globally are chasing another giant - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Li Shufu and his advisers eventually convinced Ford to part with Volvo in 2010 for $1.8 billion. It was the first in a string of deals, tapping brands such as Lotus, Smart and the London Electric Vehicle Company to form a network that he calls a ""bigger circle of friends"" across industry segments.
Li Shufu sees them as building blocks to help Geely compete in a future where autos are not vehicles, but ""service providers,"" he told Reuters in his management suite at Geely's headquarters in Hangzhou, eastern China.
In that business model, cars will be available on subscription and offer services such as making payments and in-car apps. They will update their own software, and spawn opportunities in the same way as the mobile operating systems developed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
""We are trying to create an automotive ecosystem similar to Android,"" he said.
Li Shufu, 58, recently adopted a foreign first name - Eric - because he liked the sound of it. He has charted a path from a remote fishing village in eastern China through dirty factory floors to the heart of the world's auto industry. His subordinates often still call him Chairman Li. 
This account of his evolution into one of the industry's most singular disrupters is based on interviews with Li Shufu himself, other company leaders and advisers as well as rivals and executives at firms in which Geely invested. They reveal an agile opportunist who is making a stream of startup bets - on ventures like flying cars and helicopter taxis - to prepare for the new age of autos. 
Besides vehicles, Geely has a Danish bank, a startup that's developing vehicle control software technology and Geespace, a China-based firm which got the green light from Beijing this year to make low-orbit satellites that will be the eyes in the sky for fully autonomous machines. The scale of his investments - spanning Europe, Southeast Asia, China and the United States - is unique among Chinese auto firms.
Asked about his role, some of Li Shufu's rivals said his status as a relative newcomer to the industry gives Geely a potential advantage. He isn't weighed down by a big network of gasoline-related suppliers, for instance, said an engineer at  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, who spoke on condition of anonymity: That makes it easier for him to shift to a digital industry.
""Among traditional automakers, Geely has a more sophisticated lens on the future of mobility,"" said Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai and a former Chrysler executive. ""They understand the nature of this model is shifting from a pure-play manufacturer.""
But Li Shufu's ambitions face mounting challenges. To realize this vision, executives at several rivals say he needs to upgrade perceptions of his own Chinese-brand cars. 
""Geely's biggest challenge is its name, in part because of its past as a low-cost, entry car brand,"" said an executive at Honda Motor Co. ""How does Geely go from that to become an Apple-like brand? All legacy automakers struggle with that, but that is particularly a tall challenge for Geely.""
And Li Shufu is moving in an increasingly tense global climate. 
His strategy of building diverse alliances around the world has been made possible by the past 15 years of relative openness to technology-sharing and marketing collaboration. Now superpower rivalry between the United States and China has led to a bitter trade war, and Washington and its allies are blocking the expansion of major Chinese tech companies.
The Chinese entrepreneur is undeterred, and says his foreign investments are a map of opportunity. 
""All roads might lead to Rome,"" Li Shufu said. ""But the question is which is the right road and which road leads to Rome fastest?""
Like many other businesses in China, Geely appears keen to keep in lockstep with the pronouncements of President Xi Jinping, who has increasingly called for the need to promote what he calls ""common prosperity."" In June, ahead of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary, Geely issued a press release announcing the ""Geely Common Prosperity Initiative"" to help employees in the city of Ningbo where the company has multiple facilities.
Li Shufu has been a member of some political bodies in China. He was previously a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a top political advisory body. And he was a delegate in March this year to the National People's Congress, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament.
""SOFAS ON WHEELS""
The third of four brothers born to farmers in a fishing village called Luqiao, Li Shufu's business is rooted in the entrepreneurial boom of the mid-1980s led by the economic reforms of China's then leader, Deng Xiaoping. Li Shufu pivoted to wheels from photography via fridges, and was producing vehicles before he had the necessary paperwork.
Opportunity first knocked when he went for a high-school graduation photo in the early 1980s. Seeing the line of his peers outside the village studio snake around the block, he pestered the photographer for an apprenticeship.
Then, Li Shufu said, he borrowed 120 yuan - about $70 at the time, or five times the average monthly rural income in his province - from his father. He bought a Chinese Seagull camera, jumped on a bicycle and established the first mobile studio in his village, charging 0.48 yuan per portrait.
With money flowing in, he said he experimented with salvaging appliances and melting the components to extract metals, started making fridge components and in 1986, at age 23, registered the company that became Geely.
His village has now been absorbed by the city of Taizhou. Mom-and-pop machine shops in an area stretching down to Wenzhou diversified from trades such as repairing fishing boats to making cigarette lighters, belt buckles, and eventually motorbike and car components.
In the early 1990s, Li Shufu looked at a mangled motorbike brought into his factory, saw how simple it was mechanically and decided to make bikes, according to his official biographer at Geely.
Soon he was dreaming of cars. He dismantled existing models to see how they worked, and quietly built a car plant and made some primitive prototypes, the biographer told Reuters.
The first model, the Geely Haoqing, was finished in 1997. It was a disaster. His engineers had not water-proofed it and torrents gushed into the cabin when it was tested for leaks.
To progress in an industry tightly controlled by the state, Li Shufu needed Communist Party support.
In 1999 - the year Tesla chief Elon Musk sold his online publishing startup - Li Shufu persuaded an up-and-coming Communist Party official to give him the licence to manufacture cars in China officially, by saying they were not that complicated to produce - they were really just ""two sofas with four wheels,"" he said.
His factory wouldn't cost the state anything, he recalled telling the official: ""At least give me a chance to fail."" 
Reuters could not verify that account, but by the following year, the waterproofed Haoqing was rolled out to showrooms in large numbers.
CHANGE OF PLAN
Geely was soon selling a few hundred thousand rough-and-ready cars a year - models with bumpers that tended to sag after a few years - but Li Shufu had his sights on the global market.
Geely displayed one of its models in the lobby of the Cobo exhibition hall in downtown Detroit at the 2006 auto show, with a view to setting up a plant and sales network in the United States. In March 2007 a group of potential U.S. backers gathered at Geely's headquarters in China to discuss how to help set up a U.S. factory. 
Li Shufu announced he had changed course.
""He basically said, 'I have a new plan,'"" said one of those present, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""'We wonder if Volvo might be for sale?'""
There was an awkward silence. Li Shufu, who declined to comment on this version of events, told the investors it would take too long to engineer vehicles to meet U.S. safety and emissions regulations, the person said. Buying a brand like Volvo - renowned for its safety and reliability - would be a quicker way to acquire technology and become an established name.
Volvo initially wasn't for sale - Li Shufu was rebuffed by Ford's Don Leclair at their meeting. But as the global financial crisis hit U.S. carmakers, Ford turned to preserving its core business, and parted with Volvo. ""We elected to sell a storied brand to a great new owner,"" a spokesperson said.
By 2010, Geely had mustered the funds for the deal. Most came as subsidised low-interest loans from the Chinese cities of Chengdu, Daqing and the Jiading district of Shanghai, the company said. Geely went on to build Volvo factories in the first two cities and a Volvo technology centre in the third.
Other auto firms, including Tesla and Ford, also received aid, in the form of billions of dollars in low-interest loans that year under the U.S. Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, a bailout following the global financial crisis. 
Meanwhile, China's car market had boomed. And Volvo, which was running at a loss when Li Shufu took over, was in the black. Geely and Volvo executives said they made Volvo profitable chiefly by beefing up its presence in China, sharing components and suppliers and developing common platforms.
A DISADVANTAGE
The year that Geely bought Volvo, Tesla became the first American car company to sell its shares to the public since Ford in 1956. Based in Palo Alto, Tesla had a two-seater electric sports car, which Musk called ""a freaking technology velociraptor,"" saying it was ready to revolutionise the way Americans buy and drive cars.
Li Shufu also saw the need to go electric. Geely and Volvo set up a joint technology centre in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2013 and developed hybrid and electric vehicle ventures Lynk & Co. and Polestar a few years later. Earlier this year, it launched Zeekr in China, a new electric car brand.
But Li Shufu and his lieutenant Daniel Li, the Chief Executive of Geely Holding, faced another obstacle.
The likes of Tesla - backed by venture capital hungry for the next big thing - could command high valuations without delivering profits, making it easy for them to raise capital. Geely was at a disadvantage, the Geely executives said, partly because its investor base of pension funds and investment funds is tasked with taking lower risks to achieve steady returns.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment for this story. It made a full-year profit for the first time last year. But its market value has surged from $34 billion in 2016 to a peak of $834 billion in January.
Since 2011, Geely's Hong Kong listed business - a subsidiary of Geely Holding Group - has reported net profits every year, averaging 5.19 billion yuan or $800 million at today's rates. Its market value is about $35 billion.
The way forward, Li Shufu decided, was to combine resources with legacy carmakers, known in the industry as original equipment makers (OEMs).
""If traditional OEMs ... didn't invest in new technologies and trends, we would die. But if each OEM simply made huge investments by itself, we would also not survive,"" Geely Holding Chief Executive Daniel Li told Reuters. ""We have to make those investments in a smarter and more collaborative way.""
That thinking was behind yet another gamble by Li Shufu.
""CIRCLE OF FRIENDS""
He identified Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) AG, a firm with roots dating back to the world's first gasoline car in 1886, as a key candidate for his ""circle of friends."" But the Geely boss knew that if he knocked on Daimler's front door he would not be taken seriously, two Geely sources said.
So, starting in October 2017, Geely began discreetly building a stake in Daimler, as Reuters has previously reported https://reut.rs/3qD9uTX.
Using Hong Kong shell companies called Tenaciou3, Miroku and Fujikiro, as well as derivatives, bank financing and carefully structured share options, Geely stayed in the shadows until the following February. Then it stunned the auto world by announcing it was Daimler's biggest shareholder, with a 9.69% stake that cost roughly $9 billion.
Asked where Geely got the cash, a person familiar with the matter said it bought some Daimler shares and used them as collateral for a loan to buy more, a point Reuters couldn't confirm. Li Shufu said in an interview posted on the People's Daily website at the time that Geely had used only ""offshore"" funds to execute the deal.
The move aroused alarm in Germany, where the government was wary of Chinese firms' interest in domestic champions and their technology. A group of Geely executives led by Li Shufu launched a four-day diplomatic tour to calm the waters.
Meeting Daimler's top brass, government officials and lawmakers in Berlin and Stuttgart, the Geely team said they were seeking synergies, not domination, Daniel Li said. Their interest in Daimler wasn't about economies of scale, they said, but about the pressing need for legacy automakers to form joint ventures and divvy up the cost of developing new technologies.
In some of the meetings, Li Shufu floated his idea of using hundreds of proprietary mini, low-orbit satellites as a more accurate global positioning system for self-driving cars, Daniel Li said.
Daimler and Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on those meetings. Germany has since lowered the threshold for screening purchases of stakes in German firms by non-Europeans; last year it blocked the takeover of a satellite and radar technology company by a state-controlled Chinese missile maker.
Following the trip, Daimler initially offered to let Geely buy its troubled Smart brand of tiny urban cars outright. Li Shufu wanted more. 
In September 2018, at a lunch at the Mercedes-Benz museum with Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche, the two agreed to form a 50-50 joint venture to transform Smart into a network of electric urban transporters, two people familiar with the meeting said. Zetsche declined to comment for this article. 
Geely and Daimler have since agreed several joint new investments: a premium ride-hailing service in China called StarRides; a super-efficient gasoline engine for hybrid cars; and stakes in German electric flying taxi startup, Volocopter. Geely is also sharing its electric vehicle platform technologies, supply chains and factories with Daimler while using the German brand name and sales network to market new Smart models.
Making cars is only one source of revenue Geely is targeting. Another will be non-traditional vehicle sales such as car subscription services, which will enable car-owners to make money from the loan of their vehicles when they aren't using them, Li Shufu and Daniel Li told Reuters.
As a first step, Geely is already rolling out a subscription model in Europe this year for its hybrid Lynk & Co SUVs. Throw in ride-hailing, battery charge-and-swap services that are already in operation, as well as selling the software to operate electric vehicles, and Geely aims to have an array of alternative revenue streams.
NEW SENSITIVITIES
As Li Shufu ventures into the age of self-driving autos, he also enters more sensitive ground. The still-nascent area is delicate - because passenger safety is not yet assured, and also because the technology crosses over into areas with national security implications.
""You may ask why Volvo and Geely are not aggressively promoting their self-drive technology by now?"" Li Shufu said. ""If you are to uphold Volvo safety traditions and standards, we can only call it autonomous self-drive technology when people can close their eyes and doze off in a self-drive car with 100% safety guaranteed."" 
To beef up the slow, inaccurate connectivity and vehicle positioning capability of current cars, Li Shufu wants to use low-orbit satellites: He said the technology should be able to position and navigate a car with a margin of error of a few millimetres.
To be fast enough for safety, the satellite technology would need to be augmented by others including 5G cellular signals, radar and digital cameras, said William Malik, a cybersecurity expert at Trend Micro (OTC:TMICY) Inc.
When developing satellite technology, Geely may also face a U.S. ban on the export of space and satellite technology to China. The United States is increasing trade restrictions on Chinese tech businesses. 

Geely said it doesn't comment on political issues. 
But Li Shufu says he thinks global companies should go ahead and pursue global integration. ""We can do business together and maximise synergies within an industry,"" he said. ""That's why I'm all against cutting off ties.""

Investing.com – Hillrom stock (NYSE:HRC) traded 4.4% higher and Baxter (NYSE:BAX) 0.5% up in Thursday’s premarket as the two companies agreed to combine.
As per the terms, Baxter will pay $156 for each share of Hillrom, a 7.5% premium to the stock’s closing on Wednesday. That assigns the company an equity value of $10.5 billion, and a total enterprise value including debt of $12.4 billion.
Hillrom is a maker of hospital beds and patient-monitoring devices. Baxter is a medical-technology company focusing on critical care, nutrition and surgical products.
Baxter expects the combination to result in around $250 million of savings in costs. It said the deal is EPS accretive and that it will finance it through a combination of cash and debt.
The transaction is expected to close by early 2022.
In the interim, Baxter issued long-term financial guidance that ignores any impact from the proposed acquisition.
Baxter expects sales to grow 4%-5%, compounded annually from 2021 to 2024.
(CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the enterprise value of the combined group.)"
401,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>",Singapore Rolls Out SPAC Rules as Global Scrutiny Rises,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) Ltd. has introduced a framework for blank-check companies to list in the city-state, the first Asian financial hub to host the vehicles whose popularity in global financial markets has surged over the past year.
Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, will be allowed to list in Singapore starting Friday under a more liberal rulebook than initially envisioned by the exchange. The entities require a minimum market capitalization of S$150 million ($112 million), half of the amount SGX proposed earlier, while certain limits on warrants and share redemption have been removed, a statement from the bourse showed Thursday.
Beating Hong Kong to the punch, Singapore’s approval comes as global financial regulators are stepping up scrutiny of SPACs. While firms worldwide have raised a total of $130 billion this year via SPACs -- according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- the pace of listings has abated in recent months with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission calling for more disclosures and a recent earnings bust validating some concerns over the structures.
The introduction of the rules positions SGX “as a regional first-mover in serving Asia’s fast-growing new tech and new economy companies’ financing needs,” a spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a statement.
SGX changed its proposed rules for SPAC listings following market feedback. The market wants “features that align sponsor interest with shareholder interest rather than what we proposed, which were features that restricted shareholder rights,” said Tan Boon Gin, chief executive officer at Singapore Exchange Regulation.
The exchange’s regulatory arm had earlier this year proposed tighter restrictions than in the U.S. as it looked to boost the local IPO market while also seeking to address worries over investor protection. In an interview in February, SGX’s chief executive officer Loh Boon Chye had said the exchange is aiming to list its first SPAC this year. 
More Relaxed Rules
While the “honeymoon period” with blank check companies in the U.S. seems to have come to an end, “international sponsors may see Singapore as a good neutral exchange to launch their SPACs and attract Asian targets” given Sino-U.S. tensions, said Stefanie Yuen Thio, joint managing partner at legal firm TSMP Law Corp.
The pool of Asia-based target firms for SPACs, which sell shares to raise money and explore takeovers, is mainly in the S$500 million to S$1 billion range -- making a S$150 million threshold more market-friendly. Under the new rules too, warrants will now be detachable from shares while investors who vote in favor of a business combination will be allowed to redeem shares.
Meanwhile, market participants expect SPACs to boost Singapore’s IPO business, at a time when Southeast Asian companies are looking attractive. 
READ: Overlooked IPO Markets Are Suddenly Booming as China Deals Slow
“There is an ecosystem of companies in Singapore that have a regional footprint and they may choose to list in Singapore; tech will definitely be a relevant sector as SPACs take off,”  said Vineet Mishra, co-head of Asean investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
Here are some of the rules at a glance:

402,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>","Five Below Slumps as Revenue Falls Short, Q3 Guidance Disappoints","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Five Below stock (NASDAQ:FIVE) plunged 10% in Thursday’s premarket trading as its May-July revenue fell short of expectations and the discount retailer's guidance for the ongoing quarter disappointed.
Third-quarter net sales are expected to be around $557.5 million, based on opening approximately 40-45 new stores and assuming a 5% increase in comparable sales. That represents an abrupt deceleration in sales after second-quarter revenue rose 52% to $646.6 million and comparable sales grew 39%.
Adjusted profit per share more than doubled to $1.15 and topped analysts’ estimates.
Sales rose as consumer spending - particularly among Generation Z, the discount retailer’s target audience - came back. However, analysts had expected more, their estimate for second-quarter sales being $657.81 million. The company opened 34 new stores during the second quarter and ended July with 1,121 stores in 39 states.
The company again declined to give annual guidance, which has been suspended for seven straight quarters.
Five Below had last given annual guidance in December 2019, but suspended it at the start of the pandemic, like many others. However, most companies have since restored the practice. Five Below blamed Covid-19, potential future shifts in consumer spending, and ongoing global supply chain disruptions for its stance.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore Exchange unveiled new rules allowing special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to list in the city-state, after easing some measures viewed as too strict by participants, as it seeks to tap a global trend in such listings.
SGX's rules, effective from Friday, would make it the first Asian bourse to allow blank check companies to list after the frenzy seen in such investment vehicles in the United States since last year, although the popularity seems to be peaking.
Following a market consultation, SGX's regulatory arm halved the minimum capitalisation requirement for SPAC listings to S$150 million ($112 million) from its proposal issued in March.
It also said it would now allow warrants to be detachable and all shareholders would have redemption rights, making the overall rules mostly similar to U.S. markets.
""We reduced the market cap in response to market feedback that the biggest pool of Asian targets is in the S$500 mln to S$1 billion market cap range and the size of the target is usually 3-8 times the size of the SPAC,"" Tan Boon Gin, CEO of Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) Regulation, told Reuters.
Citing sources, Reuters reported on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-singapore-exchange-roll-out-easier-rules-spac-listings-sources-2021-09-01 that the SGX was set to issue easier rules for SPAC listings.
SPACs are shell corporations that list on stock exchanges and then merge with an existing company to take that public, offering it shorter listing timeframes and strong valuations.
""We are likely to see significant interest from sponsors and institutional investors in SPACs and that bodes well for the Singapore market,"" said Yin Mei Lock, a partner at Allen & Overy.
FIRST MOVER
In other markets, Hong Kong and Indonesia are taking tentative steps for potential SPAC listings, while Britain has eased rules. https://www.reuters.com/business/britain-eases-spac-rules-attract-listings-2021-07-27 But such investment vehicles are peaking in popularity in the United States as regulators there clamp down on SPACs https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-us-sec-focuses-bank-fee-conflicts-it-steps-up-spac-inquiry-sources-2021-07-13 after a listing frenzy.
A spokesperson from the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the local rules position SGX ""as a regional first-mover in serving Asia's fast-growing new tech and new economy companies' financing needs"", while providing safeguards for investors.
SGX, which has struggled to capture large listings of high-growth firms and faces prospects of losing out in courting Southeast Asian startups looking to list in their home markets https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/bukalapak-indonesias-biggest-ipo-up-25-blockbuster-debut-2021-08-06 or in the United States, expects the rules to boost listings.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Thursday, but gains are likely to be limited ahead of the release of more important employment data, with the Federal Reserve’s tapering plans at the forefront of investors’ thoughts.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 50 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
Improvements in the U.S. labor market are key to the Federal Reserve’s thinking over when to start winding down its massive bond-buying program. This was made clear in Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at the virtual Jackson Hole symposium on Friday.
With this in mind, Friday’s release of the nonfarm payrolls figure for August looms large, with economists looking for 750,000 jobs to have been created last month, a drop from July’s 943,000. 
“Friday’s jobs report is the most important event risk this week and, while economists and investors expect job growth to slow, the significantly weaker-than-anticipated ADP number raises concerns for nonfarm payrolls,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management, in a note. 
Thursday sees another guide to the labor market recovery, with the release of the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The data slate also includes second-quarter productivity and unit labor costs as well as factory orders for July. 
In corporate news, chip maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will offer up the key earnings release Thursday, after the close. 
Additionally, ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) will be in the spotlight after the electric vehicle infrastructure company raised its guidance late Wednesday following second-quarter record revenue that beat estimates.
Pet retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and the discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) are likely to see a more difficult start to trading Thursday after they both reported disappointing quarterly results.
Crude prices pushed higher Thursday, helped by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, raising its demand forecast for 2022, while continuing to add supply to the market, as well as a sharp drop in U.S. crude inventories.
Doubts remain about demand growth in the near term, however, given the continued spread of Covid-19 in the U.S. and Europe, and with a number of U.S. refiners, a major source of demand, remaining offline after Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast area earlier in the week. Demand levels will also take time to return to normal in and around New York City, which was battered by the remnants of Ida on Wednesday.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $68.97 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $72.04.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,817.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1854.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>",China expected to keep curbs on int'l flights throughout H1 2022 - Air China to analysts,"BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's aviation regulator is likely to keep the current tight caps on international flights throughout the first half of 2022, analysts cited Air China (OTC:AIRYY) as saying this week. 
The move has broad implications for tourism in the Asia-Pacific region, where Chinese outbound travellers normally play an outsized role, though other countries have also been slow to open borders because of relatively low vaccination rates and rising COVID-19 cases.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last month said that weekly international flights were at only 2% of 2019 levels, as more flights were suspended amid a rising number of imported COVID-19 cases.
China's three biggest airlines, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), said in their earnings calls that CAAC's restrictions on international flights may continue until the first half of 2022, given the government's COVID-19 prevention approach around the Beijing Winter Olympics in February, Parash Jain, head of shipping, ports and Asian transport research at HSBC, said in a note on Wednesday.
This would push a full recovery further out to 2024, Jain added.
Expectations of a delayed recovery in international travel have partly led some analysts to lower earnings forecasts over the next few years. China Merchants Securities, for example, cut their estimates for net profit for Air China to -9 billion, 2.7 billion, and 6.7 billion yuan in 2021, 2022, 2023. 
Air China management told analysts that the recovery of China's outbound travel would be slower than that in the United States and Europe, adding that the vast majority of developing countries have not achieved high vaccination rates.
They added CAAC was not expected to loosen restrictions until after the first half of 2022. 
Chinese airlines do not hold a media call on results, but two analysts briefed Reuters on what was said, speaking anonymously because they were not authorised to comment beyond notes to clients. Air China and CAAC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 

CAAC slashed international flights in March 2020 to allay concerns over rising coronavirus infections. A so-called ""Five One"" policy allows mainland carriers to fly just one flight a week on one route to any country and foreign airlines to operate just one flight a week to China.
The CAAC has the tweaked the policy with flight suspensions or capacity caps for airlines if a certain number of passengers are found to have been infected with COVID-19, or adding flights if an airline does not import any cases.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is facing an antitrust challenge in India for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters.
The allegations are similar to a case Apple faces in the European Union https://reut.rs/38nEVZZ, where regulators last year started an investigation into Apple's imposition of an in-app fee of 30% for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.
The Indian case was filed by a little-known, non-profit group which argues Apple's fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry.
""The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market ... This could also result in consumer harm,"" said the filing, which has been seen by Reuters.
Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) are not made public. Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
In the coming weeks, the CCI will review the case and could order its investigations arm to conduct a wider probe, or dismiss it altogether if it finds no merit in it, said a source familiar with the matter.
""There are high chances that an investigation can be ordered, also because the EU has been probing this,"" said the person, who declined to be identified as the case details are not public.
The complainant, non-profit ""Together We Fight Society"" which is based in India's western state of Rajasthan, told Reuters in a statement it filed the case in the interest of protecting Indian consumers and startups. 
In India, though Apple's iOS powered just about 2% of 520 million smartphones by end-2020 - with the rest using Android - Counterpoint Research says the U.S. firm's smartphone base in the country has more than doubled in the last five years. 
The Apple case in India comes just as South Korea's parliament this week approved a bill that bans major app store operators like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Apple from forcing software developers to use their payment systems.
""MIDDLEMAN IN TRANSACTIONS""
Companies like Apple and Google say their fee covers the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide, but many companies disagree.
Last year, after Indian startups publicly voiced concern https://reut.rs/3kA0hsS over a similar in-app payments fee charged by Google, the CCI ordered an investigation https://reut.rs/3l9vJgB into it as part of a broader antitrust probe into the company. That investigation is ongoing.
The India antitrust case against Apple also alleges that its restrictions on how developers communicate with users to offer payment solutions are anti-competitive, and also hurt the country's payment processors who offer services at lower charges in the range of 1-5%.
Apple has hurt competitors by restricting developers from informing users of alternative purchasing possibilities, thereby harming ""app developers' relationship with their customers by inserting itself as middleman in every in-app transaction,"" the filing added.
In recent weeks, Apple has loosened some of the restrictions for developers globally, like allowing them to use communications - such as email - to share information about payment alternatives outside of their iOS app.
And on Wednesday, it said it would allow some apps to provide customers an in-app link to bypass Apple's purchase system, though the U.S. firm retained a ban on allowing other forms of payment options inside apps.
Gautam Shahi, a competition law partner at Indian law firm Dua Associates, said that even if companies change their behaviour after an antitrust case in filed, the CCI still looks at past conduct.

""The CCI will look at recent years to see if the law was violated and if consumers and competition were harmed,"" said Shahi.
The CCI has plans to speed up all cases involving big technology firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google by deploying additional officers and working to more stringent internal deadlines, Reuters reported https://reut.rs/3sYEAXc in June.

Net sales grew 27% to $2.16 billion, fractionally below the $2.17 billion analysts estimated. The company had produced a strong series of numbers as broader pet ownership became one of the less-expected side-effects of pandemic-induced lockdowns. That trend is now easing as economies reopen, people step out and pet adoption reverts to normal levels.

Investing.com – ChargePoint stock (NYSE:CHPT) soared 12% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the company raised its guidance following second-quarter record revenue that beat estimates.
Increased mobility as a result of reopening of economies boosted revenue. Growth was significant in North America and Europe across the commercial, fleet and residential verticals.
Commercial customers of all types are investing in charging for their consumers, employees and visitors and demand for residential products has grown as vehicle arrivals accelerate.
The company raised its full-year revenue outlook to a range around $230 million, up 15% from the guidance given in June. That reflects the increasing penetration of the U.S. and European car markets by electric vehicles. ChargePoint had originally assumed 2.3 million EV sales in those markets in 2021, which would represent growth of 40% from 2020.
ChargePoint’s activated ports exceeded 118,000 as of July 31 with over 5,400 in Europe and over 3,700 DC fast-charging ports.
The company grew its quarterly revenue 61% on-year to $56.12 million. Net losses narrowed to $92.36 million, but on a per share basis, were lower than analysts’ estimate.

PARIS (Reuters) -Luxury goods billionaire Bernard Arnault has effectively cut ties with Paris Match publisher Lagardere's heir and boss, leaving the media group more exposed to takeovers.
France's richest man, known for running Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, came to Arnaud Lagardere's aid last year with an investment to help fight off an activist and mop up his debts.
But that bet turned sour when another media tycoon, Vincent Bollore, took an interest and became top shareholder with 27% of the Lagardere conglomerate, which also operates in travel retail and publishing and owns influential newspapers.
Lagardere confirmed that Arnault's Agache investment firm was exiting Lagardere's personal holding company and instead raising its direct stake in Lagardere to 10%.
Shareholder agreements between Arnault and Arnaud Lagardere will be ended, Lagardere said in a statement late on Wednesday. 
Shares in Lagardere fell slightly on Thursday, after plunging in previous days on speculation of a restructuring. 
The shake-up diminishes the voting rights of Lagardere, who once held vast sway over the company founded by his late father through a partnership structure, giving him a strong buffer against takeovers. He now has an 11% stake.
Bollore is seen as a prime candidate for a Lagardere bid, although he can now also exercise influence with his stake. 
The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), meanwhile, holds 11.5% of the company, while Amber Capital, which campaigned for a governance overhaul, has 18.5%. 

Arnault, who built up LVMH through acquisitions, has been unravelling some of his less successful side investments. 
Agache on Tuesday exited its minority stake in  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), the French supermarket group now reaping the fruits of a turnaround but whose shares lost value over Arnault's 14 year investment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors in Europe's seven biggest markets increased their opposition to executive pay and the re-election of some directors in the most recent season for annual general meetings, consultancy Georgeson said in a report https://www.georgeson.com/uk/insights/2021-agm-season-review.
Across the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, France, Switzerland and Italy, contested director elections - classed as any vote receiving 'significant' dissent of more than 10% of votes cast - increased 37% year-on-year, it said.
After a tough year marked by the economic damage caused by the global pandemic and associated lock-downs, executive pay faced greater scrutiny, with an 18% increase in the number of contested votes.
Spain saw the highest proportion of contested pay resolutions, at 60.6% of those for firms in the country's blue-chip IBEX 35 index, up a third from the prior year. The lowest level of dissent was in the UK, the region's biggest stock market.
France and Switzerland saw the highest levels of rebellion against the re-election of directors, up 77.3% and 142% respectively, the report said.

Nearly a quarter of all resolutions aimed at issuing new shares were also contested.
""The increased opposition to votes on remuneration, director elections and share issuance is a warning for companies to focus on their shareholder engagement and education, particularly during the off-season,"" said Domenic Brancati, chief executive for UK and Europe at Georgeson.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Explainer-How unions work in China,"By David Kirton
SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese tech giants Didi Global Inc and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com have set up unions for their staff in landmark moves in the country's tech sector where organised labour is rare.
E-commerce company JD.com established its trade union this week, according to a newspaper affiliated with the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions while the union for ride-hailing platform Didi was announced on an internal forum last month, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
WHY ARE THE TECH COMPANIES ESTABLISHING UNIONS?
Didi and JD.com are the biggest tech firms in China to establish company-wide unions up until now, though authorities in a county in Hubei province said in June that local subsidiaries of delivery firms Meituan and Ele.me, owned by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), have also established unions.
The government is encouraging companies to implement initiatives to share wealth as part of a recent ""common prosperity"" drive laid out by President Xi Jinping to ease inequality in the world's second-largest economy.
China's Communist Party is preparing for major political meetings in November as it reviews its development over its 100 years of existence, with the meetings expected to outline the government's vision for the country's economy.
Ahead of this, China's tech titans have been facing a multi-pronged crackdown across sectors including gaming, the sharing economy, including bike and even phone-power pack sharing, cloud computing, algorithms and IPOs.
While China's private-led tech sector has developed with a relatively light-touch from regulators over the last decade, some work culture practices appear to be coming in for greater scrutiny.
Many rely on flexible workers who number 200 million nationwide, according to state media.
Didi, which provides 25 million rides a day, has been criticised by state media for not paying its drivers fairly. In April it said it would set up a drivers committee to improve income stability and transparency over wages. 
It is also the subject of an investigation launched by several Chinese regulators on the heels of its $4.4 billion U.S. stock market listing.
Last month, China's top court said the overtime practice of ""996"", working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, a policy common among many Chinese technology firms, was illegal.
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF LABOUR UNIONS IN CHINA?
Labour unions have a central place in the Chinese Communist Party's proletariat beginnings, and workers' rights have grown in importance as China moved from a planned economy to a more market-oriented one. The country boasts the biggest union in the world, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), a state-run body. 
All unions in China are required to register with the ACFTU and have largely been confined to sectors such as manufacturing and transport. 
However, ACFTU's track record in negotiating better terms for workers has, however, often been criticised.
Aidan Chau, a researcher at the Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, said the country's unions rarely directly challenged how companies treat their workers, focusing instead on matters such as alleviating employee grievances and promoting work safety.
Xi is reported to have criticised the ACFTU behind closed doors as early as 2013 for not doing more for workers, according to academics and former union cadres, telling ACFTU to ""break new ground"" in supporting workers and unions in November 2018.
Yet support for unions has been less clear in practice. 
Also in late 2018, protests over sacked workers at Jasic International, a welding machinery manufacturer in the southern city of Huizhou, led to detentions of the student activists, and two trade union officials who helped set up the union. 
Since then labour rights groups have faced increased police harassment and intimidation, several people formerly involved in rights groups have told Reuters.
WHAT ARE THE NEW TECH COMPANY UNIONS EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE? 

In July, the ACFTU and seven other top Chinese government bodies published guidance about safeguarding the rights of gig economy workers and suggested unions could play a role in helping negotiate with firms, mediate disputes and provide legal aid for workers.
It remains unclear what the exact aims are of Didi's union, while JD.com said some of its local units have created unions in recent years and the new group-level union will help them with planning and coordination.

China further deregulated its financial markets in 2019, allowing foreign asset managers to form majority-owned wealth management ventures with local banks. Foreign expertise can help Chinese lenders grow their investment capabilities as they phase out risky shadow banking businesses. 
Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters that the investment management arm of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) will hold a majority stake in the planned venture with AgBank's wealth management subsidiary.
BNP Paribas declined to comment. AgBank, China's third biggest lender by assets, did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.
French rival Amundi and U.S. fund giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) have already formed Chinese wealth management ventures, while  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are following suit.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management has partnered with China Merchants Bank's wealth management unit.
BNP Paribas Asset Management is in talks to form the venture with AgBank's Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management Co, the sources said, without giving financial details.
BNP Paribas AM already owns a Chinese mutual fund venture, and the new alliance would give it access to AgBank's massive retail customer base. 
""Getting the wealth management license is worth the effort,"" a source with direct knowledge of the talks said.
Amundi initially discussed venture plans with AgBank, but eventually chose Bank of China as its partner, another said.
AgBank and other major state banks face political pressure to form wealth management JVs, sources said, an indication of China's willingness to open up which could help Chinese banks build globally competitive asset management businesses.
BNP Paribas AM manages 489 billion euros ($579 billion) in assets, and offers a comprehensive range of active, passive and quantitative investment solutions. It's also a major player in sustainable investing, which Beijing is aggressively promoting.
AgBank's wealth management unit, set up in July 2019, had 1.1 trillion yuan ($170.24 billion)in wealth management products at the end of June.
China's asset management market will grow to 210 trillion yuan in 2025, from 122 trillion yuan at the end of 2020, China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank and Boston Consulting Group estimate.

In order to achieve this, the Munich-based automaker intends to increase the proportion of recycled and reusable materials used in manufacturing its vehicles from 30% to 50%, it said in a statement released ahead of the IAA (NYSE:IAA) Mobility conference in Munich next week. 
""We are committed to a clear course to achieve the 1.5 degree target,"" CEO Oliver Zipse said, referring to the Paris Agreement.
BMW has been reluctant to set a hard deadline for phasing out fossil-fuel cars, pointing out limitations to the expansion of electric vehicles including the sore lack of charging infrastructure across the EU and elsewhere.

Still, the automaker has set a range of sustainability targets in the past, including generating at least half of BMW Group sales from electric vehicles by 2030 and reducing CO2 emissions per vehicle and kilometre driven by at least half from 2019 levels in the same time frame.
Like its competitors, the company has warned that its revenues in coming months could be plagued by chip shortages and raw material prices, despite reporting stronger than expected profits in its latest quarterly results.

418,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",European Stocks Calm; Payrolls and ECB Stimulus in Focus,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- European stock markets traded largely unchanged Thursday, with investors displaying caution ahead of Friday’s key U.S. payrolls release while European Central Bank members discussed withdrawing monetary stimulus. At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%, with mining heavyweight BHP (LON:BHPB) weighing as it went ex-dividend.
The rebound in the Eurozone economy, coupled with a sharp rise in inflation, has brought the subject of the ECB’s extraordinary monetary support back into debate, to the possible detriment of the region’s stock markets.
Earlier this week, inflation in the euro region jumped to 3%, well above the ECB’s goal, and this prompted Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, to talk on Wednesday about scaling back this stimulus.
While Weidmann and fellow hawks Robert Holzmann and Klaas Knot are typically in a minority on the ECB's governing council, the accounts of the ECB's last meeting included the clearest acknowledgement of excessive inflation risks since the start of the pandemic 19 months ago.
The region’s July PPI number, due for release at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), will be carefully studied.
The week’s major focus, though, is Friday’s release of the key August monthly U.S. employment report as this could guide future Federal Reserve policy.
Median forecasts are for a rise of 750,000 nonfarm jobs, but the ADP nonfarm employment change disappointed at 374,000. The weekly initial jobless claims data, later Thursday, will also be watched as a precursor to Friday’s release.
Back in Europe,  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  (ST:SOBIV) stock soared 24% after U.S. venture capital firm Advent International and Aurora Investment offered to buy the drugmaker.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock rose 0.6% after the budget airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, said it flew 11.1 million passengers in August, above target and 75% of the number it carried in August 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic, while British engineering firm  Melrose  Industries (LON:MRON) stock climbed 4.2% as it reported a first-half profit.
On the flip side, Lagardere (PA:LAGA) stock fell 0.8% following billionaire Bernard Arnault restructuring his holdings in the French media and publishing firm, while CMC Markets (LON:CMCX) stock slumped 25% after the U.K. based financial services group issued a profit warning as summer trading was sluggish.
Crude prices stabilized Thursday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, confirmed its intention at a meeting Wednesday to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month through December. However, the group also raised its demand forecast for 2022.
Doubts remain about demand growth in the near term, however, given the continued spread of Covid-19 in the U.S. and Europe, and with a number of U.S. refiners, a major source of demand, remaining offline after Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast area earlier in the week. 
That said, U.S. crude inventories dropped by a hefty 7.2 million barrels last week as the U.S. gears up for the last peak of its summer driving season this weekend. 
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded flat at $68.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $71.61.

Just a few weeks ago, it appeared that there was little that could knock a robust dollar. Fast forward, and uncertainty over the timing of Federal Reserve tapering is providing ammunition for dollar bears.
And recent days have seen the greenback undermined further as hawkish comments from a slew of European Central Bank policymakers have made investors sit up and sense signs of a shift in euro area monetary policy.
Don't forget the backdrop to the barrage of hawkish ECB talk was data showing consumer inflation in the currency bloc has surged to a 10-year high - challenging the view that price pressures are transitory.
Inflation is at risk of overshooting the ECB's projections, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Wednesday.
So no surprise then that the euro is trading near one-month highs above $1.18, having recovered around 1.5% from 9-1/2 month lows hit less than two weeks ago. The dollar index is not far off its lowest levels in almost a month.
Euro area bond yields too have shot up.
Both data and central bank-speak will remain in the spotlight. Thursday's highlights include July U.S. industrial production, factory orders and trade balance data, along with the weekly initial jobless claims.
Concern about a slowdown in China, the world's number two economy, is keeping world equity markets in a cautious mood. Asian shares held just below five-week highs, while European and U.S. stock futures were marginally lower.
Bank of Japan board member Goushi Kataoka warned the coronavirus may weigh on the economy longer than initially expected, warning of heightened risks to the central bank's forecast of a moderate, export-driven recovery.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell after OPEC+ agreed to keep its policy of gradually returning supply to the market at a time when coronavirus cases around the world are surging and many U.S. refiners, a key source of crude demand, remained offline.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
- Australia trade surplus hits record in July as resources boom
- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) loosens App Store payment rules for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), others in deal with Japan
- U.S. venture capital firm Advent International and Aurora Investment offered to buy Sweden's SOBI for $8 billion
- Euro zone July PPI

Globally carmakers have been hit by chip shortages and have warned of further pain due to stiff competition from the consumer electronics industry for semiconductor deliveries.
Mahindra said its revenue and profit will be impacted in line with the fall in production volumes, while its tractor, truck, bus and 3-wheeler production was unaffected.
The company will have about seven ""no production days"" at its automotive division plants this month, the company said in a filing http://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid= Earlier this week, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country's top carmaker, said it expected production at its plants in the states of Haryana and Gujarat to be affected in September due to semiconductor shortages. Indian automakers reported August sales on Wednesday, with most of them seeing a recovery from a year earlier. However, Mahindra's passenger vehicle sales in August were down 24%, Maruti sales fell 22.8% and  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd sales were down 7.2% month on month. Globally, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), have been caught off guard by a prolonged global chip shortage, forcing many to idle or curtail production. In July, Tata Motors warned it expected the chip supply crunch in the second quarter to be greater than the first. 
Due to the shortages and rising prices, automakers have focused on manufacturing high margin models and have passed on some of the costs to customers. Maruti hiked prices four times this year, while Tata Motors and Mahindra have also increased prices. On Thursday, Mahindra's shares fell as much as 1.5% following the update, but recovered some of the losses by 0540 GMT.

Regulators put the licence on hold when the bank's IPO principals left.
Deutsche had still been able to work on deals in a junior role but could not act as sponsor, which in Hong Kong is the most senior role on an IPO.
In Hong Kong, IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank, which typically collects a larger proportion of fees than banks listed only as bookrunners.
Deutsche has recruited a number of senior bankers, led by Ian Long as vice chairman of investment banking and coverage for Asia.
Long, alongside two other recent hires - Derek Chung and Albert Chang - will be the bank's IPO sponsor principals, according to the posting on the Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) website.

Deutsche Bank did not feature in the top 25 banks in the Asia Pacific equity capital markets league tables in the first half of this year, according to Refinitiv data.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan board member Goushi Kataoka said on Thursday the coronavirus pandemic may weigh on the economy longer than initially expected, warning of heightened risks to the central bank's forecast of a moderate, export-driven recovery.
Kataoka also stressed the BOJ's readiness to ramp up stimulus if needed, reinforcing market expectations Japan would lag other countries in exiting crisis-mode policies.
""Given recent domestic and global economic developments, the need for bolder steps is heightening,"" Kataoka told a briefing.
In another sign Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy will continue, Fumio Kishida - who is challenging Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to become ruling party chief - said Japan must ""not fall behind"" other countries in supporting their economies with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
In a speech, Kataoka said Japan's economic outlook was bound with uncertainty with consumption seen remaining in a ""severe state"" due to state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic.
""Risks to consumption are heightening,"" with a spike in Delta variant cases forcing Japan to maintain curbs on economic activity, he said. ""There's a good chance the impact of the pandemic may last longer than expected.""
An advocate of aggressive monetary easing, Kataoka has been a consistent, sole dissenter to the BOJ's decision to keep its interest rate targets unchanged.
Kataoka repeated his calls for the BOJ to ramp up government bond buying to push down borrowing costs for companies, so they can boost capital expenditure and invest in growth areas.
""Personally, I believe the BOJ must strengthen monetary easing"" as inflation will remain distant from the bank's 2% target for years even if the economy were to recover, he said.
His calls for bolder monetary easing steps have not gained support from the rest of the board at the BOJ's policy meetings.

Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and 10-year bond yields around 0% through massive asset purchases.
While inflation remains well below its 2% target, the rising cost of prolonged easing has forced the BOJ to steadily slow bond buying and focus on measures to mitigate the hit to bank profits from years of ultra-low interest rates.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower Thursday, weighed by talk of the European Central Bank withdrawing its monetary stimulus amid caution over China’s regulatory clampdown and Friday’s key U.S. payrolls release.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The rebound in the Eurozone economy, coupled with a sharp rise in inflation, has brought the subject of the ECB’s extraordinary monetary support back into debate, to the possible detriment of the region’s stock markets.
Earlier this week, inflation in the euro region jumped to 3%, well above the ECB’s goal, and this prompted Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, to talk on Wednesday about scaling back this stimulus.
“We have to watch the risks to the outlook for prices. In my view, upside risks predominate,” the German central bank chief said.
While Weidmann and fellow hawks Robert Holzmann and Klaas Knot are typically in a minority on the ECB's governing council, the accounts of the ECB's last meeting included the clearest acknowledgement of excessive inflation risks since the start of the pandemic 19 months ago.
Adding to the reasons to be cautious was continued evidence of a regulatory crackdown in China, with the country’s regulators calling in 11 ride-hailing and delivery firms, including giants Didi (NYSE:DIDI) and Meituan (OTC:MPNGY), over allegations they are recruiting unapproved drivers and vehicles.
That said, China also announced support for small- and medium-sized firms to help ease their financing burdens.
Investors around the world are also warily gearing up for Friday’s release of the key August monthly U.S. employment report as this could guide future Federal Reserve policy.
Median forecasts are for a rise of 750,000 nonfarm jobs, but the ADP nonfarm employment change disappointed at 374,000. The weekly initial claims data, later Thursday, will also be watched as a precursor to Friday’s release.
Back in Europe, earnings come from  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV) and Superdry (LON:SDRY), while French media and publishing firm Lagardere (PA:LAGA) will also be in the spotlight after billionaire Bernard Arnault restructured his holdings.
Crude prices weakened Thursday after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, confirmed its intention at a meeting Wednesday to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month through December. The group also raised its demand forecast for 2022 earlier this week.
Doubts remain about demand growth in the near term, however, given the continued spread of Covid-19 in the U.S. and Europe, and with a number of U.S. refiners, a major source of demand, remaining offline after Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast area earlier in the week. 
That said, U.S. crude inventories dropped by a hefty 7.2 million barrels last week as the U.S. gears up for the last peak of its summer driving season this weekend. 
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $68.33 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $71.38.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,816.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1845.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 11:51PM ET</span>",S.Korea inflation at 9-year peak fuels rate hike expectations,"By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's August consumer inflation stayed at a nine-year peak, raising the chances the central bank will hike rates again this year as strong demand adds to price pressures.
Consumer prices in August rose 2.6% from a year earlier, Statistics Korea said on Thursday, matching the rate in July, driven by a spike in fresh food prices due to a heat wave and high cost of oil products, housing rental and other services.
The inflation rate beat the 2.3% increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
The 2.6% rise was first seen in May, when inflation marked the fastest pace since April 2012, and continued to stay above the central bank's 2% target for a fifth straight month.
Thursday's data comes a week after the Bank of Korea raised its policy rate for the first time in almost three years, becoming the first major Asian central bank to shift away from pandemic-era monetary settings as ballooning consumer debt created new threats for the economy.
""Our base case is for the next hike to materialise in early 2022, but we acknowledge that increasing demand-side price pressures and rising inflation expectations could trigger an earlier move in November this year, if growth uncertainties ease by then,"" ANZ Economist Krystal Tan said in a note.
The breakdown of data showed the continued price surge for agricultural and oil products fuelled inflation.
The cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries and petroleum products jumped 7.8% and 21.6%, respectively, while that of housing rentals and dining rose 1.6% and 2.8% each.
CPI rose 0.6% month on month, the best reading since January and accelerating from 0.2% in July. Economists had forecast a 0.3% increase.
Meanwhile, core CPI rose 1.3% from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace since June 2018 and up from a 1.2% rise in July.
The BOK pushed up its inflation projection for 2021 to 2.1% from 1.8% previously, and sees it standing at 1.5% for the whole of 2022.

In the Reuters poll published last week, all 18 analysts who gave end-2022 forecasts saw further rate increases next year, after the BOK raised its policy rate from record lows to 0.75%.
A slim majority of 10 analysts predicted the base rate would stand at 1.25% by the end of next year.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore Exchange is preparing to roll out easier guidelines for listings of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in the city-state, which would make it the first major Asian bourse to accept such investment vehicles, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
The changes come after SGX , which has struggled to capture large listings of high-growth companies, received market feedback that some of its earlier proposals were too strict.
SGX's regulatory arm is now considering easing a minimum S$300 million ($223.2 million) market value proposal for SPACs and a proposal that warrants cannot be detached from underlying shares, two of the sources said.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak about the matter.
SGX faces prospects of losing out in courting Southeast Asian startups looking to list in their home markets https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/bukalapak-indonesias-biggest-ipo-up-25-blockbuster-debut-2021-08-06 or in the United States.
""We are carefully reviewing the feedback and carrying out our engagements with respondents, regulators and other stakeholders,"" a SGX spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.
SGX said that given the high level of interest, it is looking to publish the results of its consultation ""as soon as possible.""
SPACs are shell corporations that list on stock exchanges and then merge with an existing company to take that public, offering it shorter listing timeframes and strong valuations.
Though SGX will have an early mover advantage, one lawyer said it would still be challenging for it to become a vibrant platform for SPACs.
""Whether SPACs will take pride of place in the Singapore market, like real estate investment trusts, will depend on whether there is a perceptible track record of good valuations and liquidity post-SPAC mergers,"" said Robson Lee, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.
In a consultation paper for SPAC listings issued in late March https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-bourse-proposes-allowing-spac-listings-with-restrictions-2021-03-31, SGX had outlined measures to rein in risks seen in U.S. SPACs such as excessive dilution by shareholders and sponsors and a rush by these firms to merge with targets.
All the sources Reuters spoke to said that SGX was likely to introduce other measures to safeguard investor interests but would simplify proposed guidelines to still make it attractive for SPACs.
In other markets, Hong Kong and Indonesia are taking tentative steps for the potential listing of SPACs, while Britain has eased rules. https://www.reuters.com/business/britain-eases-spac-rules-attract-listings-2021-07-27 But such investment vehicles are peaking in popularity in the United States as regulators there clamp down on SPACs https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-us-sec-focuses-bank-fee-conflicts-it-steps-up-spac-inquiry-sources-2021-07-13 after a listing frenzy.
Hamstrung by a small base of retail investors, SGX has grappled with low liquidity and valuations. However, over the past few years, it has built up a lucrative Asian derivatives business and still remains a global listing venue for real estate investment trusts.

IPO fundraisings on SGX from January to late August fell to a six-year low of $239 million in Southeast Asia's total tally of about $8.4 billion, placing Singapore behind Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, according to data from Refinitiv

The outlet, which is published by the People's Daily, China's official newspaper for the ruling Communist Party, argued a recent attempt to block a Chinese purchase of a Korean chip company ""represents a dangerous precedent for the industry as a whole.""
""If the US succeeds in blocking the deal this time, it could set a very bad precedent for global high-tech mergers and acquisitions, further consolidating the industrial concentration in the US,"" the op-ed read.

On Monday, Magnachip said in an SEC filing that the U.S. Department of Treasury, in a letter to the company's legal counsel last Friday, said the acquisition posed ""risks to the national security of the United States.""
The chip sector has become a hotbed for tensions between the U.S. and China. 
Both countries are pouring billions of into their domestic industries, with the recognition that semiconductors are critical to national security and economic development.
Cross-border acquisitions, which require approval from regulatory bodies, have at times fallen apart because of government objections.

In 2018, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's planned $44 billion acquisition of Dutch chipmaker  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) failed after China's anti-monopoly regulator signaled it would not approve the deal.
That same year, Singapore's Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc withdrew its $117 billion bid to acquire Qualcomm after Washington's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) said the purchase could endanger the U.S' national security by aiding China.

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) -The first batch of BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Taiwan on Thursday, helped by the involvement of two of the world's most important tech firms after months of heated political and diplomatic wrangling. Taiwan has blamed China, which claims the island as its own territory, for nixing an original order from the German firm this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied. Taiwan's government then allowed major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd - as well as its high-profile billionaire founder, Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, to negotiate on its behalf for the doses. A $350 million deal for 10 million shots was inked in July, which will be donated to the government for distribution.
A cargo flight from Luxembourg carrying the vaccines landed at Taiwan's main international airport at Taoyuan, outside of Taipei, at 7 a.m. (2300 GMT), and was met on the tarmac by Health Minister Chen Shih-chung and Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation's chairwoman and Gou's cousin. 
Chen spoke briefly to thank the companies, and a Taiwanese Buddhist group that has also ordered 5 million doses, for their efforts to get the vaccine.
""They've worked very hard and overcome all the difficulties,"" he said.
Chen did not mention Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, which has the right to sell the shots on BioNTech's behalf in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and whose unit signed the deal for the island's doses.
A large label on the side of one of the crates with the names of BioNTech, Fosun and the vaccine, using simplified Chinese characters, which are not used in Taiwan, was removed before arrival.
Fosun had posted a picture on its Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account of the crate in the warehouse, with the label, before it was loaded onto the aircraft.
In another flourish of drama, China announced the exact arrival date of the vaccines on Wednesday, shortly before Chen began his daily news briefing.

The roughly 900,000 doses of the vaccine, jointly developed with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), are expected to start being administered later this month.
Taiwan is getting the shots earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau. While a relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak is well under control in Taiwan, only around 5% of its 23.5 million people are fully vaccinated, though the government has millions of vaccines on order. More than 10 million vaccine doses have arrived in Taiwan to date, split between  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, while local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp's shots have also started to be administered.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday it is investigating a deviation in the descent of the flight of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane that carried British billionaire Richard Branson to the edge of space on July 11.
The New Yorker magazine earlier reported that the regulator was investigating an off-course descent. An FAA spokesman told Reuters the vehicle ""deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America. The FAA investigation is ongoing.""
Virgin Galactic acknowledged in a statement to Reuters that ""the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan"" but added it ""did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the protected airspace.""
The company said ""the flight did drop below the altitude of the airspace ... ""for a short distance and time (1 minute and 41 seconds) before re-entering restricted airspace.""

439,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>",Amazon's new union battle: Teamsters go local to snarl expansion,"By Julia Love
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -In June, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the nation's largest and most influential unions, vowed to make organizing the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workforce a top priority.
Two months later, details of the Teamsters' ground game are starting to take shape, Reuters has learned from interviews with local union leaders. While organizing workers is the ultimate aim, the short-term strategy is one of disruption. 
Over the past year, the Teamsters have raised concerns about Amazon at local government meetings in at least 10 communities, leading to the scrapping of projects and the rejection of a tax break, as well as resolutions calling on the company to meet local labor standards, according to a Reuters tally. 
From Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Oceanside, California, the Teamsters are popping up in city halls around the country, joining forces with community groups as they seek to persuade local officials to ask more of the tech giant or reject its expansion plans outright. They are training members at logistics companies on how to talk to Amazon drivers about the benefits of unionizing. In New York, the Teamsters weighed in on an antitrust bill passed by the state senate that would make it easier for regulators to pursue companies for anticompetitive conduct, and they have also backed antitrust bills in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Taken together, these early moves show the Teamsters are tapping into their network of more than 1 million members to take on Amazon at the local level. The escalating push suggests that while Amazon earlier this year fended off https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-union-drive-facing-long-odds-final-votes-counted-2021-04-09 an attempt by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to organize workers in Bessemer, Alabama, the fight with organized labor has only just begun, and it is being waged across the country.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.
The Teamsters are playing the long game, showing that while organizing Amazon workers is a long-term project, they can keep the company on its toes by challenging expansion plans in the meantime.
Most Amazon facilities ""have to be built in a particular area for operational needs,"" Randy Korgan, the Teamsters' national director for Amazon, said in an interview. ""Why would any community give anything away?""
Rather than holding votes supervised by the National Labor Relations Board, as the RWDSU did in Bessemer, the Teamsters have indicated they will seek to ratchet up pressure on Amazon through tactics such as community demonstrations, strikes and boycotts until the e-commerce giant is forced to deal with them.
GROUND GAME
With its vast, high-churn workforce, Amazon is viewed as one of organized labor's toughest targets, and nixing a proposed warehouse is a far cry from organizing a workforce. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, for example, have fought Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's expansion for years using similar tactics, but have yet to bring U.S. workers into the fold.
Still, local forums such as town halls and planning commission meetings are a good place to start, said Pat Garofalo, director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit.
""You have to reduce (Amazon's) ability to get their way at the same time as you are building up workers' ability to make demands,"" he said.
As one of America's largest unions, the Teamsters are well-funded, though their finances are decentralized, with money often concentrated in the hands of powerful local branches, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. That makes achieving local buy-in essential, though Logan does not think the Teamsters will have trouble uniting around the cause of Amazon.
Southern California, which is both an Amazon logistics hub and a place where unions enjoy strong support, has emerged as a key battleground. To speak out about a proposed Amazon facility in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, the Teamsters knocked on the doors of some 700 neighboring homes and attended county meetings.
The union followed a similar playbook in Oceanside, California, inviting community members to sign ""commitment cards"" to stay engaged about an Amazon development. In August, the city council rejected the project.
The Teamsters are also closing ranks around Amazon in Massachusetts. In Boston and 11 surrounding municipalities, local leaders have passed nonbinding resolutions drafted by Teamsters Local 25 that urge Amazon to uphold local labor standards and meet with unions and community groups as it expands, according to Local 25.
In pushing the resolutions, the Teamsters targeted municipalities close to highways and airports, seeking to hit Amazon where it hurts, said Sean O'Brien, president of Local 25.
""Amazon is not happy about it,"" O'Brien said.
Boston City Councilor Liz Breadon, who co-sponsored the resolution, said it ""sent a very clear message to Amazon that we take working conditions and pay and benefits very seriously."" 

Whether the Teamsters can slow the pace of Amazon's growth long-term is unclear, but one thing is certain - the fight will require stamina. In June, the city council of Arvada, Colorado, voted down a proposed Amazon delivery center after Teamsters business agent Dan Murphy and other community members spoke out against the project, citing concerns including traffic, safety and labor conditions. 
Weeks after the vote, Murphy heard rumblings of another Amazon project that could be underway an hour to the north.

Workhorse, which did not respond immediately to a request for comment, in June challenged a decision by the U.S. Postal Service earlier this year to award a multibillion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense to manufacture a new generation of postal delivery vehicles.
Fuzzy Panda Research describes itself as a short seller on its website. The firm did not respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Lordstown months ago announced the sudden departure of its founder and former top boss, Steve Burns, after an internal investigation into short-seller Hindenburg Research's claims that the startup overstated the viability of its technology and misled investors about production plans.
Burns was also the former CEO of Workhorse. 

Lordstown has also faced scrutiny from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the SEC regarding its merger with a blank-check company and previously made statements about preorders for its vehicles.
The SEC and U.S. prosecutors in July charged Trevor Milton, the former CEO of EV firm Nikola Corp, with defrauding investors by lying to them about the company.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Grain shippers on the U.S. Gulf Coast reported more damage from Hurricane Ida to their terminals on Wednesday as Cargill Inc confirmed damage to a second facility, while power outages across southern Louisiana kept all others shuttered.
Global grains trader Cargill Inc said its Westwego, Louisiana, terminal was damaged by Ida, days after confirming more extensive damage at its only other Louisiana grain export facility, located in Reserve.
Ida, which roared ashore on Sunday, has disrupted grain and soybean shipments from the Gulf Coast, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. exports, at a time when global supplies are tight and demand is strong from China.
Emergency authorities were still surveying the destruction, as numerous barges and boats were sunk in the lower Mississippi River, while other debris has obstructed the navigation channel, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
A portion of the river north of river mile 167.5 near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, that was closed by the Coast Guard this week was reopened to vessel traffic on Wednesday afternoon, according to a Coast Guard document seen by Reuters. The notice warned that some hazards such as debris may still exist in the major shipping waterway.
Farther south, a roughly 75-mile (120-km) stretch remained closed to all vessel traffic due to downed power lines and sunken vessels in the river, according to the Coast Guard and shipping sources.
The Coast Guard will also allow light-draft ships to transit during daylight hours from the Southwest Pass to the south edge of the restricted zone at river mile 105, the notice said.
Mike Strain, commissioner of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, saw scores of barges and at least five ships grounded during a flyover of the river.
""There are still transmission lines in the river, and those need to be removed before there can be safe passage,"" Strain said. He said low water levels were making it harder to get stuck ships and barges moving again. 
Cargill is still assessing the extent of the damage and does not yet know how soon its grain loading and shipping operations at the busiest U.S. grains port may resume, Cargill spokeswoman April Nelson said.
Rival exporter CHS Inc is diverting its export shipments scheduled through the next month through its Pacific Northwest terminal as the hurricane knocked out a transmission line that powers its lone Gulf Coast facility, the company said.
Other shippers, including  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co, are still assessing damage to their locations, although all are still without power, the companies said.
Power may not be restored for weeks.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed Wednesday at a record high, and the S&P 500 rose but just missed a fresh peak, as September kicked off with renewed buying of technology stocks and private payrolls data, which supported the case for dovish monetary policy.
Technology stocks, which tend to benefit from a low-rate environment, finished higher. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 0.4% to its second-highest close, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc all advanced between 0.2% and 0.7%.
Utilities and real estate - sectors considered as bond-proxies or defensive - were the top performers.
""Given there's going to be some choppiness in the economic recovery because of COVID, people will look for where they can find the best future growth potential,"" said Chris Graff, co-chief investment officer at RMB Capital.
Wall Street's main indexes have hit record highs recently, with the benchmark S&P 500 notching seven straight monthly gains as investors shrugged off risks around a rise in new coronavirus infections and hoped for the Fed to remain dovish in its policy stance.
Each new data release though is viewed by investors through the prism of whether it could push the Fed to taper sooner rather than later.
A report by ADP, published ahead of the U.S. government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, showed private employers hired far fewer workers than expected in August.
Another set of data on Wednesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in August amid strong order growth, but a measure of factory employment dropped to a nine-month low, likely as workers remained scarce.
""We've got the jobs report on Friday, but what's become more important is the job openings report next week and the CPI release after that, so a lot about employment and inflation in the next couple of weeks which will reset people's expectations for tapering and interest rates,"" Graff added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 48.2 points, or 0.14%, to 35,312.53, the S&P 500 gained 1.41 points, or 0.03%, to 4,524.09 and the Nasdaq Composite added 50.15 points, or 0.33%, to 15,309.38.

More than 80% of oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remains offline, while analysts have warned that restarting Louisiana refineries shut by the storm could take weeks and cost operators tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Mingling with power brokers at celebrations to mark the centenary of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1, a beaming Hui Ka Yan showed no signs that his company, China Evergrande, was facing mounting pressure with debt repayments.
Hui, wearing a navy-blue suit and open-neck shirt, looked relaxed as he stood on a podium overlooking the festivities in Tiananmen Square, an invitation many considered a show of support for the billionaire businessman. 
A month earlier, the Evergrande group chairman had hosted a rare meeting with more than 1,000 suppliers and was once again flanked by the business elite, as he spoke of his deleveraging goals.
But now Hui's highly leveraged business strategy is unravelling. Debts at Evergrande, the country's No. 2 developer, triggered warnings on Aug. 19 from the central bank and regulators worried that its 1.97 trillion yuan ($302 billion) of liabilities - the size of Finland's GDP - could result in contagion if the company was not stabilised.    The company warned on Tuesday of default risks if it failed to dispose of more assets and renew loans.
Evergrande and Hui did not respond to requests for comment.
The 62-year-old former steel technician, raised by his grandmother in a rural village in central Henan province, founded Evergrande in 1996 in southern Guangzhou city and built his fortune on the back of low-priced homes.
Under Hui, the property developer expanded aggressively by raising loans to support its land buying sprees and selling homes at lower margins for quick turnover. Evergrande grew to achieve 700 billion yuan in annual sales by 2020.
In 2017, Hui was Asia's richest man with a net worth of $45.3 billion according to Forbes. Today his net worth is estimated at $13.4 billion.
Hui keeps a low public profile and is a workaholic, who at times demands that others follow his work style, three employees told Reuters.
He also set ambitious targets; when questioned by investors and reporters in the past decade about his highly leveraged projects, Hui said that Evergrande's high turnover and asset value were sufficient to cover its debts.
POKER PALS
Hui did not shy away from new ventures, especially in support of China's larger goals. He dabbled in electric cars and soccer, both a passion of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Outside mainland China, Hui mixed with Hong Kong tycoons including New World Development's late founder, Cheng Yu Tung, and Chinese Estates Holdings' former chairman, Joseph Lau. 
With them, he became a core member of the ""poker club"", a tight-knit circle of tycoons who often did investment deals together, according to three people familiar with the club. 
""He was very composed when he was first brought to the club; he knowingly lost a lot of money in the games and gained the fondness of Cheng,"" one of the people briefed by the tycoons said.
Cheng injected $150 million into Evergrande a year before its 2009 IPO in Hong Kong, helping it through a crunch during the financial crisis following aggressive expansion, according to Evergrande's listing prospectus. 
Chinese Estates has disclosed investments over the years amounting to billions of dollars in the shares and bonds of Evergrande - the largest issuer of dollar junk bonds in Asia. Chinese Estates did not respond to a request for comment.
Hui's highly leveraged businesses are worrying regulators who have warned Evergande to get its house in order.
""He's done everything correct politically but he has also raised so much debt - in an industry the government has warned against excessive borrowing and over speculation,"" said an analyst who declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to media.
Speaking at the 2018 China Charity Awards as a winner for the 8th consecutive year, Hui said Evergrande had paid tax totalling 185 billion yuan in the past 22 years and donated more than 10 billion yuan.
""Without the country's policy to reform higher education, I could not have left the village. Without the country giving me a scholarship of 14 yuan every month, I could not have completed university,"" Hui said.
""Without the country's good policy to reform and open up, Evergrande would not have what it has today. Therefore, everything that Evergrande and I have, they are all given by the Party, by the country, and by society.""

President Laurentino Cortizo pledged just before taking office two years ago that a new contract for the lucrative Cobre Panama open pit mine should provide more public benefit.
The mine, located about 75 miles (120 km) west of the Panamanian capital, is estimated to hold 3.1 billion tonnes in proven and probable reserves. It has generated some $6.7 billion in private investment, and includes two open pits, a processing facility, two power plants and a port.
Cobre Panama alone contributes 3.5% of the country's gross domestic product, according to government figures, and at full capacity can produce more than 300,000 tonnes of copper per year.
Ramon Martinez, Panama's trade and industry minister, said in a speech on Wednesday the negotiations would lead to a ""completely new"" contract, suggesting that if a fairer deal is not reached another company could be invited to take over the mine.

Toronto-based First Quantum, which holds a 90% stake in the Minera Panama local unit that runs Cobre Panama, began operations at the project in 2019.
Minera Panama negotiator Manuel Aizpurua said in a statement that he expects the negotiations to balance the public interest with the company's legal rights.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 05:51PM ET</span>",Judge will approve Purdue Pharma bankruptcy plan that shields Sacklers,"By Tom Hals and Mike Spector
(Reuters) -A U.S. judge said on Wednesday he would approve OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP’s bankruptcy reorganization plan, clearing a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shielding the company's wealthy Sackler family owners from future opioid litigation.
Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said that with small changes he would approve the plan, which overcame opposition to garner support from nearly all states, local governments, tribes, hospitals and other creditors that voted on the restructuring. They became creditors in the bankruptcy by virtue of suing Purdue and Sackler family members over their alleged contributions to the nationwide opioid epidemic.
Drain said it was clear the wrongful marketing of the company's opioid products contributed to the addiction crisis, which touched every corner of the country. ""That makes the bankruptcy case before me highly unusual and complex,"" said Drain, who spent more than six hours reading his ruling from the bench.
The plan, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion, dissolves the drugmaker and shifts assets to a new company not controlled by Sackler family members. The new company will be owned by a trust run to combat the opioid epidemic.
It also includes legal releases shielding Sackler family members from future opioid litigation, a controversial provision that some states opposed. Congressional Democrats in recent weeks introduced legislation to block such legal releases.
The Sacklers have denied allegations, raised in lawsuits and elsewhere, that they bear responsibility for the opioid addiction crisis. They have said they acted ethically and lawfully while serving on Purdue's board. 
The Purdue bankruptcy plan includes a $4.5 billion contribution from Sackler family members. The contribution is in the form of cash that will be paid over roughly a decade and also includes $175 million in value from relinquishing control of charitable institutions.
Drain noted that he had expected a larger contribution from the Sacklers and said the evidence showed more might have been secured through litigation, although that was hard to predict. 
""This is a bitter result,"" he said. He also said he would not jeopardize what the plan achieved by rejecting it and asked for small changes to secure his final approval.
Still, the evidence showed the plan was negotiated by the creditors who all viewed the Sacklers as ""the other side, the opposition, the potential defendants,"" Drain said. ""This is not the Sacklers' plan.""
'INSULTING TO VICTIMS' 
The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker pleaded guilty to criminal charges in November stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct.
Several state attorneys general opposed the plan.
“This order is insulting to victims of the opioid epidemic who had no voice in these proceedings,” said Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who said his office would appeal.
A lawyer for the Office of the U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog and part of the Department of Justice, said his office would file a motion for a stay of the order confirming the plan during the appeal.
More than 95% of creditors voting approved Purdue's restructuring, far above the legal threshold required for a bankruptcy judge's blessing.
Ryan Hampton resigned on Tuesday as the co-chair of the official creditors committee, which included governments and other creditors. Even though the committee helped negotiate the plan, he called the outcome a ""total injustice.""
He said people like himself who were recovering from addiction were the real victims and they had to fight states and local governments during plan negotiations for the $750 million set aside for them. 
""At no point were the victims listened to,"" he said.
Sackler family members behind Purdue were prolific philanthropists, with their names on museum wings and other cultural institutions. They have also agreed to a prohibition on associating their name with charitable contributions until litigation settlement funds are fully paid, according to court records.
Much of the plan's value is contingent on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications that Purdue has under development.
Drain noted that Sackler family owners who testified showed little remorse. ""A forced apology is not really an apology,"" he said. ""And so we will live without one.""
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-factbox/where-the-purdue-pharma-sackler-legal-saga-stands-idUSKBN1ZS1H3 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits against the company and Sackler family for contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999. 

Drain, the judge overseeing the case in a White Plains, New York, bankruptcy court, agreed early in the case to halt litigation against Purdue and Sackler family members, who had not filed for bankruptcy themselves.
Sackler family members have not been criminally charged. They previously agreed to pay $225 million to resolve separate civil allegations with the Justice Department. The family members have denied those allegations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety regulators on Wednesday said they had identified a 12th crash involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc vehicles using advanced driver assistance systems in incidents involving emergency vehicles and demanded the automaker answer detailed questions about its Autopilot system.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Aug. 16 said it had opened a formal safety probe into Tesla driver assistance system Autopilot after 11 crashes. The probe covers 765,000 U.S. Tesla vehicles built between 2014 and 2021.
The 12th occurred in Orlando on Saturday, NHTSA said. The agency sent Tesla a detailed 11-page letter on Tuesday with numerous questions it must answer, as part of its investigation.
Tesla's Autopilot handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods. Tesla says Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lane.
Tesla did not respond to a request seeking comment. The company could face civil penalties of up to $115 million if it fails to fully respond to the questions, NHTSA said.
Tesla shares closed down 0.2% at $734.09 on Wednesday.
On Saturday, the Florida Highway Patrol said the car of a Florida trooper who had stopped to assist a disabled motorist on a major highway was struck by a Tesla that the driver said was in Autopilot mode. According to a police report released on Wednesday, the trooper ""narrowly missed being struck as he was outside of his patrol car.""
NHTSA said earlier it had reports of 17 injuries and one death in the 11 crashes. A December 2019 crash of a Tesla Model 3 left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.
NHTSA's request for information asks Tesla to detail how it detects and responds to emergency vehicles, as well as flashing lights, road flares, cones and barrels and to detail the impact of low light conditions.
NHTSA said previously that most of the 11 incidents occurred after dark.
Tesla in July introduced an option for some customers to subscribe to its advanced driver assistance software, dubbed ""Full Self-Driving capability."" Tesla said the current features ""do not make the vehicle autonomous.""
NHTSA is seeking information on the ""date and mileage at which the 'Full Self Driving' (FSD) option was enabled"" for all vehicles, along with all consumer complaints, field reports, crash reports and lawsuits.
The agency also wants Tesla to explain how it prevents use of the system outside areas where it is intended. 

Among the detailed questions, NHTSA also asked Tesla to explain ""testing and validation required prior to the release of the subject system or an in-field update to the subject system, including hardware and software components of such systems.""
Tesla must respond to NHTSA's questions by Oct. 22, it said, and it must disclose plans for any changes to Autopilot within the next 120 days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -World stock markets closed at new highs on Wednesday as investors looked beyond weak economic data that weighed on the dollar to focus on the likely continuation of massive central bank stimulus measures.
MSCI's all-country world index climbed to its fourth straight closing high, while the Nasdaq Composite hit a fresh record close. The Euro STOXX 600 came close to breaching an all-time peak set three weeks ago and the S&P 500 almost reached a new intraday high.
The upbeat mood for equities came despite signs that Asia's factory activity lost momentum in August and that U.S. private employers hired far fewer workers than expected last month, likely due to a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
But the U.S. labor market continues to recover, with private payrolls increasing last month by 374,000 jobs, or 48,000 more than in July, the ADP National Employment Report showed.
U.S. manufacturing activity also unexpectedly picked up in August amid strong order growth, providing markets a sunny side to cheer.
Many investors and other market participants expect central bank stimulus measures to remain and companies to report strong earnings despite a deceleration in economic activity.
""We're in the moment where it's still semi-Goldilocks - there is the inflation element that is still for the moment being discarded by central bankers,"" said Olivier Marciot, senior portfolio manager with Unigestion. 
""Earnings are very good, macro is very strong and still the central banks are remaining very accommodative,"" Marciot said.
MSCI's all-country world index rose 0.32% to end the session at 743.67, its fourth consecutive record close, while the broad STOXX Europe 600 index closed up 0.48%.
The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.33%, lifted by tech powerhouses such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which set a new high, while the S&P 500 pared earlier gains to close up just 0.03%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.14%.
The dollar traded near its lowest point in nearly three weeks versus major peers as investors await the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday for clues to when the Federal Reserve begins paring its stimulus. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said an improving labor market is a prerequisite for tapering to begin.
Worries persist, however, that the Delta variant of the coronavirus is weighing on the economy, leading some to lower their estimates for U.S. jobs data on Friday, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""The recovery has been uneven but if nonfarm payrolls should also disappoint, that would seemingly close the door to an imminent taper and keep the dollar in a bit of a funk,"" he said.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.14% to 92.52.
The euro rose 0.26% to $1.1838, while the yen traded up 0.02% at $110.0400.
An Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey highlighted persistent problems securing raw materials, a situation worsened by disruptions caused by the latest COVID-19 wave, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as ports congestion in China.
The ISM index added to skepticism that the Fed will move any time soon on tapering its bond-buying program, Manimbo said.
""It's a vote of confidence in the Fed's dovish stance,"" he said.
Powell tried last week to distance the two concepts of the Fed tapering its bond purchases from when it begins to raise interest rates, said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed-income strategy at WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF) Inc.
""You have to give the Fed kudos; they've done a very good job with their forward guidance with respect to tapering,"" Flanagan said. ""They've met their criteria on the inflation side, and now it's on the jobs number.""
Markets are likely to remain quiet until Friday, with an attempt by bond traders to push yields on the 10-year Treasury above the 1.32% to 1.33% level unsuccessful, he said.
The benchmark U.S. note's yield traded flat at 1.302%.
Government bond yields across the euro area touched their highest levels in around six weeks, pushed up by unease over the future pace of European Central Bank bond purchases. 
Germany's 10-year Bund yield briefly touched its highest level in just over six weeks at -0.354% before steadying at around -0.365%.
Oil prices traded little changed after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to stick to their existing policy of gradual crude output increases.

Brent futures fell 4 cents to settle at $71.59 a barrel while U.S. crude rose 9 cents to settle at $68.59 a barrel. 
U.S. gold futures settled down 0.1% at $1,816 an ounce.

This is great for the 1% and the places where they like to shop. Therefore, investors should consider buying  Movado Group Inc . (NYSE:MOV), Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) Limited Common Shares (SIG), and Hugo Boss AG (BOSSY).Last year, as the coronavirus’ impact on the economy and the necessity of shutdowns became clear, the Federal Reserve aggressively slashed interest rates to zero and injected trillions of liquidity into financial markets to ensure that the banks remained functioning and solvent. In hindsight, it’s clear that this has been one of the primary drivers of the ensuing bull market in nearly all types of assets.
From the March 2020 lows, the S&P 500 is up more than 100%, home prices according to the Case-Shiller Index are up 19%, and the commodities index is up 47%. There have even been spillover effects into more speculative asset classes like cryptocurrencies and collectibles. Although certain parts of the economy continue to struggle as evidenced by a recent Pew poll showing that 5.6% of Americans are behind a cumulative $20 billion on rent.
Given the continued economic pain, it’s likely that the Federal Reserve will be very slow in removing its accommodation. Two beneficiaries of these circumstances are the 1% who own 40% of the country’s wealth and luxury stocks which thrive when wealthy people are feeling flush and willing to spend more extravagantly. Therefore, investors should consider buying Movado Group Inc. (MOV),  Signet Jewelers Limited  Common Shares (SIG), and Hugo Boss AG (BOSSY).

Therefore, industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and United Microelectronics (UMC) are expected to achieve significant growth in the near term. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Based in Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. It also offers customer service, account management, and engineering services. Also based in Taiwan, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) operates semiconductor wafer foundries in Taiwan, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, the United States, and Europe. It operates through Wafer Fabrication and New Business segments.
The semiconductor industry has struggled with production bottlenecks in the first half of 2021 amid growing demand. However, with increased focus and initiatives by governments and industry giants, the industry is making a comeback. According to a Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) report, the worldwide sales of semiconductors stood at $44.50 billion in June 2021, reflecting a 29.2% improvement year-over-year. Also, sales during the second quarter of 2021 were up 8.3% sequentially. The demand for chips is expected to increase over an extended period as the world races toward technological advancements and sustainability goals. Both TSM and UMC are prominent players and should benefit from the industry tailwinds.
UMC has gained 8% in price over the past month, while TSM has returned 2%. Also, UMC’s 34.9% gain year-to-date compares with TSM’s 9.1% returns. In terms of their past year’s performance, UMC is the clear winner with 221.2% in price gains versus TSM’s 50.2%.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>",Antibody levels higher after Moderna shot; Lilly arthritis drug used with steroid cuts death risk,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Antibody levels are higher after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine
The mRNA vaccine from Moderna Inc induces higher levels of antibodies against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 than the similar vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), Belgian researchers have found, although what this means for their efficacy is not clear. Soon after receiving their second shot, the 688 healthcare workers who got Moderna's vaccine had antibody levels roughly twice as high as the 959 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech product, regardless of their ages, doctors at a Belgian medical center reported. This held true even after accounting for individual risk factors, and regardless of whether participants had previously been infected with the virus, the researchers reported on Monday in JAMA https:// Antibodies are just one component https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mrna-vaccines-trigger-backup-immune-response-some-cancer-drugs-may-help-2021-08-25 of the immune system's defenses, however. The study cannot determine whether one vaccine is more effective at preventing infection or illness, or whether the antibodies induced stay longer in the blood before disappearing. Those questions, and others, require further investigation, the researchers said.
Arthritis drug adds to benefit of steroids in severe illness
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients died less often if they received Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib along with the other treatments their doctors had prescribed, according to a study published on Wednesday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine https:// The randomized trial involved 1,525 seriously ill patients, all of whom needed extra oxygen to help with breathing. More than 90% were already receiving dexamethasone, a cheap generic steroid known to improve survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients. While baricitinib, sold under the brand name Olumiant, did not appear to keep patients from getting sicker, it did reduce their risk of dying. The 28-day and 60-day death rates were 5% lower among patients randomly assigned to receive baricitinib instead of a placebo. Baricitinib is already approved in the United States for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in combination with Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Science's antiviral drug remdesivir. The two drugs together appear to have more benefit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-science/flu-outbreaks-may-be-linked-to-covid-19-arthritis-drug-benefit-seen-idUSKBN26538P than remdesivir alone. In the new study, more than 80% of participants were not receiving remdesivir, suggesting that baricitinib also ""has synergistic effects with other standard-of-care treatments,"" including dexamethasone, researchers said. 
Vaccine poses low risk for adults with high-risk allergies

Highly allergic adults can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, a new study suggests. Among the 8,102 patients with allergies in the Israeli study, 95% received the shots in routine settings because their risk of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine was low, and no such reactions were reported. The remaining 429 patients, who were considered to be highly allergic, received the vaccines under careful supervision and were observed for two hours afterward. Nine had allergic reactions, including three who showed signs of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. All responded to treatment with epinephrine and no one had to be hospitalized, according to a report published on Tuesday in JAMA Network Open https:// An editorial https:// published with the study said lessons from this study of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine are likely ""generalizable to the Moderna"" shot as well.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>",Launching into space? Not so fast. Insurers balk at new coverage,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
(Reuters) - An ever-swelling amount of space debris is threatening satellites that hover around Earth, making insurers leery of offering coverage to the devices that transmit texts, maps, videos and scientific data, industry sources said.
Thousands of new satellites are being launched into areas where orbital rubbish has been accumulating since early space missions nearly 65 years ago. The surging collision risks have left the handful of insurers that offer satellite coverage pulling back or exiting the market, executives and analysts said.
""This is a real issue for insurance,"" said Richard Parker, co-founder of Assure Space, a unit of AmTrust Financial.
Over a year ago, the company stopped providing spacecraft insurance in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where most satellites operate. The few policies it has sold since then exclude collision damage.
""It may start to get difficult to get that type of coverage in the near future as more insurers realize that this is a significant risk that we can't even get our arms around,"" Parker told Reuters.
There are 8,055 satellites roaming Earth's orbits, 42% of them inactive, according to Seradata, which tracks the statistics. Most operate in the LEO, which extends 2,000 kilometers, or 1,243 miles, beyond Earth.
The number of active satellites has jumped 68% from a year ago and more than 200% from five years ago. 
Graphic: BILLIONAIRE ELON MUSK'S SPACEX IS SENDING HUNDREDS OF NEW SATELLITES TO ORBIT - https://graphics.reuters.com/SPACEDEBRIS-INSURANCE/gkplggqgrvb/chart.png 
Much of the new activity has come from billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX, as it expands its Starlink broadband network.
SpaceX did not reply to requests for comment. As a privately held company, it does not disclose whether its satellites are insured.
Other major companies including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also rely on satellites to transmit data, as do telecom providers, government agencies and universities working on space research, insurance sources said.
Space coverage has been a lucrative niche for insurers, which took in $475 million in gross premiums to cover satellites, rockets and unmanned space flights last year and paid just $425 million in losses, according to Seradata.
Space premiums are 10-20 times aviation premiums, said Peter Elson, CEO of insurance broker Gallagher Aerospace.
""This is a risky business in the first place,” he said.
MESS IN SPACE
The insurance dilemma underlines a greater problem: no one is cleaning up the mess in space.
Government agencies track thousands of pieces of debris, including inside a ""graveyard orbit"" where old geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites are sent to die with their last bits of fuel, 36,000 kilometers, or 22,370 miles into space.
LEO satellites are much smaller than GEO satellites. Typically the size of a small refrigerator, they need $500,000 to $1 million worth of coverage, far below the $200 million to $300 million for those in the GEO, industry experts said.
Historically, policies have protected devices against loss, failure or damage from launch through their orbiting life, but not revenue losses from outages. Operators could add liability coverage in case one satellite damages another or re-enters the atmosphere in a way that causes damage or injury on the ground.
About half of new satellite launches now have insurance, said Denis Bousquet, an executive in AXA XL’s space business. Industry sources expect more policies to exclude collision coverage and fewer satellites to have insurance at all.
""The concentrations of debris and increasing numbers of satellites being deployed are increasing the potential for collision,"" said Charles Wetton, underwriting manager for space policies at insurer Global Aerospace. 
Graphic: SATELLITES ROAMING EARTH'S ORBITS - https://graphics.reuters.com/SPACEDEBRIS-INSURANCE/egpbkkbkevq/chart.png 
DEBRIS GRAVEYARD
Only 11 spacecraft have suffered a partial or total failure due to suspected debris strikes over the past decade, according to Seradata, making insurer worries largely theoretical for now.
Yet because insurers predict risks over the life of current and future policies, space underwriters fret over doomsday scenarios years ahead.
Wetton cited the possibility of a ""Kessler effect,"" named for NASA space debris expert Don Kessler who developed the theory in 1978. It anticipates LEO becoming so crowded that there is a cascade of collisions.
There are no signs such a situation is imminent, but it would render entire orbits uninsurable, Wetton said.
Assure Space's Parker said he is confident a major collision will occur within the next three years, rendering insurance nearly impossible to obtain.
New insurers may enter the market to alleviate supply-demand strains. Until then, industry experts said companies, universities and government agencies will likely bear more financial responsibility.
Taxpayers also may also end up on the hook more often.

In June, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), approved $80.7 million in financing for a SpaceX launch as well as a launch and in-orbit insurance for Spanish communications network Hispasat SA.
""The availability of EXIM's financing enables SpaceX and other U.S. exporters to remain competitive,"" said EXIM Acting First Vice President and Vice Chairman James Cruse.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) notched a second record high this week.
U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in August with strong order growth. Earlier in the day, other data showed that Asian and European factory activity lost momentum last month.
Oil prices dipped after major oil producing nations agreed to stick to gradual output increases, while analysts continue to assess the damage to the industry from Hurricane Ida. Restarting refineries shut by the storm could take weeks.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 
1. Food earnings
Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL)reports earnings on Thursday amid supply chain issues in the food industry and rising input costs. It is expected to announce earnings per share of 39 cents on revenue of $2.69 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com
2. Chip earnings
Speaking of supply chain bottlenecks, the chip industry has been dealing with a widespread shortage of product, affecting the manufacture of personal electronic devices and autos, among other things. On Thursday analysts will be listening for an update from chip maker Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) which is seen posting revenue of $6.76 billion and earnings per share of $6.88 for the third quarter.
3. Word from the pandemic winner
DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) got a big boost during last year’s remote working trend, and analysts want to hear what its plans are now that companies are starting to bring employees back to the office. It is seen clocking an EPS of 40 cents on revenue of $488.71 million in the second quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Volkswagen's U.S. unit has agreed to a $42 million settlement covering 1.35 million vehicles that were equipped with potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Miami.
The settlement is the latest by major automakers and much of the funding goes to boosting recall completion rates. To date, seven other major automakers have agreed to settlements worth about $1.5 billion covering tens of millions of vehicles.
VW did not immediately comment.
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending dangerous metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in history.
To date, at least 19 U.S. deaths have been attributed to faulty Takata air bag inflators. Honda Motor Co said in April it had confirmed the 19th U.S. death tied to a ruptured Takata air bag inflator since 2009 - and the 16th in one of its vehicles.
Honda reached an earlier $605 million civil settlement with owners similar to the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) settlement.
More than 400 injuries are also tied to faulty Takata inflators and at least 28 deaths worldwide. There have been two U.S. Takata deaths in Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co vehicles and one in a BMW.
Ford previously reached a $299.1 million civil settlement with owners, while BMW agreed to a $131 million settlement.
The Takata recalls cover about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers worldwide, including about 67 million inflators in the United States.
The VW settlement, like earlier ones, covers rental car and out-of-pocket costs, including lost wages and childcare costs, that owners had or may face getting vehicles repaired or while awaiting repairs.
Court documents say around 35% of the inflators in Volkswagen and Audi vehicles that have been or will be recalled have not been repaired.

Peter Prieto, a lawyer for the owners who sued, said the owners would ""vigorously prosecute our claims against Mercedes Benz, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and FCA to ensure that our clients obtain the relief they deserve.""
GM,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and FCA parent Stellantis did not immediately comment.

Considering their solid growth prospects, BASF (BASFY), Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY), Suzuki (SZKMY), Covestro (COVTY), and Vishay Intertechnology (NYSE:VSH) look significantly undervalued at their current price levels. So, it could be wise to scoop up these stocks.

Consequently , the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 hit their all-time highs on Monday. However, amid the rising inflation, which the Fed deems “transitory,” it could be risky to bet on high-flying stocks even if they possess fundamental strength. That’s because any correction experienced by the market could lead to a significant price decline for these stocks on profit taking.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Wednesday proposed new requirements for financial institutions to collect and report data on small businesses' access to credit in a bid to boost transparency and fair lending.
The proposed rule would require financial institutions report the amount and type of small business credit applied for and extended, demographic information about small business credit applicants, and key elements of the price of the credit offered, the consumer watchdog said in a statement. 
""We don't know enough about whether small businesses have fair access to the capital they need to generate new jobs and grow the American economy,"" CFPB Acting Director Dave Uejio said on Wednesday.
The coronavirus pandemic underscored the challenges for U.S. small businesses during a crisis. The vast majority of American small businesses took a hit to their revenue last year, with minority-owned businesses struggling the most and worrying more about accessing credit, a Federal Reserve survey https://www.reuters.com/business/most-us-small-businesses-took-sales-hit-due-pandemic-fed-survey-finds-2021-02-03 released earlier this year showed. 
The requirements are a long-awaited part of the broader Wall Street reforms in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. They would apply to a wide range of products, including term loans, lines of credit, credit cards and merchant cash advances, the CFPB said.
The proposed plan will be open to public comment for 90 days before the agency finalizes the rule. While business owners are not required to provide demographic information, lenders will have to collect and report the data when they do. 

Bank and business groups warned the new requirements could become burdensome for lenders. 
""A complicated final rule would make it more difficult for small business to access credit,"" said Bill Hulse, vice president of the U.S. Chamber Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - It has been nearly five years since  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co began addressing widespread customer abuses that led to regulatory penalties, lawsuits, reputational damage, business overhauls and management changes, but the fourth-largest U.S. bank apparently still has a lot of work to do, analysts say.
Regulators at two key agencies – the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) – are considering additional sanctions against Wells Fargo because it has been too slow to compensate victims and address underlying weaknesses in business practices, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
The bank also remains under an unprecedented asset cap that the Federal Reserve imposed, as well as roughly a dozen consent orders with regulators, all stemming from a sales scandal that erupted publicly in September 2016.
OCC, CFPB, Fed and Wells Fargo spokespeople declined to comment.
Chief Executive Charlie Scharf has pledged to get Wells Fargo on the right track and resolve regulatory issues as quickly as possible. But after news of more potential penalties, analysts predicted it could take him years to achieve those goals.
""Wells Fargo didn't get into this situation overnight and they surely won't get out of it overnight,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading.
Wells Fargo’s shares were down 4.6% on Wednesday afternoon, following a sharp decline on Tuesday.
The bank’s issues stem from a pervasive culture under prior management, where hitting sales targets was the most important element for employee success. As a result, the bank ended up enrolling customers in millions of phony accounts and many more products, sometimes charging unnecessary fees or harming their credit ratings.
Wells Fargo’s management team and board have changed dramatically since then, implementing new incentive structures and risk-management protocol across the bank. Scharf became CEO in October 2019, the fourth person to lead Wells Fargo since the scandal emerged.
Scharf has repeatedly emphasized the urgency of resolving regulatory issues, fixing internal risk and control structures, and restoring Wells Fargo’s reputation with customers, investors and other stakeholders. The catchphrase on his corporate biography is, “We will get it done.”
However, Scharf has resisted offering a hard timeline, saying that problems ran deep within the bank and that regulators will ultimately decide when and whether they are resolved.
“The amount of customer remediation and control-related issues that existed when I arrived was many multiples of what should exist at our company,” he told analysts during a conference call in July. 
The bank flagged difficulties satisfying regulators in its quarterly filing in May, and Scharf said he was ""not even thinking about what life is like without the asset cap.""
The asset cap, $1.95 trillion, is important because it limits Wells Fargo’s ability to lend and invest, and therefore its ability to earn profits. Wells Fargo held $1.945 trillion in total assets as of June 30.
Analysts struggled to predict how long it will take Wells to fully move past the sales scandal.
Boltansky was encouraged that the unresolved issues still appear to stem from prior practices, rather than new abuses coming to light. On the other hand, the Biden administration has positioned itself as getting tougher on policies for large U.S. companies, including banks, and it is unclear how the White House will handle upcoming appointments to regulators including the Fed.

Few analysts expect Wells can resolve the asset cap or consent orders any time soon.
""This process has taken years longer than both regulators and Wells Fargo initially expected,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) analyst Vivek Juneja wrote in a note to investors. ""The bank was initially expected to complete steps 1-4 by September 2018.""

468,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 02:06PM ET</span>","Pfizer, Merck launch new trials of oral COVID-19 drugs","(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co Inc announced on Wednesday new trials of their experimental oral antiviral drugs for COVID-19 as the race to develop an easy-to-administer treatment for the potentially fatal illness heats up.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said its latest mid-to-late-stage trial will enroll 1,140 non-hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus infection who are not at risk of severe illness. Patients in the trial will be given Pfizer's pill, known as PF-07321332, and a low dose of ritonavir, an older medication widely used in combination treatments for HIV infection.
Pfizer's drug is designed to block the activity of a key enzyme that is needed for the coronavirus to multiply. 
Merck said its new trial will study experimental drug molnupiravir for the prevention of COVID-19 among adults in the same household as someone diagnosed with symptomatic coronavirus infection. Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics are already conducting a late-stage trial of the treatment in non-hospitalized patients to see if it reduces the risk of hospitalization or death.
Molnupiravir is a type of antiviral designed to introduce errors into the RNA of the virus that eventually prevent it from replicating.
Pfizer began in July a different trial of PF-07321332 in adults with COVID-19 infection who are at high risk of becoming severely ill due to underlying health conditions such as diabetes. The company said it expects initial results from that study some time this fall.
Rivals Pfizer and Merck, along with Swiss pharmaceutical Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF), have made the most progress in developing what would be the first antiviral pill to treat, or possibly prevent, COVID-19.
To date,  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s intravenous drug Veklury, known generically as remdesivir, is the only approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 in the United States. 
Roche and partner Atea Pharmaceuticals in June said early data from a trial of their experimental oral antiviral AT-527 showed that it lowered viral load in hospitalized patients.

Merck said in June that the U.S. government agreed to pay about $1.2 billion for 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir, if it is proven to work and authorized by regulators. The company said it expected to file for U.S. emergency use authorization of molnupiravir in the second half of 2021 at the earliest.
Pfizer said in July if the PF-07321332 trial was successful, it would file for a potential emergency use authorization in the fourth quarter.

Hywin, which derives most of its revenues from distributing real estate products, including those investing in projects from China Evergrande Group, will focus on new offerings such as privately-raised securities products.
""We need to follow the Chinese government's directions and policy guidance, when we strategise our product directions,"" Lok told Reuters in an interview.
Reducing the level of exposure to real estate is ""inevitable, but it will be a process over time.""
China has launched tough measures to wean the real estate sector from excessive debt, squeezing developers. 
Evergrande, China's most indebted property developer, has been scrambling to raise funds it needs to pay its many lenders and suppliers, amid deepening investor concerns of default.
""There's a lot of speculation and uncertainties around this particular developer and that's inevitable,"" Lok said, adding Evergrande is just one of many institutions Hywin partners with.
""We are always on the watch for any risk that's inherent in the products on our shelves.""
Hywin will help investors understand the risks in real estate products in a transparent way as ""there are underlying assets that people can actually go and see,"" said the former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker, who was appointed as CFO last month. 
The risk is also limited by the fact that the government has various goals, including deleveraging and maintaining financial stability, he said.
Hywin's net income jumped 111.1% to 62.1 million yuan ($9.61 million) in the three months to June 30, while revenue rose 43%. The number of active clients increased 17.6% to 29,094.
Hywin is also expanding its geographic footprint, having set up a family office in Hong Kong. Many wealthy Chinese keep their money offshore, and ""we believe we can tap into that client base quite effectively,"" Lok said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the United States gears up for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign, most vaccinated Americans want the additional dose, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found, largely driven by concern over the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
The U.S. government said if health regulators approve the move, it will roll out COVID-19 booster shots starting Sept. 20 out of concern about waning vaccine protection against COVID-19 infections. Many scientists say https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/scientists-question-evidence-behind-us-covid-19-booster-shot-drive-2021-08-19 the need for a booster has not been proven. The government has already made third shots available to immunocompromised adults.
    The national survey, conducted Aug. 27-30, found that among those adults who received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, 76% want a booster, while 6% do not and 18% were not sure. Among those aged 55 and over, 80% said they want one.
    ""I've got a four-year-old grandson. I want to make sure he knows me,"" said retired journalist Dora Ann Reaves, 75, from South Carolina. ""I'm going to take every opportunity to take every shot I can. I've already had everything else I can have, other than taking shots for bubonic plague."" 
    The results reflect anxiety over the Delta variant that has caused a surge in infections and hospitalizations, and show the public favors boosters more than scientists do, said Jason Gallagher, an infectious diseases expert at Temple University.
    ""There's a lot of hedging among people in the medical community about the necessity of boosters, so it sounds like the general public is more in favor than a lot of practitioners are,"" he said.
There is no harm in some people not wanting a booster because not everyone needs one, Gallagher said, adding that at-risk individuals should get them. The U.S. began offering the additional shot last month to people with compromised immune systems.
    Among those who want boosters, almost 43% said they were worried about the Delta variant and over 34% cited their age.
    Concern that their initial inoculation was no longer effective was cited by 28% of respondents, while 15% said they were immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk.
    ""I would like to get the booster to be on the safe side,"" said Texan customer service representative Joe Guerra, 63, who has rheumatoid arthritis, which could put him at higher risk. Many widely used medicines for the condition suppress the immune system.
Guerra also expressed concern that millions of Americans remain unvaccinated.
    As of Aug. 31, over 66 million people - 25% of U.S. adults - have not received a single vaccine dose, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. 
""It's not a smart thing to not get it. Just play by the rules, keep yourself safe, keep those around you safe,"" said high school graduate Jamarii Perrington, 18, in Massachusetts. 

    The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,427 adults, including 3,042 who had received at least once dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 2,374 who expressed interest in a booster shot. 
Ipsos weighted the results using the latest population and vaccination statistics so that they better reflected the U.S. population. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points.

(Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co said on Wednesday it was planning to increase prices of some products, as it deals with higher ingredient and freight costs that are likely to plague packaged foods makers through the year.
Shares in the Cape Cod potato chips maker, which already raised prices for some items only last month, gained 2% as it also announced a $500 million share repurchase plan.
Packaged foods makers have been raising prices of their products in recent months as they wrestle with labor shortages and higher costs of wheat, corn and edible oils.
Campbell expects to realize mid-single-digit price growth in fiscal 2022. It plans to selectively push prices up to deal with potential jumps in raw material costs, including steel.
Steel is used in packaging its soups, demand for which has been steady due to repeat orders from consumers. Campbell now looks to keep up the sales level by modernizing packaging and launching new items.
""Part of the composition of the year is going to be a little bit of a tale of two halves,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse told analysts, noting an expected improvement in sales in the second half.
""With COVID resurgence, I think some of the consumer dynamics that supported demand is likely going to be with us for a while longer.""
However, Campbell expects fiscal 2022 organic net sales in a range of 1% decline to a rise of 1%. The maker of Prego pasta sauces also forecast adjusted earnings between $2.75 and $2.85 per share, below Refinitiv IBES estimates of $2.87.

""Question will remain on margin progression through the year given creeping costs and uncertainty around price vs. volume dynamic,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts wrote in a note.
Net sales fell 11% to $1.87 billion in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 1, beating estimates of $1.81 billion.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd on Wednesday said they are working with Japanese authorities to recall three batches of COVID-19 vaccine after an investigation found stainless steel contaminants in some vials. 
Japanese authorities had suspended use of these batches of Moderna shots containing 1.63 million doses last week after being notified of the contamination issue.
Japan's health ministry said on Wednesday, based on information from the companies' investigation, that it did not believe the particles of stainless steel pose any additional health risk. Moderna said the stainless steel contamination probably occurred during production.
Takeda distributes the Moderna vaccine in Japan.
The most probable cause of contamination was related to friction between two pieces of metal in the machinery that puts stoppers on the vials, Moderna said in the joint statement with Takeda. The material was confirmed to be stainless steel.
Moderna conducted its investigation in partnership with Takeda and Spanish manufacturer Rovi, which operates the plant where the contamination occurred. 
""Stainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk,"" Takeda and Moderna said in a joint statement.
Moderna shares were up 2.6% following the statement. Shares of Rovi were up than 4.5% after falling more than 10% on news of the dose suspensions. Takeda shares rose more than 2%. 
Administration of the Moderna shots from the three lots was suspended in Japan after 39 vials were found to contain foreign material. All the vials came from a single lot, but shots from two other lots from the same Rovi manufacturing line were suspended as a precaution.
Those three lots were the only ones affected by the manufacturing issue, the statement said. Rovi has fully inspected its manufacturing facility and implemented new procedures to avoid similar problems in the future, it added. 
Use of the Moderna vaccine from different batches also was temporarily halted in three regions in Japan this week. In some cases, foreign substances were found in unused vials, while others appear to have been the result of incorrectly inserted needles causing bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off.
The contamination issue gained more attention after the health ministry said on Saturday that two men, aged 38 and 30, died in August within days of receiving their second Moderna doses. Each had received a dose from one of the suspended lots.
The cause of death in the two cases is still being investigated.

Moderna and Takeda said in the joint statement that there was no evidence the fatalities were caused by the vaccine. ""The relationship is currently considered to be coincidental,"" the companies said in the statement.
About 500,000 people have received shots from the three suspended Moderna batches, Taro Kono, Japan's minister in charge of the vaccination campaign, told reporters on Friday. Moderna said it cannot confirm how many doses were distributed from the batches.

This could be the case with ABB (ABB),  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN), and Allied Motion (AMOT). They could be solid picks given their uptrend over the past few months and the fundamental strength to maintain it in the near term. Let’s discuss these names.Even though solid second-quarter corporate earnings reports have been helping the major stock market indexes hover near their all-time highs, investors’ concerns over the pace of economic recovery due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases have fostered market volatility. In addition, the Federal Reserve recently indicated its willingness to reduce its asset purchases before the end of the year.
Several stocks are currently trading at sky-high valuations, and a high inflation environment could cause them to decline in price. However, turning to momentum investing could be rewarding now because stocks that have managed to gain momentum over the past few months might be able to maintain it in the near term, irrespective of short-term fluctuations by the broader market. Investors’ increasing interest in momentum stocks is evident in the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF’s (MTUM) 2.8% returns over the past month.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Amazon CEO unveils 55,000 tech jobs in first hiring push under his watch","By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is planning to hire 55,000 people for corporate and technology roles globally in the coming months, Chief Executive Andy Jassy told Reuters.
That’s equal to more than a third of Google’s headcount as of June 30, and close to all of Facebook’s.
Jassy, in his first press interview since he ascended to Amazon’s top post in July, said the company needed more firepower to keep up with demand in retail, the cloud and advertising, among other businesses. He said the company's new bet to launch satellites into orbit to widen broadband access, called Project Kuiper, would require a lot of new hires, too.
With Amazon's annual job fair scheduled to begin Sept. 15, Jassy hopes now is a good time for recruiting. “There are so many jobs during the pandemic that have been displaced or have been altered, and there are so many people who are thinking about different and new jobs,” said Jassy, who cited a U.S. survey from PwC that 65% of workers wanted a new gig.
“It’s part of what we think makes ‘Career Day https://www.amazoncareerday.com’ so timely and so useful,” he said. The new hires would represent a 20% increase in Amazon's tech and corporate staff, who currently number around 275,000 globally, the company said.
Amazon’s move, only the latest hiring spree on which it has embarked, follows a period of heightened scrutiny of its labor practices and opposition by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Earlier this year, a failed effort by some staff in Alabama to organize put on display Amazon’s taxing warehouse work and its aggressive stance against unions. In that battle’s aftermath, Jeff Bezos, the CEO whom Jassy succeeded, said Amazon needed a better vision for employees.
Asked how he might change Amazon’s demanding workplace culture, Jassy said its heavy focus on customers and inventiveness set it up for improvements.
“Everybody at the company has the freedom - and really, the expectation - to critically look at how it can be better and then invent ways to make it better.”
The positions Amazon is marketing include engineering, research science and robotics roles, postings that are largely new to the company rather than jobs others quit, it said. 
In a reopening U.S. economy, and tightening labor market, some companies have struggled to fill vacancies and balance remote and in-person work. It was unclear how many of the Amazon jobs - such as for competitive engineering hires - have been open for some time.
Amazon, which earlier touted an ""office-centric culture,"" later dialed back its vision and offered workers the opportunity to spend just three days a week at its offices in person starting next year.
Already the second-biggest private employer in the United States, Amazon brought on more than 500,000 people in 2020, largely in warehouse and delivery operations. That area has had significant turnover.
The company is investing heavily in building more warehouses and boosting pay to attract workers, in order to catch up to strong demand from shoppers seeking products delivered to their homes. Jassy said Amazon has been ""very competitive on the compensation side."" He said, ""We've led the way in the $15 minimum wage,"" and for some states on average that ""really, the starting salary is $17 an hour.""
Of the more than 55,000 jobs Jassy announced, over 40,000 will be in the United States, while others will be in countries such as India, Germany and Japan.
Amazon previously promised a big tech hiring binge in 2017, when it sought a location for its second headquarters. Officials at cities and states across North America fawned on the company for its jobs and tax dollars.

Arlington, Virginia, the “HQ2” contest winner that so far has a small fraction of the 25,000 roles Amazon has promised it over a decade, currently has about 2,800 openings. The city of Bellevue where Amazon is growing near its hometown Seattle has another 2,000.
The career fair will be global. That's after Amazon saw 22,000 people tune in last year from India, among other locales outside the United States, Jassy said.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Massachusetts' attorney general on Wednesday gave backers of a proposed ballot measure, which would define drivers for app-based companies like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) as independent contractors rather than employees, the green light to collect the signatures needed to put it before voters.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey certified that the measure met constitutional requirements, clearing the way for a coalition of app-based service providers backing the initiative to begin collecting the tens of thousands of signatures needed to get the proposal onto the November 2022 ballot.
Her decision came despite a lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit-massachusetts/massachusetts-judge-allows-state-lawsuit-over-uber-lyft-driver-status-to-proceed-idUSKBN2BH3JX that Healey, a Democrat, filed challenging the designations by Uber and Lyft of their drivers as contractors not entitled to benefits like a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time.
It was among 17 of 30 proposed ballot measures that Healey certified. The union-backed Coalition to Protect Workers' Rights urged Healey to reject the measure as unconstitutional and is considering suing to challenge the measure, said its director, Mike Firestone.
The Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, whose members include Uber, Lyft, DoorDash Inc and Instacart Inc, last month proposed https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/group-backed-by-uber-lyft-pushes-massachusetts-gig-worker-ballot-measure-2021-08-04 asking voters to declare their drivers independent contractors entitled to minimum benefits but not their employees.
The proposal would establish an earnings floor equal to 120% of the Massachusetts minimum wage for app-based ride-share and delivery drivers, or $18 an hour in 2023, before tips. Drivers would be guaranteed at least 26 cents per mile to cover vehicle upkeep and gas.
Ride-share and delivery network companies would be required to pay healthcare stipends if drivers work at least 15 hours per week. Drivers could also earn paid sick time and paid family and medical leave.

The Massachusetts proposal followed a similar measure last year in California, where the companies persuaded state voters to solidify ride-hail and food delivery workers' status as independent contractors with some benefits.
However, a California judge on Aug. 23 ruled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/court-rules-california-gig-worker-initiative-is-unconstitutional-sacramento-bee-2021-08-21 that that measure, known as Proposition 22, violated the state's constitution.

Following the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) rebuff, Kansas City Southern has adjourned a shareholders meeting that was set to vote on its deal with Canadian National. On the other hand,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway's chief executive officer said the company would not offer Kansas City $300 per share should the U.S. railroad operator's board fail to decide on the offer by its Sept. 12 deadline. 
Below are the events that unfolded over several months as Canadian National and Canadian Pacific locked horns to take control of Kansas City Southern to create the first railway spanning the United States, Mexico and Canada, as they stand to benefit from a pick-up in trade. 
MARCH 21: CANADIAN PACIFIC AGREES TO ACQUIRE KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN
Canadian Pacific agreed to acquire Kansas City Southern in a $25 billion cash-and-stock deal, which would be the largest ever combination of North American railways by transaction value.
MARCH 22: FARM GROUPS SHOW SUPPORT FOR CP-KCS DEAL
Farm groups said Canadian Pacific's deal to buy Kansas City Southern would create a rail network from Canada to Mexico that could smooth the flow of their goods to market.
APRIL 20: CANADIAN NATIONAL TRUMPS CP'S OFFER
Canadian National offered to buy Kansas City for about $33.7 billion, trumping Canadian Pacific's buyout offer for the railroad operator. Canadian National said it was willing to match the terms of Canadian Pacific's offer for Kansas City Southern.
APRIL 21: CN KICKS OFF REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR KCS DEAL
Canadian National informed the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which oversees freight rail service and rates in the United States, that it planned to file an application, seeking permission to combine with Kansas City Southern.
APRIL 21: CANADIAN PACIFIC RULES OUT RAISING BID FOR KCS
Canadian Pacific's Chief Executive Keith Creel said the company would not raise its bid for Kansas City Southern and that bigger rival Canadian National's offer is ""not a real deal"". Creel said the company was not ready to put its ""balance sheet at risk."" 
APRIL 22: CN SHOWS CONFIDENCE IN DEAL GETTING APPROVAL
Canadian National informed Kansas City Southern's board about its confidence in winning regulatory approvals for its offer for the U.S. railroad. 
APRIL 23: LAWMAKER WARNS AGAINST RAILROAD CONSOLIDATION 
Senior U.S. lawmaker said the potential acquisition of the Kansas City Southern should set off ""alarm bells"" about industry consolidation, warning Wall Street would make money from railroad consolidation, but the U.S. economy and workforce will suffer.
APRIL 24: U.S. REGULATOR GIVES CP EARLY WIN IN TAKEOVER WAR 
The STB granted a waiver to Canadian Pacific's bid for Kansas City Southern, which means the deal would not be subjected to the tougher railroad merger rules the regulator put in place in 2001. At the same time, Kansas City Southern said its board had determined that a competing offer from Canadian National could be expected to lead to a ""superior proposal."" 
APRIL 26: RAIL CUSTOMERS PICK SIDES IN THE TAKEOVER WAR
North America's freight rail customers, from grain shippers to logistics companies, chose sides as the takeover war continued. Canadian National filed 409 letters of support with the STB, almost at par with Canadian Pacific's stated level of support. Some companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Conagra were publicly supporting both rail bids. 
MAY 1: CP OBJECTS TO CANADIAN NATIONAL's BID 
Canadian Pacific filed a formal objection stating Canadian National's rival bid for Kansas City does not qualify to be exempted from tougher merger rules as the CN-KCS deal would greatly expand the size of the fifth largest U.S. Class 1 railroad. 
MAY 6: STB APPROVES CP'S VOTING TRUST FOR KCS DEAL
The STB approved the voting trust for Canadian Pacific's proposed acquisition of Kansas City. Canadian Pacific had earlier agreed to bear most of the risk of the merger deal not going through. Canadian Pacific was going to buy Kansas City shares and place them in an independent voting trust, insulating the acquisition target from its control until the STB cleared the deal.
MAY 13: KCS DECLARES CN BID SUPERIOR TO CP DEAL 
Kansas City Southern accepted Canadian National's bid, leaving Canadian Pacific with five business days to make a new offer. If Canadian Pacific were to table a new offer, a bidding war could ensue. 
MAY 14: DOJ SAYS CANADIAN NATIONAL BID A GREATER RISK TO COMPETITION 
The U.S. Department of Justice said Canadian National's bid for Kansas City Southern appears to pose greater risks to competition than an agreement with Canadian Pacific.
MAY 18: SHAREHOLDER URGES CANADIAN NATIONAL TO AMEND KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN DEAL
Billionaire hedge fund manager Chris Hohn urged Canadian National Railway to abandon its bid for Kansas City Southern unless the Canadian railroad operator changed its agreement to drop a key feature that could invite more regulatory scrutiny.
MAY 20: CANADIAN PACIFIC ASKS KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN TO REJECT RIVAL OFFER
Canadian Pacific asked the U.S. railroad operator to reject rival Canadian National Railway's takeover offer, saying there was no longer any basis to terminate the CP-KCS agreement.
MAY 21: KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN STICKS TO CANADIAN NATIONAL OFFER
Kansas City Southern reiterated that Canadian National Railway's offer was ""superior"".
MAY 26: CANADIAN NATIONAL TO DIVEST KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN'S 70-MILE RAIL OVERLAP
Canadian National Railway agreed to divest Kansas City Southern's 70-mile rail line between New Orleans and Baton Rouge to eliminate the only overlap between the two railroad operators. 
AUG. 10: CANADIAN PACIFIC CHALLENGES CANADIAN NATIONAL WITH $27 BLN KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN BID

(Reuters) - Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) on Wednesday pushed back a vote on its proposed $29 billion sale to Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) as financial investors bet a decision by the U.S. regulator had derailed the deal.
The other suitor for the U.S. railroad,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd, said it would not be as willing to stick to its own $300 per share offer, worth $27 billion, after a Sept. 12 deadline.
Giving no timeline for a new shareholders' vote, Kansas City said it would evaluate the smaller offer again, while saying it was looking at other options to complete the deal with Canadian National.
Shares in both the Canadian companies rose around 5% on bets that Canadian National may not complete a costly merger, while others said Canadian Pacific (CP) could profit from stepping in to buy the U.S. railroad at a cheaper price. 
""It's probably going to be good news if they (CP) can win this deal,"" said Gregory Taylor, a portfolio manager at Purpose Investments.
Canadian National and its smaller rival have been vying to buy Kansas City for months, seeking to create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States and Mexico.
The U.S. Surface Transportation Board on Tuesday rejected a voting trust structure that would have allowed Canadian National's deal to proceed on antitrust concerns. 
Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Peter DeFazio on Wednesday backed https:// the regulator's ruling.
The rail regulator has already cleared Canadian Pacific's voting trust to buy Kansas City.

Meanwhile, Canadian National said it was also evaluating options. The company and Kansas City can seek a full approval, but regulatory experts said the process would be uncertain and could last more than a year.
Kansas City's shares were up 3.6%. They fell 4.4% on Tuesday after the regulator's ruling.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 12:56PM ET</span>",Majority of U.S. companies may mandate COVID-19 vaccine in coming months - survey,"(Reuters) - More than half of U.S. companies are planning to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the workplace by year end, with almost a quarter considering vaccination as a condition for employment, according to a national survey of nearly 1,000 employers. 
In the face of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, spurred by the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, that has strained the U.S. health care system, many companies have come out with mask mandates and changed their vaccination policies.
Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) are among the growing list of employers requiring some or all staff to get the vaccine.
The survey, which polled 961 U.S. companies that together employ around 9.7 million people, found that by the fourth quarter of 2021, over 52% of employers could have one or more vaccine mandate requirements, an increase from 21% currently. 
The mandates could range from requiring vaccination for staff to access common areas such as cafeterias to requiring vaccination for all employees, according to the survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) between Aug. 18 and 25.
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, an important step that could help accelerate vaccine mandates in the United States. 
""We expect even more employers to institute vaccine mandates in the wake of FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine,"" Willis Towers Watson's population health leader, Jeff Levin-Scherz, said.

The survey found the number of employers that track whether employees have completed their vaccination was increasing, with more companies considering implementing financial incentives for vaccinations. 
About 62% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose, while more than half or roughly 52% are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Tuesday, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of 13 members of the U.S. Congress sent a letter to the Pentagon supporting  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s proposed acquisition of rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne, according to the letter seen by Reuters.
Shares of Aerojet rose more than 2% after the Reuters report as investors cheered congressional support for a deal that has run into headwinds among some lawmakers.
In July, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Federal Trade Commission to take a tougher look at defense industry mergers, questioning Lockheed Martin's plan to buy the biggest independent maker of rocket motors, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD).
The Aug. 31 letter sent to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said it was in ""both our national security interests and the U.S. taxpayer's best interest to approve this proposed acquisition.""
The lawmakers said  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC)'s 2018 purchase of rocket engine maker Orbital ATK upset the structure of the rocket engine marketplace and a Lockheed deal would restore equilibrium.
""The only reasonable assurance we have that the American rocket propulsion manufacturing sector remains strong and has at least two well-resourced merchant suppliers for all defense and space propulsion products is to approve the merger with Lockheed,"" the letter said. 
Lockheed announced a $4.4 billion agreement to buy Aerojet late last year, but the deal has raised eyebrows because it would give Lockheed - the No. 1 defense contractor - ownership of a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry. Aerojet motors are used in everything from the homeland missile shield to Stinger missiles.

Lockheed has said Aerojet Rocketdyne would continue to supply the entire defense industry, a premise met with skepticism by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), a major customer for rocket motors.
A Lockheed spokesperson said the company is expecting the deal to buy Aerojet to close by year-end.

However, not all winning stocks possess fundamental strength. And because many analysts expect the stock market to remain under pressure in the near term, we think ultra-popular stocks Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), Naked Brand Group (NAKD), and Zomedica (ZOM) are extremely risky bets now, given their weak financials and sky-high valuations. Read on.Consumer confidence in the United States dipped to a six-month low in August due to concerns over rising COVID-19 cases and rising inflation. According to a Conference Board survey, the consumer confidence index slipped to 113.8 in August from 125.1 in July, its lowest level since February.
Although strategists believe it's too early to predict a market correction, the risks have been rising with concerns over changes in Fed policy and the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. And although solid second-quarter corporate earnings results have driven the major stock market indexes to hover near their all-time highs, many stocks have become highly overvalued.
Amid this environment, ultra-popular stocks  Palantir Technologies Inc . (PLTR),  Peloton Interactive Inc . (PTON), Naked Brand Group Limited (NAKD), and Zomedica Corp. (ZOM) could witness significant price declines in the near term because their weak growth prospects don’t justify their current valuations. So, we think these stocks are best avoided now.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>","Germany, Greece see lower demand for debt sales in nervous market","By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) -Germany and Greece launched syndicated debt sales in a nervous market on Wednesday and saw lower demand than for their previous issuances. 
Euro zone bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have risen sharply this week, driven partly by unease following hawkish comments from several European Central Bank policymakers on the future of the bank's pandemic emergency bond purchase programme (PEPP). 
Germany received more than 18 billion euros of demand for the sale of the 5.5 billion euro bond, which priced for a yield of 0.159%, according to lead manager memos seen by Reuters. Its finance agency will retain 500 million euros of the bond, the memos showed. 
The deal received less than half the 39 billion euros of demand Germany saw for a 30-year green bond syndication in May though green debt sales tend to see higher demand as they cater to a specialist investor base seeking environmentally-friendly assets.
Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho, said the German syndication offered ""limited value"" for investors, as he saw the yield on offer slightly below fair value. 
Greece, which tapped outstanding five- and 30-year bonds to raise 2.5 billion euros, received 18.9 billion euros of investor demand, lead managers said, with demand split roughly equally between the two bonds, which raised 1.5 and 1 billion euros respectively. 
Demand fell short of the 29 billion euros Greece saw for a 10-year bond tap in June that had also raised 2.5 billion euros.
'TOUGH TIME FOR GREECE'
The sale came as the gap between 10-year Greek bonds and their German equivalents - effectively the risk premium on Greek debt - reached its widest on Wednesday since May, at 115 basis points (bps). 
""It's a tough time for Greece to issue with people worrying about when PEPP is going to end and that's clearly to the detriment of demand,"" Mizuho's McCallum said.
The ECB made an exception to purchase junk-rated Greek debt in PEPP last year and has bought a substantial amount of the marketable Greek debt stack since. It only purchases investment grade securities for its regular bond buying programmes.
The spread Germany offered investors tightened from 3 bps over an outstanding bond due Aug. 15 2050, down from around 4 bps when the sale started earlier on Wednesday, according to earlier memos. 
Greece priced the shorter-dated bond for a yield of 0.02% and the longer one at 1.675%, cutting the spread to 38 bps and 135 bps over the mid-swap levels respectively, according to lead manager memos, down from around 43 and 145 bps respectively when the sale started. 
In syndications, borrowers hire investment banks to sell the debt directly to end-investors, allowing them to target a larger investor base and raise bigger size. They also allow investors to get hold of bonds in size and receive a new issue premium. 
Germany, which in the past rarely issued debt through syndications, started issuing bonds more regularly in this format last year as its funding needs ballooned due to the pandemic.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc has set up a union for its staff while e-commerce powerhouse JD (NASDAQ:JD).com has also established one - landmark moves in the country's tech sector where organised labour is extremely rare.
Regulators in China have come down hard on its biggest technology firms this year, criticising them for policies that exploit workers and infringe on consumer rights in addition to unleashing a slew of anti-trust probes and fines.
The government is also encouraging companies to implement initiatives to share wealth as part of a recent ""common prosperity"" drive laid out by President Xi Jinping to ease inequality in the world's second-largest economy.
Didi's union, announced on an internal forum last month, will be initially managed by employees at its Beijing headquarters and will be guided by the government-backed All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACTFU), said two people familiar with matter. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
JD.com established a trade union this week, a newspaper affiliated with the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions said, publishing pictures of the ceremony which was attended by a number of government officials. 
JD.com confirmed the news, saying that some of its local units had created unions in past years and the new union - set up at the group level - aimed to coordinate planning and resources.
Didi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Didi has been criticised by state media for not paying its drivers fairly and it said in April it would set up a drivers committee to improve income stability and transparency over wages. It is also the subject of an investigation launched by several Chinese regulators on the heels of its $4.4 billion U.S. stock market listing.
Didi and JD.com are believed to be the biggest tech firms to date to have established company-wide unions, though authorities in the county of Shishou in China's Hubei province said in June that local subsidiaries of Meituan and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Ele.me had established unions. 
Meituan and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The two food delivery firms have come under fire in local media for their treatment of delivery workers, most of whom are not covered by basic social and medical insurance. 
In July, the ACFTU and seven other top Chinese government bodies published guidance about safeguarding the rights of gig economy workers and suggested unions could play a role in helping negotiate with firms.
All unions in China are required to register with the ACFTU and have largely been confined to sectors such as manufacturing and transport.
The ACFTU's track record in negotiating better terms for workers has, however, often been criticised.

Aidan Chau, a researcher at the Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, said the country's unions have rarely directly challenged how companies treat their workers, instead focusing on matters such as alleviating employee grievances and promoting work safety. 
China's top court last month also took aim at the overtime practice of ""996"", working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, a policy common among many Chinese technology firms, saying it was illegal.

Investing.com – Campbell stock (NYSE:CPB) rose 1.2% after its second-quarter sales and earnings beat estimates and the company’s board approved another $500 million share repurchase program.
The latest share buyback plan has no expiration date and is in addition to the $250 million program announced in the previous quarter.
Fourth-quarter net sales decreased 11% to $1.87 billion but traders took comfort in the fact that sales were higher than the comparable 2019 quarter levels by 5%. Last year was an exception as people stayed indoors due to lockdowns and at-home consumption boomed.
Sales of meals and beverages fell 16% and those of snacks decreased 6%.
Organic net sales eroded by 4% from last year but rose 9% compared to the 2019 period. The decline versus the prior year was driven by a 5% decrease in volume and mix primarily as a result of cycling both the elevated demand in food purchases for at-home consumption and the partial retailer inventory recovery in the prior year, the company said.
Organic net sales exclude the impact from the additional week in the same quarter last year and the impact from the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business, the company said.
The company saved $25 million during the quarter under its multi-year cost savings program.
Adjusted earnings per share decreased by 8 cents to 55 cents.
For the ongoing financial year, Campbell expects sales to stay flat or fall by up to 2% from 2021’s $8.47 billion. Organic net sales growth is seen between minus 1% and 1%."

The number, closer to the lower end of the initial estimates given by insurance analysts while the storm was still raging earlier this week, is the first from one of the industry's major risk-modelling experts. 
KCC said $40 million worth of the insured loss would be in the Caribbean and the rest from wind and storm surge losses in the United States.
Hurricane Ida made landfall in the United States on Sunday as a Category 4 storm, after sweeping ashore from the Gulf of Mexico, flooding wide areas under heavy surf and torrential rains.
Insurance experts had earlier in the week estimated $15 billion to $30 billion in claims from Hurricane Ida, but cautioned the figure could be higher, in part because of pandemic pricing that has pushed up the cost of lumber and labor to rebuild.
The wide-ranging estimates, based on models that track the storm's severity and path, are still likely to be far less than the $87 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when adjusted for inflation, according to experts.
Ratings agency Fitch said losses from Ida will likely surpass those from winter storm Uri at $15 billion and Hurricane Laura - the costliest insured catastrophe event of 2020 - at $10 billion. 
KCC said that its data showed Ida tied with the Last Island Hurricane in 1856 and Hurricane Laura in 2020 for the strongest maximum sustained winds at landfall in Louisiana.

Its forecast includes damage to privately insured residential, commercial, and industrial properties and automobiles, and excludes boats, offshore properties or losses that come under the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program.
Analysts from UBS said the fallout from Ida would hit Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) and Lancashire's earnings per share hardest, by 32% and 30% respectively, while Hannover Re and reinsurance industry leader Munich Re would be the least hit.

We think these companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for chips. So, let’s examine these names.The current semiconductor shortage has forced many automakers and consumer electronics manufacturers to cut back production over the past few months. Limited supply and increasing demand for semiconductor chips are driving chip prices higher.
According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, chip sales came in at $133.6 billion in the second quarter, representing a 29.2% year-over-year rise. Furthermore, semiconductor companies worldwide have been increasing production to meet the soaring demand. Government initiatives in several countries to address the semiconductor chip shortage should also boost the industry’s growth. According to an Electronics Sourcing report, the worldwide semiconductor market is expected to grow 19.7% to $527 billion this year.
Hence, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound semiconductor stocks STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM), Renesas Electronics Corporation (RNECF), Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO), and inTEST Corporation (INTT).

Investing.com – Conn's stock (NASDAQ:CONN) soared nearly 8% Thursday as the company raised its annual guidance for same-store sales growth following its second-quarter results that beat estimates.
The company now expects same-store annual sales to rise by around 16% compared to the 9% growth forecast it gave earlier. This follows a 16% jump in those sales in the second quarter as demand for furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics stayed elevated.
The company’s earnings per share of $2.74 for the first six months of the year are higher than any annual earnings in Conn’s 131-year history, Chief Executive Officer Chandra Holt said.
May to July EPS was also a second-quarter record. It rose to $1.22 from 70 cents in the same period last year.
Total retail sales for the first half increased at the fastest growth rate in seven years, the company said. Second-quarter ecommerce sales more than trebled.

But even though WKHS stock is currently trading at less than $10, given the news regarding the reduction of its equity position in Lordstown Motors (RIDE) and its ballooning losses, is it worth betting on the stock now? Let’s find out.Technology company Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) in Loveland, Ohio, is focused on manufacturing battery-electric vehicles and providing mobility solutions to the commercial transportation sector. WKHS' shares have gained 1.5% in price over the past five days, driven by the company’s recent deal with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to run a pilot program to provide small Unmanned Aerial Systems to support the Department’s efforts in Mississippi. But the stock has plummeted 15.8% over the past month and 50.9% year-to-date, reflecting investor concerns over WKHS’ underwhelming second-quarter earnings report.

And because the industry is expected to continue witnessing sales growth in the coming months, Wall Street analysts expect established players in this space, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Lands' End (LE), and Citi Trends (CTRN), to rally substantially in price. So, let’s discuss.Although apparel retailers bore the brunt of the pandemic-related store closures last year, the speedy COVID-19 vaccine rollout and substantial increase in consumer spending have helped the industry’s sales rebound strongly this year. According to the chief U.S. economist at PNC, the outlook for consumer spending is expected to remain “positive.” Even though the worries over the COVID-19 Delta variant dampened spending activity slightly in July, clothing and accessories store sales were up 43.4% year-over-year.
The global apparel market is expected to hit $842.7 billion in 2025, registering a 9.8% CAGR. A shift in preference to branded products, aggressive branding by retail apparel operators, and strengthening e-commerce platforms are expected to propel the industry’s growth.
Thus, Wall Street analysts are bullish about the upside potential of several fundamentally sound apparel retailers. For instance, they expect  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) (ADDYY), Lands' End, Inc. (LE), and Citi Trends, Inc. (CTRN) to rally by more than 75% in price in the near term.

Kanagawa prefecture said on Tuesday several black particles in one Moderna vaccine vial were found upon checking for foreign substances before its use, and it has put the rest of the lot on hold.
Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-withdraws-16-mln-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-doses-over-contamination-nikkei-2021-08-25 of Moderna shots last week after being notified of contamination in some of the supply. Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines, have said the cause could be a manufacturing issue, and European safety regulators have launched an investigation.
Moderna has said no safety or efficacy issues had been identified from the issue. No similar Moderna incident has been reported in other countries.
Kanagawa prefecture said the vaccine's domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, had collected the vial with the suspected contaminant and that about 3,790 people had already received shots from the same lot.
More Moderna shots were temporarily halted in two other regions this week. In some cases, foreign substances have been found in unused vials, whereas others appear to be caused when bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-health-minister-says-okinawa-vaccine-contaminants-likely-needle-stick-2021-08-31 when needles are incorrectly inserted.
Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kanagawa incident. The company posted a notice on its website on Wednesday saying that on rare occasions during manufacturing, rubber stopper material can get mixed into the vaccine solution.
Japan's health ministry, citing an investigation by Takeda, said on Wednesday that the vial sent to Kanagawa was from a different lot than the other lots, and rubber stopper material appears to have gone into it during the manufacturing process.
Rovi did not have an immediate comment to a Reuters' request for an update on its investigation.
Medical staff are advised to do a visual inspection of vials for discoloration or foreign materials before use, the notice said.
The contamination incidents come as Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with daily infections exceeding 25,000 in August for the first time.

Tokyo reported on Wednesday 3,168 more cases, with NHK citing 20,031 new cases nationwide.
Severe COVID-19 cases are at record levels in Japan, leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds. Only 45.4% of its population has been fully vaccinated, lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries.

Investing.com –  Plug Power  stock (NASDAQ:PLUG) rose 4.5% Wednesday as Wolfe Research initiated its coverage with an outperform rating and a target of $34, which is 24.5% higher than the current level of $27.3.
Analyst Steve Fleishman said he likes Plug’s positioning as the hydrogen market develops with its integrated strategy, established business and broad set of relationships.
According to him, most hydrogen names are concept stocks with small existing businesses but have huge growth potential as hydrogen begins to drive the energy transition.
Plug Power claims to be the largest buyer of liquid hydrogen globally.
“We think that Plug will be among the first to transition from “story” to one that has meaningful cash flow and growth,"" Fleishman wrote in a note.
Experts believe green hydrogen will play an essential role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets worldwide, particularly in the transportation and logistics sectors.
Growth in the hydrogen economy is expected to accelerate, reaching up to 500-800 million tons used per year by 2050 and supplying 20% of global energy demand, according to Plug Power.
Last month, the company broke ground on the site of a green hydrogen production plant in Georgia’s Camden County. The company will invest $84 million in the facility.
The plant, which will serve customers in the Southeastern U.S., will produce liquid green hydrogen using 100% renewable energy. It will employ at least 24 full-time, local employees."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets edged higher at the open on Wednesday, after payrolls processor ADP's monthly report on private-sector hiring hinted at a slowdown in the job market recovery and, consequently, a higher likelihood of continued monetary stimulus. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a mere 10 points, less than 0.1%, at 35,371 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.
ADP said private payrolls expanded by 374,000, an acceleration from last month's 326,000 but far less than the 650,000 expected. Market participants took the news in their stride, mindful of the huge gap last month between the ADP's payrolls number and the government's much stronger data.  
Greg Daco, an analyst with Oxford Economics, called the figures ""underwhelming,"" pointing to a marked lag in hiring by small businesses, which added only 86,000 last month. 
Among individual movers, Lucid Motors stood out with an 11% drop in anticipation of heavy selling by early investors as a lockup on early backers ends.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock appeared to benefit from switches within the sector, rising 0.5% despite reports of another incident in which a Tesla car using its Autopilot software failed to identify a stationary police car.
Railroad stocks were also in focus after the unraveling of  Canadian National Railway  's (NYSE:CNI) takeover bid for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU). CNR's voting trust arrangement was refused by U.S. regulators on Tuesday, amid broader concern in Washington at the consolidation of market power in the railroad sector.

Canadian Pacific stock rose 3.5%, while CNR rose 5.1% on relief that it had avoided an expensive and deal in a difficult regulatory environment. Kansas City Southern stock rose 2.5%.after falling sharply on Tuesday.
Elsewhere Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) overcame initial wobbles to rise 0.6% after raising its guidance slightly on the back of strong growth numbers after the bell on Tuesday. The company's valuation of some 20 times expected 2021 sales, after a six-fold rally since the start of the pandemic, has left the cybersecurity expert exposed to any sign of growth slowing. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), another software company that fell sharply on Tuesday after failing to match heroic growth expectations, recovered 3.0%.
PVH (NYSE:PVH), which has the opposite valuation problem, rose 16% after the parent company of fashion brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger also reported better-than-expected results, notably from its reopened stores in Europe.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The Mexican arm of Anheuser-Busch InBev has accused Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) in a lawsuit of a second breach of their deal allowing Constellation to sell Mexican beers in the United States.
Grupo Modelo filed a suit in the U.S. district court of the southern district of New York on Tuesday, according to a court document, over Constellation's launch of two Modelo Reserva beers, one aged on tequila and another on bourbon barrels.
It says the first breaches U.S. and Mexican laws that strictly limit the use of the word tequila, and the second breaches Constellation's sub-licence to sell ""Mexican-style beer"" because bourbon has nothing to do with Mexico.
The sub-licence also does not allow this type of spirit branding, the suit says.
Constellation said Grupo Modelo's claims were without merit and that it had fully complied with the sub-licence terms.
When AB InBev took full control of Grupo Modelo in 2013, it agreed with U.S. antitrust regulators to sell Grupo Modelo's business in the United States to Constellation. The world's largest brewer retained rights to Modelo brands. 
The filing says Grupo Modelo notified Constellation of the issue in June and that Constellation had refused to stop selling the product.
AB InBev, which confirmed the filing, said Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) had also demanded Constellation cease its use of the word tequila in marketing.
In February, Modelo filed a legal challenge in the same court over Constellation's Corona Hard Seltzer, a sparkling water with alcohol flavouring, one of several seltzer drinks that have become very popular in the United States.
The AB InBev subsidiary said the 2013 deal only allowed Constellation to apply the Corona brand name to beer. 

Constellation said at the time that Modelo's claims were without merit and an attempt to restrain a strong competitor.
The new case is the latest in an increasingly litigious brewing market. In July, the CRT settled a four-year legal dispute with Heineken (OTC:HEINY) over the latter's tequila-flavoured beer Desperados.

Wood's bet on Zoom and other pandemic winners such as online healthcare service provider Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc had helped her ARK Innovation's portfolio outperform all other U.S. equity funds in 2020, although the fund has lagged this year.
Asset manager Ark Invest said it added about $45.5 million shares of Zoom to the flagship ARK Innovation ETF and about $11 million in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF.
The video conferencing company issued a dour forecast of 31% rise in third-quarter revenue compared with the multiple-fold growth rates seen last year amid remote work and schooling.
Its shares have nearly halved in value compared to their peak in October last year as the pandemic-boom started to fade. Meanwhile, the $25.5 billion ARKK is down about 2% for the year, clawing back from losses of about 22%.

Separately, ARK Fintech Innovation ETF added about $11.5 million shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD). Wood's interest in the popular trading app after its weak market debut in late-July partly drove a rally in the stock. 
Zoom shares were up 0.9% to $292.16 in premarket trading.

China will step up support for small- and medium-sized firms to help stabilise economic growth and employment, as rising commodity prices push up production costs and receivables, the cabinet said in a statement after a regular meeting.
The central bank will provide support via rediscount instruments to help ease financing burdens of small firms, while financial institutions will conduct bill discount financing for small firms, the cabinet said.
The government will strengthen its policy reserves and improve cross-cyclical adjustments, state media said, adding that local government special bonds will help drive effective investment.
The government will study and roll out new policy steps or extend existing policies that are set to expire to help firms cope with difficulties, the cabinet said.

By Arno Schuetze and Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Dating group ParshipMeet has started preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) next year as its private equity shareholder seeks to benefit from high sector valuations and sell some of its stake, three people close to the matter said.
ParshipMeet, which is 43% owned by buyout group General Atlantic and 53% by German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media, has invited banks to pitch for roles in the listing, the sources said.
Investment bank Evercore is helping ParshipMeet's shareholders with the IPO preparations and the choice of banks to organise the transaction, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2022, they said.
ProSieben declined to comment while Evercore and General Atlantic, which originally invested in the Munich media company's e-commerce division in 2018, also declined to comment.
ProSieben Chief Executive Rainer Beaujean has publicly set his sights on floating ParshipMeet in 2022. Its e-commerce business bought The Meet Group (NASDAQ:MEET) last year for $467 million and renamed it ParshipMeet Group.
Applying a market multiple of 35 times its core earnings of 100-120 million euros would imply that ParshipMeet could be worth upward of 3.5 billion euros ($4.1 billion).
By crystallising the value of its stake in ParshipMeet, which it would retain after the IPO, ProSieben could show investors that its core entertainment business was undervalued, he said.
""If you look at a sum-of-the-parts valuation, entertainment would be worthless,"" Beaujean said in November, when ProSieben's market valuation was 2.3 billion euros. It has since risen to 3.8 billion.
MARKET MULTIPLES
ParshipMeet reported first-half revenues of 280 million euros, up 19% on a pro-forma basis, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) climbed to 61 million euros.
While dating has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which has made it harder to meet up in person, ParshipMeet says its live video platform is driving romantic interest across its stable of brands, which include Parship,  MeetMe  and eharmony.
Rivals such as Bumble and Tinder-owner Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) trade at about 50 times their expected core earnings. That means ParshipMeet could be valued at more than 4 billion euros in the IPO, people close to the matter said.
One source cautioned, however, that the weak recent performance by shares in Bumble, which are down 22% this year, and by other recent e-commerce IPOs in Germany might push the ParshipMeet deal into the second half of 2022.

ProSieben's Nucom unit bought The Meet Group in early 2020 for 14.8 times the company's core earnings. ParshipMeet has since been made into a standalone business unit.

The roles, a mix of part-time and full-time jobs ranging from freight handlers to lift drivers, will be offered at 250 Walmart and Sam's Club distribution centers, fulfillment centers and transportation offices, the world's largest retailer said.
A nationwide labor shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred retailers to raise wages this year, with many worried that they will not have enough workers in stores and warehouses during the holiday shopping season.
Walmart said on Wednesday the average wage for supply chain associates it plans to hire will be $20.37 per hour. It raised average pay for U.S. hourly workers earlier this year to at least $15.25 an hour.
Walmart did not disclose the cost of the additional hiring.
Retailers are also grappling with rising freight costs due to bottlenecks at ports and container ship shortages as economies recover from a pandemic-led slowdown.
Low-price retailer  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) said on Wednesday it was looking to hire more workers at stores and distribution centers as well as truck drivers.
The discount chain, which has hired more than 50,000 employees since mid-July, is offering a $5,000 sign-on bonus to drivers as it expands its private fleet.
Rival  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) is offering a $1,000 sign-on bonus to ensure its distribution centers are sufficiently staffed ahead of the holiday season.

Last month, grocery chain Aldi announced plans to hire more than 20,000 U.S. workers across its stores and distribution centers and raise its wages.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Biden infrastructure plan takes on EV charging’s inequality problem,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - The Biden administration has an ambitious $7.5 billion plan to expand electric vehicle charging to underserved areas, but it must first overcome a host of obstacles that have discouraged private investment in more equitable charging networks.
The experience of California - the U.S. state with the largest number of EVs and the most advanced charging infrastructure - shows how challenging it will be to achieve the goals in the $1 trillion infrastructure spending proposal Biden wants Congress to pass.
California has poured more than $2 billion into a variety of EV incentive programs over the last years, which include policies to promote equity in distribution of chargers. The state has also generated more than $25 billion through its carbon credits trading program since 2012, a portion of which goes toward EV and charging projects.
Nevertheless, California currently has less than 40% of the charging infrastructure needed to support projected EV growth by 2025, according to a U.S.-wide charging gap study by the International Council on Clean Transportation.
Lower-income areas in largely Black and Hispanic California neighborhoods continue to be significantly less likely to have access to public chargers, a February study by researchers at California's Humboldt State University found.
""For charging site hosts, the economics are extremely challenging because of the relatively low adoption of EVs today,"" said John  Gartner  (NYSE:IT), senior director at the Center for Sustainable Energy, which administers EV incentive and infrastructure programs on behalf of six U.S. states, including California. 
For a graphic on charging economics: 
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-INFRASTRUCTURE/EVCHARGING/egvbkklbkpq/chart.png 
ONLY A DOWN PAYMENT
Gustavo Occhiuzzo, the CEO of California-based electric vehicle charging company EVCS, said the level of public support to defray upfront and operational costs is the key to decisions on building out his charging network in rural and disadvantaged communities.
""We need to be strategic where we invest our time and money. And for now, California is the one place that provides the biggest return for us,"" said Occhiuzzo, whose company maintains more than 1,500 chargers in largely disadvantaged California communities - and turns a profit.
Most of the private charging companies, however, such as EVgo, ChargePoint and Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK), have yet to be profitable. Executives at EVgo and ChargePoint said government support was needed to expand charging to overlooked communities and create incentives for business owners or landlords considering installation.
California's incentives for disadvantaged communities are gradually increasing. Applications for the state's EV rebate program from low- and middle-income households have increased to a quarter so far this year, and around a third of funding for a popular state EV charging program is earmarked for disadvantaged communities.
Replicating California's programs on a national scale will require vastly more funding than the U.S. government has currently allocated. 
Daniel Davenport, senior director of automotive at Capgemini Americas, estimates it would require around $50 billion to build out the U.S. charging network.
Getting more Americans to switch to a battery-powered car by improving access to charging infrastructure is a key component of Biden's agenda to combat climate change, with transportation accounting for the largest share of U.S. emissions.
The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill provides for $7.5 billion in charging network investments over a five-year period, with a portion set aside for low-income and rural areas.
A White House official said the government would also use Department of Energy loan programs and other financing tools, prioritizing public funding for locations that would not necessarily be supported by private capital alone.
""As the administration... develops the guidance for these new programs we will emphasize the importance of equity in the siting and operation of chargers,"" the official said.
UTILIZATION RATES
State and federal officials face a two-prong challenge to expand charging beyond high-income zip codes: Battery-powered vehicles are still out of reach of many consumers, and a charger that is not used heavily will not recoup its costs.
High-speed charging units that can top up a vehicle battery in half an hour cost around $100,000 to build. Experts estimate they need to be used at least 20% of the day to operate profitably at current rates - prompting many charging providers to place them in areas with higher anticipated use.
In the future, used EVs could allow less-affluent Americans to drive battery-powered vehicles. Currently, used EVs account for only 0.3% of all U.S. franchise dealer used sales, compared with new EVs making up 3% of new vehicle sales, according to market research firm J.D. Power. 
""It's going to be a very long time before EVs are a significant part of the used market,"" said Tyson Jominy, the firm's vice president of Data & Analytics.
Beyond government agencies, electric utilities are emerging as source of capital to expand charging networks, owning stations themselves or partnering with private companies. 
Investor-owned utilities have approved $3 billion in EV charging infrastructure investments in recent years, according to the Edison Electric Institute, dominated by entities in California and New York. A quarter of those funds has been allocated to disadvantaged communities, and equity-based funding programs are expected to accelerate in the coming years. 

In North Carolina,  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) has asked state regulators to approve a $56 million electric vehicle program, which includes $13 million for rural and low-income communities. 
""We're making sure to hit those low-income rural counties that would likely be underserved by the traditional private market, areas a private company wouldn't select until EV adoption is further down the road,"" said Lon Huber, a Duke Energy vice president.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, adding more gains to a positive August, ahead of the release of important private payrolls data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 110 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.4%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 35 points, or 0.2%.
The major indices all posted gains in August, with the broad-based S&P 500 climbing 2.9% and rising for the seventh month in a row. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained around 4% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2%.
This week’s main focus remains Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data for August, as the strength of this release could influence the Federal Reserve’s decision on when to start running down its massive bond-buying program.
Economists are generally looking for 750,000 jobs to have been created last month, which would be a drop from July’s 943,000 but still one of the highest monthly gains on record. 
Ahead of that, comes the release, at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), of the ADP private payrolls number. This is expected to show that employment at private companies roared back in August, with 613,000 positions added, a spike from July’s 330,000.
In corporate news, Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) will be in the spotlight Wednesday after the cybersecurity firm beat quarterly revenue and earnings expectations after the close Tuesday.
Additionally, earnings are expected from  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB), before the open, and  Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb), the maker of Jack Daniels whiskey and Finlandia vodka, after the bell.
Crude prices rose after OPEC+ raised its forecast for oil demand next year ahead of a meeting later Wednesday to decide future production levels.

Ahead of this, Reuters reported that the group's experts have revised its 2022 oil demand growth forecast to 4.2 million barrels per day, up from the previous forecast of 3.28 million barrels per day. 
Additionally, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will report its weekly U.S. crude supply data later this session, with the industry body the American Petroleum Institute detailing a draw of just over 4 million barrels on Tuesday.

Investing.com – Nio ADRs (NYSE:NIO) fell more than 4% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the Chinese maker of electric vehicles cut its forecast for deliveries in the current quarter due to a shortage of chips.
The company now plans to deliver 22,500 to 23,500 vehicles in the third quarter, down from a previous target of 23,000 to 25,000.
The shortage of semiconductor supplies is hurting virtually all automakers, not least giants such as Toyota and Volkswagen.
Vehicle makers have been among the sectors hardest hit by the shortage of chips, as more supplies have been directed to makers of digital gadgets. The pandemic has generated runaway demand for electronics as masses of people have chosen or been forced to do more work from home, and seek their entertainment online.
Nio said it delivered 5,880 vehicles in August, an all-time high, and up 48% on-year. Production was disrupted though, the company said. It blamed supply chain constraints resulting from the pandemic in parts of China and Malaysia. In China in particular, supply chains were hit this summer by a series of lockdowns aiming to quash the worst localized outbreaks of Covid-19 since last winter."

Arnault held a 5.7% stake via his Financiere Agache holding company, which raised 724 million euros ($854 million) by selling shares on the market in an accelerated bookbuilding process, bookrunner Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said on Wednesday. 
Carrefour shares were down just over 5% in early trading. 
The Agache stake was sold at 16 euros per share, after Arnault, alongside Colony Capital (NYSE:DBRG) and Axon Capital first took a 9.8% holding in 2007 at an average price of 47 euros per share.
Carrefour has been through several transformations, with shareholders benefiting as it spun-off businesses, including its DUA supermaket chain. Arnault was one of its three big shareholders, along with the Moulin family and Brazilian businessman Abilio dos Santos Diniz.
The company in May renewed the mandate of Chairman and Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard, who has spearheaded a turnaround plan involving cost cuts and an e-commerce push to boost sales and profits, for another three years. 
Arnault, France's richest man, was supportive of Bompard in January when the executive was in talks with Canada's Couche-Tard about a takeover deal, sources said at the time. Couche-Tard eventually dropped its bid of nearly $20 billion for Carrefour after it ran into opposition from the French government.
Bompard has since carried out the acquisition of Grupo BIG, valued at around $1.3 billion, and asserted Carrefour was viable on its own. 
Agache is focused on investments in fashion and luxury, and took a stake in sandal maker Birkenstock in February. 

The vehicle had already begun to sell down part of its Carrefour stake in 2020.

Investing.com – Crowdstrike stock (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 3.3% in Wednesday’s premarket as the cybersecurity firm's higher guidance failed to live up to one of the highest valuations of any widely-recognized company..
The company lifted its revenue guidance for the year to $1.39 billion-$1.40 billion, having raised it to $1.34 billion-$1.36 billion in June. At the top end, it’s a 3% rise from the previous guidance and a 61% jump from last year.
Crowdstrike is the second Cloud-based company this week (after Zoom Video) to have fallen despite beating forecasts, amid signs of recognition of how the 18-month rally in pandemic winners has stretched valuations. Tuesday's closing market value of $64 billion still priced the company at over 40 times expected sales. 
Coming at a time when demand for cybersecurity solutions is booming as the world adjusts to a new normal of home-office life, the stock reacted to the modest revision. Crowdstrike’s 2021 revenue grew 74% last year and its latest July-quarter revenue by 70% to $337.7 million, beating estimates.
Annual recurring revenue rose 70% year-over-year to $1.34 billion as the company catered to a variety of demands from users of laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines and IoT devices.
Net income more than tripled to $25.9 million, and beat estimates on a per share basis.

The fine https://www.reuters.com/technology/france-fines-google-500-mln-over-copyright-row-2021-07-13 came amid increasing international pressure on online platforms such as Google, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to share more of the revenue they make from using media outlets' news. 
""We disagree with a number of legal elements, and believe that the fine is disproportionate to our efforts to reach an agreement and comply with the new law,"" said Sebastien Missoffe, head of Google France.
""We continue to work hard to resolve this case and put deals in place. This includes expanding offers to 1,200 publishers, clarifying aspects of our contracts, and sharing more data as requested by the French Competition Authority.""
The French antitrust body imposed the sanction on Google for failing to comply with its orders on how to conduct the talks with publishers.
It said on Wednesday that Google's appeal, which will be ruled on by Paris' court of appeal, would not hold up the fine, which the U.S. tech giant must still pay. It could not say how long the appeal process would take. 
The case focused on whether Google breached temporary orders issued by the authority, which said such talks should take place, within three months, with any news publishers that asked for them.

The watchdog said in its July 13 decision that the U.S. tech group must come up with proposals within the next two months on how it would compensate news agencies and other publishers for the use of their content. If it does not do that, the company would face additional fines of up to 900,000 euros per day.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - State-backed firms are set to take a sizeable stake in a key Ant Group asset for the first time, three people told Reuters, in a move that will loosen the Chinese fintech giant's grip on a data treasure trove of over 1 billion users but help revive its IPO.
The partners plan to establish a personal credit-scoring firm, said the people, adding that such a firm and ownership structure was one aspect of restructuring ordered by regulators who put a sudden stop to Ant's blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) in November.
The listing highlighted the outsized role of Ant and e-commerce affiliate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in China, triggering a regulatory clampdown on the business empire of billionaire founder Jack Ma. The result was a restructuring order for Ant, a record $2.75 billion fine for Alibaba for antitrust violation, and a near-three month disappearance of Ma from public view.
Under the plan, Ant and Zhejiang Tourism Investment Group Co Ltd will each own 35% of the venture, while other state-backed partners, Hangzhou Finance and Investment Group and Zhejiang Electronic Port, will each hold slightly more than 5%, said one of the people. 
The only non-state investor will be Transfar Group, parent of logistics and financial services firm Transfar Zhilian Co Ltd, said the people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified as the information was private.
Transfar's stake will total 7%, said one of the people.
Reuters phone calls to Zhejiang Tourism seeking comment went unanswered. Ant and other shareholders did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) - China's central bank, which is overseeing Ant's restructuring, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
GOVERNMENT CONTROL
The plan, part of Ant's business revamp, would represent one of the most prominent outcomes of a government push for state-backed firms to exert more control and influence over fast-growing but previously lightly regulated new-economy businesses.
It follows the PBOC in April ordering Ant to become a more strictly regulated financial holding firm, break its ""monopoly on information and strictly comply with the requirements of credit information business regulation.""
In June, Ant won operational approval for a consumer finance venture whose minority shareholders include state-owned firms. The venture puts Ant's lucrative micro-lending businesses under tighter regulatory purview.
The proposed joint venture would collect, manage and analyse consumer data to score people's credit, thereby bringing Ant's main business-data operations together and making regulatory oversight easier, said one of the people. 
Under the framework being discussed for the new venture, shareholders will invest about 500 million yuan ($77.4 million) in the entity as registered capital, said another person.
They aim to establish what would be China's third licensed personal credit-scoring firm as soon as October, two of the people said. The other two are Baihang Credit Scoring and Pudao Credit Rating Co Ltd, both of which won approval in recent years and count several internet firms among their shareholders. 
BIG DATA
E-commerce and financial technology (fintech) firms such as Ant sit on a huge cache of consumer data that is the backbone of China's internet where, in finance, companies' offerings are as varied as loans and investment products sold via smartphones.
Big platforms like Ant, which began as Alibaba's payments arm, have for years been reluctant to share that data with credit-scoring firms run or backed by regulators.
The government responded with tighter rules for fintech firms that collect and use personal data in financial services due to concern of the systemic financial risk they pose.
In January, the central bank issued draft rules clarifying the scope of information and businesses included in credit-scoring regulation and urged credit-scoring firms to apply for licences and to not over-collect user data.

Ant, via super-app Alipay, collects data from over 1 billion users, many of whom are young, internet-savvy people without credit cards or sufficient bank credit records, as well as 80 million merchants, according to analysts and its IPO prospectus.
It runs Zhima Credit, one of China's biggest private credit-scoring platforms, with proprietary algorithms to score people and small businesses based on their use of Ant-linked services.

Investing.com – Shares in fashion group PVH (NYSE:PVH), the owner of brands such as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, soared more than 8% in Wednesday’s premarket as it raised its annual revenue guidance and announced a buyback after a rebound in sales.
Revenue through digital channels grew around 35% and sales in international markets, primarily driven by Europe, significantly exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
Chief Executive Officer Stefan Larsson said recovery had been faster than expected in both of its main brands. Traffic in stores has improved due to reopening and reduced restrictions, he said.
The company had lowered its guidance in June, adjusting for some brand disposals. These included IZOD, Van Heusen, ARROW and Geoffrey Beene under its Heritage Brands business.
The company said it will use $200 million from the sale proceeds to repurchase shares.
The company now projects annual revenue to increase 26%-28%, having cut its guidance to a range of 22%-24% earlier this year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share of $8.50 are expected, compared to the previous forecast of $6.50. Third-quarter revenue is projected to increase 11%-13%.
Second-quarter revenue increased 46% to $2.31 billion and adjusted EPS was $2.72, both beating estimates.

PARIS (Reuters) -French spirits maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) said on Wednesday it was confident its sales momentum would continue this year after a rebound in demand in China and the United States helped it to deliver stronger-than expected annual profits.
With recurring cash flow at an historical high of 1.745 billion euros at end-June, Pernod, which bought a minority stake in U.S. wines and spirits company Sovereign Brands, also said it would resume its 500 million euros ($590.60 million) buyback programme for the fiscal year 2021/22.
Its shares were up 3% by 0830 GMT, making it the biggest gainer on the Paris CAC 40, which rose 1%.
The owner of Mumm champagne, Absolut vodka and Martell cognac, did not provide specific operating profit guidance for the year 2021/22 that started on July 1, but said its first quarter would be ""very dynamic"". 
""We are giving a qualitative guidance for the full year, good sales momentum supported by on-trade recovery, resilient off-trade, dynamism in e-commerce,"" Finance Chief Helene de Tissot told Reuters.
However, she said Pernod Ricard remained ""very cautious"" concerning travel retail prospects over the next 10 months because of ongoing pandemic restrictions.
Over the twelve months to June 30, profit from recurring operations reached 2.423 billion euros ($2.86 billion), an organic rise of 18.3%. This exceeded the company's guidance for a profit rise of as much as 17%.
""Pernod Ricard FY 2021 reflects a strong recovery despite residual COVID weakness in travel retail and in India,"" Berstein analysts said in a note. Sales reached 8.824 billion euros, an organic rise of 9.7%, reflecting a 16% jump in sales in the United States and a 14% rise in China.
In the fourth quarter alone sales rose 57% from a year-earlier, as bars and restaurants reopened in the United States and in Europe as COVID restrictions eased.
Asked whether Pernod Ricard could be at risk from China's possible plans for wealth redistribution and clamp down on high incomes, Chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard told a news conference: ""If indeed there is an increase in the purchasing power of the (Chinese) middle class, it could be a positive for Pernod,""
The world's second-biggest spirits group after Britain's  Diageo  (LON:DGE), had raised its organic profit growth guidance for 2020/21 to 16% from 10%. And last month, Pernod said a U.S. court ruling that it could claim a refund on spirits exported from the United States would add a further 1% to its organic profit growth.

The group reiterated what Alexandre Ricard called a ""framework"" of 4-7% sales growth and 50-60 basis points operating leverage per year for the medium-term. It will hold a capital market day ""probably in spring"".

531,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>",WH Smith warns on 2022 profit due to slow travel recovery,"By Yadarisa Shabong
(Reuters) -WH Smith's 2022 profit is likely to be at the lower end of market expectations, the British retailer warned on Wednesday as a slow and uncertain recovery in global tourism squeezes its stores in travel hubs like airports and train stations.
The company's 2022 pretax profit was expected to be in the range of 70 million to 135 million pounds ($96-186 million), according to a company-compiled consensus of analysts estimates.
WH Smith highlighted, though, that a quicker recovery in its North American travel stores in the last two months meant that the group's 2021 performance would be slightly better than market expectations of a pretax loss of 68 million pounds.
Shares in the company, which sells books, travel and tech accessories and also has stores on high streets, were down nearly 7% in morning trade, underperforming London's broader midcaps index.
The global travel and tourism sector does not expect to fully recover from the COVID-19 crisis until at least 2023 as a result of uncertainty related to new virus variants and quarantine measures.
WH Smith's revenue globally from its travel-related stores, its biggest source of income, was still only at 55% of 2019 levels in the six months ending Aug. 31. 
JP Morgan Cazenove analysts downgraded the group's 2022 and 2023 estimates for pretax profit due to the slower-than-expected recovery in global travel, and said didn't expect its underlying profitability to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. 

WH Smith said that finance charges related to its bond issue in April would also affect its profitability in 2022.

Tencent’s “large and important gaming, social media and other content businesses are exposed to regulatory, social and political tail risks that we cannot handicap,” said Chris Wheldon, who co-manages the Magellan High Conviction Fund. 
Some assets were shifted to a stake in Amazon after the Seattle-based company’s shares dropped in the wake of its second-quarter results, he said in a webinar Wednesday. 
Amazon’s price fall “coincided with a change in our risk-adjusted views regarding the Tencent investment case,” he said. The U.S. e-commerce and cloud-computing firm is “right in the center of the dartboard in terms of business quality and long-term compounding potential,” Wheldon said, adding that the fund previously “had a question mark next to its valuation.”
Magellan oversees A$117 billion ($85.6 billion) in global equity and infrastructure strategies, according to its website. Its Tencent stake was in Hong-Kong listed shares of the Chinese tech giant.

533,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 04:03AM ET</span>","European Stocks Higher; Pernod Ricard Expects ""Dynamic"" Quarter","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Wednesday, climbing to near record levels, helped by upbeat comments from the European Central Bank.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.4%, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.9%, and the pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.8%, climbing close to the record levels seen in mid-August.
Helping the tone Wednesday were comments by ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos, stating in a Spanish newspaper that the Eurozone economy is growing quicker than the ECB expected and hinting at an upward revision to the bank's growth forecasts when its policy-making council next meets.
This has overshadowed the release of disappointing German retail sales for July, which slumped 5.1% on the month, in a sign that a consumer-driven recovery in Europe's largest economy may be running out of gas. The Eurozone manufacturing PMI for August also fell by more than expected, although it remained at a historically high 61.4.
Data released earlier Wednesday showed China’s factory activity entered contraction territory for the first time in nearly one-and-a-half years in August, also pointing to a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. 
Back in Europe, there are more economic data releases due, including the latest Eurozone unemployment figures for July.
In corporate news,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) stock rose 3.5% after the French drinks maker expressed confidence in its sales momentum, saying its first quarter, which started in July, would be ""very dynamic"".
On the flip side, WH Smith (LON:SMWH) stock fell 6.8% after the U.K. retailer warned that profitability for the year ending August 2022 will be at the lower end of market expectations, citing uncertainty in the recovery of travel. Many of WH Smith's outlets are in airports and train and bus stations.
 Carrefour  (PA:CARR) stock slipped 3.7% after French billionaire investor Bernard Arnault sold his 5.7% stake in the supermarket group via an accelerated bookbuilding process, according to bookrunner Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Crude prices rose Wednesday after OPEC+ raising its forecast for oil demand next year ahead of a meeting later Wednesday to decide future production levels.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, is expected to confirm the addition of another 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month through December.
Ahead of this, Reuters reported that the group's experts have revised its 2022 oil demand growth forecast to 4.2 million barrels per day, up from the previous forecast of 3.28 million barrels per day. 
Also helping the tone, the American Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday a draw of just over 4 million barrels in U.S. crude supply for last week, and investors will be looking to see if the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms this sign of strength later in the session.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $69.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $72.19.

LONDON (Reuters) - KPMG allegedly provided ""false and misleading"" information about its audits of collapsed builder Carillion and data erasure company Regenersis for regulatory checks, Britain's accounting watchdog said on Wednesday.
The information was provided in connection with the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) routine annual quality checks of audits by the main accounting firms.
""The formal complaint alleges misconduct against KPMG and several individuals regarding the provision of allegedly false and misleading information and/or documents to the FRC by KPMG in connection with the FRC's inspections of two audits carried out by KPMG,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
The complaint is against KPMG itself, a former partner, and certain current and former employees, the FRC said.
""The formal complaint does not allege misconduct arising from the performance of the relevant audits, nor does it allege that in either case the financial statements had not been properly prepared,"" it added.
KPMG said it took the matter extremely seriously.
""We discovered the alleged issues in 2018 and 2019, and on both occasions immediately reported them to the FRC and suspended the small number of people involved,"" KPMG said.
A disciplinary tribunal will hear the formal complaint and determine whether there has been misconduct. The hearing will start in January 2022.
""The allegations in the formal complaint would, if proven, represent very serious breaches of our processes and values. We have cooperated fully with our regulator throughout their investigation,"" KPMG added.

Separately, the FRC is investigating KPMG's audit of Carillion, whose collapse triggered a string of government-backed reviews to improve standards in a market dominated by KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC, known collectively as the Big Four.
In its latest annual report on routine quality checks published in July, the FRC said KPMG's bank audits needed improvements for an ""unacceptable"" third year running and the accounting firm will be closely monitored.

The company in June recalled up to four million of its respiratory devices and ventilators, as it said a foam part might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer. 
Philips said it had received authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the rework of the affected DreamStation device, allowing it to replace the sound abatement foam with a new material.
More than half of the affected machines have been sold in the U.S. and the full replacement effort will take about a year, Philips said.
Philips shares have lost about 15% of their value since the recall, as investors fear the possible costs of a number of class action lawsuits that have been launched over the affair.

Philips has set aside 500 million euros ($590 million) in provisions for the recall operation in the first half of 2021.

A look at the day ahead from Tom Arnold. 
After seven straight months of gains for stocks, some investors are beginning to wonder when the good times will end.
Data from Asia on Wednesday is the latest reminder that they may not last.
Factory activity lost momentum in August as a coronavirus resurgence hit supply chains across the region. China's factory activity slipped into contraction for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years, while chip shortages and factory shutdowns slowed manufacturing in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
So far, markets don't seem overly concerned.
Propelled by bets of continued central bank support, the S&P 500, Europe's STOXX 600 and MSCI's global equity index closed August with their seventh straight month of gains.
With the Federal Reserve last week appearing in no rush to pull back stimulus, traders are honing in on Friday's U.S. jobs figures for their next clues on taper timing. 
So where will it all end?
An ominous sign is that the last time world stocks notched up their best run of monthly gains -- a 15-month streak that ended in January 2018 -- markets then tumbled to their worst year since the global financial crisis.
Back then it was precipitated, at least in part, by worries of tightening monetary policy. 
Sound familiar? 
Developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- Biden says Afghanistan exit marks the end of U.S nation-building..
- BOJ's deputy governor warns against premature monetary tightening.. 
- S.Korea's parliament passes bill to curb Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) commission dominance.
- Central bank of Chile raised rates by 75 bps 
- Australia Q2 GDP stronger than expected at +0.7% q/q.
- ECB Board member Edouard Fernandez-Bollo speaks at 1155 GMT.

- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic speaks at 1600 GMT.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Wednesday, helped by upbeat comments from the ECB, but concerns remain about the strength of the global economic recovery.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Helping the tone Wednesday were comments by ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos, stating in a Spanish newspaper that the Eurozone economy is growing quicker than the European Central Bank expected.
""The economy is performing better in 2021 than we expected, and this will be reflected in the projections that will be published in the coming days,"" El Confidencial quoted de Guindos as saying on Wednesday.
However, this could also result in the sooner than expected withdrawal of the central bank’s stimulus, especially after Tuesday’s Eurozone inflation data showed consumer prices increased by 3% in August, far above expectations and the European Central Bank’s 2% target. The accounts of the last ECB policy-meeting also acknowledged the risk of excessive inflation for the first time in years.
Data released earlier Wednesday showed China’s factory activity entered contraction territory for the first time in nearly one-and-a-half years in August. 
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index, released earlier in the day, was at 49.2, below the 50-mark indicating growth, as lockdown measures to contain the latest Covid-19 outbreak, supply bottlenecks, anti-pollution initiatives and high raw material prices all contributed to a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. 
Back in Europe, German retail sales slumped 5.1% on the month in July, way below expectations, setting the scene for the release of the latest Eurozone unemployment figures for July and August manufacturing PMI data.
Crude prices rose Wednesday, supported by a larger-than-expected decline in weekly U.S. oil stocks and ahead of a meeting of the group of top producers to determine future production levels.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, is expected later Wednesday to confirm the addition of another 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month through December, judging that the market is strong enough to cope with the extra output. 
The American Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday a draw of just over 4 million barrels in U.S. crude supply for last week, and investors will be looking to see if the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms this sign of strength later in the session.
Additionally, U.S. refiners will continue to assess flood damage in the wake of Hurricane Ida.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $69.11 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $72.21.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp said on Wednesday it has completed the official business registration of its electric vehicle unit, marking the latest milestone in its push into the automotive sector.
The new unit, to be called Xiaomi EV Inc, opened with registered capital of 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) and Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun as its legal representative, Xiaomi said in a statement.
Some 300 staff have so far been employed to join the EV unit and it continues to recruit talent, it said. 
The smartphone maker, which became the world's second top-selling brand behind Samsung (KS:005930) in the second quarter, confirmed its foray into electric cars in March, pledging to invest $10 billion over the next 10 years.
Lei said at the time the push into electric vehicles would mark his ""last major entrepreneurial project.""
Xiaomi said on Wednesday it has since conducted more than 2,000 interview surveys and visited over 10 industry peers and partners. However, it has revealed few details of its strategy for the automotive sector or vehicle types it intends to launch.
Last week, the company said it purchased autonomous driving technology startup Deepmotion for over $77 million, in an effort to boost research and development.
Earlier in August, Reuters reported that Xiaomi had entered talks with beleaguered real estate giant Evergrande Group to purchase a stake in the latter's automotive unit.
In response to the news, a Xiaomi spokesperson wrote on the company social media account that it is in touch with several automakers but has yet to decide which one to work with.

(Reuters) - A gaggle of so-called meme stocks were mostly lower on Tuesday after eye-popping rallies in their shares in recent days suggested that retail investors are still eager to bet on companies popular in online forums.
Shares of software company Support.com shot up 313% in the six trading sessions through Monday and were up more than 1,400% year-to-date. They were down 11.3% on Tuesday afternoon. 
Digital marketing company Vinco Ventures, up 114% since Thursday, was up 0.3% on Tuesday. E-commerce platform Aterian Inc fell 12.4% after gaining 60% in the last two trading days.
The recent moves were another sign that the wild rides associated with meme stocks may be a feature of markets for some time to come. For eight months now, Wall Street has witnessed breathtaking rallies in shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other stocks favored by individual investors gathering on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets.
Another sign of the phenomenon's potential staying power came Monday, when shares of Paypal jumped after a report that it was exploring ways to let U.S. customers trade individual stocks on its platform.
On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-is-going-on-a-hiring-spree-11630414800 that Fidelity Investments plans to hire another 9,000 employees this year due to surging demand for stock-trading and other personal investing services. 
""Retail trading and momentum is now a relevant facet of daily trading,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners. “It moves prices and institutional investors take notice."" 
Options trading is probably exacerbating moves in some shares. Options volume for Vinco Ventures stood at 259,000 contracts early late Tuesday afternoon, making it the sixth most active single stock name in the entire options market, according to Trade Alert data. 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Corp, which rose along with GameStop in January and has seen subsequent rallies in recent months, was the third most active, with 406,000 contracts. AMC’s shares were last up 7.8%.
Some of the newer meme stocks also sport unusually high short interest, making them targets for investors seeking to force a short squeeze. This can send share prices sharply higher as bearish investors are forced to unwind bets against a stock.
Short interest in the shares of Support.com, for instance, recently stood at around 60%, while Vinco’s short interest was at 20%, according to S3 data.
Massive volumes in some of the shares are evidence that the bulk of the gains came from bullish investors piling in rather than bears closing out positions, Dusaniwsky said. Trading volume for Support.com over the last three sessions, for example, was 115 million shares, or about 6.6 times the 50-day moving average. 
This month, Support.com said a shareholder vote to merge with bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation Holdings was scheduled for Sept 10. Support.com announced it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the bitcoin miner in March.

Plenty of market participants believe the meme stock craze is unlikely to survive if the bull market ends whenever the U.S. Federal Reserve unwinds the easy money policies that have helped the S&P 500 double from its March 2020 lows. 
""If ever this was a sign that there is too much idle money in peoples' hands, meme-stock gambling is it,” said David Trainer, chief investment officer at an investment research firm New Constructs. “As soon as the super loose money begins to abate, I think you'll see folks be much more rational.”

(Reuters) - A union representing Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co pilots has filed a lawsuit challenging forced time off and other changes to working conditions imposed by the airline during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association filed a complaint in federal court in Dallas on Monday claiming that the carrier implemented an ""emergency time off"" program, altered schedules, and scaled back prescription drug and retirement benefits without bargaining, in violation of federal labor law.
It claims Southwest should have collectively bargained with the union instead of giving itself ""force majeure"" rights when air travel plummeted during the pandemic.
The lawsuit marks an escalation in mounting tensions between the airline and its staff. Its pilots union has threatened to picket over the winter holidays to protest against a host of issues including a gruelling work schedule, a lack of food and accommodation and COVID-19 protocols.
The protest prompted the company last week to trim flight schedules for this fall in a bid to better align its operations with staffing.
In the lawsuit, the union said the airline is bound by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that lapsed in August last year, but remains in effect until a new agreement is reached and does not contain a ""force majeure"" clause.
It asked the court for an injunction, requiring Southwest to stick to the provisions of the lapsed agreement, and negotiate the terms for an ""emergency extended time off"" program, and COVID 19-related work conditions.
In an email sent to its members on Tuesday, the union said the lawsuit was the ""only recourse"" to compel the company to meet its duty to collectively bargain.

Russell McCrady, Southwest vice president of labor relations, in a statement said that the airline disagrees that any COVID-related changes adopted in recent months required negotiation. 
""As always, Southwest remains committed to pilots’ health and welfare and to working with SWAPA, and our other union partners, as we continue navigating the challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A California cookie maker on Tuesday sued  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) for the right to keep using a stylized chocolate chip teardrop on its packaging, after Hershey complained it looked too much like its famous Hershey's Kisses.
The Cookie Department Inc said Hershey's threatened trademark lawsuit accusing it of borrowing Kisses' ""conical configuration"" without permission was in retaliation for its own lawsuit accusing Hershey of infringing its ""Tough Cookie"" mark.
Cookie Department said the teardrop it has used since 2009 merely depicts the ""universally known"" shape of a chocolate chip, and called Hershey's threatened lawsuit a ""strategic ploy"" to have it soften its stance in the Tough Cookie case.
It also called the Kisses marks ""inherently weak"" because the design and shape of Kisses are the same as those of chocolate and baking chips used worldwide since the 1940s.
The Berkeley-based cookie maker is seeking an order from a San Francisco federal judge that it has not infringed Hershey's intellectual property rights in Hershey's Kisses.
Hershey spokesman Jeff Beckman said the company does not discuss pending litigation.
The Tough Cookie lawsuit concerns Hershey's use of the phrase ""Tough Cookies Only"" on packaging for One protein bars. Cookie Department said a mediation is scheduled for Sept. 16.
Hershey, headquartered at 19 East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey, Pennsylvania, invented Hershey's Kisses in 1907, and according to court papers has had related trademark registrations since at least 1976.

It said average annual U.S. sales of Kisses products exceeded $490 million over the last five years.
The case is Cookie Department Inc v Hershey Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-06743.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) on Tuesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an Ohio court ruling that cleared the way for the state to move forward with a lawsuit over its diesel emissions scandal and manipulation of emissions-control systems.
The German automaker previously asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appeals court ruling that said two counties could seek diesel-related financial penalties that could total billions of dollars. That request is pending.
In June, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled 6-1 that the federal Clean Air Act did not pre-empt state law-based claims that Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost is pursuing, or prohibit state oversight after a vehicle or engine is sold, as VW contends.
""This is a major decision that will ensure that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) can be held accountable,"" Yost said in June.
VW said in court papers Ohio’s claims ""could total $350 million per day, or more than $127 billion per year, over a multi-year period.""
Ohio said VW engaged in “deceptive recalls” after vehicles were sold.
VW and supplier Robert Bosch LLC in January asked the U.S. high court to reverse a unanimous 9th Circuit Appeals Court ruling that said Utah’s Salt Lake County and Florida’s Hillsborough County could seek “staggering” damages over updates made to polluting diesel vehicles after they were sold.
The U.S. Supreme Court in April invited the Justice Department to offer its views on the issue. 
VW admitted in 2015 to secretly using illegal software to evade emissions rules, and pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

Volkswagen settled actions prompted by the emissions scandal for more than $20 billion, but that did not shield it from local and state government liability, the appeals court found.
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who ruled in VW’s favor in 2018, noted the automaker’s “potential penalties could reach $30.6 million per day and $11.2 billion per year” in the case involving the two counties.

Rivals CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co earlier this month had announced plans to make booster shots available at their stores, pending regulatory guidance.
U.S. health regulators have authorized a third dose of the vaccines made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for those with weak immune systems, and the government has said it plans to make booster doses available to more Americans in September. 
The need for boosters, however, has not yet been recommended by health regulators. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said it may be difficult to determine at this point whether immunity from prior vaccination is waning over time or if the vaccines are just less able to prevent infection by the highly-transmissible Delta variant.
Walmart, which runs one of the largest U.S. pharmacy chains, and its Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering the third dose to immunocompromised individuals.

Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in total liabilities, has been scrambling to raise the funds it needs to pay its many lenders and suppliers, with regulators and financial markets worried that any crisis could ripple through China's banking system.
Reporting first-half earnings on Tuesday, Evergrande said it would implement measures to improve cashflow, including adjusting project development timetables, renewing borrowings and disposing of equity interests and assets. But it cautioned that if it was not successful, it could default on borrowings and could see more litigation.
While net profit jumped on asset sales, its income that includes non-controlling interests slid 29%. In addition, its gross profit margin tumbled 12.9% in the first half from 25% a year ago due to a drop in sales prices and delivered area.
Citi analyst Griffin Chan said in a report he expects a loss in Evergrande's core property business for the full-year, and cut its earnings per share estimate for the next two years by 59% and 60% due to lower margin assumptions.
He also slashed its target price to HK$4 from HK$13.5.
Shares of the country's No. 2 developer fell as much as 2.5% in Tuesday morning trade to HK$4.25. The stock has lost more than 70% of its value this year.
The mid-price of Evergrande's 7.5% June 2023 dollar bond was last quoted at 36.92 cents by financial data provider Duration Finance, down nearly 2 cents. 

Its 6.98% July 22 exchange-traded puttable bond was the third-biggest loser among corporate bonds on Wednesday, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, falling 0.15% to 66.7 yuan.

(Reuters) - The U.S. rail regulator on Tuesday rejected a voting trust structure that would have allowed Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co to proceed with its $29 billion proposed acquisition of U.S. peer Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).
The decision, which the regulator said was made over antitrust concerns, was a blow to the deal that would create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States and Mexico.
The voting trust would temporarily own Kansas City Southern without Canadian National exerting control. It would have allowed Kansas City Southern shareholders to receive and keep the $325 per share in cash and stock that Canadian National was offering, even if the combination was subsequently rejected by the regulator, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB).
Canadian National said late on Tuesday it was disappointed with the regulator's decision and evaluating options available.
The STB said it left the door open for the companies to seek full review of their proposed merger. Regulatory experts said the process would be uncertain and could last more than a year. Kansas City Southern did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its next steps.
Kansas City Southern has an alternative suitor,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd, whose $25 billion deal to buy the company in March was later trumped later by Canadian National.
Canadian Pacific's proposed voting trust was approved in May, and this month the company presented a new $27 billion cash-and-stock bid for Kansas City Southern, confident the STB would reject Canadian National's voting trust.
Canadian Pacific said in a statement it had informed Kansas City Southern on Tuesday that its $300 cash-and-stock offer was still valid and would expire on Sept. 12 if Kansas City Southern had not yet recognized it as superior to its deal with Canadian National.
Kansas City Southern shares closed on Tuesday down 4.39% at $280.67. Canadian National shares closed up 7.36% at $148.40, indicating relief from shareholders that the acquisition now looks unlikely. Canadian Pacific shares dropped 4.55% to C$86.69, highlighting trepidation among its shareholders over paying up for a deal with Kansas City Southern.
After the STB decision, one of Canadian National's shareholders, hedge fund TCI Management Ltd, sent a letter to the company's board urging it to cancel its deal with Kansas City Southern and replace CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest with Jim Vena, a veteran of both Canadian National and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP). Vena could not be immediately reached for comment.
""The board must take responsibility for the company's recent underperformance and failure,"" TCI said in the letter. The fund, run by hedge fund veteran Chris Hohn, has a 5.2% stake in Canadian National and is also Canadian Pacific's largest shareholder.
The STB said that even though the overlap of Canadian National's and Kansas City Southern's networks was confined to 70 miles between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, the two railways operated parallel lines in the central portion of the United States and could be under less pressure to compete if the voting trust was approved.
""The Board finds that applicants have not demonstrated that their use of a voting trust would be consistent with the public interest"" the STB said https://prod.stb.gov/news-communications/latest-news/pr-21-37 in its ruling. It added that it was not making a final determination on whether the competitive issues that the deal faced could be resolved.

President Joe Biden has issued sweeping executive orders aimed at promoting competition in the U.S. economy. One order encouraged the STB to consider Amtrak's statutory rights when assessing whether a rail merger is in the public interest.
Passenger railroad Amtrak, majority owned by the U.S. government, had opposed the Canadian National's voting trust, saying its pledge to divest the Baton Rouge to New Orleans line will harm future passenger service in Louisiana.

550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",Evergrande’s Total Liabilities Swell to Over $300 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- On the face of it, China Evergrande Group made progress cutting its debt load in the first half of the year. On closer examination, paying its dues got even harder.
Evergrande’s total liabilities including bills owed to suppliers rose to 1.97 trillion yuan ($305 billion) as of June 30, near a record high, results showed Tuesday. While its borrowings shrank to 572 billion yuan, the group’s cash and cash equivalents plunged to a six-year low. 
The upshot: Evergrande will need to accelerate asset sales and continue to aggressively discount apartment prices to generate enough cash to meet its obligations. The world’s most indebted developer is all too aware of what’s at stake, saying it risks defaulting on borrowings if its all-out effort falls short.
“Now it’s at a critical point,” said Chuanyi Zhou, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics. “If asset sales and introduction of new investors don’t progress well and meet the government’s expectation, a default is likely to happen, possibly followed by an out-of-court arrangement with creditors.”
Evergrande said it’s exploring the sale of interests in its listed electric vehicle and property services units, as well as other assets, and seeking to bring in new investors and renew borrowings. Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) discounts to swiftly offload apartments cut into margins in the first half, helping push net income down 29% to 10.5 billion yuan ($1.6 billion), in line with an earlier profit warning.
“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” the Shenzhen-based company said in the statement. “Shareholders and potential investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the securities of the group.”
 
Evergrande’s 8.25% dollar due in March fell 1.1 cent on the dollar to 43.7 cents on Wednesday morning, according to Bloomberg-compiled data, on pace for a fresh record low. Its shares fell as much as 2.5% in Hong Kong, taking this year’s decline to 71%. 
“Evergrande’s gross margin could compress further on the potential fire sale of its properties,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Patrick Wong and Lisa Zhou. The gauge of profitability is the lowest among major developers tracked by BI due to aggressive promotions and price cuts, they wrote in a note. 
With banks, suppliers and homebuyers exposed to the real estate giant, any collapse could roil China’s economy, raising questions over whether it might receive state support. Regulators urged Evergrande to resolve its debt woes in a rare public rebuke earlier this month. 
Evergrande said some property development payables were overdue, leading to the suspension of work on some projects. The company is negotiating with suppliers and construction contractors to resume the work, it added. 
“The group will do its utmost to continue its operations and endeavor to deliver properties to customers as scheduled,” it said. Evergrande’s trade and other payables climbed 15% from six months earlier to a record 951.1 billion yuan, the results showed.
The company still falls short on two of China’s so-called three red lines -- metrics imposed on developers as part of a crackdown on leverage in the industry. It has pledged to meet all three by December 2022. 
One measure -- the ratio of cash to short-term borrowings, a gauge of liquidity -- worsened in the period to 36% from 47% at the end of last year, as its cash and equivalents plunged to the lowest in six years, Bloomberg calculations based on the results show.

(Reuters) - Wall Street finished marginally lower on Tuesday, although the slightly subdued ending to August failed to detract from a strong monthly performance by its three main indexes, in what is traditionally regarded as a quiet period for equities.
Having all posted lifetime highs in the second half of the month, including four record closings in five sessions for the S&P 500 prior to Tuesday, the three benchmarks were weighed by technology stocks on the final day.
For the S&P, which rose 2.9% in August, it was a seventh straight month of gains, while the Dow and the Nasdaq advanced 1.2% and 4%, respectively, since the end of July.
The performance reflects the level of investor confidence in U.S. equities derived from the Federal Reserve's continued dovish tone toward tapering its massive stimulus program.
""After all the monetary and fiscal interventions, the question is where do we go from here? Does the S&P go to 5,000, and how does it get there?"" said Eric Metz, chief executive officer of SpringRock Advisors.
While a strong recovery in economic growth and corporate earnings have boosted U.S. stocks, investors are concerned about rising coronavirus cases and the path of Fed policy.
U.S. consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in August, according to survey data from the Conference Board on Tuesday, offering a cautious note for the economic outlook.
A Reuters poll last week showed strategists believe the S&P 500 is likely to end 2021 not far from its current level.
""Where's leadership going to come from, for equities to power higher? Is it earnings growth, is it growth versus value, technology or energy? This needs to be defined, but I think the next leg-up for equities will be sector driven,"" Metz added.
Technology stocks have continued to garner interest from investors in recent days, given the benefits which lower rates have on their future earnings, although the sector's index was among the worst performers on Tuesday. 
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 0.8% after hitting a lifetime high in the previous session, while  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc tumbled 16.7% as it signaled a faster-than-expected easing in demand for its video-conferencing service after a pandemic-driven boom.
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors retreated. Among those that did not were the real estate and the communications services indexes, which closed at record highs.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.11 points, or 0.11%, to 35,360.73, the S&P 500 lost 6.11 points, or 0.13%, to 4,522.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.66 points, or 0.04%, to 15,259.24.
Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) dropped 4.4% in afternoon trading after the U.S. rail regulator rejected a voting trust structure that would have allowed Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co to proceed with its $29 billion proposed acquisition of its U.S. peer.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.84 billion shares, compared with the 8.98 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

By Abhijith Ganapavaram and Chris Kahn
(Reuters) - Public support for stronger measures to require COVID vaccinations is strong, according to a new Reuters/IPSOS poll, but for Detroit automakers the debate over vaccination policy is far from over. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Thursday it has required its U.S. salaried employees to report whether they have received COVID-19 shots, the first such action by one of Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers.
GM said the information will help ""determine when GM should relax or strengthen certain COVID-19 safety protocols as recommended by the CDC and OSHA, such as mask wearing, physical distancing and facility occupancy rates,"" referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration.
Separately, United Auto Workers President Ray Curry on Thursday expressed support for only voluntary measures to encourage vaccination or survey workers' vaccination status. 
The UAW, with nearly 400,000 members, represents U.S. factory workers at GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Stellantis NV as well as workers at other U.S. manufacturers, colleges, government agencies and casinos. 
""We would be open to discussion about voluntary efforts,"" Curry said during a videoconference on Thursday. 
Steps such as GM's plan to gather information about employees' vaccination status would be subject to bargaining before they could be applied to UAW workers, Curry said. Such data collection would raise medical privacy concerns, he said.
Likewise, Curry said the UAW would expect companies to negotiate before following the example of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which said it will charge unvaccinated employees https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/delta-add-200-monthly-health-insurance-charge-unvaccinated-staff-2021-08-25 an extra $200 a month for company health coverage.
""We have not had an employer reach out to discuss with us"" a vaccine mandate or a penalty for workers who are not vaccinated, Curry said.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds support for employer vaccination requirements.
The poll found that 60% of adults support employers who require people to show a proof of vaccination before allowing them to return to the office, while 34% oppose vaccine requirements. The poll, conducted from Aug. 13 to 19, gathered responses from 4,427 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
About two-thirds of American adults support mask requirements in restaurants, airplanes, gyms and the workplace, while less than one-third oppose them, the poll found.
Detroit automakers have reinstated masking requirements in their factories as the Delta variant of the coronavirus has spread. But they have so far not proposed broad measures to require vaccinations.
GM has about 48,000 salaried workers in the United States, as per its annual regulatory filing. 

""GM earlier this month implemented an expanded vaccination status reporting process that was mandatory for all U.S. salaried employees. We gathered this information via a confidential online tool,"" the company said in a statement.
Ford is requiring salaried staff who travel internationally to get vaccinated. ""We are currently assessing whether we need to expand the requirement,"" the company said in a statement.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have signaled to the bank they are not satisfied with its progress, including the bank's attempts to improve its governance and risk controls, the report said. 
Wells Fargo's stock fell 5.6% on the news.
Representatives from the OCC and the CFPB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wells Fargo declined to comment. 
The bank, the fourth-largest in the United States, has been dogged by persistent costs and restrictions tied to its years-old sales practice scandals. Employees opened some 3.5 million phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission to artificially hit internal sales targets. 
In 2016, Wells reached a $190 million settlement with the CFPB, the OCC and a Los Angeles prosecutor over the practice.
In 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered that Wells Fargo keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved governance and risk controls, and it entered into a sweeping consent order with the OCC related to selling of mortgage and auto-insurance products. 
The bank has sought more time to resolve the issues raised by the consent orders, according to Bloomberg. 

The asset cap has constrained the bank's ability to make loans or grow, its executives said in July. Further sanctions could hurt the bank's growth prospects.
It was not clear when regulators might proceed, Bloomberg reported.

Zoom and other video conferencing services such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)'s Slack raked in millions of new users as the pandemic forced people to work, study and communicate with friends and family remotely.
With easing pandemic curbs, Zoom will need to find new avenues for growth. The company already made a $14.7 billion bet on Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) in July to bolster its contact center business.
Analysts said it would take a few quarters for Zoom to return to its true underlying growth rate.
""There are significant questions outstanding regarding how new customer demand and customer churn rates will stabilize in the core business following the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions,"" analysts at Daiwa Capital wrote in a note.
Zoom forecast current-quarter revenue between $1.015 billion and $1.020 billion on Monday, indicating a rise of about 31%, compared with multiple-fold growth rates in 2020. 
(GRAPHIC: Zoom's revenue growth set to slow further - https://graphics.reuters.com/ZOOM-RESULTS/lbvgnnyekpq/chart_eikon.jpg) 
At least six brokerages cut their price targets on Zoom, according to Refinitiv data, with Piper Sandler being the most bearish - slashing its price target by over $100 to $369.

Shares of the company fell by the most in more than nine months to close at $289.50 on Tuesday. 
The company's shares rallied to stratospheric highs since February last year, with its valuation touching $175 billion in October. Since then, the shares have eased and Zoom's current capitalization is half of the October peak.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 05:43PM ET</span>",Explainer-Why and how China is drastically limiting online gaming for under 18s,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday introduced new rules that limit the amount of time under-18s can spend on video games to three hours a week, a move it said was necessary to combat gaming addiction.
The new rules place the onus on implementation on the gaming industry and are not laws per se that would punish individuals for infractions. 
WHY IS CHINA CONCERNED ABOUT GAMING ADDICTION?
Authorities in China, the world's largest video games market, have worried for years about addiction to gaming and the internet among young people, setting up clinics which combine therapy and military drills for those with so-called ""gaming disorders"". 
Rising rates of nearsightedness were also cited as a concern in 2018. 
The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the regulator which approves video game titles, said on Monday the new rules were a response to growing concern that games affected the physical and mental health of children. 
About 62.5% of Chinese minors often play games online, and 13.2% of underage mobile game users play mobile games for more than two hours a day on weekdays, according to state media.
Chinese regulators have also targeted the private tutoring industry and what they see as celebrity worship in recent weeks, citing the need to ensure the wellbeing of children.
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR? 
In 2017, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) said it would limit play time for some young users of its flagship mobile game ""Honor of Kings"", a response to complaints from parents and teachers that children were becoming addicted. 
A year later, citing concerns over growing rates of myopia, Beijing said it was looking at potential measures to restrict game play by children and suspended video game approvals for nine months. 
In 2019, it passed laws limiting minors to less than 1.5 hours of online games on weekdays and three hours on weekends, with no game playing allowed between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. It also limited how much minors could spend on virtual gaming items each month, with maximum amounts ranging from $28 to $57, depending on the age. 
In addition, minors were required to use their real names and national identification numbers when they logged on to play and companies like Tencent and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) set up systems to identify minors. 
In July, Tencent rolled out a facial recognition function dubbed ""midnight patrol"" that parents can switch on to prevent children from using adult logins to get around the government curfew.
WHAT ARE THE NEW CURBS AND HOW WILL CHINA ENFORCE THEM?
The new restrictions forbid children under 18 to play online games from Monday through Thursday, effective Sept. 1. They can only play for one hour, between 8 and 9 p.m., on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. 
Online gaming companies must ensure they have put real name verification systems in place, and all titles will eventually need to be connected to an anti-addiction system being set up by the NPPA. 
NPPA told state news agency Xinhua http://www.xinhuanet.com/healthpro/20210831/288989aaf0f340dea4dc07881f27c766/c.html it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections of online gaming companies to ensure time limits were put in place.

The regulator will also step up measures to punish gaming firms that violate the rules and has increased penalties given after inspections, noting that more than 10,000 gaming titles were reviewed last year. 
It noted minors could still use their parents' accounts to bypass the restrictions and said parents and schools also need to step up supervision.

561,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 05:02PM ET</span>","Stocks notch seven straight months of gains, dollar flat","By Herbert Lash and Tommy Wilkes
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -A gauge of global equities posted its seventh consecutive month of gains and a record closing high on Tuesday, but stocks and the dollar mostly ended the day little changed after U.S. and Chinese economic data suggested slower growth ahead. 
Markets were subdued in quiet end-of-summer trading as investors wait for a U.S. jobs report for August on Friday that could shape how soon the Federal Reserve begins to withdraw its support of the economy when it begins to taper bond buying.
Data on Tuesday wasn't inspiring. U.S. consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in August as soaring COVID-19 infections and rising inflation dampened the economic outlook, a view that data from China, Canada and the EU also implied. 
China's businesses and the broader economy came under increased pressure in August as factory activity expanded at a slower pace and the services sector slumped into contraction. In Canada, the economy unexpectedly shrank 1.1% in the second quarter on an annualized basis. 
The Delta variant has cast a shadow on U.S. consumer optimism, which had soared earlier in the year on expectations coronavirus vaccines would bring a return to normalcy, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
""Consumers are increasingly aware of the near-term risks to the economic recovery created by rising prices and the COVID-19 resurgence,"" Baird said in a note. But confidence is relatively high and consistent with solid consumer spending, he said.
Investors are taking some risk off the table after the U.S. and Chinese economies, the world's two largest, showed signs of short-term weakness, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange brokerage OANDA. 
""The Delta variant's impact on the U.S. economy might be greater than initially anticipated and that won't bode well for third-quarter spending,"" he said.
Markets mostly shrugged off a surge in euro zone inflation to a 10-year high in August, with further rises likely, as the European Central Bank's narrative of temporary inflation and ultra-easy policy for years remained intact.
MSCI's all-country world index eked out a third straight record closing high, ending up 0.06% at 741.27, and also made August its seventh month of consecutive gains. 
The STOXX Europe 600 closed down 0.38% but the broad pan-European index notched its seventh straight month of gains in its best monthly winning streak since 2013. Technology was the best performing European sector in August, up 6% on several strong earnings reports.
On Wall Street, stocks seesawed near breakeven. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11%, the S&P 500 slid 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.04%.
Stocks in emerging markets jumped, with MSCI's EM index rising 1.78%.
Value fell slightly less than growth stocks, a change from Monday when technology shares jumped after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated last week that interest rates would remain low well past the date the Fed begins to taper its buying of bonds.
The dollar slipped to its lowest level in more than three weeks against a basket of currencies as investors awaited U.S. jobs data on Friday that could shape future Fed monetary policy. The greenback later pared losses to trade little changed.
The dollar index fell 0.05% to 92.6550, while the euro rose 0.09% at $1.1809. The yen traded up 0.09% at $110.0100. 
U.S. Treasury yields rebounded after earlier easing a bit following the U.S. consumer confidence data. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 2.6 basis points to yield 1.3104%. 
Benchmark German bond yields rose to the highest in more than five weeks after a higher-than-expected inflation reading and an ECB policymaker called on the bank to reduce its emergency bond purchases as soon as the fourth quarter.
Germany's 10-year bund yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, rose as high as -0.376%.
Oil slipped as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies geared up for a meeting on Wednesday amid calls from the United States to pump more crude, though Brent still traded well above $70 a barrel. 
Brent futures fell 42 cents to settle at $72.99 a barrel. U.S. crude settled down 71 cents at $68.50 a barrel.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.3% at $1,818.10 an ounce.
Asian shares overnight broadly recovered. MSCI's gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan gained 1.6%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 bounced back to rise 1.1% despite weak July industrial output data.

So, it could be wise to bet on ETFs such as the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ), iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP), and Invesco DWA Basic Materials Momentum ETF (PYZ) as they are expected to continue gaining even if inflation persists.While solid second-quarter corporate earnings reports helped the major stock indexes soar, the market has been volatile lately due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and an inflationary environment. At the Jackson Hole economic symposium, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that high inflation is ‘temporary.’
However, the inflation rate for the 12 months that ended July came in at 4.2%, the highest rate since the first Gulf War in 1991. Moreover, according to the Labor Department data, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July, representing the largest jump since August 2008. Also, the producer price inflation (PPI) rose 7.8% for the 12 months that ended July, higher than economists’ expectations. While high inflation poses a threat for some industries, several industries are less susceptible to the consequences and benefit from rising inflation.

So, we believe natural gas ETFs United States Natural Gas (UNG) and United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund (UNL) could be wiser bets to capitalize on the rising gasoline prices. Read on.Gas prices have already risen over 80% from their low point in April 2020, when the pandemic halted industrial and economic activity. However, natural gas demand has already bounced back as industrial activity resumes, while extreme weather this year is leading to even more demand. As a result, gas prices have shot up by 41% since last August. Moreover, natural gas futures rallied last week, recording their highest finish for the first time since late 2018 as summer heat intensified concerns about tight supplies later.
Furthermore, supplies and production could temporarily get affected by the hurricane Ida, which swept across the Gulf of Mexico, impacting about 15% of the U.S. total. Of course, it's not helping that other parts of the country are dealing with a heatwave and many expect a cold winter.

""We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal - leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple,"" Apple said in a statement.
But the South Korean move raises the stakes for Apple and Google who face similar legislation in the United States that was introduced earlier this month by a bipartisan trio of senators.
""It's time the U.S. follow suit to reduce Big Tech's app store influence. I urge Congress to swiftly pass my bill with Senators Blumenthal and Klobuchar that will help ensure fair competition for innovative startups,"" said Senator Marsha Blackburn in a statement.
Based on South Korean parliament records, the amendment bans app store operators with dominant market positions from forcing payment systems on content providers and ""inappropriately"" delaying the review of, or deleting, mobile content from app
markets. 
It also allows the South Korean government to require an app market operator to ""prevent damage to users and protect the rights and interests of users"", probe app market operators, and mediate disputes regarding payment, cancellations or refunds in the app market. 
""Today's historic action and bold leadership by South Korean lawmakers mark a monumental step in the fight for a fair app ecosystem. The legislation passed today by the Assembly will put an end to mandatory in-app purchase in South Korea, which will allow innovation, consumer choice, and competition to thrive in this market,"" a spokesperson at Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which owns the popular dating app Tinder, said in a statement. 
The Korea Internet Corporations Association, a nonprofit group representing Korean IT firms, also welcomed parliament's decision. 

""We hope that the passage of this bill will ensure the rights of creators and developers, and create a fair app ecosystem, where users can enjoy diverse contents at lower prices.""
Apple on Thursday agreed to loosen App Store restrictions for small developers, allowing developers to promote payment options outside Apple's payment system.

In the filing, Allbirds said it hopes to help pioneer a framework to conduct the first-ever ""sustainable public equity offering,"" a process the retailer set up with an advisory group that shows it meets environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.
Allbirds said that as part of its IPO process sustainability ratings firm ISS ESG assessed whether it met the criteria for a sustainable public equity offering.
The footwear company set up the process with an advisory council hosted by sustainable business organization BSR, one of its investors and ESG ratings agencies. 
Other sustainability-focused startups that recently tapped into capital markets include Hollywood star Jessica Alba's Honest Co and Oprah Winfrey-backed Oatly Group (NASDAQ:OTLY) AB. Plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods is looking at a number of ways to go public, Reuters reported in April.
Allbirds is also a certified B corp and public benefit corporation, which allow its board to balance generating returns for shareholders and conserving the environment.
Founded by co-Chief Executive Officers Joseph Zwillinger and Timothy Brown, a former New Zealand soccer player, Allbirds is known for the use of sustainable materials in its products.
Brown researched and tinkered with the properties of merino wool and eventually teamed up with Zwillinger to craft a fabric made specifically for footwear. 
Allbirds, whose backers include Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, also uses a plant-based alternative to leather for its shoes. It has also partnered with Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) to create a range of sustainable sneakers.

The company reported a more than 25% jump in net revenue for the first six months of 2021, while net loss widened to $21.1 million during the period.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities are lead underwriters on the offering.

571,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 03:43PM ET</span>","Spirits, Soup, Payroll Reports: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Stocks fell back but were still trading near their record highs on Tuesday, wrapping up a strong August with S&P 500 on track for a seventh straight month of gains.
The S&P would mark its longest winning streak since 2018, adding a 3% gain in August.
A resilient economy and solid corporate earnings for the latest period have lifted U.S. stocks even though investors continue to be wary about the stage of the pandemic and the direction of monetary policy.
August payrolls data due to be released later in the week could set the tone for trading in September, when the Fed will once again meet to discuss the state of the economy.
U.S. consumer confidence tumbled to a six-month low in August on concern the spike in Covid cases linked to the Delta variant would throw cold water on the recovery. 
The Conference Board’s survey, released Tuesday, said consumers were less positive about the labor market and less inclined to buy a home, a vehicle, or a major household item. If that turns out to be the case, consumer spending will cool off this quarter after two successive quarters of big growth.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Spirit giant reports
Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb), the maker of Jack Daniels whiskey and Finlandia vodka, is expected to announce its first-quarter earnings per share of 39 cents on revenue of $830.12 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Soup earnings
Pantry staple  Campbell Soup  Company (NYSE:CPB) is seen posting revenue of $1.81 billion and earnings per share of 47 cents for the fourth quarter.
3. ADP report
Job creation at private companies is likely to have roared back in August from the meek gain that happened in the prior month, according to expectations about the data to be released Wednesday from payroll processing firm ADP.
Employers added 613,000 positions for the month, a spike from July’s 330,000 which was also the smallest gain since February. The report comes out at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT).

We think fundamentally sound stocks BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Silvercrest Asset Management (SAMG), with high yields and stable payouts, could be solid additions to one’s retirement portfolio now. Let’s discuss.The Fed is expected to keep the interest rates at near-zero levels until 2023 because Fed Chairman Powell anticipates that there’s “much ground to cover” for employment to reach pre-pandemic levels. However, with the bank’s bond tapering expected to begin later this year, and with declining Treasury yields, investing in dividend stocks is ideal now for investors planning for retirement.
Given the increased demand for dividend stocks, many companies are undertaking robust payouts to attract investors. The  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS) expects aggregate dividend payouts for the S&P 500 index will grow 6% this year and in the following year. Dividend payouts increased 26% year-over-year to $471.70 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, with 84% of the companies improving or maintaining their dividends versus prior-year quarter values. Total dividends paid to investors is expected to reach $1.39 trillion in 2021.
In this scenario, we think high-yield dividend stocks BHP Group Ltd. (BHP) and Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc. (SAMG) are expected to be ideal bets for retirement planning.

(Reuters) - The damage to Louisiana's power grid from Hurricane Ida is so extensive that the U.S. Coast Guard has joined the task of assessing the wreckage, a departure from its maritime security duties. 
More than 1 million homes and businesses along the U.S. Gulf Coast are without power following Ida's landfall late Sunday. The storm destroyed transmission lines up and down the Mississippi River, including one large tower that collapsed near Avondale, Louisiana, leaving a conductor from an electrical line in the river itself. 
""Where and how the tower fell, and the assessment on how we can deal with it has yet to be made,"" a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman told Reuters. The Coast Guard joined the effort because of the potential hazard to navigation. 
 Entergy Corp  (NYSE:ETR) is developing plans for crews to pull the transmission conductor from the river and had a team at the site on Tuesday, the company said. 
The Coast Guard, which aids in security for ports and waterways, said its involvement only extends to overseeing the tower's safe and timely salvage. 
Nearly 800,000 Louisiana homes and businesses served by Entergy are without power. The company said the winds damaged some generating plants in the New Orleans area. Some customers may be without power for several weeks as Entergy assesses damage and seeks to restore service, though some 85,000 customers have already had their lights turned back on, it said.
""The priority is to police stations, fire stations, hospitals in particular given the COVID dynamic, and assisted living facilities,"" Rod West, Entergy's group president for utility operations, said late Monday in an interview. 
Ida's high winds dealt a severe blow to the state's grid, knocking out power for facilities that generate power themselves including Waterford-3, an Entergy-owned nuclear power generator that disconnected from the grid as a safety measure ahead of the storm. The plant was still running on backup diesel as it focuses on ""restoring offsite power,"" the company said Tuesday.
Numerous chemical plants, refineries and other facilities were also without power. Refiners are ""a higher priority for us. A lot of it is going to depend on their ability to safely take power,"" West said. 
Agricultural giant  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) originally estimated that its Destrehan, Louisiana grain facility would reopen on Tuesday, but with numerous trees and power lines down, the company couldn't fully assess the damage yet, a spokeswoman said late Monday. 

Power officials have told leaders in Jefferson Parish in the New Orleans area that its roughly 440,000 people could be without electricity for a month or longer, said councilman Deano Bonano.
""The damage from this is far worse than Katrina from a wind standpoint,"" said Bonano. ""We are going to be without power for four to six weeks.""

Let’s discuss.With a strong propensity for mutation and vaccine resistance, coronavirus has remained one of the biggest threats to the global economy since last year. The highly transmissible Delta variant has resulted in reduced vaccine efficacy, highlighting the need for “booster shots.” Chief Medical Advisor to President Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci, recently observed that the United States could emerge from the pandemic by spring 2022, extending his earlier projection that the country could control the virus outbreak by summer this year.
Last week, the FDA gave its full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, paving the way for greater vaccine mandates as schools, universities, and businesses gradually reopen. The U.S. is now gearing up to r distribute COVID-19 booster shots nationwide beginning in September.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines on Tuesday said it would hire 1,500 new flight attendants in anticipation of an increase in demand for air travel next summer.
The announcement comes as many airlines struggle to keep up with a recovery in air travel and are grappling with staff shortages.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) last week said it would run fewer flights through the end of the year as a result of a staffing crunch, which disrupted its operations this summer and led to flight delays and cancellations.
Delta Air, too, had to cancel about 100 flights in April due to staff shortages. But a company spokesperson said the airline's operations since have been relatively smooth.
In July, the carrier's average daily departures totaled 4,377 compared with 2,009 in April.
Including the 1,500 flight attendants hired in early 2020 before the pandemic, Delta aims to have 3,000 new flight attendants to support operations next summer. It is also hiring 1,200 pilots.
""The need here is to support future flying,"" the spokesperson said.

Since May, Delta Air has made full vaccination a condition of employment for new hires. On Tuesday, it reiterated that policy, saying all new hires, including current Delta employees who have been accepted into the training program for flight attendants, must be fully vaccinated before their training start date.
Last week, the company said employees who choose not to be vaccinated will have to pay $200 extra per month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan.

(Reuters) - European stocks fell on Tuesday as a spike in inflation caused jitters about a possible shift in monetary policy, but nevertheless rose nearly 2% in August on strong quarterly earnings and optimism over an economic recovery. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.4% lower, but marked a seventh straight month of gains in its best monthly winning streak since 2013. 
Technology was the best performing sector in August, up 6% on several strong earnings, while a rise in global COVID-19 cases also pushed investors into sectors most resilient to the pandemic. 
Regional stocks had shed early gains on Tuesday after data showed inflation surged to a 10-year high in August, with further rises likely challenging the European Central Bank's (ECB) benign view on price growth.
Robert Holzmann, governor of Austria's central bank, also sent some shivers through the market when he called on the ECB to start tapering bond purchases.
Concerns about tapering, along with some month-end selling, pulled European stocks away from near record highs. 
Basic resources stocks were the worst performers in August, down 4.2% as wild swings in metal prices saw investors pull out of the sector, which has otherwise performed well through the year. 
But strong earnings and a relatively high rate of vaccination have boosted European recovery hopes, while the U.S. Federal Reserve's remarks last week reaffirmed views it was in no rush to tighten monetary policy.
""We're still riding the Powell wave,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""On the China side, it's worth noting that it's been priced in for a while. While the data is quite weak, the situation has evolved over the last couple of weeks,"" Erlam said.

Meanwhile, data showed German unemployment fell more than expected in August.
The country's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) extended their lead over Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, according to a latest poll published on Monday, just weeks ahead of a general election.
Analysts expect European stocks to hold around current record levels for the rest of 2021, supported by stellar earnings, while worries around U.S. monetary policy tightening, German elections and a Chinese regulatory crackdown will cap gains.

Among stocks, Dutch technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV rose 6.4% after it said it had agreed to buy Indian payments platform BillDesk for $4.7 billion.
Travel and leisure stocks fell 0.7% after European Union governments agreed to remove the United States from the EU's safe travel list.

While this should benefit many cybersecurity companies, some stocks in this space are trading at lofty valuations. Indeed, Wall Street analysts expect overvalued cybersecurity stocks Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) to witness a price pullback in the near term. So, we think these names are best avoided now. Read on.As organizations rapidly adopted the digital ways of doing business amid the pandemic, the need to protect client data and prevent cyber-attackers from gaining access to the system has led to rising investments in cybersecurity infrastructure. According to the  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) 2021 CIO Agenda Survey, 61% of the more than 2,000 CIOs surveyed are expected to increase cyber/information security investment this year.
Due to the increase in ransomware attacks and growing incidents of cybercrimes, several organizations are spending large amounts on cybersecurity to strengthen their security and protect critical data. The global cybersecurity market is expected to reach $345.4 billion by 2026, registering a 9.7% CAGR from 2021 - 2026.
However, not all cybersecurity companies are expected to benefit from the industry tailwinds. Wall Street analysts believe cybersecurity stocks Zscaler, Inc. (ZS) and Qualys, Inc.

593,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Campari says imitation is flattery as Aperol faces challengers,"By Francesca Landini
VENICE (Reuters) - Italian drinks group Campari sees plenty of room for growth from its best-selling beverage Aperol and is not worried about the threat from competitors, including a new spritz cocktail launched by LVMH's Moet Hennessy.
In an interview with Reuters at the opening of the first flagship bar for Aperol in Venice, Campari Chief Executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz said the group is confident the bright orange aperitif could continue to grow by double digits over the years and attract new customers among beer drinkers.
Kunze-Concewitz also said the group's strategy is still to expand through acquisitions and that in the medium to long term the group aims to secure big deals.
Campari bought Aperol in 2003 when the aperitif was drunk only in the Veneto region of Italy and its sales were less than 50 million euros ($59 million) a year.
In 18 years Campari has developed a global brand by marketing Aperol as the main ingredient for the spritz cocktail. The beverage currently accounts for around one-fifth of Campari's nearly 2 billion annual sales and is considered by financial analysts as the group's engine of growth, with other brands including Campari bitter and Grand Marnier liqueur recording a more volatile trend of growth.
""There is a huge opportunity still ahead of us on Aperol growth,"" said Kunze-Concewitz, adding that comparing data on per-capita consumption of beer and Aperol shows that the drink can win many more consumers around the world and even in Italy. 
Between 2004 and 2019 Aperol's sales grew 16.5% on average every year. A pause in growth in 2020 due to the pandemic created some doubts the drink had reached a plateau.
However, Campari results in the first half of this year have marked a return to double-digit growth also versus 2019. 
""We have developed a long-term marketing model which ensures that we constantly have double-digit growth rates for Aperol,"" the CEO said, adding that in Italy the group is now introducing Aperol as a beverage to go with meals rather than just an aperitif.
After the opening in Venice, other cities outside Italy will host a Terrazza Aperol in the future as a way to make the brand even more visible, the CEO said. 
Success has triggered imitations, with LVMH's wine and spirits division Moet Hennessy launching a ready-to-drink concoction called Chandon Garden Spritz. 
""I am not worried (about imitations). As long as the new entrants are premium and come from high-end groups they will broaden the overall aperitif category,"" Kunze-Concewitz said, adding that ""imitation is the greatest form of flattery"".
""It is not only a question of trying to get some sort of orange liquid into a bottle. It is about quality. No one can really compete with us on taste"".
Moet Hennessy launched the new drink in France in May and plans to sell it in Italy next year.
Despite competing on aperitifs, Campari and Moet clinched an alliance to develop an e-commerce platform for wine and spirits in July around Italy's Tannico and they will support it through acquisitions in Europe, the Campari CEO said.
BIG DEALS
The Italian group, which has proven successful in buying and reviving heritage brands, continues to scout for acquisitions even if multiples and prices of potential targets remain high.
Campari's CEO said the pandemic did not change the M&A landscape in the spirits sector, adding that low interest rates mean abundant liquidity and high multiples.
The group, however, is confident of finding good deals.
""Returning cash to investors is possible in theory, but we have plenty of ideas, we think we can do interesting acquisitions in the medium to long term horizon,"" the CEO said.
Kunze-Concewitz expects a consolidation in the spirits sector and says the group is getting ready for big deals after it moved its registered office to the Netherlands last year to introduce an enhanced loyalty share scheme. 
""We have gained much more flexibility in our financial structure, this will allow us, if an opportunity arises, to issue equity to finance bigger deals while still allowing the current majority shareholder to keep control,"" he said.

Campari is majority-owned by the Luxembourg-based holding company of Italy's Garavoglia family. Kunze-Concewitz said the Garavoglia family had turned down offers to sell the group, noting that Campari has offered a high return to investors so far.

With sentiment in the toilet and many investors disgusted with their precious metals holdings and some leaving the space altogether, it’s not surprising that we’re now hearing lots of chatter about Q3 2020 being the peak for metals and that we’re starting a new bear market. However, one look at the Silver/Gold ratio suggests differently, given that it’s acting completely different from the last bull market peak. As shown below, the 2011 peak saw the price of gold race to new highs in Q2 and early Q3, while silver was unable to make a new high, sending the Silver/Gold ratio plunging from a reading of 0.30 to 0.22. This significant underperformance in silver is never a good sign, and it suggested that we were likely at the tail end of a bull market, with the ratio making a lower high and a lower low just as gold made its new highs above $1,900/oz.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 11:01AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Biden administration aims to cut costs for solar, wind projects on public land","By Nichola Groom and Valerie Volcovici
LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration plans to make federal lands cheaper to access for solar and wind power developers after the clean power industry argued in a lobbying push this year that lease rates and fees are too high to draw investment and could torpedo the president's climate change agenda.
Washington’s decision to review the federal land policy for renewable power projects is part of a broader effort by President Joe Biden's government to fight global warming by boosting clean energy development and discouraging drilling and coal mining.
“We recognize the world has changed since the last time we looked at this and updates need to be made,” Janea Scott, senior counselor to the U.S. Interior Department’s assistant secretary for land and minerals, told Reuters.
On Tuesday, the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced it has initiated a process to revise regulations related to renewable energy permitting and rights-of-way on public lands starting with four public listening sessions in September and a separate consultation with Native American tribes. 
The sessions will focus on rent lease schedules and fees for wind and solar rights-of-way, application processing times and environmental justice considerations.
The push for easier access to vast federal lands also underscores the renewable energy industry’s voracious need for new acreage: Biden has a goal to decarbonize the power sector by 2035, a target that would require an area bigger than the Netherlands for the solar industry alone, according to research firm Rystad Energy.
At issue is a rental rate and fee scheme for federal solar and wind leases designed to keep rates in line with nearby agricultural land values.
Under that policy, implemented by President Barack Obama's administration in 2016, some major solar projects pay $971 per acre per year in rent, along with over $2,000 annually per megawatt of power capacity. 
For a utility-scale project covering 3,000 acres and producing 250 megawatts of power, that is a roughly $3.5 million tab each year.
Wind project rents are generally lower, but the capacity fee is higher at $3,800, according to a federal fee schedule.
The renewable energy industry argues the charges imposed by the Interior Department are out of sync with private land rents, which can be below $100 per acre, and do not come with fees for power produced. 
They are also higher than federal rents for oil and gas drilling leases, which run at $1.50 or $2 per year per acre before being replaced by a 12.5% production royalty once petroleum starts to flow.
""Until these overly burdensome costs are resolved, our nation will likely miss out on living up to its potential to deploy homegrown clean energy projects on our public lands — and the jobs and economic development that come with it,"" said Gene Grace, general counsel for clean energy trade group American Clean Power Association.
The renewable energy industry has historically relied on private acreage to site large projects. But big tracts of unbroken private land are becoming scarce, making federal lands among the best options for future expansion.
To date, the Interior Department has permitted less than 10 gigawatts of solar and wind power on its more than 245 million acres (99 million hectares) of federal lands, a third of what the two industries were forecast to install nationwide just this year, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The solar industry began lobbying on the issue in April, when the Large Scale Solar Association, a coalition of some of the nation’s top solar developers - including NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE),  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) and EDF (PA:EDF) Renewables - filed a petition with the Bureau of Land Management asking for lower rents on utility-scale projects in the nation’s blistering deserts.
A spokesperson for the group said the industry initially focused on California because it is home to some of the most promising solar acreage and because land around major urban areas like Los Angeles had inflated assessments for entire counties, even on desert acreage not suitable for agriculture.
Officials at NextEra, Southern, and EDF did not comment when contacted by Reuters.
In June, the BLM lowered rents in three California counties. But solar representatives called the measure insufficient, arguing the discounts were too small and that the megawatt capacity fee remained in place. 

Attorneys for both the solar companies and BLM have discussed the issue in phone calls since, and further talks are scheduled for September, according to Peter Weiner, the attorney representing the solar group.
""We know that the new folks at BLM have had a lot on their plates,"" Weiner said. ""We truly appreciate their consideration.""

Digital marketing company Vinco Ventures, Inc. (BBIG) focuses on sourcing, design, sales, fulfillment, and shipping services in North America, the Asia Pacific, and Europe. Shares of the Bethlehem, Pa.-based digital media merger and acquisition company have rallied 187% in price over the past five days, driven by the meme stock craze.
As investor chatrooms like StockTwits and Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets light up with BBIG’s mention, along with other new meme names, the NFT stock has more than doubled in price from last week. Also, the strategic launch of its E-NFT platform and its planned Lomotif acquisition have helped the stock soar 149.5% over the past three months.
However, the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings results. In addition, its expanding operating expenses and losses and uncertainty surrounding the NFT space could cause its shares to retreat in the near term.

606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 10:27AM ET</span>","Google, Apple Forced to Open App Store Pay Systems in South Korea","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea became the first country to force Apple and Google to open up their app stores to other payment systems, setting a potentially radical precedent for their lucrative operations everywhere from India to the U.S.
The National Assembly passed a bill Tuesday that will ban app store operators from forcing developers to use their online payment systems and instead allow users to pay through a variety of methods. The bill will become law as soon as it’s signed by President Moon Jae-in, possibly as early as next month.
The Telecommunications Business Act says users must be given a free choice of app payment providers and opens the door for companies like Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. to transact directly with customers, bypassing the platform owner’s charges. Epic has taken the iOS and Android owners to court in various jurisdictions arguing their fees are unfair.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, the effective duopoly controlling most of the world’s smartphones, face a raft of legislative measures in the U.S. rebuking their “gatekeeper control” and urging a curb on their power to dictate terms on app marketplaces. Both charge a fee of as much as 30% on purchases made through their stores and exclude alternative payment handlers, arguing this protects users from fraud and privacy invasion.
“This could presage similar actions elsewhere,” said Omdia analyst Guillermo Escofet, who specializes in digital consumer platforms. “The overriding political mood has become hostile to the enormous amount of power concentrated in the hands of the tech giants.”
Korean lawmakers are making their move ahead of plans by Google to introduce its 30% commission fee in October, reversing a years-long exemption for the country. The company’s announcement last year that it would make its payment system mandatory for non-gaming apps is widely seen as the trigger for the new legislation -- dubbed locally the anti-Google law.
The controversy over commissions goes to the heart of how Apple and Google sustain a dominance that’s endured since the start of the global smartphone era over a decade ago. Apple settled a wide-ranging class-action lawsuit with U.S. app makers Thursday, but without agreeing to major changes to its policies.
The revenue streams in question are central to profit growth for both Apple and Google. The iPhone maker’s App Store feeds broader efforts to grow income from services and subscriptions, producing around $20 billion annually, according to Sensor Tower. Google’s Android is booming in user numbers as India’s population gets online with the help of mobile devices, and app fees are a key way the company monetizes its otherwise free software.
Google said its payment model helps keep device costs low for consumers and enables platforms and developers to succeed financially.
“Google Play provides far more than payment processing, and our service fee helps keep Android free, giving developers the tools and global platform to access billions of consumers around the world,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks.”
Apple emphasized that the ruling will erode safety protections for users, leading to a decline in trust in App Store purchases and ultimately fewer earning opportunities for developers in Korea.
“The Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like “Ask to Buy” and Parental Controls will become less effective,” an Apple spokesperson said.

The ramifications extend beyond just the $142 billion world of apps. The confrontation strikes at the fundamental role played not only by Apple and Google but also Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). as the new gatekeepers of the digital economy. Over a decade, all four companies have built up vast online marketplaces on which their rivals do business.
Korea remains one of the few arenas where local players such as Naver Corp. and Kakao Corp. hold sway, though they’re under threat: YouTube this year became the nation’s top video service, for instance, edging out Naver.
Lawmakers now echo their U.S. counterparts in saying the absence of competition exposes consumers and developers to the whims of the duo. In India, startup founders have been especially vocal about getting shut out.
“The mood has changed over the past couple of years,” said Kim Dohyeon, business professor at Kookmin University and director at Korea’s Startup Alliance. “The in-app billing system creates a big barrier to entry for startups that are not generating profits.”

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Databricks, a data analytics platform that uses artificial intelligence, said on Tuesday it raised $1.6 billion to expand its engineering team to keep its lead in the market, a funding round that valued it at $38 billion.
The massive fund injection “does not push out the IPO”, said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO. He declined to say when Databricks was planning to go public or whether it would go the traditional route or use a direct listing where companies list existing shares without issuing new shares or raising new funds.
Ghodsi did rule out going public through a merger with a blank-check firm or a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a popular way for many startups to list.
“I think SPACs are much better suited for companies that maybe have difficulty IPOing on their own and have difficulty getting those kind of investments from the kind of mutual funds that we're talking about,” he said, adding that Databricks’ annualized revenue is $600 million. He said few companies at that scale would list through SPACs.

The latest round was led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management’s investment arm Counterpoint Global. In February the company raised $1 billion in a funding round led by Franklin Templeton. Silicon Valley’s venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz led several earlier funding rounds and the company's investors include Amazon Web Services, Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents of the University of California, Tiger Global Management.
San Francisco-based Databricks partners with the cloud services of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), and China’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, said Ghodsi.

Analyst Greg Konrad sees attractive long-term prospects of space tourism that could eventually yield a $1.7-billion-revenue company by 2030.
The total addressable market for Virgin Galactic is seen as high as $120 billion. Konrad expects 250,000 travelers at a $450,000 ticket price in less than 10 years from now.
The analyst also pinned his belief that Virgin Galactic can get to 660 flights per year by 2030.
The analyst says Virgin Galactic has a simple business model centered around building spaceships to meet demand. He expects the company to have four spaceships by 2025.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, losing overnight gains after new data showed house and rental prices rising at some of the fastest rates on record, reviving fears of an early end to the Federal Reserve's pandemic-era stimulus programs.
The market had hit new record highs on Monday, confident after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday that the 'tapering' of bond purchases would not start before December. However, figures released on Tuesday showed house prices rising at an annual rate of over 19% in July, a sharp reminder of how the Fed's liquidity creation has helped drive various key asset prices higher. The figures came after four of Powell's colleagues at the Fed - all of them regional Fed presidents who are typically more concerned about the impact of policy at local level - all argued for tapering to being 'sooner rather than later'.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34 points, or 0.1%, at 35,366 points. The S&P 500 was down a little less than 0.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was down by 0.2%.
The market was also unsettled by signs of realization that even stellar growth stories have their limits. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), whose revenue quadrupled last year as the pandemic forced the accelerated mass-adoption of videoconferencing, fell 16% after saying revenue would grow only 51% this year. The fact that this was a modest increase from its previous guidance made little difference. 
Zoom's growth over the last year has left it trading at a level 25 times this year's expected sales and 120 times its expected earnings as of Monday evening, according to data compiled by Investing.com, Such multiples demand extraordinary and sustained growth.
Another previously hot growth story, Uber (NYSE:UBER), rose 0.8%, after news that it had pocketed $1 billion from exiting joint ventures in food delivery, logistics and self-driving technology in Russia. Its partner,  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX), which is buying Uber out, rose 2.6% to an all-time high. Uber stock had on Monday fallen to its lowest level since  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) both declared the effectiveness of their Covid-19 vaccines in November.
Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock lost 0.7% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s  (NASDAQ:GOOG) C-class stock lost 0.1% after South Korea enacted a new law that may have far-reaching consequences if its key principle is adopted by other countries. South Korea will in the future force the two to allow third-parties to process payments for their app stores, exposing a high-margin and essentially monopolistic business to competition. 
Such concerns have already led to the EU fining Alphabet $4.3 billion for abusing its dominant position on the Google Play store and also to charges against Apple for its behavior with its own app store.
Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock appeared to bottom out, a day after Securities and Exchanges Commission head Gary Gensler labeled its business model of accepting payment for its clients' order flow as an ""inherent"" conflict of interest. Gensler warned in an interview with Barron's that regulation to ban the practice was ""on the table.""  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), which like many brokerages has been forced to imitate Robinhood's model due to its success, fell another 1.8%. Both stocks had already fallen heavily on Monday.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Ryanair does not expect to do a deal with Boeing (NYSE:BA) this year on a major new order of 737 MAX jets, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday - but added that he could order up to 250 of the aircraft if the price was lowered. 
Ryanair is already the largest European customer for the 737 MAX, with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat MAX 8-200 model. In July it said it might do a deal before the end of the year for a significant order of the 230-seat MAX 10.
But O'Leary told journalists on Tuesday that he would be surprised if agreement was reached before next year. 
""I would be hopeful that agreement might be reached in 2022. I mean the rate and pace of negotiation depends on Boeing,"" O'Leary told a press briefing in London. 
""At the moment I think the balance lies in favour of us because Boeing have recorded remarkably few orders for the aircraft, and they need a couple of large Max 10 orders.""
A large order from Ryanair would provide a major boost to U.S. planemaker Boeing and its MAX, which was grounded for 20 months, up to last November, after two fatal crashes.
European arch-rival Airbus closed a deal with Britain's Jet2 on Tuesday for 36 A321 neo aircraft worth about $4.9 billion in a blow to Boeing, which has supplied the airline in the past.

In the past he had indicated that that order would be on a similar scale to the 210 jet MAX 8-200 order. But on Tuesday he said he could take up to 250 of the MAX 10. 
""In an ideal world ... if we can agree on pricing, I would certainly like to see Ryanair continue to grow and expand at the rate of about 50 aircraft a year."" he said. ""So over a four or five-year period we should be looking at 200-250 aircraft.""

Investing.com – Uber stock (NYSE:UBER) traded 0.3% higher in Tuesday's premarket as the company cashed out of some of its food delivery and self-driving joint ventures in Russia and elsewhere.
The move represents the latest retreat from foreign markets for Uber, which is still struggling to become consistently profitable. It had originally bundled its Russian operations with  Yandex  in 2017, after giving up ambitions to go it alone in the country.
The company will receive $1 billion in cash from the buyer, Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX). Shares of the Russian company traded 1% higher on the Nasdaq.
Uber has sold its indirect stakes in Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery, giving its partner 100% ownership in all three businesses. The stakes were held through MLU, a joint venture with Yandex.
It also sold its interest in Yandex Self-Driving Group.
Yandex has a two-year American call option to acquire the remaining 29% of Uber’s interest in the newly restructured MLU at a strike price of $1.8 billion, subject to agreed increases over the option period -- going up to approximately $2 billion if exercised in September 2023.
The Russian company will also get an extension of the current license to use Uber's brand in Russia and certain other countries until August 2030, assuming exercise of the option.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 07:46AM ET</span>","Correction in global stocks likely, funds trim equity allocations: Reuters poll","By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - A modest correction in global stock markets is likely by the end of this year, according to a slim majority of fund managers polled by Reuters who recommended trimming global exposure to equities in August in favour of bonds.
On Monday, MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets hit historic highs and European shares, with a monthly gain of more than 2%, were on track to clinch their longest winning run in over eight years, buoyed by pandemic-related monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Still, fund managers and chief investment officers in Europe, Japan and the United States polled Aug. 12-30 slightly cut recommended equity allocations to an average 49.9% of their model global portfolio from a 3-1/2 year high of 50.1% in July.
The findings precede an expected inflection point in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, with diverging views amongst officials on the precise timing of when a tapering in the Fed's $120 billion of monthly bond purchases will begin.
Asked about the likelihood of a correction in global equity markets by the end of this year, a narrow majority of respondents - nine of 17 - said it was likely, while the others said it was unlikely.
A separate Reuters survey of over 250 equity market strategists found this year's blistering global stocks rally is nearly over, and a correction was likely by end-year.
""A growth scare from rising coronavirus infections and a slowdown in reopening activity could spook domestic markets into a modest correction,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, Washington, said. 
""We would anticipate this is more of a growth scare than risk of a recession or significant slowdown given the amount of stimulus still working through the economy.""
Of those who said a correction was likely, the poll median forecast stock prices to drop 8% with predictions ranging 5%-10% in the latest survey.
But fund managers reiterated that most of the recent drops in stock prices proved to be opportune moments to increase exposure to risky assets taking advantage of rock-bottom interest rates and the resultant liquidity.
Asked about the most likely change in model portfolio recommendations over the next three months, 10 of 19 respondents said they would increase exposure to equities.
The remaining respondents said they would decrease exposure to either equities or bonds. None said they would increase their bond holdings.
""We might increase our equity exposure, but we are now in a stock picker's market. It is a question of 'what you own in the market rather than owning the market',"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London.
Dec Mullarkey, managing director, investment strategy at SLC Management in Boston, reiterated the widespread view that for returns, equities are the only game in town.
""We might think things cannot get any better from here, but when we look relative to other asset classes, even for normal, reasonable and modest performance from here, it is still going to be kind of a healthy outcome,"" he said. 
Reuters poll graphic on global asset allocation outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/zgpommlxdpd/Global%20AA.png 
Still, the latest poll found bond holding suggestions were increased to account for 39.7% of the balanced global portfolio, up from last month's 39.3%.

Chief investment officers on the whole tend to be more prudent with their allocations in a setting where monetary policies are bound to be tighter.
Even 18 months after the onset of the pandemic, new variants and the damage they carry remains a top risk to fund managers' portfolio positioning, along with any sudden tapering in monetary stimulus by central banks.

Payment for order flow is a practice where brokers send trade orders from customers to market makers who execute those trades and collect a small commission or fee from the transactions.
The SEC staff is reviewing the practice and could come out with proposals in the coming months, the Barron’s report said.
Gensler has been critical of the method in the past, on the grounds that it conflicts with brokers' fiduciary duty to find the best price for their clients. Others have cited the well-worn phrase that if the service is provided for free, then the customer is ultimately the product.
Robinhood relied on PFOF for more than 75% of its revenue in the first quarter.
Monday saw a double whammy for Robinhood stock, as a CNBC report said PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is looking into launching a stock trading platform that would compete with it. The company recently hired brokerage industry veteran Rich Hagen and is considering to let users trade individual stocks, the report said."

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian internet giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) said on Tuesday it would buy Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s stakes in their joint foodtech, delivery and self-driving businesses, and increase its stake in their ride-hailing joint venture as part of a $1 billion deal.
The restructuring of the MLU ride-hailing and car sharing joint venture, which includes Yandex.Taxi, will see Yandex own 71% while Uber's stake falls to 29% from 33.5%, Yandex said, adding it had taken out a $2 billion call option to buy out the rest if it chooses to do so.
In July, Yandex increased its e-commerce investment plan this year to $650 million, from $400-500 million, after reporting strong second-quarter results and upgrading its 2021 revenue forecast and as surging interest in online services continued after being boosted during the coronavirus pandemic. The company forecasts e-commerce GMV to jump threefold this year.
Under the agreement with Uber, Yandex will take over Uber's 33.5% indirect interest in Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery as well as its 18.2% interest in Yandex Self-Driving Group (SDG), giving Yandex 100% ownership in all businesses.
Uber could not be immediately reached for comment.
The restructuring, which Yandex said had already been approved by the boards of directors of Yandex and Uber, will be implemented in two stages, and completed by the end of the year. The deal will be financed from the company's own funds, Yandex spokesperson Asya Panoyan told Reuters.
The consolidation will allow assets to ""interact more closely with Yandex.Market and strengthen each other,"" Panoyan said.
Yandex had $2.9 billion in cash and deposits at the end of the second quarter, according to BCS analyst Maria Sukhanova. ""It might though need some extra funding if and when it decides to exercise the option for Uber’s stake in MLU BV,"" she said in a note. 

Yandex said it will also extend its licence for the exclusive rights to use the Uber brand in Russia and several other countries until August 2030, assuming the exercise of the option.
Uber and Russia’s Yandex combined their ride-sharing businesses in Russia and neighbouring countries in 2018. Yandex said in June last year that it was interested in taking full control of Yandex.Taxi ride-hailing service and was talking to Uber about potentially increasing its majority stake.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norwegian Air said on Tuesday it would not need to raise more cash as easing COVID-19 travel restrictions lifted bookings, although the budget carrier which has emerged from bankruptcy proceedings did not provide a 2021 outlook.
The pandemic sent the indebted airline into bankruptcy proceedings https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/norwegian-air-saved-collapse-reinvents-regional-carrier-2021-05-26 last year, forcing it to terminate its transatlantic network and to cut more than 6,000 jobs to survive. It now has about 3,000 employees.
The company reported on Tuesday revenue of 591 million Norwegian crowns ($68.3 million) for the first half of 2021, down from 7.1 billion crowns in the same period a year ago. It said it remained focussed on preserving cash for the rest of 2021.
""We will very much be ready for the peak season (of 2022), so there is no risk today that we will have to go out and get more capital in the foreseeable future,"" Chief Executive Geir Karlsen told Reuters.
Norwegian emerged from the government-backed bankruptcy proceedings in May and saw the number of passengers jump in July but still less than a fifth of those flown at the same time two years ago.
Bookings have risen in response to relaxation of travel restrictions and the roll-out of vaccines, Norwegian said, adding that it expected a further boost in the second quarter of 2022 when holiday travel was expected to pick up.
The current fleet of 51 aircraft, down from around 160 last year, would likely be fully utilised by the end of the year, up from less than 10 jets flown during April and May, the company said. It aims to expand to between 60 and 70 planes in 2022.
Norwegian's debt was reduced by around 80% during reconstruction as creditors took control, but the company now faces fresh competition from Flyr on domestic routes in Norway and some foreign destinations.
""Given the continuous uncertainty and ongoing impact on overall demand for air travel due to COVID-19, Norwegian does not provide guidance for 2021,"" the board said.

Norwegian's shares rose 0.2% by 0825 GMT, slightly lagging a 0.3% rise in the Oslo benchmark index.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, although healthy monthly gains look likely as August comes to an end.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 15 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded largely unchanged, less than 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 10 points, or 0.1%.
Tuesday will be the final trading day of August, and the three main indices are poised to post strong gains for the month. The broad-based S&P 500 is up 3%, set for its seventh winning month in a row, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4%, likely to register its third straight winning month. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up a more subdued 1.3%, as optimism over the pandemic ebbed in recent weeks, leading to many reflation- and reopening-themed plays being unwound.
Extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus has provided a powerful backdrop, and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday indicating that the central bank would continue to be cautious in its approach to withdrawing stimulus has helped the tone this week.
Adding further support has been a stellar quarterly earnings season, although this is now coming to an end, with Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) the highlight of a short list Tuesday. Year-on-year growth rates are likely to edge down from here, given that the second quarter of 2020 represented the height of the pandemic.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) will be in the spotlight, with the video conferencing company’s stock seen slumping premarket after it reported slowing revenue growth in the second quarter, while Chinese gaming company NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) reported better-than-expected numbers.
The main economic data number Tuesday comes in the form of the Conference Board consumer confidence release for August, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), which is expected to fall to 124, down from 129.1 in July. The index has risen for six straight months. 
That said, it’s Friday’s jobs report for August that is at the forefront of investors’ minds, especially as it coincides with the scheduled end of federal pandemic unemployment assistance in the states that haven’t stopped paying it already.
Crude prices slipped lower Tuesday in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast, dropping after last week's sharp gains with the damage not as severe as had been feared.
Hurricane Ida hit output at six refineries in Louisiana that process almost 2 million barrels per day of crude, around 12% of U.S. refining capacity.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $68.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded 0.8% lower at $71.65.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.42% to $1,815.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1837.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 threatens the fragile recovery of U.S. restaurants, according to a report on Tuesday from the National Restaurant Association. 
Nearly one in five adults surveyed online from August 13-15 said they stopped going to restaurants as Delta cases rose, the report said.
Total annual sales at U.S. restaurants are expected to rise 19.7% from 2020 to $789 billion in 2021. But that will still be 8.7% lower than 2019's $864.3 billion total sales, the report said. 
""There has been some back-off as the Delta variant has taken hold,"" Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Riehle, a National Restaurant Association executive, said of consumer behavior.
Average daily U.S. COVID cases rose to 466 people per million people as of Aug. 29 on a seven-day rolling average, versus fewer than 40 in mid-June, according to Our World in Data. 
The rise and continuing uncertainty have forced the cancellation of major events and could hamper tourism. U.S. restaurants - hurt last year by occupancy limits and public fear about dining out - stand to lose more business if tourism wanes.
For example, sales at American steakhouses soared over the summer. But because they rely heavily on tourists and private business bookings, the Delta spread threatens their comeback.
Some U.S. fast-food restaurants - including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Yum Brand Inc's Taco Bell and KFC - are closing indoor seating areas or limiting hours of operation because of the Delta variant. [L1N2PY2E8]

Restaurant sales dropped in August from July, according to Black Box Intelligence data. July's sales were 8.1% higher than in 2019, but sales in August through Aug. 22 were up only 6.3% over 2019. 
Three in five respondents to the association's survey said they changed the way they spend money and eat at restaurants because of the Delta variant, such as by ordering takeout and delivery instead of eating on site, sitting outside rather than indoors or cancelling plans to dine out.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that British Airways, owned by London-listed IAG (LON:ICAG), was considering folding its short-haul operations at Gatwick into a new unit. The company said it was working on options for the operations to curb costs, but did not specify what its proposals were.
O'Leary, speaking in Brussels on Tuesday to announce the launch of new winter routes from Belgium, told a news conference he did not hold out much hope for what he described as British Airways' umpteenth go at creating a low-cost carrier. 
""If you were going to open up a low-cost carrier, the one airport in London you wouldn't go to would be Gatwick,"" he said, adding it was London's second most expensive airport.

""If you're going to open up a low-cost carrier, you'd go to Stansted or Luton or Southend, which has lots of cheap, low-cost and underused facilities,"" he said.
O'Leary said the company would fare better pocketing a lot of money by selling Gatwick slots to the likes of Wizz Air or easyJet (LON:EZJ).

Traders ignored the company’s first billion-dollar-revenue quarter as well as overall results that beat estimates.
Raising its guidance for the second time, Zoom said total annual revenue is likely to be fractionally over $4 billion, around 2% higher than what it said in June. It had already revised its initial guidance for the year up by over 5% in March.
Adjusted profit per share is now seen between $4.75 and $4.79.
Zoom’s total revenue in the last financial year grew 326% to $2.65 billion, as individuals, families and corporates took to its video conferencing app to keep life and work going during the pandemic.
At the top end of the forecast for the year, revenue growth is now seen slowing down to 51%, an outcome of a higher baseline and the reopening of economies.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Young Chinese gamers took to social media to express their outrage at new rules that limit their gaming time to just three hours per week, while investors fretted about the long-term impact on the industry.
Authorities argue the restrictions https://www.reuters.com/world/china/why-how-china-is-drastically-limiting-online-gaming-under-18s-2021-08-31 are necessary to stop growing gaming addiction and the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper, said the government had to be ""ruthless"" as online games impair normal study life and the physical and mental health of teens.
The curbs are part of Beijing's efforts to promote the primacy of socialism and strengthen controls over society it now views as having become too lax after years of laissez-faire growth for the tech sector and other industries.
Young gamers were, however, angry.
""This group of grandfathers and uncles who make these rules and regulations, have you ever played games? Do you understand that the best age for e-sports players is in their teens?"" said one comment on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).
""Sexual consent at 14, at 16 you can go out to work but you have to be 18 to play games. This is really a joke.""
While the hit to gaming stocks was relatively measured as children do not provide much revenue for gaming companies, analysts noted that the implications for the long-term growth of the industry were much more severe.
""The root of the problem here is not the immediate revenue impact,"" said Mio Kato, an analyst who publishes on SmartKarma. ""The problem is that this move destroys the entire habit-forming nature of playing games at an early age.""
There was also relief that the regulations did not go further. 
""What the industry is really afraid of is if the government stops approving new games like they did in 2018,"" said a Beijing-based private equity investor, referring to a nine-month period when China suspended approvals of new video game titles as part of an overhaul of the regulatory bodies that oversee the sector.
""The new policy is not the worst thing that could have happened,"" said the investor who declined to identified given the sensitivity of the topic.
ONUS ON GAMING COMPANIES
Shares in Tencent, the world's largest gaming firm by revenue, initially slid but ended up 3%, with analysts noting it had already imposed additional limits on gaming for minors earlier this month. 
Krafton Inc, a South Korean company that earns fees by providing services for a similar game to its blockbuster ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG) to Tencent, finished 1% lower.
Tokyo-listed Nexon and Koei Tecmo joined NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), which is traded in United States and Hong Kong, in losing more than 3%.
The new rules place the onus on implementation on the gaming industry and are not laws per se that would punish individuals for infractions. Kids can often circumvent rules that require the use of their real names and national identification numbers when signing into games by using the login details of adult family members.
""This is a family education issue, not a gaming issue,"" said a 17-year-old gamer who wanted to be known only by her surname Luan. 
But some parents like Li Tong, a hotel manager in Beijing with a 14-year old daughter, were heartened by the new rules.

""My daughter is glued to her phone after dinner every day for one to two hours and it's difficult for me or her mother to stop her,"" he said. 
""We told her it's bad for her eyes and it's a waste of her time, but she won't listen.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa will generate positive cash flow this summer, while it should be possible to fully unwind a COVID-19 rescue package in a year's time, CEO Carsten Spohr said late on Monday.
Most Lufthansa flights were grounded by the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, plunging the airline into crisis and leading the German government to acquire a 20% stake as part of a 6 billion euro ($7.1 billion) rescue package.
Germany's economic stabilisation fund said last week it would start selling down its stake in the coming weeks with a view to disposing of it fully by the end of 2023.
""We are relieved that the government has entered the process of exiting,"" Spohr told journalists, adding that he expected the rescue and stabilisation of the airline to be largely wrapped up next summer.
Cost savings mean Lufthansa can generate cash even with passenger numbers at half pre-pandemic levels - a level reached during the summer holiday season, said Spohr. For the year as a whole, Lufthansa can reach 40% of pre-crisis capacity.

Lufthansa's cargo operation was performing strongly and is expected to generate profits of a billion euros this year, he added. That compares with air cargo profit of 640 million euros in the first half of this year.

Vivendi said the transaction was based on an enterprise value of 35 billion euros ($41.40 billion) for 100% of UMG's share capital. 
The deal, to close by Sept. 9, means Pershing Square will own 10% of UMG's share capital after it bought a 7.1% stake from Vivendi in August, the French company added. 
The transaction comes ahead of the distribution of 60% of UMG's share capital to Vivendi's shareholders and the listing of the company scheduled for September 21.
UMG, which represents artists like Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, is benefiting from a music industry rebound, underpinned by booming streaming revenues but also a recent surge in sales of vinyl records and CDs.
In January, Vivendi said a consortium led by Chinese media group Tencent had bought an additional 10% stake in UMG, pushing its holding up to 20%. Tencent has been expanding globally with stakes in Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Warner Music Group. 
Besides UMG, Vivendi's media assets include pay TV firm Canal+, communications group Havas, video games firm Gameloft, video-sharing firm Dailymotion, plus other publishing and entertainment firms.
The French conglomerate has said it plans to use the proceeds from the UMG deals to reduce its financial debt and to finance share buybacks and acquisitions.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely edged higher Tuesday, but gains are limited after disappointing growth data out of China and with travel stocks hit hard by new Covid-related restrictions.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
Data released earlier Tuesday brought China’s economic recovery into question, with factory activity expanding at a slower pace in August and the services sector tumbling into contraction territory. 
The mobility restrictions that were imposed to stop the recent new outbreak of Covid-19, coupled with high raw material prices and supply constraints, pushed the country’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index down to 50.1 in August, from 50.4 in July. It's now six months since China's PMI peaked.
The non-manufacturing PMI tumbled to 47.5, from 53.3, below the 50-mark indicating growth and the lowest reading since February 2020.
Also weighing on sentiment in Europe was the decision by the EU to remove the United States from its safe travel list. The United States, on its part, has issued a ""do not travel"" advisory for several European nations.
IAG (LON:ICAG) Group, the owner of British Airways, saw its stock fall over 3%, Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) stock fell 1.2% and Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock dropped 1.3%, overshadowing comments from CEO Carsten Spohr who said the German carrier will generate positive cash flow this summer.
In other corporate news, Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) stock fell 0.7% after the French conglomerate agreed to sell an additional 2.9% of Universal Music Group to Pershing Square for $1.15 billion, while Bunzl (OTC:BZLFY) stock fell 1.8% after the U.K. wholesaler released half-year results and an unchanged outlook.
French inflation surprised on the upside in August, rising 0.7% from July, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 2.4%, the fastest rate in nearly three years. There are more important economic releases due Tuesday, including German unemployment data and Eurozone inflation numbers, both for August. 
Still, European stocks continue to benefit from the dovish nature of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at the virtual Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, when he declined to provide a firm timetable for tapering asset purchases.
Many had expected the Fed chief to pinpoint the beginning of the end for the central bank’s unprecedented monetary support in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
Crude prices stabilized Tuesday in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast, with the prospect of extended refinery outages, and consequently reduced crude demand, balancing out the temporary hit to supply from the suspension of output of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Wholesale gasoline prices also appear to have peaked, unwinding around half of last week's gains. 
Hurricane Ida hit output at six refineries in Louisiana that process almost 2 million barrels per day of crude, around 12% of U.S. refining capacity.
The market is also awaiting the latest meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, with the group, known as OPEC+, expected on Wednesday to agree to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month through December.   
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $69.17 a barrel, while the Brent contract was mostly unchanged at $72.22.

From Fed boss Jerome Powell on Friday to the Cleveland Fed's Loretta Mester on Monday, the doves have been out in force, sending the dollar to two-week lows, Treasury yields below 1.3% and putting the S&P 500 on track for its longest monthly winning streak since 2018. 
But China is rocking the boat.
Its non-manufacturing PMI fell to a contractionary 47.5 in August (53.3 in July) and the composite PMI recorded its first sub-50 reading since February 2020.
The impact of new rules restricting under-18s from playing video games for more than three hours a week is also weighing -- Shenzen-listed tech shares are down more than 2%. 
And a Reuters report of a regulatory probe into the property investments of Ping An Insurance sent its shares 7% lower at one point. 
Still, world shares scaled new record highs, while Wall Street futures are almost half a percent higher. The main focus in Europe is the euro zone ""flash"" inflation data following Germany's 3.4% reading on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters predict 2.7% -- that would be the highest reading since 2012.
Bond markets however, shrugged off Germany's outsized reading and are likely to keep their eyes firmly trained on the Fed and Friday's August U.S. jobs data. 
On the corporate front, dealmaking never really took a break over the summer but expect the pace to pick up in coming weeks. 
Today's big news is the $4.7 billion purchase by tech investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) of Indian payments platform BillDesk. And the familiar laments about supply chain disruptions continue - business supplies distributor Bunzl (OTC:BZLFY) is the latest. 
Finally, watch travel stocks after EU removed the United States and five other countries from its safe travel list. The United States, on its part, has issued a ""do not travel"" advisory for several European nations. 
Developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
- Japan's industrial output shrank in July.
- Germany's centre-left SPD cement hold on first place ahead of Sept 26 elections. 
- Zoom Q2 revenues rose 54% to $1.02 billion, beating forecasts of $991 million; BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) AUM at record $9.49 trillion in Q2 vs $7.32 trillion a year earlier
- Chinese Evergrande New Energy Vehicle shares down after big H1 loss. 
-Chile central bank meeting

639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 02:09AM ET</span>",Tesla Inches Closer to Entering India With Four Models Approved,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  is closer to making its official debut in India after it received approval to make or import four models in the South Asian nation.
Tesla has had its vehicles certified as being roadworthy in India, a posting on the website of the nation’s ministry of road transport and highways showed.
“The tests ensure the vehicle matches the requirements of the Indian market in terms of emission and safety and road worthiness,” according to the site. A Tesla fan club earlier tweeted about the development, saying the cars were probably Model 3 and Model Y variants.
Gaining a foothold in the Indian car market won’t be easy considering EVs account for only 1% of the nation’s annual car sales and Tesla’s automobiles are very expensive. Scant charging infrastructure and a lack of financing for companies wanting to develop electric cars are other reasons why India is behind in the electric shift.
The country’s high tax regime is another roadblock. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk last month tweeted that import duties in India are among the highest in the world and the nation treats clean energy vehicles the same as gasoline, which isn’t consistent with its climate goals. The billionaire has said a factory in India is “quite likely” if the California-based carmaker can first test the waters by importing vehicles.
Tesla’s call for a tax cut on imported EVs has received a mixed reception. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s India unit and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. have backed the move while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. has called for a review of import tariffs along with lower domestic levies. 
 Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd. Chief Financial Officer P.B. Balaji said during an earnings call last month the government should continue with the existing EV subsidy plan, which places an emphasis on localization and affordability of electric models. India’s government has said it has no plans to cut import duties on electric vehicles.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China regulator probes Ping An Insurance's property investments -sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's banking and insurance sector regulator is probing Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd's investments in the property market, two people with knowledge of the matter said, after the firm took a big profit hit from a soured bet.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) has also ordered the insurer to stop selling alternative investment products, which are typically tied to the property market, said the people, who declined to be identified as the information is not public.
Ping An in a statement said its real estate exposure was significantly lower than the regulatory cap. It did not respond to queries on the regulatory probe. The CBIRC did not respond to a request for comment.
The regulatory move comes after Ping An, the country's biggest insurer by assets, in February disclosed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-developer-ping-an-of-china-debt-idUSKBN2A40HQ a 54 billion yuan ($8.4 billion) exposure to the indebted China Fortune Land Development Co Ltd.
Ping An made adjustments to its earnings figures including booking impairment provisions https://www.reuters.com/article/ping-an-results-idUSL1N2PX0KA of 35.9 billion yuan for investments related to China Fortune in the first half of 2021, which contributed to a 15.5% fall in its net profit in the January to June period.
China Fortune, a developer of industrial parks and urban real estate, said it had overdue debt and interest worth 69.2 billion yuan as of June-end, and that default and liquidity stress could impact its operations and financing.
The regulatory probe into Ping An's property portfolio also comes against the backdrop of Beijing sharpening its scrutiny of the country's red-hot real estate market by tackling unbridled borrowing that has fuelled concern about financial risk.
The government has been working to curb unregulated credit flows into the property market. And as new rules choke off shadow lending to developers, the squeeze is increasing the risk of default for some of the country's biggest property players.
The insurance regulator's investigation into Ping An, the only insurer designated as systemically important, aims to uncover and contain risk connected to its property investment portfolio, said the people.
The insurer's total real estate-related exposure is 185.5 billion yuan, weighing roughly equally on equities, debt and investment properties and accounting for around 4.8% to 4.9% of its 3.8 trillion yuan total investment portfolio, according to a Citi research note.
The Shanghai-listed shares of Ping An fell as much as 3.2% on Tuesday after the news to their lowest price in four years.
In a new statement on Tuesday, Ping An said it has been ""strictly following the relevant regulations"" in its investments, and that it did not comment on market rumours.
PROPERTY EXPOSURE 
The regulator's latest on-site probe into Shenzhen-based Ping An, whose shares are down more than 40% this year, started this month, said one of the people, adding the CBIRC has been requesting documents since earlier this year.
Also, the CBIRC in February ordered the insurer to halt the sale of so-called alternative investment products, leaving dozens in a team set up for the purpose without work, they said.
Ping An's other property investments include 14.1% of the shares in China Jinmao Holdings Group Ltd, 8% of Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd and 6.54% of CIFI Holdings (Group) Co Ltd, showed Refinitiv data based on company filings. 
China's insurers have been busy unwinding or cutting their exposure to developers this year, said two people who work at mid-sized insurance firms.

""All I've been doing is travelling to meet our different developer clients this year in different parts to China to tell them we can't finance them anymore,"" said one person who works at one of China's top 10 insurance firms.
""We're cutting our exposure as part of our internal strategy,"" the person said.

642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 01:54AM ET</span>","Iron Ore Retreats as Investors Eye Weaker Economy, Steel Outlook","(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore Futures retreated as the market weighed a coming seasonal pick-up in Chinese demand against the prospect of a broadly weakening economy and more curbs on steel output.
The raw material had been regaining some ground after a collapse in July, with China’s upcoming fall construction season suggesting higher demand. But iron ore still faces headwinds as the world’s largest steel market faces several challenges for the rest of this year. Authorities want to rein in output, and production curbs to reduce emissions are expected to intensify in the last quarter.
Even if seasonal demand is expected to emerge soon, “it’s hard to change the weak outlook for the medium- and long-term given the overall guidance to lower crude steel production,” Zhongzhou Futures Co. wrote in a website note.
China’s economic activity weakened more than expected in August as an outbreak of the delta virus variant curbed consumer spending and travel. While that could trigger fresh government support including infrastructure spending, there’s typically a months-long lag between policy changes and their effect on steel demand.
Earlier this week, Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit of China’s biggest producer, flagged the potential for renewed price declines in iron ore.
Futures on the Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) fell 1.9% to $153.85 a ton as of 11:54 a.m. local time, after earlier rising as much as 1.2%. In China, iron ore fell 2.2% while steel futures also retreated.

In March, Chinese private equity firm Wise Road Capital agreed to acquire system chip manufacturer Magnachip in a deal valued at $1.4 billion.
Since then, regulatory authorities in countries including the United States and South Korea have been reviewing the deal. Magnachip, which produces display and power chips, has production and R&D facilities based in South Korea. 
Magnachip said in a SEC filing on Monday the U.S. Department of Treasury, in a letter to the company's legal counsel last Friday, said the acquisition posed ""risks to the national security of the United States,"" and expects to seek President Joe Biden's decision on the matter. 
CFIUS, a committee under the U.S. Department of Treasury, had ordered the deal to be put on hold in June.
The filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not specify the nature of the risks. 

Magnachip was assessing its next steps, but cannot give assurance that it would agree to proposals that would facilitate clearance by CFIUS, the filing said. A spokesperson for Magnachip declined further comment. 
A global shortage of chips has slowed production in the automobile and tech industries, fuelling calls for the United States to rely less on China and leading to efforts such as the U.S. Senate passing the ""U.S. Innovation and Competition Act"" which authorised about $190 billion for provisions to strengthen U.S. technology and research.

The Hang Seng Tech Index slid as much as 1.5%, led by shares of Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc., which fell in Hong Kong after declines in their American depositary receipts. The renewed selloff helped drag the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index to the lowest level in a week, while losses spread to gaming shares in Tokyo. 
“The regulatory environment is clearly continuing to pose a headwind for sentiment around China’s tech stocks,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman, “It’s tough to see a light at the end of the tunnel as that requires guessing the next move by the government.” 
The escalation of restrictions on gaming adds to the pain for investors in the region’s biggest technology companies, who’ve been hit by new rules from Beijing on everything from ride-hailing platforms to e-commerce to data security. The latest move has also halted a spurt of bargain hunting that had helped the sector claw back some of its losses over the past week.
Bilibili declined as much as 7.2% while NetEase slipped 4.6%. Kanterman noted that Bilibili’s customer base is skewed a bit more toward youth than that of NetEase. 
Shares of food delivery giant Meituan were also swept up in Tuesday’s rout, dropping as much as 2.1% as concerns over renewed regulatory crackdowns outweighed the company’s strong second-quarter revenue beat.
China Slashes Kids’ Gaming Time to Just Three Hours a Week
The new rules will only allow gaming platforms to offer services to minors from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays, weekends and public holidays, according to state news agency Xinhua, which cited a release by the National Press and Publication Administration. China had previously restricted gaming hours for teens to 1.5 hours per day in 2019.
In Tokyo, Nexon Co. and Koei Tecmo Holdings Co. led Japanese video game makers lower. Nexon fell as much as 5% while Koei Tecmo dropped as much as 4.4%. Nexon received about of its 28% of its revenue from China in the last fiscal year.
Chinese gaming stocks listed in the U.S. had come under pressure on the news on Monday, with NetEase, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., Bilibili and Huya (NYSE:HUYA) Inc. ADRs all falling at least 1.1%.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index -- which tracks 98 firms listed in the U.S. that conduct a majority of their business in China -- still managed to gained 0.7% after earlier falling as much as 2.5%. Yet the gauge has dropped 29% this year, including about 47% since its record high in February.

China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03% by 9:44 PM ET (1:44 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.09%. Economic data released earlier in the day was disappointing, with the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 50.1 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 47.5, below the 50-mark indicating growth, in August.
U.S.-listed Chinese video-gaming shares were also on a downward trend after Beijing limited video games playtime for minors, the latest regulatory tightening to take place in the country.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.09% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.24%. Australia was the sole bright spot, with the ASX 200 edging up 0.19%.
U.S. Treasuries also climbed, adding to the gains it has recorded since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cautiously hinted at possible asset tapering and interest rate hikes at the previous week’s Jackson Hole symposium.
Global shares are on track to record a seventh monthly advance as August draws to a close, due to strong company profits and COVID-19 vaccination rates that reflect an ongoing economic recovery. However, depressed Treasury yields could reflect remaining concerns that COVID-19's Delta variant is still impacting the recovery.
Some investors remained optimistic.
“The bond market is getting a little nervous about the economic outlook. I actually think the economy is fundamentally strong. By year-end, if the economy holds up, which we forecast it will, that’s when we expect rates, especially in the long end, to start to edge higher,” TD Securities head of global interest rate strategy Priya Misra told Reuters.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Moderna Inc's COVID-19 vaccine contamination woes in Japan widened after two regions put temporary holds on shots following the discovery of foreign substances in more batches.
The disruption to  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) supplies comes as Japan battles its worst wave of COVID-19 yet https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-eyes-mixed-use-covid-19-shots-speed-vaccine-rollout-2021-08-29, driven by the contagious Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 this month for the first time amid a slow vaccine rollout.
The latest reports of vaccine contamination came from Gunma prefecture near Tokyo and the southern prefecture of Okinawa, prompting temporary holds on Sunday on shots from two new Moderna lots. That followed the nationwide suspension of 1.63 million doses https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-withdraws-16-mln-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-doses-over-contamination-nikkei-2021-08-25 last week.
A tiny black substance was found https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-gunma-prefecture-reports-contaminant-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-2021-08-30 in a Moderna vaccine vial in Gunma, an official from the prefecture said, while in Okinawa, black substances were spotted in syringes and a vial, and pink material was found https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/okinawa-finds-contaminants-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-nhk-2021-08-29 in a different syringe.
Japan's health ministry said some of the incidents may have been due to needles being incorrectly inserted into vials, breaking off bits of the rubber stopper. 
The ministry and Takeda Pharmaceutical, which distributes the Moderna vaccine in Japan, said there were no safety issues from the Okinawa and Gunma incidents and that there was no need for nationwide suspensions.
Gunma and Okinawa can resume using vials from the lots in question as long as they do not contain foreign materials, the ministry told a briefing late on Monday. 
The contamination cases come on the heels of a government report on Saturday that two people died https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-die-japan-after-shots-suspended-moderna-vaccines-japan-govt-2021-08-28 after receiving Moderna shots that were among lots later suspended. 
The government had said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was a precaution. The causes of death are being investigated. 
""It is unlikely, in my opinion, that contamination of foreign substances led directly to sudden deaths,"" said Takahiro Kinoshita, a physician and vice chair of Cov-Navi, a vaccine information group. 
""If the contaminated substances were dangerous enough to cause death for some people, probably many more people would have suffered from some symptoms after the vaccination.
""However, further investigations are definitely needed to evaluate the harm of the particular doses in question.""
'LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE'
Japan earlier halted the use of 1.63 million Moderna doses, shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide after Takeda received reports of contaminants in some vials.
Some 500,000 people received shots from those supplies, Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccine push, has said. 
Moderna and Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said at the time that the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of Rovi's production lines.
Rovi said, in a statement on Sunday, that an investigation was under way in coordination with Moderna, Takeda and the health authorities. Takeda also said, on Monday, that the investigation was ongoing.
Rovi shares closed down 13.5% on Monday.
Nicholas Rennick, an Australian doctor practicing at the NTT Medical Centre in Tokyo, said the contamination ""is a serious problem"" and there is need to investigate, but given rising COVID-19 cases, Moderna vaccinations should ""continue with appropriate precautions"".
Severe COVID-19 cases are at record levels in Japan, leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds. Only 44% of its population has been fully vaccinated, lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries.

""We've got thousands of Delta variant patients around Japan as we speak, spreading the virus, and so many of the population remain unvaccinated and unprotected,"" Rennick said. 
""We have to look at the bigger picture.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), a popular gateway for trading meme stocks, tumbled nearly 7% on Monday on news that  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) may start an online brokerage and a report saying regulators were looking at a possible ban on a practice that accounts for the bulk of the company's revenue.
Shares of Robinhood extended an early decline after CNBC reported that PayPal was exploring ways to let U.S. customers trade individual stocks on its platform.
Robinhood shares fell further after Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told Barron's in an interview published on Monday that payment for order flow has ""an inherent conflict of interest.""
Retail brokers such as Robinhood send their customers' orders to wholesale brokers rather than exchanges in the controversial practice known by the acronym PFOF.
Gensler said that in addition to making a small spread on each trade, wholesalers or market makers also get data, the first look at a trade and the ability to match buyers and sellers from the order flow they pay retail brokers.
""That may not be the most efficient markets for the 2020s,"" Gensler told Barron's in the interview.
Gensler did not say whether the SEC had found instances where conflicts of interest had harmed investors. 
The SEC is scrutinizing PFOF over concerns it may incentivize brokers to send customer orders to trading platforms that maximize their own profit instead of providing customers the best execution for their trades. 
Shares of Robinhood closed down 6.9% at $43.64. The stock went public in late July and has gained about 25% since, according to Refinitiv data.

Robinhood's simple interface has made it popular with investors trading from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to wild rides in shares of companies like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), among other meme stocks. 
In an emailed response to Reuters, a Robinhood spokesperson pointed to its chief financial officer's earlier remarks that the company would defend its customers and ensure it does not put up barriers that keep people out.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court said the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff's firm can pursue a $343.1 million clawback lawsuit against  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), a decision that could help the late swindler's customers recover close to the estimated $17.5 billion they lost in his Ponzi scheme.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled on Monday that lower court judges incorrectly required the trustee Irving Picard to prove Citigroup lacked good faith by being ""willfully blind"" to ""red flags"" suggesting a high probability of fraud.
It said the correct standard was whether the New York-based bank knew ""suspicious facts"" about Madoff that would have caused a reasonable person to follow up.
Seanna Brown, a lawyer representing Picard, in a statement called the decision an ""important victory"" for Madoff victims that could help the trustee recover $3.75 billion, on top of nearly $14.5 billion he has already recovered.
Brown said the decision affected about 90 lawsuits, and should help bring victims ""as close as possible to recovering 100% of their losses.""
Citigroup declined to comment. Brown and Picard are partners at the law firm Baker & Hostetler.
The $343.1 million represented money that Citigroup received between 2005 and 2008 from a Madoff ""feeder fund,"" Rye Select Broad Market Prime Fund LP, that had borrowed from the bank to invest with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
Picard said Citigroup accepted that money despite internal suspicions that Madoff's trading activity and investment returns were a sham.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan dismissed Picard's case after another judge, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, imposed the willful blindness standard.
But in Monday's 3-0 decision, Circuit Judge Richard Wesley said the plain meaning of good faith in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code required that Citigroup be only on ""inquiry notice"" of Madoff's fraud.
The appeals court also revived similar clawback lawsuits against two other firms.

Madoff died on April 14 at age 82 in prison, where he was serving a 150-year sentence.
The cases are Picard v. Citibank NA et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-1333; and Picard v. Legacy Capital Ltd et al in the same court, No. 20-1334.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq topped their record closes once again on Monday, bolstered by technology stocks, as last week's dovish comments from the Federal Reserve on tapering its monetary stimulus refocused investors' minds on economic growth.
It was the fourth record closing high in five sessions for the S&P, and the fifth in six sessions for the Nasdaq, runs only interrupted by jitters ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech.
Ultimately, these worries were unfounded as Powell said on Friday the central bank would continue to be cautious in its approach to tapering its massive pandemic-era stimulus, while reaffirming a steady economic recovery.
""It's now clear that there's going to still be an extraordinary amount of support for this economy, probably until November,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA.
""Some investors are thinking that tapering might not even start this year, but the one thing that everyone can agree on is that Chair Powell has signaled they are in no rush to raise interest rates and he's disconnected tapering with rate-hike timing.""
With this in mind, investors turned to high-growth tech stocks which tend to benefit from expectations of lower rates because their value rests heavily on future earnings.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 3% to an all-time high, while  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc rose between 0.4% and 2.1%, helping the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperform the S&P 500 and the Dow.
The benchmark index is tracking its longest monthly winning streak since 2018 on the promise of easy money, with investors shrugging off signs of a slowing economic recovery and surging COVID-19 cases.
The S&P 500 has risen 3% so far in August - a seasonally weak period for stocks - and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts said last week they expect the index to rise another 8% by the end of the year.
It is also on track to log one of its best year-to-date returns through August of the past six decades, said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC). 
The S&P 500 gained 19.42 points, or 0.43%, to 4,528.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 136.39 points, or 0.9%, to 15,265.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.96 points, or 0.16%, to 35,399.84, 
While U.S. crude prices rose 0.7% on Monday, energy stocks broadly slipped as investors fretted about possible longer-term impacts from Hurricane Ida, which roared ashore on Sunday near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a major hub for the U.S. offshore oil industry. [O/R]
The energy index fell 1.2%, with only the financials benchmark dropping further on the day, as bank stocks reacted to falling bond yields.
 PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) advanced 3.6% on a CNBC report that the financial services firm was exploring the development of a stocks trading platform for its U.S. customers. The news helped send  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) down 6.9%.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.77 billion shares, compared with the 8.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 77 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 153 new highs and 34 new lows.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Hurricane Ida damaged a grain export elevator owned by global grain trader Cargill Inc, and rival shipper CHS Inc warned on Monday its grain facility may lack power for weeks after the storm tore though the busiest U.S. grains port.
Cargill said its Reserve, Louisiana, terminal, one of two the company operates along the Mississippi River near the Gulf of Mexico, ""sustained significant damage"" when the storm roared ashore.
Rival crop exporters  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co said they were working to assess damage to their area export facilities.
The storm has disrupted grain and soybean shipments from the Gulf Coast, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. exports, at a time when global supplies are tight and demand is strong from China.
Images of the damaged Cargill terminal, with a twisted and partially collapsed grain conveyor system, circulated on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and were shared among grain traders and barge shippers.
""This area in SE Louisiana is still facing significant personal safety concerns and power outages, so we are just able to start assessing the storm’s impact on the river system. We don’t currently have a timeframe for resuming operations,"" Cargill said in a statement.
CHS is working to divert export shipments scheduled through the next month to its terminal in Kalama, Washington, as the hurricane knocked out a transmission line that powers its Myrtle Grove facility south of New Orleans, the company said.
""Best estimates as to when power will be restored at the terminal are in the two to four week range,"" said John Griffith, executive vice president at CHS Global Grain & Processing.
Cash premiums for grain delivered by barge to Gulf terminals for export fell sharply on Monday as traders feared a prolonged recovery from the storm.
A preliminary assessment of Bunge's Destrehan, Louisiana, export terminal and oilseed processing plant found no significant structural damage, spokeswoman Deb Seidel said.
Bunge had hoped to restart operations on Tuesday after shutting down on Saturday ahead of the storm. But power to the facility remains out with no estimate for when it may be restored, Seidel said.

Archer-Daniels-Midland will assess damage to four New Orleans grain elevators and port operations it closed over the weekend ahead of the hurricane, spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said. 
""ADM has a vast transportation network and we are making alternate shipping arrangements as necessary to meet customers' needs as we manage through this difficult situation,"" she said in an email.

The world's biggest miner on Monday set out measures it was taking to support vaccination in communities where it operates including on-site jabs at its Mt Arthur Coal Mine in New South Wales state that are to begin this week.
The state has become the epicentre of Australia's current coronavirus outbreak, having declared a record 1,290 new cases on Monday as the nation struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant.
Although Australia has used a system of strict lockdowns and quarantine to keep coronavirus infection and death rates lower than in most comparable nations, the Delta variant is now pressuring health services. Residents of its two biggest cities have been on strict lockdown for more than a month.
BHP said in a statement that it was actively assessing vaccination as a condition of entry to its workplaces. 
""As vaccinations become more accessible to all Australians, we have been encouraging our people to better protect themselves and their families and communities, and we will look for further opportunities to increase access and uptake of vaccinations,"" Edgar Basto, who runs BHP's Minerals Australia business, said. 
BHP expects to complete its assessment in September, with a policy likely to come into effect in early 2022, once people have had a reasonable opportunity to be fully vaccinated. 

The miner is funding a new vaccine hub in central Queensland near its coal joint venture with Mitsubishi Corp, and is working with South Australian health authorities to establish a mobile clinic near its Olympic Dam copper mine. 
It is also working with health officials in Western Australia to support vaccine rollouts in the Pilbara region, the heart of its iron ore operations, it said.

The company on Monday forecast third-quarter revenue between $1.015 billion and $1.020 billion, compared with the analysts' average estimate of $1.013 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
That indicates a rise of just about 31.2% from a year earlier, compared with multiple-fold growth rates in 2020 when the COVID-19 crisis had turned Zoom into a household name due to the rise of remote working and schooling.
""We had expected that (the slowdown) towards the end of the year, but it's just happened a little bit more quickly than we expected,"" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said on an earnings call. 
Zoom has faced pressure this year as vaccinations encourage schools to reopen and more companies to bring employees back to offices. 
Competition from legacy platforms such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s Webex and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams has also dented its efforts to win bigger contracts from businesses.
Zoom said it expects a decline in revenue from customers with 10 or fewer employees. This group consists mainly of small and medium businesses which pay bills monthly. 
It forecast third-quarter adjusted earnings between $1.07 and $1.08 per share, compared with expectations of $1.09 a share.
Analysts said the company would try to arrest the growth slowdown by aggressively spending on expansion and ramping up its platform and Zoom Phone - its cloud-calling product for businesses.

Zoom recently announced the buyout of call-center software maker Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) for $14.7 billion in its largest deal, and Kites GmbH, a firm that helps in real-time language translation. 
It posted a profit of $1.04 per share in the second quarter on revenue of $1.02 billion, both of which were higher than estimates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers are bracing for $15 billion to $30 billion in claims from Hurricane Ida, but the figure could jump higher, in part because of pandemic pricing that has pushed up the cost of lumber and labor to rebuild, insurance experts said on Monday.
The widely ranging estimates, based on models that track the storm's severity and path, are still likely to be less than the $87 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina, when adjusted for inflation, experts said.
Insurance companies with significant exposure include Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), FedNat, Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd, American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) Inc and The Hartford, according to Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome.
Ida was about one category weaker than Katrina was when it made landfall 16 years ago, and that makes a large difference in its destruction and financial cost, Newsome said.
Insurers said they are asking clients about damage and poring over satellite images to assess the wind impact. But inspections are necessary to assess the amount of flooding.
""The wind damage may be more visible, but you don't know the extent of the water damage until you're actually able to inspect,"" said Anne Wilson, property expert for the Americas at Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) AG. ""You have to get eyes on the ground.""
Insurance costs for residential flooding will largely be covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Commercial policies, however, will face claims for direct physical damage and also business interruption and supply chain disruption that spread beyond the disaster area, said Robert O'Brien, a managing director at the national property claims practice of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC).
With power outages, floods, impassable roads and other impediments, production can be disrupted for weeks and can generate contingent claims by distant businesses unable to get supplies from or sell products to companies hit by the storm.
""Those involved parties could be anywhere,"" O'Brien said. ""A local event can ripple out across the world.""

Ida also likely will renew efforts to address problems with NFIP, which was launched more than 50 years ago and is $20.5 billion in debt because the premiums are too low to cover the cost of claims, said Craig Poulton, chief executive officer of Poulton Associates, which administers flood and other insurance.
""This event will serve as a reminder of the severity that storms can bring,"" he said.

SEC staff is reviewing the practice and could come out with proposals in the coming months, the report https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-chairman-says-banning-payment-for-order-is-on-the-table-51630350595?mod=hp_LEAD_2 said.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>",U.S. vaccine advisers unanimously favor Pfizer/BioNTech shot after approval,"By Manas Mishra and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) -An advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday unanimously recommended the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine for people age 16 and older, an important step that could help accelerate vaccine mandates in the United States. 
The Food and Drug Administration last week granted full approval to the vaccine that was previously available under the agency's emergency use authorization (EUA), which had allowed the shots to be rolled out rapidly to Americans. 
Health officials hope the formal approval and CDC recommendation will spur more Americans to get vaccinated. With full FDA approval, some companies and states have begun mandating COVID-19 vaccination. 
Vaccination rates remain low in many parts of the United States, contributing to a big surge in hospitalizations due to the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Some panel members said increasing vaccinations before the fall season was critical to getting children back to schools safely. 
""Everyone who has anything to do with a child that is not old enough to be vaccinated yet should be vaccinated for the benefit of their children,"" said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, an infectious disease specialist who was part of the panel. 
Regulators have authorized a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines for those with weak immune systems, and the U.S. government has said it plans to make booster doses available to more Americans in September. 
The CDC advisers are considering an approach to boosters that would focus on preventing severe disease among those most at risk - residents in long-term care facilities, other older adults and healthcare workers - much like the original vaccine rollout. 
CDC staff presented available data on the need for boosters and said, at this point it may be difficult to determine whether immunity from prior vaccination is waning over time or if the vaccines are just less able to prevent infection by the highly-transmissible Delta variant. 
Several panel members expressed concern about the White House announcement of a booster policy starting in September, even before the vaccine advisory panel had seen the evidence or determined that such a campaign was needed.
Members of the vaccine advisory working group, which is shaping the agency's approach to boosters, stressed that the top U.S. priority remains getting shots to the unvaccinated.
Another meeting will be scheduled in mid-September to discuss boosters. 
At Monday's meeting, the CDC reiterated that the benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweigh potential risks associated with the shots.

New Zealand on Monday reported its first death linked to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine after a woman suffered myocarditis, a type of inflammation of the heart muscle that is a known rare side effect of the vaccine. Health officials there said other factors could have contributed to her death.
There have been no reported deaths among young U.S. adults who developed myocarditis after getting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, CDC said.

Shares of struggling companies GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), for example, skyrocketed in price, with retail investors betting against hedge funds. This trend is expected to continue because retail traders are expected to gain more influence over the market as sophisticated technology and zero-commission trading platforms gain prominence.
One objective of retail investors is to gain from betting on stocks that are being discussed on numerous social media platforms and might experience a short squeeze. However, while short squeezes can lead to eye-popping rallies in many stocks, those companies that have weak business models or other fundamental weaknesses should eventually see a pullback.
Short squeeze candidates Support.com Inc. (SPRT) and SCWorx Corp. (WORX) seem to have garnered significant attention lately in the ongoing retail trading frenzy.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -U.S. and global equity benchmarks hit all-time highs on Monday, as the Federal Reserve appeared in no rush to step away from its massive stimulus, and U.S. oil prices finished higher.
MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets hit a record. The S&P 500 .SPX and Nasdaq also rose to all-time highs as dovish remarks from the Fed last week bolstered optimism in an economic rebound and eased fears of a sudden tapering in monetary stimulus.
The S&P 500 gained 0.43%, to 4,528.76 and was on track to finish the month up more than 3%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.9% to 15,265.72 as investors jumped into technology stocks. 
High-growth tech stocks tend to benefit from expectations of lower rates because their value rests heavily on future earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.16% to 35,399.84.
The Europe-wide STOXX 600 rose 0.07% and was on course to end August with a rise of more than 2% - its seventh month of gains in what would be its longest such winning run in over eight years. 
Asian stocks hit a two-week high and Japan's blue-chip Nikkei closed up 0.5%.
Positive sentiment in equity markets was underpinned by Friday's Jackson Hole, Wyoming, speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in which he said tapering of stimulus measures could begin this year, but added the central bank would remain cautious.
""The questions now should pivot from the timing of the taper to its speed. How fast will the Fed reduce its purchases from the current $120 billion monthly rate?"" said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment Institute.
""That will likely be determined by some of the data coming in this week, including U.S. consumer confidence and jobs, but also European inflation and Chinese PMIs,"" Smart said.
With the market focused on the medium term, traders have seen any weakness as buying opportunities, said Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet.
""We are going from great to good - the outlook is not as great as it was earlier this year but it's still consistent with further equity market gains,"" he added.
Chinese shares remained the outlier, with the U.S.-listed shares of gaming firms such as NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc dropping on signs of further regulation.
Chinese regulators cut the amount of time players under the age of 18 can spend on online games to an hour on Fridays, weekends and holidays, state media reported.
The new rules come amid a broad crackdown by Beijing on China's tech giants, such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) that has hammered Chinese shares traded at home and abroad.
OIL OFF HIGHS
Oil prices edged higher but were off a four-week high as Hurricane Ida weakened into a Category 1 hurricane within 12 hours of coming ashore as a Category 4.
Nearly all U.S. offshore Gulf oil production, or 1.74 million barrels per day, was suspended in advance of the storm.
Focus turned to a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Wednesday, with sources telling Reuters the group is likely to keep its oil output policy unchanged and continue with its planned modest production increase.
Oil prices rose, with Brent crude finishing up 71 cents at $73.41 a barrel after touching four-week highs. They rose more than 11% last week in anticipation of disruptions to oil production from Hurricane Ida.
U.S. oil rose 47 cents to $69.21 a barrel, having jumped a little more than 10% over the last week.
""Hurricane Ida will dictate oil's near-term direction,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA. ""If Ida weakens and its path of destruction is lower than expected, oil's rally will temporarily lose momentum here.""
Gold prices slipped after touching their highest level since Aug. 4.
In bond and currency markets, the Fed's dovish tone held sway and Friday's key U.S. jobs report was in focus.
U.S. Treasury yields retreated as the market looked ahead to the release this week of the August employment report and the possibility it could factor into the timing of the Fed's tapering announcement.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was around 1.2818% , while the dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies - edged higher after touching a two-week low. 

The euro edged up to $1.18, off a three-week peak touched earlier in the session.
""If we get a (U.S. payrolls) number close to a million, that would increase the odds of taper being announced in September, but if the number is in line with expectations, then there's a 50-50 chance for a September move,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier Group.

Therefore, prominent cloud stocks Snowflake (SNOW) and Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) should benefit. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) in San Mateo, Calif., and Pleasanton, Calif.-based Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV) are two prominent players in the cloud-computing industry. SNOW provides a cloud-based data platform that enables customers to consolidate data into a single source to drive business insights, build data-driven applications and share data. In comparison, VEEV provides cloud-based software solutions for the global life sciences industry. The company offers enterprise applications, multichannel platforms, customer relationships, and content management solutions.
Because the resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the spread of its Delta variant is causing delays in office-reopening plans, cloud companies are expected to witness high demand for their products and services. Furthermore, amid the ongoing digital transformation of almost every industry, the need for safe and efficient cloud platforms should drive the cloud industry’s growth. The cloud computing market is expected to grow at an 18% CAGR to $303.07 billion by 2025. So, both SNOW and VEEV should benefit.

(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc on Monday proposed a plan for a flexible benefits fund for app-based ride-hail and food delivery drivers in Canada under which all gig industry players would share data on workers' hours and earnings.
Under the preliminary proposal outlined in a company blog post https://ubr.to/3t196jm, the fund would provide gig workers with cash benefits to put toward a retirement or life insurance plan, or to pay for educational or dental and health benefits not covered by Canada's universal healthcare system.
The benefits fund would be enabled by Canada's provincial governments, Uber (NYSE:UBER) said in the blog post without providing further details, but managed by ride-hail and delivery companies.
The companies would share data on drivers' hours and earnings and pay into the fund proportionally. Workers would qualify for fund benefits if they meet a threshold, which Uber's Monday proposal did not disclose. 
Uber in a statement said it welcomed discussions with other industry players, adding the benefits fund was part of a recent Ontario government submission.
DoorDash Inc in a statement said it welcomed other stakeholders who wanted to provide workers with benefits while maintaining their flexibility, but did not directly comment on Uber's plan.
 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Just Eat Takeaway.com's Grubhub did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Uber said it advocates for benefits funds everywhere, but added that labor laws, social safety nets and different cultures meant it would pursue a different approach in every country, with Monday's proposal tailored to Canada.
Gig companies have long been criticized for the lack of benefits and protections they offer their independent contractor workers. Many labor unions, some lawmakers and the Biden administration have said gig workers should be reclassified as employees. 
The companies have also faced several lawsuits in Canada and the United States alleging worker misclassification.
The companies have rejected calls for reclassification, saying surveys showed the majority of their workers do not want to be employees. 
In recent years, the companies have suggested limited benefit models while maintaining workers' contractor status, including in California where voters approved such a proposal last year.

The companies at times have argued apportioning benefits is complicated by the fact that many drivers work for multiple platforms at once.
In a March blog post https://ubr.to/3gLQSgG outlining its initial Canadian proposal, Uber advocated for industry-wide reforms that held every company to the same standards.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 04:10PM ET</span>","McDonald's, others consider closing indoor seating amid Delta surge in U.S","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some U.S. fast-food restaurants are closing indoor seating areas or limiting hours of operation because of the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19, according to franchisees.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) had temporarily closed indoor dining at nearly all U.S. locations in early 2020, but it reopened 70% by last month. The global burger chain said on July 28 that it was on track to open nearly 100% by Labor Day - barring any COVID-19 resurgence.
But last week, McDonald's instructed its franchisees on steps they should take to re-close their dining rooms in areas where the Delta variant is rapidly spreading, according to internal company materials seen by Reuters. 
""We have a much deeper sense of what actions make a difference for the safety of our restaurant teams and crew,"" McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said during a Wednesday meeting, according to the materials.
In Wednesday's conference call, McDonald's executives recommended franchisees consider closing indoor seating in counties where COVID cases exceed 250 per 100,000 people on a rolling three-week average.
The materials did not specify how many locations have shut indoor seating or could soon do so.
One McDonald's franchisee who operates multiple locations told Reuters it had to bar indoor seating at several restaurants. 
But expected closures are fewer than the number that shuttered in spring of 2020, when the pandemic first hit the United States.
""We’re monitoring the impact of the Delta variant closely and recently convened together with our franchisees to underscore existing safety protocols, reinforce our people first approach and provide updates on the rise in cases in the country,"" McDonald's Corp said in a statement on Friday. 
Top U.S. health officials said on Friday that U.S. cases of the coronavirus continue to rise amid the fast-spreading Delta variant. Vaccination rates were also higher, they said.
Deaths and cases were up 11% and 3% respectively over the past seven days nationwide, with hospitalizations up 6% over the past week to an eight-month high, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.
Drive-thru, carry-out and delivery helped fast-food sales rise this year despite shuttered dining rooms. But franchisees told Reuters that sales went up further when indoor seating reopened. 

PMTD Restaurants had to cut hours in a few of its nearly 40 KFC and Taco Bell restaurants in Alabama and Georgia because they were short-staffed when several employees became infected with COVID-19, according to Bill Byrd, president of PMTD Restaurants. 
That impacts Taco Bell locations in particular, because closing at 8 p.m. instead of midnight or later means the restaurants lose late-night customers, who can make up 20% of business, Byrd said.

(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) is providing its controversial and expensive new Alzheimer's drug free of charge for some patients amid slow claim reviews by Medicare, according to sources familiar with the situation, including a doctor treating patients with the drug.
The development underscores the division among doctors about whether the $56,000-a-year drug helps patients and how uncertainty about reimbursement from Medicare, the U.S. government health plan for people over age 65, has held back prescriptions and sales. Aduhelm, which is given as a monthly infusion, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June even though one of Biogen's two large clinical trials failed to show a benefit for patients diagnosed with the incurable mind-wasting disease. 
In order to expedite treatment, Biogen has begun to provide Florida's First Choice Neurology with free-of-charge Aduhelm, according to Dr. Jeffrey Gelblum, a neurologist at the center's Aventura, Florida, operations.
""We have been using the Biogen access program - it is almost like a sample program - to get patients started,"" he told Reuters.
Biogen has said it has a number of plans in place to support patient access, but did not give further details.
Pharmaceutical companies can provide free medications through patient assistance programs, ""however we have never heard of that for an injectable, infused drug,"" Steven Lucio, vice president at Vizient Inc, which works with about half of U.S. hospitals to buy drugs, said in an email.
James Chambers, a researcher at the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said providing free medications is a common strategy drugmakers use to boost patient prescription numbers.
HOSPITALS SLOW TO USE
A number of hospitals, as well as the Veterans Health Administration https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-veterans-health-administration-turns-down-biogen-alzheimers-drug-2021-08-11, have said there is not enough evidence to justify widespread use of Aduhelm. Several commercial insurers https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biogen-alzheimers-drug-hits-roadblocks-with-some-hospitals-insurers-2021-07-15, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), the largest private insurer offering Medicare Advantage coverage to seniors, have said they are waiting for further direction from Medicare before covering the drug.
""Mainly because of the uncertainty around insurance coverage ... most doctors and systems are in a holding pattern,"" said Dr. Anton Porsteinsson, director of the University of Rochester Alzheimer's Disease Care, Research and Education Program, which is only using Aduhelm, also known as aducanumab, on patients enrolled in clinical trials. 
A recent survey of 78 neurologists conducted by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) found that half were willing to prescribe Aduhelm, but nearly two-thirds don't think the FDA should have approved the drug. Just eight of the surveyed neurologists had prescribed Aduhelm and six of their Medicare claims had been paid as of early August.
Florida's First Choice has so far infused more than 30 patients with Aduhelm, but only the first doses for two patients were billed to Medicare - their second doses, and first doses for the others, were provided at no cost by Biogen, Dr. Gelblum said. 
He said the clinic has been reimbursed by Medicare for the infusion component of claims, but not for the medication itself, although he expects that to happen within the next couple of weeks.
Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people eligible for Aduhelm are covered by Medicare, which recently launched https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-starts-review-national-medicare-coverage-policy-biogens-aduhelm-2021-07-12 a nine-month process to determine standardized national coverage terms for the drug. 
For now, the government health plan is processing Aduhelm claims on a case-by-case basis.
In addition to the medication itself, costs of administering Aduhelm include diagnostic testing for Alzheimer's and monitoring for side effects such as dangerous brain swelling. 
Experts say Medicare could seek to lower https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biogen-alzheimers-drug-slow-take-off-us-medicare-wrestles-with-coverage-2021-07-21 the therapy's cost to taxpayers by limiting access to the treatment, linking coverage to real-world evidence of patient outcomes, or setting a fixed payment that combines drug reimbursement with other costs related to the treatment.

Aduhelm, developed in partnership with Japan's Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd, comes in two vial sizes of 300 milligrams (mg) and 170 mg. Patients are started out on a low dose, which is increased over time to the full dose of 10 mg per kg of a patient's weight.
Sales of the drug are forecast to total $81 million this year, $1.3 billion next year and $5.8 billion by 2026, according to Wall Street analysts polled by Refinitiv.

Investing.com -- Stocks notched more intraday record highs on Monday, fueled by technology as investors stopped worrying so much about the Federal Reserve’s eventual and expected move to taper its bond buying.
The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite both reached records and remained positive heading into the final minutes of trading. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped to an all-time high and other big tech stocks likeAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained. 
High-growth tech stocks do better in a low-rate environment because their value derives from future earnings, which are eroded as rates rise. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday the central bank would continue to be cautious in its approach to tapering its stimulus program and that easing away from bond buying doesn’t mean a rate hike anytime soon.
Everyone is waiting for the big economic report of the week: Friday is the day the Labor Department issues the jobs report for August. It comes as the federal pandemic unemployment assistance is scheduled to expire in the states that haven’t stopped paying it already.
The jobs report, economists say, could set the stage for the Fed's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting.
That’s the blockbuster news of the week, aside from the recovery of the Gulf coast’s energy industry after Hurricane Ida slammed ashore over the weekend as one of the most powerful storms to hit the U.S. mainland. Millions are still without power in the region, and the oil and gas industry remains offline for the time being. Crude prices ticked only modestly higher on Monday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Zoom earnings
 Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) is expected to announce after Monday's closing bell it had second-quarter earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $991.21 million. The company was one of the pandemic winners and analysts will be listening for its outlook now that people are preparing to return to school and office life.
2. Crowdstrike earnings
 Crowdstrike Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:CRWD) is seen posting on Tuesday revenue of $323.25 million and earnings per share of 8 cents for the second quarter.
3. Consumer confidence
Consumer confidence is expected to see a sharp erosion in August. As per current estimates, the Conference Board is expected to report Tuesday a slip in its consumer confidence index to 124 for the month, down from 129.1 in July. The fall comes after the index rose for six straight months. The data are due to be released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).

(Reuters) - Oil and gas pipeline operators on Monday checked for damage after Hurricane Ida hit major energy hubs as a Category 4 storm on Sunday and caused widespread power outages.
Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) said it was mobilizing crews to assess its facilities and had declared it was temporarily suspending some contacts under force majeure on two offshore pipelines, according to the company and shipper notices. 
Its pipelines were not operating because offshore oil and gas production remained halted at the platforms it services, a spokesperson said. 
""Production remains shut in to our offshore facilities; our onshore assets are operating,"" the spokesperson said.
The force majeure contract suspensions were in effect for its Nautilus Pipeline and Mississippi Canyon Gas Pipeline, according to shipper notices. 
""Enbridge is in the process of reviewing the status of its employees in the areas impacted by Hurricane Ida. There is currently no ETA on getting employees back out to inspect facilities,"" the notices said.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Delta variant makes people sicker
The Delta variant of the coronavirus is known to be more easily transmissible https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/delta-coronavirus-variant-believed-have-60-transmission-advantage-uk-2021-06-09 than earlier versions, and now a large UK study suggests it also makes people sicker. Researchers analyzed data on 43,338 patients infected with either the Alpha or the Delta variant. Overall, roughly three quarters were unvaccinated, and half were under age 31. After accounting for patients' underlying risk factors, researchers found that unvaccinated patients were 132% more likely to be hospitalized if they were infected with Delta than with Alpha. Vaccinated patients may also be more likely to require hospitalization with a Delta infection, but data for those patients was less clear, according to a report published on Friday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases https:// The results ""suggest that outbreaks of the Delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on healthcare services than the Alpha variant,"" the researchers concluded.
Oral drug shows promise against COVID-19 pneumonia
Severely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who received the experimental oral drug opaganib developed by RedHill Biopharma (NASDAQ:RDHL) required less extra oxygen and were able to leave the hospital sooner than patients receiving a placebo in a small randomized trial, researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv https:// ahead of peer review. Within 14 days after enrolling in the study, 50.0% of patients taking opaganib no longer needed oxygen, compared to 22.2% of patients in the placebo group. In addition, 86.4% of opaganib-treated patients had been discharged, versus 55.6% in the placebo group. On Thursday, RedHill announced that opaganib strongly inhibits the Delta variant of the coronavirus in test tube experiments. The drug is believed to exert its antiviral effect by inhibiting sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2), a key enzyme in cells that may be recruited by the virus to support its replication, the company said. Based on the initial 42-patient trial conducted last year, RedHill Biopharma launched a much larger randomized trial in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The last of the 475 patients in that late-stage study has now completed treatment and some of the data should be available soon, the company said last week.
Seizure in children may signal COVID-19

Seizures may be the only symptom of COVID-19 in some children, a new report cautions. Children tend to get sick from COVID-19 far less often than adults, and their symptoms are usually not severe, mainly consisting of fever and mild respiratory issues, although more have become ill with emergence of the Delta variant. Among 175 children who came to an Israeli emergency room and were diagnosed with COVID-19, 11 were brought to the hospital because of seizures, researchers reported on Saturday in the medical journal Seizure https:// Only seven had previously been diagnosed with a neurological disorder, and only six had fever. All 11 made full recoveries. While seizures have not been a frequently reported problem in adults with COVID-19, they ""may be the main manifestation of acute COVID-19 in children,"" even without fever and without a history of epilepsy, the study authors said. In some hospitals, they point out, only children with flu-like symptoms or close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient get tested for the coronavirus. Medical personnel should be aware that children with seizures should be tested, too, they said.

But with limited potential federal investments to boost the industry’s growth, we think fundamentally weak EV stocks Enovix Corporation (ENVX), FREYR Battery (FREY), and CBAK Energy Technology (CBAT) are best avoided now. Read on.Governments worldwide have announced ambitious plans to phase out internal combustion powered vehicles over the next couple of decades. As a result, the electric vehicles (EV) industry is witnessing unprecedented private and federal capital investments. For example, president Biden recently signed an executive order to ensure that half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. are electric by 2030. For this purpose, the government has allocated $7.50 billion from its $1 trillion infrastructure bill to fund the development of EV infrastructure.
However, this investment falls short of the estimated $50 billion needed to reach the production and sales target.
In addition, a global semiconductor chip shortage has harmed the EV industry with increased production costs and supply chain bottlenecks.

The growing demand and short-term supply bottlenecks due to Hurricane Ida are currently driving the rally in oil prices Therefore, we think the shares of extraction companies  SilverBow  (SBOW), VAALCO (EGY),  Amplify Energy  (NYSE:AMPY), and Barnwell (BRN) should benefit significantly in the near term. Let’s discuss.
With fuel demand rising to its highest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil prices witnessed a golden cross last week, which has happened only three times since the beginning of this century. A robust oil price rally has usually followed such uptrends. Analysts forecast oil prices to rally about 50%. Despite concerns surrounding the COVID-19 Delta variant, unprecedented fuel demand is expected to help the energy sector thrive.
Also, U.S. gasoline futures have risen slightly due to the impact of hurricane Ida in the Southern United States and Mexico. Fifteen percent of the total U.S. oil imports are from Gulf of Mexico refineries, which have been closed temporarily ahead of the hurricane, causing oil prices to rise.
Given the surging oil prices, we think leading extraction stocks SilverBow Resources, Inc. (NYSE:SBOW), VAALCO Energy, Inc. (EGY), Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY), and Barnwell Industries, Inc. (BRN) are poised to rally in the coming months.

The SEC charged KMS Financial Services, five units of financial firm Cetera, and two units of Cambridge Investment Research for failures to adopt and implement cybersecurity policies and procedures that resulted in email account takeovers exposing the personal information of thousands of customers and clients at each firm.

Cetera, Cambridge and KMS did not respond immediately to requests for comment. None of the firms admitted to or denied the findings, the SEC said in a statement. 
The Cetera entities agreed to pay $300,000, Cambridge agreed to pay $250,000 and KMS will pay $200,000, the SEC said.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told a U.S. House committee in May that the agency was going to mandate strengthening a key part on those engines. Those planes have been grounded for more than six months.
A Boeing spokesman said Monday it was ""working closely with the FAA, our customers and Pratt & Whitney to safely return PW4000-112-powered 777 airplanes to service. We have identified design changes and are working to finalize them, including a robust certification effort.""
The FAA said its ""safety review is ongoing.""
The United Airlines flight was heading to Honolulu in February when it suffered an engine failure. The Boeing 777-200 plane landed safely at Denver International Airport soon after takeoff.
A United spokesman said Monday it expects ""these aircraft to return to service but providing anything beyond that in terms of timelines would be premature.""
United Chief Commercial officer Andrew Nocella had said in July the airline was ""really disappointed"" they were not able to fly 777s with the PW engines. 
""The 777 aircrafts that are grounded are large capacity domestic movers. And we used those for Hawaii and hub-to-hub. And so right now, we're flying well below where we like to be in Hawaii,"" he said. ""We really want those aircraft back.""

United is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 such planes.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday the 777s may not fly until early 2022.

677,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",4 Hot Financial Stocks to Buy This Month,"A decent increase in demand for credit and financial transactions on the back of a rapid economic recovery has propelled the financial services sector to a strong rebound this year. So, we think it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound financial stocks Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY), Santander Consumer USA (NYSE:SC),  SEI Investments  (SEIC), and Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG). They are each well-positioned to benefit from the increasing financial transactions and capital market activities. So, let’s examine these names.The financial services industry was among the severely impacted industries last year as weak credit demand, low interest rates, and diminished economic activity reduced the revenues of most industry participants. However, the industry is rebounding solidly due to increasing investor participation in the capital markets.
Last week, the major market indices hit fresh all-time highs as the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that an interest rate hike is highly unlikely in the near term. Though this announcement may not be favorable to the financial services sector, rising financial transactions with economic activities returning to pre-pandemic levels should boost the industry’s growth. Furthermore, the federal government’s efforts to relax some capital and liquidity requirements to help accelerate lending should support the industry’s recovery.
With these factors in mind, we believe the shares of established financial companies Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (JKHY), Santander (MC:SAN) Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (SC), SEI Investments Company (NASDAQ:SEIC), and Janus Henderson Group plc (JHG), which have been witnessing strong momentum lately, could be solid bets now.

Investing.com – Levi Strauss stock (NYSE:LEVI) traded 1.5% higher Monday following an overweight rating by  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) which put a tag of $31 on the share, a nearly 13% upside from its current level.
Analyst Ike Boruchow initiated the coverage of Levi as “one of the higher quality global brands in our space today.”
According to the analyst, a new multi-year topline growth in denim has begun and is in its early innings.
“Specifically, demand for ‘loose t’ product is gathering momentum, which is a positive development for the denim category overall, and Levi in particular, given its number 1 share position globally,"" the analyst wrote in a note.
The analyst believes silhouette or ‘t’ trends tend to last longer and is thus a clear category tailwind for Levi today.
“With multiple margin tailwinds all gaining momentum at the same time (including direct-to-consumer shift, increased focus on women's, China model ramp-up, and e-comm profitability inflection), we believe a 14%-16% margin is very much on the table for the business,” he added.
The recent acquisition of Beyond Yoga provides entry into one of the fastest-growing categories within apparel: athleisure, the analyst said. “More notably, it adds greater visibility into ramping up the company's higher-margin women's business”."

683,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 11:54AM ET</span>",EU to Reimpose Travel Curbs on U.S. Amid Rise in New Covid Cases,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union countries voted to reimpose restrictions on non-essential travel from the U.S. amid a surge in new coronavirus cases, dealing a fresh blow to the tourism industry.
A qualified majority of ambassadors voted to reintroduce the curbs, which had been lifted in June, according to an EU statement.
The U.S. had 588 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the two weeks ending Aug. 22, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, well above the limit of 75 set out in the EU guidelines.
The guidance from the bloc is a recommendation and any decision on who to let in, and what restrictions to impose, ultimately rests with the governments of each member state. Countries can also choose to accept proof of vaccination to waive travel restrictions. 
While countries have largely followed the EU guidelines, there have been times when individual nations have diverged from them.
The move to restrict visitors from the world’s largest economy is a significant setback for airlines and travel firms who have been pressing for a full reopening of lucrative transatlantic routes. Shares of Air France-KLM, IAG (LON:ICAG) SA and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) all came under pressure last week on news of the vote. 
Israel, Montenegro, Kosovo, Lebanon and North Macedonia were also removed from the list. 
Travel between the EU and U.S. has been a point of political contention. The Biden administration has kept border restrictions in place despite pressure to allow visitors from allies like the EU that have eased their own curbs. U.S. officials have cited rising delta infections as one reason for that stance.
EU rules specify that for third-countries to be allowed non-essential travel into the bloc the trend of new cases should be stable or decreasing and that no more than 4% of those tested for the virus are positive. The latest U.S. numbers represent the seventh consecutive increase. 
The guidelines also take into account whether variants of concern have been detected in a particular nation and whether it has reciprocated on opening travel.
Germany classified the U.S. as a high-risk area as of Aug. 15, meaning visitors need to show they’ve been vaccinated, have recovered from the disease or present a negative test result.  
France, Spain, Italy and Belgium also require some kind of test to show the traveler has Covid antibodies or proof of vaccination. But none have imposed quarantine rules.

In addition, according to Trading Economics data, U.S. retail sales in July declined 1.1% from the prior month.
However, the department store industry is expected to continue gaining in the coming quarters on the back of increasing demand for consumer goods and strengthening online platforms and delivery systems. According to Statista, department stores and other general merchandise stores are expected to generate $2.18 trillion by 2025.

However, some cannabis operators have been unable to capitalize on the industry tailwinds due to their shaky fundamentals. With this in mind, we believe that investors are better off avoiding the following stocks in the coming months:  GrowGeneration  (NASDAQ:GRWG), 4Front Ventures (OTC:FFNTF), Charlotte's Web Holdings (OTC:CWBHF),  Acreage  Holdings (OTC:ACRGF) (ACRHF). Let’s discuss these names.The cannabis industry continues to maintain steady momentum with the rising consumption of recreational and medical marijuana and growing support for decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level. With 36 states and four territories approving cannabis products for medical use, the changing legal landscape has boosted investors’ optimism about the industry.
Because Congress is perceived to be on the verge of decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level to unwind the decades-old war on weed, several pot stocks are gaining momentum. However, not all cannabis companies are poised to capitalize on the legalization of cannabis in the United States.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid cannabis stocks with weak growth prospects and bleak financials. Accordingly, we believe GrowGeneration Corp. (GRWG), 4Front Ventures Corp. (FFNTF), Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. (CWBHF), and Acreage Holdings, Inc. (ACRHF) are best avoided now.

(Reuters) -Sea Ltd's Shopee took just two years to become Brazil's most-downloaded shopping app, winning users to its low-cost marketplace with its game-changing approach to e-commerce: in-app mini-games offering coupons to winning users.
The Singapore-based company has combined online shopping with the gaming nous of its separate mobile game arm Garena - creator of ""Free Fire"", Brazil's most-downloaded title for eight consecutive quarters - to generate sales analysts estimated at almost a third of local champion Magazine Luiza SA.
Back home, Shopee only needed five years to become Southeast Asia's most-visited e-commerce website, overtaking the likes of Lazada, backed by China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, and Tokopedia, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.
""Shopee has a track record in Southeast Asia of coming into the market late, looking at how others have solved existing problems and then building a system to leapfrog those issues,"" said analyst Jianggan Li at advisory firm Momentum Works. 
Shopee's early surge highlights the space left for foreign entrants to grow in a sector once dominated by regional firms like Magazine Luiza and Argentina's  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc.
To be sure, the startup's timing was fortuitous, launching in Brazil just as the COVID-19 pandemic drove consumers away from physical stores, pushing up 2020 e-commerce sales by 44% to $42 billion, showed data from Brazilian payments company EBANX.
Shopee - akin to Alibaba's AliExpress, carrying Chinese-made knick-knacks - emerged as Brazil's top app by downloads and time spent in use, showed data from analytics platform App Annie.
Shopee said in a comment to Reuters following the initial publication of this story that it now has more local domestic sellers in Brazil than cross-border sellers. 
Yet, in pursuit of growth, Shopee is still losing money, propped up by Sea's profitable gaming division. In the second quarter of this year, Garena posted an adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $740.9 million even as the e-commerce arm lost $579.8 million.
""Money being generated by one side of the business, which is a cash cow, is being reinvested aggressively in Brazilian e-commerce - with success,"" said Itau BBA analyst Thiago Macruz.
GLOBAL AMBITION 
Sea's Brazil foray is just one element of its global ambition. Investment arm Sea Capital is also considering putting money into startups in Latin America and beyond, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified.
The firm has also taken Shopee to Chile, Colombia and Mexico where, unlike Brazil, it has no locally based staff and so has partnered social media influencers to increase brand awareness, said two people familiar with the matter.
Sea, whose shareholders include Chinese gaming leader Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, declined to comment.
The firm has disclosed little data about Shopee Brazil, but Itau BBA analysts estimated the value of goods and services sold on the platform last year hit 12 billion reais ($2.27 billion).
The average price on its marketplace is 40 reais, other estimates showed, less than a third that of e-commerce leader MercadoLibre, which often carries higher-value branded products.
Sea's biggest challenge for Shopee Brazil is delivery in such a vast country. It reduced its reliance on the local postal system this year in favor of private carriers, but is still competing against rivals with proprietary delivery services.
Shopee aims to have one main logistics partner per country in the region, a company source told Reuters.
The company itself expects e-commerce growth in the region to spawn more delivery partnerships, as happened in Southeast Asia, Sea executives told analysts on a call this month.
On the same call, Group Chief Corporate Officer Yanjun Wang called Brazil ""a good market for continued investment.""
LOCAL SELLERS
Competition in Latin America's largest economy stepped up this month when Shopee's nearest rival in terms of product offering, AliExpress, opened up its marketplace to domestic sellers charging single-digit commission. AliExpress had been in Brazil for 11 years; Shopee did similarly after its first year.
Small-business owner Luciana Carvalho began selling plastic packaging products on Shopee in February, attracted by the free shipping and 6% commission - compared with MercadoLibre's 17%.
""It's easy to sign up, calculate your commission, get your delivery tags, your receipts. It makes us invest more in the platform,"" she said.
In a move toward profitability, Shopee has since raised commission to 18% - as much as twice marketplaces can charge in some Southeast Asian countries, indicating Latin America's potential profit margins. Carvalho continues to use Shopee, though she prefers MercadoLibre for its ""unbeatable"" delivery.
To further improve profitability, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said Shopee could start selling higher-ticket items, as it has in Southeast Asia. Momentum Works' Li expects Shopee to add financial services to its Brazil app as it has in Indonesia.

""I wouldn't be surprised,"" if they reached number one, said Li, ""Given what they have done in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, Thailand.""

FTC Chair Lina Khan is directing staff to identify new legal theories to challenge retail fuel station mergers and investigate possible collusion by national chains to push up prices, she said in an Aug. 25 letter to White House economic adviser Brian Deese obtained by Bloomberg.
The FTC also plans to impose “prior approval” requirements to deter oil and gas mergers, including in retail gas markets, that could be illegal.
“Over the last few decades, retail fuel station chains have repeatedly proposed illegal mergers, suggesting that the agency’s approach has not deterred firms from proposing anticompetitive transactions in the first place,” Khan said.
The FTC is planning to ratchet up investigations into abuses in the retail fuel station franchise market, she added.
“We will need to determine whether the power imbalance favoring large national chains allows them to force their franchisees to sell gasoline at higher prices, benefitting the chain at the expense of the franchisee’s convenience store operations,” Khan said.
Khan said the decision to toughen requirements was prompted by “significant consolidation” in the industry during recent years. But the decision also comes as oil prices have become a political liability for President Joe Biden, heightened by fresh concerns that Hurricane Ida could further push up prices at the pump.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, mindful that a strong August labor market report at the end of this week could easily precipitate the first tightening of monetary policy since the pandemic began.
In a keenly-awaited speech on Friday, the Federal Reserve Chairman had left the door open to starting the wind-down of the central bank's asset purchases already this year, saying yet again that the state of the jobs market would be decisive in tipping the Fed's hand when the time comes. While Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and others now expect an announcement on 'tapering' bond purchases at the Fed's policy meeting in November, some believe that another strong gain in nonfarm payrolls would be enough to make the Fed's meeting in September a 'live' one. 
""If job figures exceed expectations, we anticipate a tapering announcement already by September’s FOMC and beginning as soon as October,"" said Saxo Bank analysts in a morning note. ""In that case, we will see yields rising and the yield curve steepening with the 10-year yields rising as high as 1.5% ahead of the Fed meeting. In case job numbers disappoint, tapering may be delayed, something that could push Treasury yields as low as 1.12%, they argued, adding that ""any rally would be short-lived, as we expect a revival of reflation trade in autumn.""
By 9:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14 points, or less than 0.1%, at 35,442 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was outperforming with a gain of 0.4%.
 Affirm Holdings  (NASDAQ:AFRM) was the most conspicuous of early winners, rising over 43% after announcing that Amazon will carry its buy-now-pay-later solutions on its website. It's the latest eye-catching deal involving a segment of the fintech sector that has become increasingly fashionable, although it is nowhere near as big as Square's recent $29 billion bid for Australia's Afterpay. Swedish BNPL fintech Klarna meanwhile was valued at $45 billion in the funding round it completed earlier this month.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 0.8%, meanwhile.
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 4.0% after the discovery of more contaminated shots of its Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. Some 3.6 million shots of Moderna's vaccine have now been suspended. 
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock also edged 0.2% lower after The Wall Street Journal reported it had tried and failed to mediate with two women before one of them filed a suit against an ABC News executive for sexual harassment. Disney was also in the news after reports suggesting its ESPN unit wants to tie up licensing agreements worth up to $3 billion with gambling firms such as DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR).

The move by the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a drive by Beijing to strengthen control over its society and key sectors of its economy, including tech, education and property.
Bike-sharing and joint use of portable powerbanks to charge mobile phones are two popular sectors in the sharing economy. 
SAMR said its stricter oversight would include regulating powerbank sharing platforms and making their pricing systems transparent.
The regulator also said it was investigating food delivery giant Meituan for not reporting its acquisition of bike-sharing startup Mobike in 2018 for antitrust review.

Meituan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier on Monday, Meituan warned in a regulatory filing it might be required to pay ""significant"" antitrust fines.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is up more than 20% this year and has rallied more than 90% since a plunge near the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. Some investors are concerned that such a high valuation may not be sustainable, with the delta variant still hindering growth in some businesses. 
A “still good” economy means that stocks will “generally go up,” Doll,  chief investment officer at Crossmark Global Investments Inc., said in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s Surveillance on Monday.   “A good economy means good earnings so the path of least resistance has been and likely will continue to be to the upside.”
Other than the effect of the delta variant, Doll sees reasons for some caution “at the margin,” including third-quarter earnings estimates that peaked in early August, a break in a 12-month pattern where estimates continued to rise, he said. 
Also, in terms of the breadth of stock-market strength, “the average stock peaked in June,” said Doll, former chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management who earlier was chief equity strategist at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).. “What’s that telling us? It’s telling us the market’s getting a little tired.”
Still, companies have showed resilience throughout a pandemic that locked down parts of the economy for months at a time. The Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy and federal fiscal stimulus have helped maintain both earnings and stock prices.
“If you had told me there are more companies in the S&P 500 that would benefit from covid than would be hurt, I wouldn’t have believed you,” Doll said. “But that’s exactly what happened. Corporations are figuring out how to morph. They’re dealing with very low interest rates. They learned how to raise prices in an environment where pricing power is coming back. They’ve kept costs down. Corporations have morphed in lots of ways that cause them to print these excellent earnings reports.”

“Reviewing flight data and video, two things are very clear - 1) An engine shut down right after launch 2) Everything that happened next made me incredibly proud of our team. Space may be hard, but like this rocket, we are not giving up,” Astra Chief Executive Officer Chris Kemp tweeted.


This was Astra’s third attempt at putting a rocket in the orbit, none of which has successfully reached orbit.
Something appeared to go wrong right at the start, as Launch Vehicle 0006 lurched sideways at the liftoff, instead of smoothly taking off the pad. The rocket managed to recover on its own as it soared.

Meituan, China's eighth largest company by market value, has faced regulatory heat as authorities crack down on the country's sprawling platform economy.
China's State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) launched an antitrust probe into the company in April, focussing on forcing restaurants and other merchants to use its platform exclusively.
SAMR also said on Monday it would further regulate the sharing economy sector and that it has been investigating Meituan not reporting its acquisition of bike-sharing startup Mobike in 2018 for antitrust review.
Meituan said in its earnings report that it was actively cooperating with SAMR in the ongoing investigation and that it could be required to ""make changes to its business practices and/or be subject to a significant amount of fines"".
The Tencent-backed company reported a 2.21 billion yuan ($341.8 million) loss in the April-June period versus a profit of 2.72 billion yuan a year earlier.
It has been expanding aggressively into hotel booking and community group-buying, taking on such rivals as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD).
Meituan said its total revenue rose 77% in the quarter from a year earlier to 43.76 billion yuan.
That compared with a 42.32 billion yuan average estimate of 15 analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
Revenue in Meituan's core food delivery business rose 59% year-over-year to 23.13 billion yuan. 
In July, a set of guidelines announced by SAMR required food delivery platforms to guarantee their workers with insurance, causing investor concerns about the rising cost of employing riders.
The company will strictly follow the guidelines, Wang Xing said on a conference call, adding Meituan will introduce ""compulsory breaks"" for delivery riders. 

Meituan will implement the government's pilot programme for occupational injury insurance for flexible workers as early as this third quarter, according to a recent report by China Merchants Securities.

(Reuters) - When stay-at-home favorite Zoom reports quarterly results on Monday, Wall Street will look for details on how the video conferencing platform plans to attract more users as its meteoric growth brakes to its slowest rate since going public.
Zoom's revenue growth has been decelerating as the economy slowly reopens, users complain of ""Zoom-fatigue"" and as vaccinated people return to school and offices. 
Zoom's revenue growth slows https://graphics.reuters.com/ZOOM-RESULTS/zdpxoojmevx/index.html 
Wall Street analysts expect revenue to grow only 49% in the to-be-reported quarter, compared with multiple-fold growth rates in the past year.
Zoom raked in millions of new users as the pandemic forced more people to work, study and communicate with friends and family remotely.
The company is now looking to win bigger contracts from businesses, an area dominated by rivals like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)'s Slack.
""Long term, we expect Zoom will grow into a broader enterprise communication and collaboration platform,"" said Rishi Jaluria, RBC Capital Markets analyst.
THE CONTEXT
""The company's 'Act 2.0' is Zoom Phone,"" Piper Sandler analyst James Fish said. ""We're seeing a massive acceleration in on-premise to cloud-based voice solutions, which favors vendors like Zoom.""
Zoom Phone is a cloud-based phone system, which allows users to make calls across devices and help businesses manage activities like queuing and recording calls in-house. It has more than 400,000 customers.
Over the last two months, Zoom has said it would buy Kites GmbH, a firm that helps in real-time language translation and announced its largest deal - a $14.7 billion buyout of cloud-based call-center software provider Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) to double down on the service.
""The enterprise side of the market is only 15% migrated to cloud phones,"" says Needham analyst Ryan Koontz.
However, Zoom faces a two-pronged challenge with fierce competition from Cisco, Microsoft and Salesforce and the post-pandemic weakening in user traffic growth, although a hybrid working world is likely to keep demand up. 
THE FUNDAMENTALS 
* Analysts estimate Zoom's second-quarter revenue to grow 49% to $991 million.

Investing.com – Affirm stock (NASDAQ:AFRM) climbed 40% in Monday’s premarket trading following the company’s tie-up with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which will allow it to offer its ‘buy now, pay later’ option to the online retailer’s customers.
Amazon and Affirm are testing with select customers now, and in the coming months, the option will be more broadly available to customers, according to a note by the latter on Friday.
Amazon customers will get the option to split the total cost of purchases of $50 or more into simple monthly payments by using Affirm. Approved customers are shown the total cost of their purchase upfront and will never pay more than what they agree to at checkout, the note said. Consumers will not be charged any late or hidden fees.
‘Buy now, pay later’ option has been the mainstay of credit card companies’ business model for decades. However, the emergence of fintech companies has now added a new edge to it as companies, with access to troves of user data and ability to mine it in a jiffy, are able to offer more customized offerings to their customers."

The e-Palettes were halted after one of the vehicles collided with and injured a visually impaired Japanese athlete at a junction last week, prompting a YouTube video https://youtu.be/QJXhG_hFNK4 apology from Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda.
""The vehicle's sensor detected the pedestrian crossing and activated the automatic brake, and the operator also activated the emergency brake. The vehicle and pedestrians, however, came into contact before it came to a complete halt,"" Toyota said in a statement on Monday.
Aramitsu Kitazono was not seriously injured in the incident, but had to pull out of the Games judo event on Saturday because of cuts and bruises, further embarrassing the Japanese company, which along with other global automakers is trying to develop autonomous vehicles that can operate safely on public roads.
The e-Palette, a fully autonomous battery-electric vehicle, was adapted specifically for use during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, with large doors and electric ramps to allow groups of athletes to board quickly.
Operators will now be given control over how fast the vehicles travel with two safety staff members, rather than one, on board to look out for pedestrians, a Toyota spokesperson said. 

Warning sounds on e-Palettes will also be turned up and pedestrian guides at busy crossings in the athletes village will also be increased to 20 from six said the company, which is cooperating with a local police probe to determine the cause of the accident. 
The 2020 Paralympic Games began on Tuesday in Tokyo, even as Japan struggles with its worst COVID-19 outbreak, with record daily cases and an overwhelmed health service.

Investing.com – Munich Re (OTC:MURGY) and  Swiss Re  (OTC:SSREY) stocks (SIX:SRENH) traded lower Monday as Hurricane Ida sweeps through New Orleans and leads to worries that two of the world’s largest reinsurers may have to cough up billions in claims.
Munich Re traded 1.2% lower in Frankfurt and Swiss Re 1% down in Zurich.
Ida made landfall near New Orleans Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest to hit the area since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It has brought strong winds and rains with it.
New Orleans is currently without power after it was hit with ""catastrophic transmission damage,"" the city office said in a tweet Sunday.
Data from CoreLogic suggested that nearly 1 million homes along the Gulf Coast between Alabama and Louisiana were at risk of damage. In New Orleans alone, the replacement cost value of those homes totaled nearly $100 billion, CoreLogic said.
The Hurricane has left at least one dead and 1 million without power in Louisiana, according to a CNN report.
The CNN report said Ida will now move as a category 1 storm into Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia, and there could be significant rainfall still.

709,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>","Moderna, BioNTech Rally Stalls Ahead of CDC Meeting on Boosters","(Bloomberg) -- The huge rally for Covid-19 vaccine makers has stalled as Wall Street waits for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to weigh in on whether Americans should get a third shot. 
On Monday, a meeting of outside advisers to the agency could finally give investors a sense of clarity.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., which became the best performer in the S&P 500 Index after its stock price more than tripled this year, has slid 21% from its record high in early August. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), which has surged more than four-fold in 2021, has fallen almost as much over the past three weeks, while its U.S. partner,  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE), is off more than 7% from its peak. 
The retreat comes as the pace of the American inoculation campaign slows, leaving investors divided over how much growth to expect from the manufacturers. That rift has only deepened after President Joe Biden administration promised that booster shots will be made available to most Americans, which would be a major source of demand if regulators endorse that step. 
The administration’s aim to push through new guidelines in late September, however, has been met with skepticism by some medical experts. The CDC as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have to approve the plan before it can be implemented and that backing isn’t guaranteed. 
That uncertainty is likely to continue fueling volatility in the stocks. Options imply that Moderna and BioNTech could move roughly 7% in either direction over the next week while Pfizer’s stock may move about 3%. 
Morgan Stanley’s Matthew Harrison is among Wall Street analysts who expect Biden’s plan to be backed by regulators. But but he remains equal weight on Moderna and Pfizer because he doesn’t expect any major new vaccine orders in the near future, with an estimated 630 million of unused shots from the companies already purchased through 2022. 
“We do not expect any supply constraints for booster doses and do not expect the U.S. government to purchase additional mRNA vaccine doses for 2022 based on current demand or booster dose need,” Harrison wrote in a research note, referring to the technology used in both Moderna and Pfizer’s shots.
Analysts with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are more bullish. The bank has a buy rating on Moderna, estimating that its shot could drive $36.2 billion of sales next year, some $15 billion more than Bloomberg’s consensus estimates. “We see upside to these numbers given supply and pricing dynamics,” said analyst Asad Haider. 
He sees new records for Moderna and Pfizer if U.S. and other global regulators endorse the receipt of a third dose. He estimates that Moderna shares -- which closed Friday a $382.22 -- could top $600 if boosters become the norm, while Pfizer could trade as high as $61, up from $46.58 at the end of last week.  BioNTech already trades at best-case levels, he wrote.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) has emerged as the preferred bidder for Baring Private Equity Asia's (BPEA) Indian portfolio Hexaware Technologies in a $3 billion deal, two people with knowledge of the situation said.
If successful, Carlyle would be winning a competitive bidding process against peer firms including KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) and Bain Capital, as well as French company Teleperformance SE for the Mumbai-headquartered IT services firm.
Hong Kong-based BPEA, Hexaware and a Carlyle spokesman declined to comment. 
BPEA bought a controlling stake in Hexaware in 2013 for about $420 million and took the company private from the local stock exchanges late last year.
Hexaware provides automation, cloud and customer services-related technology to a wide range of industries including finance, education, hospitality and manufacturing.

With 37 offices in more than 30 countries, the company's revenue grew 6.5% year on year in 2020 to $845 million in U.S. dollar terms, according to its annual report.
Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew 24.4% to 11 billion rupees in 2020.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) plans to soon announce targets it has set itself for reducing emissions from customers, declaring it will become the first major supplier of green iron ore. 
The world's No.4 iron ore producer is pursuing some of the most ambitious green plans in the industry with its efforts to diversify into renewable energy and green hydrogen through its unit Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). 
""The really big steps for the creation of steel delivered to customers to be decarbonised has to be first the big one - create green iron ore,"" Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's founder and chairman told a briefing after the company reported record earnings https://www.reuters.com/business/fortescue-logs-record-bumper-profit-dividend-management-bonuses-cut-2021-08-29.
He said the targets would be unveiled next month and that the company had held off on announcing goals until it had been confident it could execute them successfully.
FFI spent $122 million last year and expects to spend between $400 million and $600 million in the year to June 2022, working on developing green trains, trucks and shipping and decarbonisation technologies. 
Forrest said the allocation of 10% of Fortescue's net profit to FFI would be more than enough to meet the company's targets - which include achieving net zero emissions at its operations and supplying 15 million tonnes a year of green hydrogen by 2030.
That 2030 timeline is a much faster one than bigger rivals BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), which both aim to reach net zero emissions at their operations by 2050. 
""There is a queue of investors globally - debt, equity, and other - which are ready to invest alongside a corporation of Fortescue's reputation,"" Forrest said.
The company will need around 2 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity, which would use renewable energy to split water to produce green hydrogen, to meet its target of 15 million tonnes a year of hydrogen.

By comparison, other big projects set to be built in Australia aim to have 10 megawatt electrolysers, or 0.5% of the capacity FFI aims to have by 2030.
Underscoring the ambition of Fortescue's plans, China's Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Corp said on Monday it aims to produce more than 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources between 2021 and 2025.

Investing.com –  Moderna  stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) traded 1.7% lower as the company’s woes in Japan deepened on the suspension of another million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, after foreign substances were found in more batches.
The discovery of contaminated batches has led to the suspension of as many as 2.6 million doses of the company's 'messenger RNA'-based vaccine and comes as the world’s third largest economy battles its worst wave of the pandemic.
Daily infections are now exceeding 25,000 amid a slow rollout of vaccinations. However, the rolling seven-day average for new infections fell for the first time since June last week, suggesting that the current wave may be cresting.
The latest reports of vaccine contamination came from Gunma prefecture near Tokyo and the southern prefecture of Okinawa.
Other vials from the lots can continue to be used, the ministry said on Monday.
The contamination cases followed a government report on Saturday that two people died after receiving Moderna shots that were among lots later suspended, the Reuters report said."

China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp's (CCB) ""margin will keep narrowing to the end of this year,"" said the bank's chief financial officer Zhang Yi in an online press conference.
Meanwhile, Bank of China Ltd (BoC) expects net interest margins (NIM) to ""still face a certain downward pressure,"" said vice president of the bank Wang Wei at a virtual media briefing.
The comments come after five of China's top banks, including CCB and BoC, posted robust half-year net profit growth on Friday and Monday. 
AgBank posted 12.4% growth in first-half profits, while BoC posted an 11.8% increase over the same period, the biggest jumps since 2014 and 2013 respectively, as business activity recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The results are in the same vein to those from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of Communications Co Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp, all of which reported more than 9% first-half net profit growth on Friday.
Both AgBank and BoC reported stable bad loan growth. 
BoC logged a non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 1.3% at the end of June, the same as at the end of the first quarter, while AgBank's NPL ratio edged down slightly to 1.5% from 1.53% over the same period. 
BoC, though, which is the most international of the five banks, said it expected soured debt to grow more offshore than onshore.

Investing.com -- NetEase stock (NASDAQ:NTES) slumped 7% in Monday’s premarket trading after Chinese regulators announced new rules limiting the amount of time players under the age of 18 can spend playing games online amid mounting concerns over the impact of gaming on children.
Users under 18 will be limited to an hour of gameplay on Fridays, weekends and holidays, state news agency Xinhua reported.
Online gaming companies will be barred from providing gaming services to minors outside those hours and will have to implement measures to enforce the new rules.
In 2019, China introduced rules that barred minors from playing online games between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. and restricted the amount of time they could play.
Stricter rules governing the use of online gaming by children had been expected since a state media report, early this month, called online gaming ‘opium for the mind’.
The new rules come amid a broad based crackdown by Beijing on China's tech giants, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent, which has spooked investors.

A global chip shortage during the past year has caused a major delay in manufacturing activity and forced several automakers to cut down on production.
Scania is pausing production at its truck plants in Sweden, France and the Netherlands for the whole week, a company spokesperson said.
""We are slowing down to a temporarily lower production volume,"" Scania press chief Karin Hallstan said, adding the company's South American plants will pause truck production next week.
""They are now keeping it up for a few days when we are holding back here in Europe,"" she said. 
Delivery disruptions are currently affecting operations negatively at 70% of Swedish manufacturing companies, according to a survey published on Monday by Silf/Swedbank.

Sixteen percent of the companies have revised production plans downwards for the coming six months due to lack of material, according to the survey.
Geely-owned Volvo Cars announced last week that it will halt production at its Gothenburg plant during this week, and AB Volvo, a rival to Scania, warned last month of further production disruptions and stoppages.

The launch of the actively-managed, unconstrained equity fund by BlackRock's newly-established unit in Shanghai is being closely watched, said Ivan Shi, head of research at fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
The BlackRock China New Horizon Mixed Securities Investment Fund aims to raise up to 8 billion yuan ($1.24 billion). 
""It's a very localised product,"" Shi said. ""It attracts a lot of industry attention because it's the first mutual fund product by a wholly-owned foreign fund house in China.""
BlackRock became the first foreign asset manager to operate a wholly-owned mutual fund business in China after the government scrapped a foreign ownership cap in the industry on April 1, 2020.
In addition, the U.S. fund giant, which entered China more than 15 years ago, recently set up a majority-owned Chinese wealth management joint venture, which will also launch a maiden product soon.
""When we operate globally, we pay a lot of attention to really immersing into local markets, so that we can satisfy unique needs of local clients,"" Tony Tang, BlackRock's head of China, told a recent online roadshow.
The asset manager will roll out passively-managed funds in China in the future, Tang said. 
China's mutual fund market is expected to grow to 60 trillion yuan ($8.75 trillion) in a decade, Z-Ben Advisors estimates, but competition is fierce in a sector crowded with more than 150 players.
A global brand doesn't ensure success in the China fund market, and BlackRock ""needs to build a good track record locally to attract investors,"" said Shi of Z-Ben Advisors.
The New Horizon fund, to be managed by investment veteran Alex Tang, and Shan Xiuli, will focus on five areas including new energy, consumption, digital transformation, retirement, and technology, according to BlackRock's official website. 

BlackRock also owns a minority stake in a Chinese mutual fund venture with Bank of China Investment Management Co.

The digital map maker, which also powers the navigation system in MG Motor and BMW cars in India, is seeking a valuation of 50-60 billion rupees ($681-$817 million), according to the source, who did not want to be named as the IPO details were private.

Earlier this year, India relaxed restrictions on mapping by allowing local firms to collect, generate, store and produce geo-spatial data including maps. The government expects the geo-spatial products and solutions market to be worth $13.6 billion by 2030.
The offering comes at a time Indian companies are rushing into capital markets, with equities at record highs as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Food-delivery firm Zomato Ltd saw strong gains in its market debut last month.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) will unveil a new family car under its lower cost Dacia brand in September, aiming to replace three existing models as part of Chief Executive Luca De Meo's push to trim ranges and focus on profitable vehicles. 
De Meo is looking to revive loss-making Renault's finances, including through cost savings and by cutting jobs, and reverse an expansionist strategy under former boss Carlos Ghosn to restore the group's profitability. 
Dacia, the Renault group's low cost brand, which includes best-sellers such as the Sandero city car, will unveil its new seven-seater Jogger model in early September ahead of the IAA (NYSE:IAA) Motor Show in Munich, Germany, the company said in a statement. 
The car is set to replace Dacia's Logan break model, which is already no longer in production, as well as its small Dakker people carrier and the larger Lodgy vehicles, also due to be phased out. Dacia gave no pricing details. 
The Renault group is aiming to make a push in medium-sized cars in Europe, known as the compact segment and where it competes with the likes of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Golf, and reduce its dependence on smaller vehicles with lower margins, mirroring a strategy followed by Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, now Stellantis. 
De Meo has looked to give Renault, Dacia and sports car brand Alpine more distinctive identities within the carmaking group, at a time when competition in electric vehicles is heating up globally. 
Dacia, originally a Romanian firm bought by Renault in 1999, presented its small Spring electric car in 2020, and De Meo has said he wanted to give the Europe-centred brand global impetus. 

It is due to introduce a new logo on its cars from 2022. 
Ghosn - who was arrested in late 2018 in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies, before fleeing to Lebanon - forged Renault's alliance with Japanese carmaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and had pursued a volume-based strategy which the company is now shifting away from.

The much lower-than-expected bonus payments, which analysts described as unusual, will affect some 30 people. For some executives, it comes on top of cuts to a separate bonus scheme after a cost blowout and delays at Fortescue's Iron Bridge magnetite project. 
Fortescue posted an underlying net profit of $10.35 billion, up from $4.75 billion a year ago, and not far off a forecast compiled by Vuma of $10.41 billion. Its shares finished 6.6% higher.
It also declared it would become the first major supplier of green iron ore https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/australias-fortescue-sets-sights-becoming-worlds-first-supplier-green-iron-ore-2021-08-30 and would unveil new targets for reducing emissions from its customers next month.
Asked about the bonus cuts, Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said top management were all shareholders and would also benefit that way.
Fortescue will pay a final dividend of A$2.11 per share, up from A$1 a share last year, taking its total dividend for the year to A$3.58 or A$11 billion ($8 billion). 
That will add about $1.6 billion to chairman and founder Andrew Forrest's wealth. The company's biggest shareholder with a stake of 36.6% is also Australia's richest man with a net wealth of more than $17 billion according to Forbes. 
Analysts said while some executives might feel shocked about the last minute change to the payout, Fortescue appeared to be attempting to strike a balance between paying too much which could make staff independently wealthy and prompt them to leave and paying too little which could also cause them to leave.
""If the amounts debated are not material to the company, staff retention and morale is my main concern on issues like this,"" said Brenton Saunders, an analyst with Pendal Group.
THE PASSING OF PEAK PRICES 
Rivals BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bhp-sell-oil-gas-business-woodside-2021-08-17 and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rio-tinto-first-half-earnings-more-than-doubles-2021-07-28/#:~:text=MELBOURNE%2C%20July%2028%20(Reuters),of%20%249.1%20billion%20in%20dividends have also reported record profits and paid bumper dividends on the back of resilient demand from China, the world's top consumer, and supply issues in Brazil.
But after peaking above $230 a tonne in May, iron ore prices have dropped to $140 a tonne this month on a recovery in output from Brazil and a tougher stand on emissions in China.
""We fear the peak has passed, the iron ore price cycle and by extension the earnings and share price cycles are also ... lower over time,"" said analyst Peter O'Connor of Shaw and Partners.
The miner shipped 182.2 million tonnes (Mt) of iron ore in fiscal 2021 and expects as much as 185 Mt to go out in the current fiscal year.
As part of its plans to become the world's first major supplier of green iron ore and green hydrogen, it expects to spend up to $600 million this fiscal year on Fortescue Future Industries.
The unit last year signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Afghanistan to conduct studies for the development of hydropower and geothermal projects as well on mineral resources.
Asked if what would happen now that the Taliban had seized power, Forrest said Fortescue ""would meaningfully engage with anybody including the Taliban"" if they met four conditions laid out in the company's contracts.

The conditions include equal education outcomes for girls and boys, the abolishment of all forms of forced slavery, child marriage and modern slavery, which is often defined as severe exploitation of people for personal or commercial gain.

724,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Chinese Tech Stocks Rally to Start Week as Investors Eye Bottom,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese technology shares climbed on Monday after recording their best weekly advance since January as bargain hunters continued to load up on the beaten-down sector.
The Hang Seng Tech Index rallied 1.1%, led by live streaming giant  Kuaishou Technology  (HK:1024) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Health Information Technology Ltd. Food delivery company Meituan (HK:3690) erased earlier losses and rose 1.5% ahead of its results, which showed second-quarter revenue beating estimates while losses continued.
The rally came despite a barrage of headlines of new rules for the tech sector, including a campaign to crack down on social media accounts that misinterpret domestic financial topics and the proposal for a credit rating system to regulate live streaming companies. Beijing has expanded its clampdown on private industry to tutoring companies and online gaming in a bid to reduce the wealth gap.
“We may have seen the near-term bottom of the market, after months of selloffs,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific Yamaichi International H.K. Ltd. “Although investors are still very sensitive about negative regulations, shares managed to bounce back recently despite negative news from time to time.”
Mainland investors remained net sellers of Hong Kong stocks for a fourth consecutive trading session. They offloaded HK$4.2 billion ($536 million) worth of shares via the trading links with Shenzhen and Shanghai. The Hang Seng Index closed 0.5% higher, while the CSI 300 Index fell 0.3%. 
Among the losers, entertainment and medical beauty stocks continued to be hammered on Monday.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts said China’s new guidelines on regulating the “fan-based economy” could mean negative financial impact on the sector in the near term. Meanwhile, China is seeking to rectify illicit advertising in the cosmetic surgery industry. 
Brokerage stocks also slipped after the securities regulator pushed firms to step up oversight of their margin-financing businesses, a person familiar with the matter said. The CSI Financials subgauge dropped 2.1%, with Orient Securities Co. Ltd. and GF Securities Co. Ltd. both slumping by their 10% daily limit.
Golden Dragon
In the U.S., a bout of frenzied buying from bargain-hunting retail traders helped the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index - which tracks 98 firms listed in the U.S. - gain more than 9% last week, snapping an eight-week losing streak. Yet the gauge’s performance faded toward the end of week and investors on Friday were spooked by a report about China’s plans to ban U.S. IPOs for data-heavy tech firms. 
“Like all regulatory reforms before, the end of it will be unheralded and visible only in the rear view mirror,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>",Crown Resorts results hit by regulatory costs; Oaktree deal falls through,"(Reuters) -Australian casino operator Crown Resorts reported an annual loss on Monday and said it was no longer in discussions with Oaktree Capital over the private equity firm's proposal to buy out founder James Packer's $2.3 billion stake.
The loss, which Crown had already flagged, and the failure of the Oaktree deal show the extent to which its future is being shaped by regulatory scrutiny as it struggles to rebuild its image amid multiple Royal Commission enquiries.
While Crown already lost the licence for its Sydney casino after an inquiry in February found it allowed money laundering on its premises for years, its properties in Perth and Melbourne are also under a regulatory cloud, compounding challenges for the company already hit by the coronavirus.
Oaktree declined to comment on the failed deal with Crown, while the casino operator did not offer a reason in its statement for the agreement to fall through.
Its net loss for the year to June was A$261.6 million ($191.3 million), compared with a A$79.5 million profit a year earlier, while its revenue slid by nearly a third.
Crown, however, said its Perth casino rebounded quickly after the latest round of COVID-19 curbs in Australia were relaxed, although the operating environment remained uncertain.
Macquarie analysts said they expect the recent performance at Perth ""to act as a precedent for when Crown Melbourne and Crown Sydney re-open.""
Crown, whose shares ended 0.1% lower, had in May rejected an all-cash $6.5 billion bid from investment giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, and subsequently lost out on a A$9 billion offer from smaller rival Star Entertainment Group.
Separately, the casino giant also said some of its lenders had agreed to extend maturity of few credit facilities, while one of its lenders also agreed to a new A$250 million debt facility.

Maadhavi Barber, an analyst at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, called the results ""credit negative"", but said Crown's credit profile was supported by sufficient liquidity and the extension of near-term maturities.

The company fired the 10 employees for sharing screenshots of the woman's post in the public domain after removing watermarks that bore their IDs, the Bloomberg report said https://bloom.bg/3kz5Mbk, citing an internal announcement from last week.
The employees were fired for violating policies against exposing content on employee forums, Bloomberg reported, citing the people familiar. 
Three other employees have also been reprimanded for making inappropriate comments in public forum, according to the report. 
Alibaba declined to comment on the report.
A female employee had posted an 11-page account on Alibaba's intranet in early August saying her manager and a client had sexually assaulted her, and that superiors and human resources had not taken the matter seriously in the five days since she reported it.

Alibaba fired the manager accused of sexual assault, but was blasted by state media for not acting until the accuser went public.
The e-commerce company made its decision to fire the 10 workers after wrapping up an internal investigation and has not announced the final results of that probe to the public, Bloomberg reported.

Tesla, which is looking to set up a factory in India if it is successful with imported vehicles, is holding early talks with some companies for the supply of components such as instrument panels, windshields, differential gears, brakes and power seats, the Economic Times reported https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/tesla-in-talks-with-3-local-companies-for-parts-supply/articleshow/85728000.cms?from=mdr on Sunday.
Bharat Forge Ltd, Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd and Sandhar Technologies Ltd are understood to be among the Indian companies already supplying components to Tesla, according to the report. Shares of the three Indian firms rose as much as 6.2% to 13.7% on Monday.
Tesla, Bharat Forge, Sona BLW and Sandhar did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
India's auto component makers want Tesla's potential entry to benefit the country's suppliers, and one way to achieve that is for the company to manufacture locally, the head of an industry body said https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-auto-part-makers-want-teslas-entry-benefit-local-companies-2021-08-03 earlier in August.
Reuters previously reported India was considering slashing import duties on electric cars https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-india-considers-sharp-import-tax-cuts-evs-after-tesla-lobbying-sources-2021-08-09 to as low as 40%.
The country is the world's fifth-largest car market with annual sales of 3 million vehicles, according to industry estimates, with electric vehicles (EVs) making up a fraction of the total.
However, EV sales have been gradually rising in the country as states improve charging infrastructure.

The park, a joint venture between Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Universal Parks & Resorts and state-owned Beijing Shouhuan Cultural Tourism Investment, will begin trial operations on Sept. 1, CCTV said. 
Universal Studios announced the development of the resort - the world's fifth Universal Studios-branded theme park - in 2014, saying at the time it would cost $3.3 billion. 
Its opening date has been postponed for several months due to the coronavirus pandemic, local media said. 

In addition to rides, shows and attractions, hotels, and a retail, dining and entertainment complex, it will include experiences designed to reflect China's cultural heritage, Universal said on its website.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",China Huarong in talks with investors after $16 billion loss,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese state-owned asset manager China Huarong Asset Management sought on Monday to turn the page on a deep annual loss, as its chairman said it was in talks with potential new strategic investors alongside a CITIC-led consortium.
Wang Zhanfeng, on an earnings call a day after releasing results, said many investors continue to have faith in Huarong, and that it was speaking with potential new domestic and foreign strategic investors.
On Sunday, Huarong announced a first-half 2021 profit of 158.3 million yuan ($24.5 million) and a nearly $16 billion loss for 2020. Its annual results statement had been delayed by nearly five months because of restructuring uncertainties. 
Earlier this month, the indebted company informed investors of a state-backed rescue plan led by the CITIC Group Corp.
That deal would make Huarong a subsidiary of CITIC Group, part of a plan by regulators to fold financially shaky state asset managers into financial holding groups, according to two sources familiar with the restructuring process.
Huarong is one of four state distressed debt managers and counts China's finance ministry as its largest shareholder.
""We need to turn from quick profits, to long-term profits, to hard-earned profits,"" Liang Qiang, executive director of Huarong, said on the call, alluding to the company's rapid expansion under its former chairman Lai Xiaomin.
Lai was executed in January following one of China's highest-profile corruption cases.
Huarong executives emphasised what they said was a more stable outlook for the company focused on its core business. They said the company's offshore unit, Huarong International, would remain a strategic platform, and they believed it would continue to improve its asset structure and that its financial indicators would recover.
In its half-year report, China Huarong listed liabilities totalling 1.54 trillion yuan, including 107.5 billion yuan in bond payables falling due within one year, and 577.9 billion yuan in borrowings falling due within one year. It said certain regulatory indicators including its capital adequacy ratio and leverage ratio failed to reach minimum regulatory requirements.
On Monday, Huarong executives said the company would decide whether to roll out a refinancing plan for dollar-denominated debt based on its credit recovery process, its operational and developmental needs, as well as regulatory approval.
A decision on whether to buy back outstanding perpetual bonds would also be based on the operational situation of subsidiary China Huarong International Holdings Ltd as well as contracts and deals made with creditors, they said. 

The mid-price on 4% perpetual bonds issued by subsidiary Huarong Finance 2017 Co Ltd rose about 1 cent to 94.781 following the call, according to data from Duration Finance, compared with a low of below 53 cents in May.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Just a little bit longer,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus. 
A consensual takeaway from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium is that investors will be able to dirty dance to the beat of the Fed's $120 billion monthly asset purchases for just a little bit longer.
Powell stuck to his dovish monetary policy message without disclosing the timing of the central bank's tapering strategy, allowing the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to close at record highs on Friday. 
Like all things, the current bull market must come to an end some day. But investors who feared that moment could have been last Friday can sigh in relief even if September is typically the trickiest month of the year for Wall Street.
There seems to have been no second thoughts or buyer's remorse over the weekend with Asian bourses on the rise this morning and the dollar index falling to a two-week low. 
Wall Street futures are ticking up and European bourses are set to open slightly in positive territory. Britain is closed for a bank holiday.
There's still plenty of fears around that the rally is running out of steam and that resurgent inflation might force reluctant policy makers to pull the plug on quantitative easing in a disorderly way.
In the meantime though, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 1.3%, down from last week's two-week high of 1.375%. 
In the euro zone, where the economy is bouncing back amid trillions of euros worth of monetary and fiscal stimulus, labour shortages and production bottlenecks, German 10-year bonds yield -0.42% . 
Oil prices pared early gains on Monday, off more than three-week highs reached earlier in the session as a powerful hurricane ploughing through the Gulf of Mexico forced shutdowns and evacuations of hundreds of offshore oil platforms.
Gold is steady, with the spot price at $1,816.2 per ounce, down 0.1%, having touched its highest in three weeks earlier in the session. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
-Japan's retail sales extend gains but COVID-19 challenges persist
-Thai July factory output slows from virus curbs, outbreaks 
-Eurozone business sentiment indexes consumer inflation expectations
-Preliminary German CPI/HICP
-Emerging markets: Colombia central bank

-U.S. pending new home sales data
-U.S. 6-month and 3 mth bill auctions

733,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>","Australia considering new laws for Apple, Google, WeChat digital wallets","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian government is considering new laws that would tighten the regulation of digital payment services by tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he would ""carefully consider"" that and other recommendations from a government-commissioned report into whether the payments system had kept pace with advances in technology and changes in consumer demand.
Services such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and China's WeChat Pay, which have grown rapidly in recent years, are not currently designated as payment systems, putting them outside the regulatory system.
""Ultimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure,"" Frydenberg said in an opinion piece published in the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) earlier this month called for global financial watchdogs to urgently get to grips https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/financial-regulators-urgently-need-to-ge-idUSKBN2F30YF with the growing influence of 'Big Tech', and the huge amounts of data controlled by groups such as Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
The Australian report recommended the government be given the power to designate tech companies as payment providers, clarifying the regulatory status of digital wallets.
It also recommended the government and industry together establish a strategic plan for the wider payments ecosystem and that a single, integrated licensing framework for payment systems be developed. 

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which is currently in charge of designating who is a payment services provider, reported that payments through digital wallets had grown to 8% of in-person card transactions in 2019, up from 2% in 2016. 
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), which has estimated digital wallet transactions more than doubled in the year to March to A$2.1 billion, has urged regulators to address ""competition issues"" and consider the safety implications of their use.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 02:26AM ET</span>",China tightens scrutiny on $9.3 trillion fund industry,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top securities regulator pledged on Monday to crack down on mismanaged private funds and weed out fake ones, as the government becomes more assertive in dealing with an industry worth 60 trillion yuan ($9.28 trillion).
China has been seeking to channel more household savings into the capital markets to fund innovation and aid its economic recovery, while reducing the economy's reliance on bank lending.
Fund managers should align their interests more closely with investors, and refrain from hyping their products, Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.
""China is actively promoting high-quality growth of its capital markets, and healthy development of the 60 trillion yuan fund industry is a crucial part of it,"" Yi told a meeting held by the Asset Management Association of China.
Chinese mutual fund managers also face rising competition from global asset managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity International after regulators scrapped foreign ownership in the sector on April 1, 2020.
By July-end, the country's mutual fund industry stood at 23.5 trillion yuan, 1.6 times the size at 2016-end, Yi said.
The private securities fund sector doubled to 5.5 trillion yuan, and its private equity and venture capital industry tripled to 12.6 trillion yuan during the period.
Despite a recent cleanup of China's private fund industry, there're still many small and weak players hampering the high-quality growth of the sector, Yi said, adding that the regulators will publish new rules in due course.
Some private-fund managers even raise money publicly, and misappropriate clients' funds, he added.
Yi urged fund managers to prioritize clients' needs and interest, as ""it happens from time to time that funds make money, but investors don't"".

He asked money managers to address the issue of fund churning, in which fund salespeople, seeking higher commissions, encourage investors to redeem existing funds and subscribe to just-launched ones, resulting in massive fund flows.

(Reuters) - Researchers who discovered a massive flaw in the main databases stored in  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure cloud platform on Saturday urged all users to change their digital access keys, not just the 3,300 it notified this week.
As first reported by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-microsoft-warns-thousands-cloud-customers-exposed-databases-emails-2021-08-26, researchers at a cloud security company called Wiz discovered this month they could have gained access to the primary digital keys for most users of the Cosmos DB database system, allowing them to steal, change or delete millions of records.
Alerted by Wiz, Microsoft rapidly fixed the configuration mistake that would have made it easy for any Cosmos user to get into other customers' databases, then notified some users Thursday to change their keys.
In a blog post Friday, Microsoft said it warned customers which had set up Cosmos access during the weeklong research period. It found no evidence that any attackers had used the same flaw to get into customer data, it noted.
""Our investigation shows no unauthorized access other than the researcher activity,"" Microsoft wrote. ""Notifications have been sent to all customers that could be potentially affected due to researcher activity,"" it said, perhaps referring to the chance that the technique had leaked from Wiz.
""Though no customer data was accessed, it is recommended you regenerate your primary read-write keys,"" it said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency used stronger language in a bulletin Friday, making clear it was speaking not just to those notified.
""CISA strongly encourages Azure Cosmos DB customers to roll and regenerate their certificate key,"" the agency said https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/08/27/microsoft-azure-cosmos-db-guidance.
Experts at Wiz, founded by four veterans of Azure's in-house security team, agreed.
""In my estimation, it's really hard for them, if not impossible, to completely rule out that someone used this before,"" said one of the four, Wiz Chief Technology Officer Ami Luttwak. At Microsoft he developed tools for logging cloud security incidents.
Microsoft did not give a direct answer when asked if it had comprehensive logs for the two years when the Jupyter Notebook feature was misconfigured, or had used another way to rule out access abuse.
""We expanded our search beyond the researcher's activities to look for all possible activity for current and similar events in the past,"" said spokesman Ross Richendrfer, declining to address other questions.

Wiz said Microsoft had worked closely with it on the research but had declined to say how it could be sure earlier customers were safe.
""It's terrifying. I really hope than no one besides us found this bug,"" said one of the lead researchers on the project at Wiz, Sagi Tzadik.

“There is little doubt Powell was dovish, relative to market pricing and positioning,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Financial Pty, wrote in a note. Weston remains “positive on risk for now” but added a slowing global economy and Fed policy normalization remain threats to the outlook.
On the data front, investors are now awaiting for the U.S. nonfarm payrolls for August due on Friday, as Powell said the Fed will also keep an eye on the improvement in the labor market.
“A strong payrolls print could instigate a debate for a September tapering start,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at NAB, said in a note.
In Asia, the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for August will be released on Wednesday.
""We expect both the manufacturing and services PMIs to moderate in August, given the widespread Delta variant and strict lockdown,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts in a note.
""With slowing growth momentum and dovish signals from the (People's Bank of China) meeting this week, we expect more easing, but still at a measured pace."""
737,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2021 10:07PM ET</span>",China Evergrande says it will not hold news briefing after H1 earnings,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group, the country's debt-laden No. 2 property developer, said on Monday it will not hold a news conference after it reports its first-half earnings on Tuesday.

The company did not provide a reason for the rare move.
Evergrande said last week it expected its six-month net profit to slump as much as 39% from a year earlier, dragged by a drop in its home selling prices and higher expenses.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2021 09:41PM ET</span>",Evergrande to speed up asset sales as hopes swirl about gov't lifeline,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Too big to fail or too tough to save? As China's debt-laden No. 2 property developer lurched from one crisis to another in recent months its creditors, investors, suppliers, and bankers agonised over its fate with little hope on the horizon.
But industry watchers say clear signs are now emerging that authorities at various levels are stepping in to avoid a hard landing for China Evergrande Group, amid worries about the ""social impact"" of a possible collapse that could cascade through the country's financial system.
""Its huge balance sheet will have a real domino effect on China,"" said Nomura chief China economist Lu Ting. ""If financial institutions lose money, they'll tighten credit to other companies and sectors."" 
Evergrande, whose debt has swelled to 1.95 trillion yuan ($301 billion), more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of Finland, is also set to accelerate asset sales to raise cash, company sources and analysts said.
Concerns intensified in June when the developer failed to pay some commercial paper on time. Since then, its stock price has nosedived, its bonds have been cut into ""junk"" territory, and a growing number of suppliers have filed lawsuits to recover overdue payments.
After having refrained from showing signs of bailing out the embattled privately-owned developer, Chinese regulators summoned senior company executives last week and issued a rare warning that it needs to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability.
It's becoming increasingly clear now, analysts said, that Beijing needs to safeguard suppliers and their employees, in addition to home buyers, to ensure social stability, and policymakers may prioritise them over creditors. 
Banks have been instructed to roll over Evergrande's maturing loans, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, and many news reports on its woes have been removed from the internet.
Those moves, coupled with the decision that a single court in Guangdong province will centrally handle lawsuits against Evergrande across the country, are the clearest signs yet that authorities are co-ordinating efforts, analysts said.
Guangdong is the company's home base and the firm has been reported at various times to be in stake sale talks with various local government arms and companies there.
Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment.
According to financial news and data provider REDD, the government of Guangdong province is seeking feedback from Evergrande Group's major banks about forming a creditor committee for the developer, two sources briefed by bankers said. The government initiated the discussions with the banks last week and has yet to make a decision on such a move, which could pave the wave for a restructuring. 
Evergrande has 200,000 of its own staff, but it provides employment to 3.8 million people in the country, including construction workers, according to its website. 
""Banks and trusts are relatively safe because they have collateral,"" said Oscar Choi, founder and chief investment officer of Oscar and Partners Capital.
""Construction workers are not wealthy people and need money to get food, without money they will stop working...if Evergrande has nothing to sell that will worsen its debt problem,"" Choi said
Property sales, which Evergrande targets to raise 750 billion yuan this year, are its main source of cashflow, Choi noted.
On Wednesday Evergrande warned interim net profit would slump as much as 39% from a year ago, as it cut the sales prices of its homes to boost revenue and on higher expenses. It is due to post the full report on Aug. 31.
BARGAINING POWER
If not swiftly defused, Evergrande's liabilities, which account for 2% of China's GDP, may trigger systemic risks, analysts and economists have warned.
Standing at around one trillion yuan, the money owed to Evergrande's suppliers had not been widely discussed until recently when many threatened or launched legal action.
Bondholders, on the other hand, said they are prepared for losses as Evergrande's restructuring is believed to be imminent. 
They also questioned how much of Evergrande's 2.3 trillion yuan of assets could be liquidated quickly, as potential buyers were expected to take advantage of its problems and seek distressed prices.
Evergrande, whose other business interests include a bottling water company and an electric vehicle maker, also has been scrambling to raise funds by offloading property and land holdings in both mainland China and Hong Kong. 
After the regulatory rebuke last week, however, three insiders said the developer had even less bargaining power.
""Chairman Hui (Ka Yan) didn't want to sell at a cheap prices because he thought he's not desperate, but now he has probably changed his mind,"" said one person with knowledge of the sale processes, declining to be named because the talks are private.
Hui did not respond to a request made via the company for comment.
DOMINO EFFECT
Beijing's decision to publicly step in to push for a debt resolution at Evergrande comes amid concerns about the collateral damage from its failing financial health.
Construction firm Jiangsu Nantong Sanjian saw its credit ratings and outlook cut in June by two Chinese rating agencies which cited large amounts Evergrande owed the firm. 

State media reported earlier this month that construction work was halted on two Evergrande projects in the southwestern city of Kunming - one due to late payments.
Policymakers also are concerned about the impact on home buyers who may have already put money down on apartments or arranged mortgages. The firm has hundreds of thousands of residential units yet to be delivered across China.

739,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2021 08:27PM ET</span>",Overlooked IPO Markets Are Suddenly Booming as China Deals Slow,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s crackdown on technology companies is prompting global investors to look for new opportunities across Asia, contributing to a record jump in initial public offerings from India to South Korea that shows few signs of slowing.
Tech companies from those two countries and Southeast Asia have raised $8 billion from first-time share sales this year, already blowing past the previous annual peak. The tally is poised to get bigger with planned listings by companies including Indian fintech giant Paytm and Indonesian internet conglomerate GoTo, both of which may break local fundraising records.
Long overshadowed by their Chinese peers, this new crop of startups is coming of age just as Beijing’s clampdown puts a damper on listing and growth prospects in what had long been the region’s hottest IPO market.
The result, some bankers say, may be the start of a new era for tech listings in Asia. Investors are already boosting exposure to markets outside China, with some buying into IPOs from countries like India and Indonesia for the first time. Prospective issuers that historically benchmarked themselves against Chinese companies are now highlighting similarities to other global peers in hopes of attaining higher valuations.
“These are strong companies and stories in their own right, but the overwhelming demand has been enhanced by rotation away from China tech,” said Udhay Furtado, co-head of Asia equity capital markets at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). 
China’s regulatory onslaught, now in its 10th month since the shock implosion of Ant Group Co.’s IPO, has slashed valuations for the nation’s listed tech companies by nearly 40%. It has also forced many startups to pause their IPO plans after regulators announced a stricter vetting process for overseas offerings. 
China and Hong Kong accounted for about 60% of Asian tech IPOs since the end of June, down from 83% in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About three quarters of Chinese companies that listed overseas this year are now trading below their IPO prices. 
Meanwhile, deals in smaller markets are attracting outsized demand as investors bet on increasingly internet-savvy populations, growing consumer spending and a new class of tech entrepreneurs.
PT Bukalapak.com, an Indonesian e-commerce firm, raised $1.5 billion around the end of July in the country’s largest ever IPO, far outstripping an early goal of between $300 million and $500 million. 
Zomato Ltd., an Indian online food-delivery and restaurant platform, received bids worth 1.5 trillion rupees ($20.2 billion) from large funds for its anchor tranche, making it one of the most popular Indian offerings among institutional investors. The company raised $1.3 billion in July. 
KakaoBank Corp., South Korea’s first internet-only lender to go public, sold $2.2 billion of new shares last month and soared more than 70% in its trading debut.
The hurdle for allocating capital to tech companies in China “is now much higher than it was even a month ago,” said Vikas Pershad, a portfolio manager at M&G Investments (Singapore) Pte. “The net exposure to China tech is lower and the net exposure to technology-driven business models outside of China is higher.”

One banker who asked not to be named discussing client information said some Hong Kong-based investors who previously focused on Chinese deals are now participating in tech IPOs elsewhere in the region. U.S. hedge funds are also looking at India more closely, another banker said.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) research analysts recently advised clients to re-balance their internet holdings away from China and into India and Southeast Asia.
“Are investors more interested? Definitely,” said William Smiley, co-head of Asia ex-Japan equity capital markets at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). “Global capital competes among itself and investment opportunities are judged on both an absolute and relative basis.”
Whether the enthusiasm will last is an open question. Bukalapak.com briefly dipped below its offering price this month, though the stock has since rebounded. Zomato and KakaoBank are trading 64% and 115% above their IPO prices, respectively.
A growing pipeline of deals will put investor demand to the test. Paytm -- formally called One97 Communications Ltd. -- has filed for a 166 billion-rupee IPO that is set to be India’s largest ever. Policybazaar, an online insurance marketplace, is looking to raise as much as 60.18 billion rupees.
GoTo, formed by the merger of Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce provider PT Tokopedia, is planning a domestic IPO this year before seeking a U.S. listing. It’s currently raising funds at a valuation of between $25 billion and $30 billion, meaning it could become Indonesia’s biggest-ever debut.
“There are increasingly diverse sources of capital investing in leading Asia-based growth businesses,” said Gregor Feige, co-head of ECM Asia ex-Japan at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) “Sovereign wealth funds are more active across the board. They’re leaning in and the global long-only community is also increasingly comfortable with local listings across Asia.”
The flood of tech IPOs in Southeast Asia and India is poised to reshape markets where benchmark indexes have historically focused on “old-economy” sectors like energy and finance.
Favorable demographics and domestic consumption growth in Southeast Asia “have not translated fully into stock market performance of late, as some of the fastest growing businesses were not listed,” said Pauline Ng, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. The growing representation of “new-economy” companies means these markets “can no longer be ignored,” she said.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",Clubhouse launches surround-sound feature to help chats feel life-like,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Clubhouse, an audio-only chat app, said on Sunday it will launch a spatial audio feature to make voices sound as if they're coming from different directions, helping conversations and virtual performances feel more life-like.
The app, which is backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, jumpstarted the social audio trend last year and became known for chatrooms of thousands that included chief executives and celebrities. However, it faces increasing competition from larger tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), which have all introduced their own social audio chat features.
The new surround-sound-like feature will help Clubhouse lean into performances and entertainment rooms that have proliferated on the app. 
Depending on how many speakers are in a Clubhouse room and a variety of other factors, the app's technology will assign users a spatial positioning, so that the listener will hear the voices surround them in their headphones, said Justin Uberti, Clubhouse's head of streaming technology.
In comedy rooms for instance, Clubhouse's technology will detect the main speaker and place that person's voice in the ""front,"" while the laughter of other people could sound as if they're coming from a listener's left and right sides, he said.
""I could hear people laughing and the room erupts around me,"" Uberti said. ""You can imagine in music ... there's a lot of potential.""
The spatial technology also makes it easier to detect when different users are speaking, whereas people previously might have to pay attention to the speakers' cadence and vocal timbre, he added.

Clubhouse, which started as an invite-only app and recently was opened to all users, said more than 700,000 rooms are now created each day, up from 300,000 in May.
Spatial audio will roll out first to iOS users and then Android users soon after, Clubhouse said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai state-owned property developer Limitless is set to reach an agreement with creditors over some $760 million of troubled debt, documents seen by Reuters showed - its third restructuring in a decade.
Limitless, along with Nakheel, was among the biggest casualties of Dubai’s property crash and the subsequent debt crisis that began in 2009.
It plans to enter into a lock-up agreement - a precursor to a long form term sheet and definitive documentation - with an ad-hoc group of creditors by the end of this month and with remaining creditors by the end of September to restructure the debt, an overview of the plan seen by Reuters showed.
The ad-hoc group includes First Abu Dhabi Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD, Arab National Bank, and Mashreqbank.
A Limitless spokesperson declined to comment. First Abu Dhabi Bank declined to comment and the other lenders did not immediately respond to comment requests.
Creditors will have the option to settle their debts at a 50% discount or to extend their current positions through a seven-year loan.
The restructured loan would be split into U.S dollar and UAE dirhams tranches and would include mandatory pre-payments from asset sales, the documents showed.
As part of the restructuring, Limitless would sell land at Al Wasl, a $12 billion project it planned on the outskirts of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.
The group will keep part of the sale proceeds to stabilise and fund the business.
Limitless reached a first restructuring agreement in 2012 and a second in 2016.

The company, the former property arm of Dubai World, was a victim of Dubai’s corporate debt crisis, which was triggered in 2009 by Dubai World’s request to delay repaying $25 billion in debt.
Dubai World reached an agreement in 2011 with banks to extend debt maturities and transferred the ownership to the government of Limitless, along with Nakheel Properties, which restructured its $16 billion debt in 2011.

745,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",A blazing U.S. stock rally faces market's toughest month,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A rally in which U.S. stocks have doubled from post-pandemic lows is about to enter the year’s worst month for equities, as investors focus on a nationwide COVID-19 resurgence and how quickly the Federal Reserve plans to pull back on its easy money policies.
September has been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500, with the benchmark index falling an average of 0.56% since 1945, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The S&P has advanced only 45% of the time in September, the lowest rate of any month, CFRA’s data showed.
This time around, stocks have momentum on their side. The S&P 500 notched its 52nd record closing high of the year on Friday and has gained 20% so far in 2021, having gone 287 calendar days without a pullback of 5% or more. 
That type of performance has signaled comparatively strong returns in the past. The index has gone on to deliver a median gain of 5.2% for the rest of the year during years when it made 30 or more new highs through August, according to data from LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). That compares with a median gain of 3.6% for all years, the firm's data showed.
A speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday helped allay concerns that the central bank will pull back too soon on the $120 billion in monthly government bond buying that has helped buoy markets, pushing the S&P to fresh records. 
Still, signs of caution have been growing in some corners of the market, fueled in part by rising coronavirus cases across the country and uncertainty over how quickly the Fed will tighten monetary policy once it begins its taper.
With worries over the Delta variant looming, ""to continue to question the rally because of seasonality makes sense,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
While major indexes stand near fresh highs, many stocks have been left behind. Tuesday marked the first time in nearly seven years that the S&P 500 hit a closing high while a 10-day total showed more stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq making 52-week lows than making 52-week highs, according to Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist with market research firm All Star Charts.
Investors have also been cutting back on leverage, with margin debt dropping 4.3% to $844 billion in July even as the S&P advanced more than 2%, according to data from BofA Global Research. The S&P 500 has been lower 71% of the time one year after a peak in margin debt has been reached, the bank’s analysis showed. 
Net leverage among hedge funds, meanwhile, stood at 50% at the start of the third quarter compared with 58% late last year, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report.
Though the market’s year-to-date gains have been spectacular, investors have questioned how much juice remains in the rally. A Reuters poll this week showed strategists believe the S&P 500 is likely to end 2021 not far from its current level.
A window into how the Delta variant has rippled through the economy will come next Friday, with the release of the U.S. jobs report for August, following recent weak readings on consumer sentiment and retail sales. The seven-day average of new reported cases reached about 155,000, the highest in about seven months, Reuters data through Thursday showed.
""When I sift through the noise ... that’s what the market is focusing on right now, plain and simple,” said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. 
Still, there is plenty of support for the view that equities are likely to continue grinding higher into the end of the year. 
BofA Securities said buybacks from corporate clients last week hit their highest level since mid-March, a potential source of support for stocks. Those were led by financials, which notched their highest weekly buybacks since 2010, BofA wrote.

“Despite the tangible Covid variant spike, we think the economy will continue to chug along,"" boosted by corporate and consumer spending, said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, in a note to investors on Friday. 
Some investors remain ready to jump on any downswings brought on by higher volatility in the coming weeks. ""If we do see a pullback in September, I would definitely be telling our clients, 'take this as a buying opportunity,'"" said Janasiewicz.

Japan, which has previously relied on the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines, approved AstraZeneca's vaccine in July and has secured two million doses.
""I have asked the health ministry to come up with an opinion about the use of AstraZeneca vaccines for the first dose and Pfizer's with the second, or the AstraZeneca's as the first shot and Moderna as second,"" vaccine programme chief Taro Kono said on the Fuji Television network. 
This could speed up the vaccination rollout by shortening the intervals between the first and second shots when using the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said.
AstraZeneca's two shots are administered with an interval of eight weeks, longer than for the other vaccines.

Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 this month for the first time. 
The country's vaccination ratio has lagged other developed nations. Japan has inoculated 54% of its population with at least one dose and fully vaccinated 43%, according to a Reuters vaccine tracker.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China Petroleum & Chemical Corp on Sunday reported a 39.15 billion yuan ($6.05 billion) net profit for the first six months of 2021 on the back of renewed fuel demand and a rebound in oil prices amid a recovery from the impact of COVID-19.
Asia's biggest oil refiner, known as Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), posted a 23 billion yuan loss during January-June last year as the coronavirus pandemic walloped fuel demand and knocked oil prices. The 2021 interim profit compares with a 31.338 billion yuan profit in the same period in 2019.
Revenue in the first six months rose 22.1% from last year's low base to 1.26 trillion yuan, following a recovery in global oil prices and robust demand for fuel and petrochemical products.
During the period, Sinopec processed a total of 126.11 million tonnes crude oil, up 13.7% on a year earlier, with gasoline output increasing by 20.8% as more people drove as China recovered from the COVID-19 shock.
Ethylene production also jumped 11.9% in the first six months from a year ago to 6.46 million tonnes, as the company upgrades its refineries to churn out more high-end petrochemical raw materials and slashes low value-added fuel products.
Sinopec produced 138.15 million barrels of crude oil, down 1.5% year-on-year, while its natural gas output rose 13.7% to 582.6 billion cubic feet.
Capital expenditure for the half-year came in at 57.94 billion yuan, about 35% of its full-year investment plan of 167.2 billion yuan.

Those figures are up from the 366,838,484 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Aug. 27 out of 437,567,285 doses delivered. 
The agency said 203,992,008 people had received at least one dose while 173,101,292 people are fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Saturday. 

The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech, as well as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine.
About 820,000 people received an additional dose of either  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or Moderna's vaccine since August 13, when the U.S. authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) generated $11.2 billion in revenue from its mobile app store in 2019, according to a court filing unsealed on Saturday, offering a clear view into the service's financial results for the first time.
Attorneys general for Utah and 36 other U.S. states or districts suing Google over alleged antitrust violations with the app store also said in the newly unredacted filing that the business in 2019 had $8.5 billion in gross profit and $7 billion in operating income, for an operating margin of over 62%. 
The figures include sales of apps, in-app purchase and app store ads. Google told Reuters the data ""are being used to mischaracterize our business in a meritless lawsuit.""
The company and its accusers said in a separate filing on Saturday a trial in late 2022 is possible over whether Google abuses its alleged monopoly in app sales for Android devices.
In its quarterly financial disclosures, Google groups Play app revenue with that of other services and accounts for the store's ad revenue as part of another broader category.
Attorneys general, as well as mobile app developer Epic Games and others separately suing Google, have contended that it generates huge profits through the Play Store by taking 30% of the fee for every digital good sold inside an app. The plaintiffs say Google's cut is arbitrarily high, siphoning app developers' profits.
Google argues that alternatives exist to Google's store and payment systems, though critics say those routes are unfeasible and were sometimes blocked. 

Plaintiffs allege Google through anticompetitive deals extended benefits to and imposed restrictions on major developers such as ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games to keep them from leaving the Play Store.
A filing by Epic Games unsealed this month said Google, according to internal documents, feared losing $1.1 billion in annual app store profit if the Play Store was successfully bypassed.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's government has rejected calls from retail and logistics companies to temporarily ease post-Brexit immigration rules which they say are contributing to a shortage of truck drivers and acute supply chain disruption.
Fast food chains McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), KFC, and Nando's, as well as bakery chain Greggs, have all faced disruption this week as suppliers struggled to deliver to them.
Trade body Logistics UK said Britain currently had a shortage of 90,000 truck drivers, and on Aug. 22 it and the British Retail Consortium asked the government to grant temporary visas to truck drivers from the European Union.
Since Jan. 1, most EU citizens planning to work in Britain need visas which are typically only available for higher-paid jobs than those in the logistics and hospitality sectors.
Britain's business ministry said on Saturday it did not expect these visa rules to change.
""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad,"" a government spokesperson said.
The Times newspaper had reported earlier on Saturday that the government was considering bringing forward a review of visa rules to tackle the shortage.

Alex Veitch, general manager for public policy at Logistics UK, said he was disappointed by the government's decision as it could take until early next year to work through a backlog of driving tests that had built up during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The industry needs drivers now,"" he said. ""Logistics UK is frustrated with the government's decision to reject the logistics industry's call for temporary visas to be made available for EU heavy goods vehicle drivers as a short-term solution while new domestic drivers are recruited, trained and tested.""

(Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) said on Friday it had suspended all self-driving e-Palette transportation pods at the Tokyo Paralympic Games village, a day after one of the vehicles collided with and injured a visually impaired pedestrian.
In a YouTube video, Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda apologized for the incident and said he offered to meet the person but was unable to do so. 
“A vehicle is stronger than a person, so I was obviously worried about how they were,” he said, answering questions about the incident.
Toyoda said the accident showed the difficulty for the self-driving vehicle to operate in the special circumstances of the village during the Paralympics with people there who are visually impaired or have other disabilities. 
“It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” he said.
The vehicle had stopped at a T junction and was about to turn under manual control of the operator, who was using the vehicle's joystick control, when the vehicle hit the athlete going at around 1 or 2 kilometres an hour, Toyoda said. He said Paralympic officials had told him that the athlete, who remained conscious, was taken to the athlete village medical centre for treatment and was able to walk back to their residence.
The athlete is due to compete on Saturday at 1030 local time, Toyoda said.
The e-Palette, a fully autonomous battery-electric vehicle, was adapted specifically for use during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, with large doors and electric ramps to allow groups of athletes to board quickly.
The company said it was cooperating with a local police probe to determine the cause of the accident, adding that it would also conduct its own investigation. 
In its statement, the Japanese automaker said it would continue to coordinate closely with the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to prevent any further incidents.

Paralympic Games organizers were not immediately available for comment.
The 2020 Paralympic Games began on Tuesday in Tokyo, even as Japan struggles with its worst COVID-19 outbreak, with record daily cases and an overwhelmed medical system.

Led by Chief Executive Andy An, who is also Geely's president, Zeekr said investors would jointly hold a 5.6% stake in the company, valuing it around $9 billion. Chief financial officer Yuan Jing told reporters that Zeekr does not currently have a clear plan for its initial public offering.
The company makes the Zeekr 001 model in the eastern city of Ningbo and is expected to start delivering them later this year. It aims to sell 650,000 vehicles a year by 2025.
Investors also included Cathay Fortune Corporation, which invests in mining companies, and private-equity firm Boyu Capital that additionally signed long-term investment partnerships with Zeekr, the carmaker said in a statement. 
Zeekr, which targets young and trendy customers, is jointly owned by Geely Automobile and its parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. 
The companies are expected to contribute expertise in intelligent connectivity, batteries, young consumer markets and raw materials, it said.
Car companies globally are working with more tech companies, battery makers and mining firms to develop future products and secure supply of components amid a shift towards electric vehicles (EV).
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the owner of Volvo Cars and a 9.7% stake in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), and Geely Automobile launched the Zeekr in March this year to compete with EV companies including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc. They jointly invested 2 billion yuan ($308.4 million) into the brand earlier.
Zeekr, like other global automakers, is trying to secure more chips that is used in its vehicles to ramp up production. Its executive said in June that it has sold out of deliveries for this year.

It also has other electric vehicle brands including mass-market Geometry, which saw sales growing in the past months, and premium Polestar.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Friday, pushing the S&P and the Nasdaq to record closing highs for the fourth time this week, as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium calmed fears over the tapering timetable and sent investors into the weekend in a buying mood.
All three indexes posted weekly gains.
""I see two things happening,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of research and trading at Harvest Volatility Management in New York. ""I see a reflexive dip-buying validation and I see the market embracing a dovish Fed.""
Regarding the indexes' recent string of all-time highs, including the S&P 500's 52nd record high close so far this year, Zigmont said ""The march north has been very consistent. The drawdowns are super shallow, and the recoveries are very fast.""
In his prepared remarks, Powell stopped short of providing a clearer picture regarding the timing of the central bank's tapering of asset purchases or hiking interest rates, the key elements of its dovish monetary policy aimed at helping the economy recover from the pandemic recession.
Indeed, Powell appeared to strike a more dovish tone than other Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) officials, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who said earlier in the day that they expect the tapering process to begin soon and wind down next year. 
""The market is very happy that the Fed is pumping more liquidity into the economy every month,"" Zigmont added. ""The Fed is enabling asset prices to climb and the market is pleased with that.""
Economic data released on Friday delivered, in large part, precisely what economists expected - a pullback in consumer spending and sentiment due to the COVID-19 Delta variant, and signs that the current wave of price spikes will not morph into long term inflation, inline with Fed assurances.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 242.68 points, or 0.69%, to 35,455.8, the S&P 500 gained 39.37 points, or 0.88%, to 4,509.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 183.69 points, or 1.23%, to 15,129.50.
Ten of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 advanced, with energy shares enjoying the largest percentage gain.
Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares rose 2.6% after sources said it would likely seek antitrust approval from the European Union to take over British chip designer Arm.
Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) Inc jumped 9.1% as brokerages upped their price targets after the company beat second-quarter revenue estimates.
Stay-at-home darling Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc slid 8.5% following its profit warning and its announcement it was being probed by U.S. regulators over an accident involving the safety of its treadmills. 
Beijing continued its crackdown on its tech companies, threatening to curb their ability to list on U.S. exchanges. 
U.S.-listed shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Music Entertainment fell 3.5% and 1.4%, respectively, while the Invesco Golden Dragon ETF dropped 1.1%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 132 new highs and 37 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.67 billion shares, compared with the 8.95 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge said on Friday she will rule by Sept. 3 on whether to grant a request from Native Americans to temporarily block Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp from excavating its Nevada mine site, which would become one of the country's biggest sources of the electric-vehicle battery metal.
A ruling for the Native Americans could signal the court may block the entire project, which was approved by the outgoing Trump administration in January.
Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno, Nevada, held a Friday hearing to determine whether archaeological digging at the Thacker Pass site should be blocked while she considers the broader question of whether approval should have been granted in the first place.
Tribal members say the mine would disturb ground that contains ancestral bones. The digging itself is required by federal statute to determine whether the land holds any historical artifacts.
The Vancouver-based company and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which controls the land, say the tribes did not participate in the mine permitting process when asked and did not share their beliefs about the land until earlier this summer, after the project was approved. 
""BLM's outreach efforts ... have been reasonable and in good faith,"" Arwyn Carroll, a BLM attorney, told the hearing. ""The tribes never told BLM that Thacker Pass could be this type of site.""
Attorneys for the tribes say regulators did not work hard enough to contact every tribe that could have a connection to the site, especially amid the pandemic.

Du, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, last month rejected a request from environmentalists to prevent digging, but then allowed tribes to essentially make the same request.
Du gave little hint which way she may rule, though several times asked how Native American artifacts would be handled if discovered.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has launched a multi-pronged attack on its tech companies, threatening to curb their ability to list in the United States, seeking to tighten up regulation of their use of algorithms and sidelining their cloud computing businesses in a major city.
In another move amid a wave of regulations on the tech sector announced in recent months, Beijing has also cracked down https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-crack-down-chaotic-online-fan-culture-2021-08-27 on what it described as a ""chaotic"" celebrity fan culture, imposing new restrictions on already tightly controlled content in China. 
The moves further clip the wings of Chinese tech behemoths such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and have unnerved investors, hammering Chinese shares traded at home and abroad.
Chinese tech firms have raised billions of dollars in overseas listings, particularly in the United States, as Beijing for years pursued a more laissez faire approach to the industry.
Now China is framing rules https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-plans-ban-us-ipos-data-heavy-tech-firms-wsj-2021-08-27 to ban internet firms whose data is deemed to pose a potential security risk from listing abroad, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The new rules would also put an emphasis on the legal responsibility of underwriters in overseas listings and require a more thorough disclosure of shareholdings for those with so-called variable interest entities (VIE) structure.
The VIE structure, used widely by tech firms, was created two decades ago to circumvent rules restricting foreign investment in sensitive industries such as media and telecoms.
It gives firms more flexibility to raise capital offshore via initial public offerings (IPOs), while bypassing the scrutiny and lengthy vetting that locally-incorporated companies face.
CLOUD CURBS
As China's tech sector has grown in size and prominence so Beijing has become increasingly wary of its influence and the mountains of data it controls.
In a move https://www.reuters.com/technology/tianjin-asks-govt-firms-move-data-out-alibaba-tencent-clouds-document-2021-08-27 underlining that concern, Tianjin, a city of 14 million lying south of Beijing, told companies controlled by the municipality to migrate data from clouds run by private operators like Alibaba and Tencent to a state-run system by September 2022, a document dated Aug. 12 showed.
Shares in Alibaba, China's biggest cloud service provider, closed 4% lower in Hong Kong on Friday. Its U.S.-listed shares were down more than 3% in pre-market trade in New York.
Alibaba Cloud, whose revenues remain modest compared to its parent company's vast e-commerce business, has been heavily promoting its cloud services. Last year, it said it planned to spend $28 billion over three years on next-generation data centres.
Chinese technology stocks have seen tens of billions of dollars wiped off their stock market valuations since Beijing commenced its crackdown on the sector in November 2020 with the shock halt of Ant Group’s IPO, billed as the world’s largest share sale. Since then, the tech sector has dropped nearly 20%.
The Cyberspace Administration of China said on Friday it was also tightening oversight of algorithms https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-issues-draft-guidelines-internet-recommendation-algorithms-2021-08-27 used by tech firms, telling them to act fairly and not use algorithm models that entice users to spend cash in a way that could disrupt public order. 
The guidelines include a proposal to let users turn off algorithm recommendation services, giving consumers a greater say over an area of the internet that has also been the target of authorities in the United States and Europe.
""This policy marks the moment that China's tech regulation is not simply keeping pace with data regulations in the European Union but has gone beyond them,"" said Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China.
China also cracked down https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-crack-down-chaotic-online-fan-culture-2021-08-27 on what it described as a ""chaotic"" celebrity fan culture, barring platforms from publishing popularity lists and regulating the sale of fan merchandise.

Online celebrity fan clubs have become widespread in China. The Paper newspaper has projected that China's ""idol economy"" could be worth 140 billion yuan ($21.59 billion) by 2022.
The clubs have been criticised for their influence over minors and for causing social disorder in China, which already has stringent rules on content, from video games to movies and music. Beijing censors anything it believes violates core socialist values.

(Reuters) -Business and customer engagement software company Freshworks Inc on Friday made public its filing for an initial public offering in the United States, reporting a nearly 53% surge in revenue as more customers signed up for its services. The Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) rival revealed it had earned $168.9 million in revenue for the six months ended June 30 this year in a regulatory filing, up from $110.5 million in the same period last year. Net loss came in at $9.8 million for the same period, down nearly 83% from a year earlier. Freshworks has not yet set the terms for its offering, but Reuters reported in April it could aim for a valuation of up to $10 billion. San Mateo, California-based Freshworks joins a wave of listings from the software and technology sector, most of which have been welcomed by investors who see room for growth even after the pandemic, as more companies embracing hybrid work drive up demand for such products. Launched in 2010 as Freshdesk from the Indian city of Chennai by Girish Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy, Freshworks raised its first round of funds in 2011, the same year it bagged its first customer - the Atwell College in Australia. Backed by investors including Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management, Freshworks has a suite of products that help business with customer management, like a messaging platform, an artificial-intelligence powered chatbot for customer support and call center solutions that promise shorter wait times. It also allows for automation of routine, repetitive tasks and managing of various HR functions like hiring, onboarding and tracking employee data. Freshworks said its technology is used by more than 50,000 companies, including Delivery Hero SE, Swedish payments firm Klarna, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Shareholders in Brazil's Petrobras elected seven government-backed candidates to the board of directors and one market-tipped candidate at an extraordinary meeting on Friday, frustrating investors who had hoped to dilute state control. 
In total, there are now seven government-backed board members at the state-run company, three backed by market shareholders and one backed by workers. Results of the election were the same as Petrobras' previous vote on the matter in April, during which market shareholders also failed to increase their number of seats on the board.
Petrobras' April extraordinary shareholders meeting resulted in complaints from market shareholders that the rules governing the vote were unclear. 
The sole board member elected by market shareholders, Marcelo Gasparino, alleged inconsistencies in separate preliminary vote counts published by the company before the meeting. He later resigned from the board, provoking another extraordinary shareholders' meeting under Brazilian law.
While the voting rules were clarified, the second extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Friday resulted in the same outcome. 
In a WhatsApp message on Friday evening, Gasparino said the structure of shareholders' meetings in Brazil should be improved, so shareholders do not dilute their votes among allied candidates.
Two market-backed board members as well as the worker-backed board member were not up for re-election on Friday and automatically retained their seats.

As a result, representation on the 11-member board remains the same.
Analysts have mixed opinions of the importance of the board's composition. While market shareholders had an opportunity to increase their seats, the government maintains majority voting rights by statute.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 06:31PM ET</span>",Wall St Week Ahead: A blazing U.S. stock rally faces market's toughest month,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rally in which U.S. stocks have doubled from post-pandemic lows is about to enter the year’s worst month for equities, as investors focus on a nationwide COVID-19 resurgence and how quickly the Federal Reserve plans to pull back on its easy money policies.
September has been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500, with the benchmark index falling an average of 0.56% since 1945, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The S&P has advanced only 45% of the time in September, the lowest rate of any month, CFRA’s data showed.
This time around, stocks have momentum on their side. The S&P 500 notched its 52nd record closing high of the year on Friday and has gained 20% so far in 2021, having gone 287 calendar days without a pullback of 5% or more. 
That type of performance has signaled comparatively strong returns in the past. The index has gone on to deliver a median gain of 5.2% for the rest of the year during years when it made 30 or more new highs through August, according to data from LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). That compares with a median gain of 3.6% for all years, the firm's data showed.
A speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday helped allay concerns that the central bank will pull back too soon on the $120 billion in monthly government bond buying that has helped buoy markets, pushing the S&P to fresh records. 
Still, signs of caution have been growing in some corners of the market, fueled in part by rising coronavirus cases across the country and uncertainty over how quickly the Fed will tighten monetary policy once it begins its taper.
With worries over the Delta variant looming, ""to continue to question the rally because of seasonality makes sense,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
While major indexes stand near fresh highs, many stocks have been left behind. Tuesday marked the first time in nearly seven years that the S&P 500 hit a closing high while a 10-day total showed more stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq making 52-week lows than making 52-week highs, according to Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist with market research firm All Star Charts.
Investors have also been cutting back on leverage, with margin debt dropping 4.3% to $844 billion in July even as the S&P advanced more than 2%, according to data from BofA Global Research. The S&P 500 has been lower 71% of the time one year after a peak in margin debt has been reached, the bank’s analysis showed. 
Net leverage among hedge funds, meanwhile, stood at 50% at the start of the third quarter compared with 58% late last year, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report.
Though the market’s year-to-date gains have been spectacular, investors have questioned how much juice remains in the rally. A Reuters poll this week showed strategists believe the S&P 500 is likely to end 2021 not far from its current level.
A window into how the Delta variant has rippled through the economy will come next Friday, with the release of the U.S. jobs report for August, following recent weak readings on consumer sentiment and retail sales. The seven-day average of new reported cases reached about 155,000, the highest in about seven months, Reuters data through Thursday showed.
""When I sift through the noise ... that’s what the market is focusing on right now, plain and simple,” said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. 
Still, there is plenty of support for the view that equities are likely to continue grinding higher into the end of the year. 
BofA Securities said buybacks from corporate clients last week hit their highest level since mid-March, a potential source of support for stocks. Those were led by financials, which notched their highest weekly buybacks since 2010, BofA wrote.

“Despite the tangible Covid variant spike, we think the economy will continue to chug along,"" boosted by corporate and consumer spending, said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, in a note to investors on Friday. 
Some investors remain ready to jump on any downswings brought on by higher volatility in the coming weeks. ""If we do see a pullback in September, I would definitely be telling our clients, 'take this as a buying opportunity,'"" said Janasiewicz.

(Reuters) - Top oilfield services firm Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) is asking U.S. employees to disclose their COVID-19 vaccine status and said more customers are mandating vaccinations as a condition for working on their job sites, the company said on Friday. 
Oil and gas companies have begun ordering certain employees and new hires get vaccinated as Delta variant infections and hospitalizations rise. The Food and Drug Administration this week gave full approval to the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, making it easier for companies to require the shot. 
""Customers have begun to mandate vaccinated personnel as an eligibility requirement to service their operations,"" James R. McDonald, president of Schlumberger's Americas Land business, said in an Aug. 27 email sent to employees and seen by Reuters. Several offshore operators have already enforced the mandate, he said. 
As an oilfield service provider, Schlumberger's employees are often working on job sites operated and run by other oil and gas companies. 
""All employees and contractors will need to disclose their vaccination status through a protocol that protects this information under U.S. regulatory guidelines,"" the email also said. 
Schlumberger in a statement said employees have an option to decline to disclose if they wish. 

Oil producers Hess (NYSE:HES) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) have said workers in their Gulf of Mexico operations would be required to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1. Shale major  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) also is requiring new employees to be fully vaccinated before their first day of work.
Schlumberger's call for employees to disclose their vaccination status, McDonald said the email, will allow the company to ""enhance our mitigation measures to keep people safe and enable business continuity.""

The resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and new regulatory guidance have led companies to change their plans on vaccinations and masking.

It offers a range of brand name and private label merchandise through multiple retail channels, discount stores, boutiques, catalogs, and the internet. As of March 02, 2021, it operated 358 stores in the United States and Canada.
As pandemic-related restrictions eased this year with a strong vaccination drive, department stores witnessed rising foot traffic. As a result, most department stores reported impressive earnings results for the second quarter. However, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases might slow down the increase in foot traffic in the near term. Also, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) decision to add department stores to its list of business ventures will likely increase competition in the department stores space.
On a positive note, the inelastic demand for consumer goods and the practice of passing on higher costs due to inflation to customers should buoy the industry. The global department stores & other general merchandise stores market is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR to $2.18 trillion by 2025. Therefore, both M and JWN should perform well.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street stocks soared while U.S. Treasury yields fell on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the U.S. central bank could begin scaling back its bond buying program by year-end but did not give a firm timeline.
Powell's much-anticipated speech was noncommittal on the precise timing of the Fed's bond tapering, unlike earlier remarks by several regional Fed presidents who wanted tapering to start soon.
At the Fed's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference, Powell expressed caution about raising interest rates as the Fed tries to nurse the economy to full employment and would avoid chasing ""transitory"" inflation.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida echoed Powell's remarks on Friday, saying he believed that the central bank could begin tapering later this year.
Following Powell's speech, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record highs for the fourth time this week driven by stocks in technology, communications, consumer discretionary and financials.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.3104% after Powell's remarks.
""I think markets pretty much anticipated this. The market has been making a new high every single day and week, and it needs low rates to perform,"" said David Kalis, partner at Future Fund LLC in Chicago.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, rose 0.72%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.43%.
Overnight in Asia, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.25%, capping its best week since February.
""The Fed is also aware that they can't raise rates aggressively, and inflation does seem transitory as the economy opens up and things get back in gear,"" Kalis said.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.69% to 35,455.8, the S&P 500 gained 0.88% to 4,509.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.23% to 15,129.50.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.397% to 92.684. 
Gold gained more than 1%.
Spot gold was up 1.44% at $1,817.9490 an ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 1.47% to $1,818.70 an ounce.

Oil prices increased more than 2% and were on track for their biggest weekly gains in over a year as energy companies began shutting production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ahead of a major hurricane expected to hit early next week.
Brent futures rose 2.3% to settle at $72.70 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 2.0% to settle at $68.74.

Let’s discuss.The United States has snapped out of its pandemic-driven recession. The government has been deploying sizable investment packages to propel the growth of almost every sector. Most recently, on August 24, the House voted to advance the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill while approving the $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that includes President Biden’s critical domestic policy proposals. This marks significant progress in Biden’s “Build Back Better” agenda, which if passed into law is expected to benefit businesses across almost every sector.
Despite several headwinds, including the resurgence of the COVID-19 cases, the proposed large-scale investments and fiscal stimulus are expected to drive investor optimism. Consequently, growth stocks, which tend to perform well during an economic boom, are expected to gain handsomely.

(Reuters) - Japanese oil company Inpex Corp sold two Venezuelan oil and gas assets to Caracas-based Sucre Energy Group, three people familiar with the transaction said, as multinational firms retreat from the crisis-stricken OPEC nation.
Sucre, a privately-held exploration and production firm focusing on improving mature fields in Latin America, purchased Inpex's 70% stake in the Gas Guarico natural gas partnership with state oil company PDVSA, as well as its 30% stake in the Petroguarico oil joint venture, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet public. 
Inpex declined to comment. Neither Sucre nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment. The three people declined to specify the value of the transaction.
Inpex is the latest in a string of major oil companies to abandon once-promising assets in Venezuela, home to some of the world's largest crude reserves but plagued by hyperinflation, corruption, and U.S. sanctions on PDVSA aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro, labeled a dictator by Washington. 
In recent weeks, France's TotalEnergies and Norway's Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) exited their Petrocedeno joint venture with PDVSA, citing the high carbon intensity of the project's extra-heavy crude. Both companies retained their stakes in Venezuelan gas fields.
A consortium of Japanese companies including Inpex also recently exited its 5% stake in the Petroindependencia joint venture with PDVSA, Reuters reported in June.
Sucre's entry shows how local firms are increasingly filling the void left by multinationals in the oil sector and beyond, as the government scales back intervention in the economy and restrictions on the private sector, hoping to attract investment in the face of sanctions.
Sucre has invested in Ecuador's oil sector, and is part-owner of a subsidiary of Paris-based Maurel et Prom which in 2018 purchased https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-shell-exclusive/exclusive-shell-seeks-to-sell-venezuela-jv-stake-to-frances-maurel-prom-sources-idUSKCN1ML30L Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s 40% stake in Petroregional del Lago, an oil joint venture with PDVSA in western Venezuela.
The company was most interested in Gas Guarico, which produces around 50 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, but agreed to purchase the stake in Petroguarico as well as part of the deal, the people said.
Venezuelan gas fields can be more attractive for investors than oil-focused projects because private companies can hold majority stakes and operate the fields, the people said. Venezuelan law requires PDVSA to own the majority of oil joint ventures with private companies.

Venezuela has huge gas reserves but limited infrastructure to process and transport it, meaning it cannot yet export to neighbors. Just 10% of the population has a gas connection to their homes, meaning much of the gas produced alongside oil is flared, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-gas-flaring/ex-shell-exec-who-cut-gas-flaring-in-iraq-seeks-to-do-the-same-in-venezuela-idUSKBN20S28A a significant source of carbon emissions. 
Sucre is expecting rebounds in Venezuela's petrochemical, power and heavy industry sectors after a half-decade economic collapse, providing a source of growing gas demand, one of the people said. In the longer-term, Venezuela could emerge as a gas supplier to neighbors Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago.

(Reuters) - A possible merger between storage hardware maker  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) with its Japanese partner and chipmaker Kioxia Holdings could create a NAND memory chipmaking giant that rivals Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF). 
But analysts are questioning whether Kioxia's investors will accept the price and terms of the reported $20 billion all-stock offer from Western Digital, which would provide no cash to the Japanese firm and put a lower value on it than other comparable deals in the industry. Western Digital on Friday filed documents to issue more shares but did not disclose the size of the offering.
Kioxia is one the largest players in NAND memory chips that provide the storage space in phones and hard drives, competing with South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix. Hynix last year agreed to buy U.S. chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s NAND business for $9 billion.
Analysts said the Intel deal provides a sense of what buyers are willing to pay for memory companies. Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said that Kioxia has about three times the sales of Intel's memory unit, so Kioxia's owners may want about three times the price - $25 billion to $28 billion.
But Western Digital's entire market valuation is lower than Chan's estimated price tag for Kioxia at about $20 billion as of its close Aug. 25 when the media reports on the deal came out. In a note to investors, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said even at a $20 billion price tag for Kioxia, the Japanese firm's huge price relative to Western Digital's overall value makes it ""hard to see WDC wanting to issue that much stock at this valuation."" 

Analysts instead said that investors in Kioxia, which was sold by Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp in 2018 to a consortium led by private equity firm Bain Capital for $18 billion as Toshiba Memory Corp, would prefer an all-cash deal or at least a deal with a heavy cash component. But some analysts believe Kioxia's owners could come around to an all-stock deal if they believe the combined company's shares will rise in the coming years.
""It could be a long-term play on the combined company's success,"" said William Kerwin, analyst at Morningstar Research. ""Or it may have been the only way to offload Kioxia at a valuation they wanted.""

So, let’s take a close look at these companies.The stock market has been volatile of late owing to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, surging inflation, and rising geopolitical tensions. Because concerns over a slowing economic recovery could lead to a market correction in the near term, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound mid-cap stocks that have business momentum.
Historically, mid-cap stocks have delivered better returns than large-cap stocks and remained more stable than small-cap stocks.

The House of Representatives Select Committee asked for records connected to the violence and the days leading up to it, including the spread of misinformation and efforts to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's election.
Demands also went out to 4chan and 8kun. 
Twitter declined to comment. TikTok and Parler did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The other companies could not be reached for immediate comment.
Facebook, Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Google and Reddit each confirmed they had received the request and said the companies would work with the committee.
Gab said in a statement that it received a letter from the committee, adding it had removed accounts ""which sought to spread division and fear"" in the lead-up to the inauguration.
The committee is seeking records dating to the spring of 2020 including what, if any, policy changes the companies made to slow the spread of false information online.
Former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said that committee subpoenas did not have the power to force the companies to turn over private content, and he said contacts with law enforcement might be shielded as well. On the other hand, he said internal reviews of what the platforms could have done better might shape public understanding of what happened and why.
The committee's broad document request spanning 15 companies indicates this is the opening salvo to understanding how the social media platforms were used to organize ahead of Jan. 6 and on the day, and will likely lead to numerous follow-up questions, said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.
The tech platforms have long been criticized for failing to police violent extremist content, though they also face concerns over censorship. The issue of domestic extremism, including white supremacy and militia groups, took on renewed urgency following the Capitol riot.
The congressional panel on Wednesday made its first document request https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-committee-demands-records-over-jan-6-attack-us-capitol-2021-08-25 from government agencies, including communications involving some of Trump's closest advisers and family and extensive requests for material from the government agencies including the Pentagon, Justice Department, FBI and intelligence agencies.
House Democrats formed the committee, despite objections from Trump's fellow Republicans in the House, to investigate the worst violence at the Capitol since the British invasion during the War of 1812.

Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot to death by police and the other three of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives.
The document requests came a month after the committee held its first hearing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-who-defended-us-capitol-testify-riot-probes-first-hearing-2021-07-27, at which four police officers who had helped repel the attack described being beaten, taunted with racial insults and fearing they might die as they struggled to protect the building.

""We believe there remains sufficient cause to support the election of a direct shareholder representative at this time,"" Glass Lewis wrote in its report, which was seen by Reuters.
The report criticizes Box's board for having supported a $500 million convertible preferred offering led by private equity firm KKR, calling it a ""puzzling, poorly received and underutilized capital raise.""
For Starboard, the KKR deal has become the centerpiece of its broader criticism that Box has a poor track record of being a public company and has failed to deliver on its commitments in spite of its strong product positioning. Starboard has also told the board that it should fire Chief Executive Aaron Levie and find a buyer for the company.
This year's campaign marks the second time in two years that Starboard, one of the industry's busiest activists with a history of winning more board seats than its rivals, has taken aim at Box.
The hedge fund reached a settlement with the company in March 2020 that allowed it to choose one director and have input in choosing a second. Both of those directors have assumed leadership roles on the board.
Starboard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Box said the report ignores ""that Peter Feld has been insistent on firing Box’s CEO in the absence of a sale, demonstrating his unwillingness to be open minded.""
Glass Lewis and its larger rival Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) are often instrumental in determining the outcome of boardroom battles over who sits on a board by making recommendations that many big investors like mutual funds follow.
ISS issued its report earlier this week and came to a different conclusion, recommending that investors back the company's nominees instead, not Starboard's directors. While ISS says that Starboard deserves credit for operational and governance changes made since last year's settlement, it also adds that the current board deserves more time to allow its changes to take hold.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>","U.S. COVID-19 tests again in short supply as infections soar, schools reopen","By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests increasingly in short supply as COVID-19 cases soar and schools and employers revive surveillance programs that will require tens of millions of tests, according to industry executives and state health officials. 
    Test manufacturers including  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Co, and Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp in recent months scaled back production of rapid COVID-19 tests, which can produce results on-site in minutes, as well as test kits that are sent to laboratories for analysis. The move followed a nearly 90% decline in testing and a similarly large drop in COVID-19 cases in the United States.
Abbott in June shut down two production lines in Maine and closed a manufacturing plant in Illinois. Around the same time, Quidel shifted production away from COVID-19 tests. Becton Dickinson had also scaled back production in recent months. 
    Now, with the Delta variant pushing U.S. COVID-19 cases well above 100,000 per day, test makers are working to quickly reverse course, industry executives and state officials told Reuters. 
""We’re hiring people and turning on parts of our manufacturing network that were idled or slowed when guidance changed and demand plunged,"" Abbott said in a statement. 
However, testmakers including Abbott and Becton Dickinson cautioned that there may be supply constraints in the near term. 
    “With the rise of cases from the Delta variant... there is currently some tightness in supply as manufacturers ramp back up,"" said Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesperson for Becton Dickinson, adding that the company expects inventory levels ""will normalize over the next couple of weeks.""
    Demand for COVID-19 tests has been largely driven by healthcare providers, employers and schools, he added. 
Supplies could tighten even further as more state governments and private employers demand staff either get vaccinated or agree to regular testing.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are among major employers requiring staff to be regularly tested.
    Testing in schools is a top priority for federal and state officials as a minority of the roughly 70 million school-age U.S. children have been vaccinated. Those under 12 are not yet eligible for the shots. 
    Demand for diagnostic tests has surged nearly six-fold in the past two months, from around 250,000 per day in early July to nearly 1.5 million in mid-August, according to U.S. federal data. The data only tracks diagnostic tests that are run in laboratories.   
    That demand is only expected to grow.
More than half a dozen states, including California, Delaware, and South Carolina, have set up comprehensive surveillance testing programs for their public K-12 schools, while Pennsylvania and Arkansas are among at least a dozen other states developing similar plans. Even in states without such plans, many local school districts are rolling out surveillance programs. 
    Ysleta Independent School District in El Paso, Texas, expects to need around 40,000 Abbott rapid tests per month to monitor students for COVID-19, said Lynly Leeper, the district’s chief financial and operational officer.
Her school district had been planning to shut down its testing program until the Delta variant sent cases soaring in the state in recent weeks.
SUPPLY CHAIN CONCERNS
Delaware, which was among the first to roll out a comprehensive surveillance testing program in July, has already begun to see some test shortages, said Dr. Rick Pescatore, an associate medical director in the state’s public health agency.
The surge in test demand has sounded alarms among federal officials, who are “concerned that people are going to start shutting down our supply chain,” limiting the flexibility to respond to a spike in cases, said Quidel Chief Executive Douglas Bryant told Reuters.
The recent increase in surveillance testing ""really stresses the supply chain,” said Dana Lerman, medical director at The COVID Consultants, a physicians group that provides COVID-19 testing and advisory services. Her organization has seen demand for rapid tests increase 200% since June.
Even if testmakers are able to keep up with rising demand from U.S. schools, states will still face challenges covering the expense of widespread testing, which experts say will cost the average school district at least $1 million each year. 
   Ysleta in El Paso said it expects it will cost around $3 million to safely test its students this school year, and is relying on Texas to provide it with funds. 

   The Biden administration granted $10 billion to help states developing COVID-19 testing programs. Experts said the sum is far short of what states will need to cover testing for the full school year. 
   “More federal funding will be necessary,"" said Dr. Antonia Sepulveda, president of the Association of Molecular Pathology that represents diagnostic testing laboratories, ""for institutions to continue comprehensive testing programs.""

So, for investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for chips, we think it could be wise to instead invest in Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI). These three companies possess sound financials and are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. So, let’s examine these names.As one of the popular players in the semiconductor space, the shares of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD) have gained 36.9% in price over the past three months to close yesterday’s trading session at $107.27, after hitting their $122.49, 52-week high. The company recently launched its AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT graphics card, which is designed to deliver the ultimate high-framerate, high-fidelity, and highly responsive 1080p gaming experience.
However, AMD’s trailing-12-month gross profit margin and CAPEX/Sales are 45.71% and 2.08%, respectively, compared unfavorably with the 49.04% and 2.28% industry averages. Moreover, the stock is currently trading at an expensive valuation. In terms of forward Price-to-Book ratio, AMD’s 15.39x is 156.3% higher than the 6x industry average. In addition, the stock’s 8.33x forward P/S is 103.2% higher than the 4.10x industry average. So, it’s wise to wait for a better entry point in the stock.
Nevertheless, the industry looks attractive right currently. Because the governments of several countries are investing heavily to address the semiconductor chip shortage, prominent players in this space should benefit from the rising demand for semiconductors from several industries. According to a SpendEdge report, the global semiconductor market will grow at a 6.8% CAGR from 2021 - 2025.

(Reuters) -Peloton Interactive Inc said on Friday U.S. regulators were investigating the company, adding to the exercise bike maker's woes as it deals with a backlash over reports of accidents involving its treadmills.
The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have subpoenaed the company for documents and information over injuries from its exercise machines, the company said in a filing with the U.S. securities regulator https:// Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) recalled its Tread+ product in May, just weeks after saying there was ""no reason"" to stop using the exercise machine despite reports of the death of a child and multiple injuries.  Its public disclosures related to the reports are also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Peloton said.  ""Even with the treadmill 'fix' to prevent small children and pets from being injured, it is a high hurdle to get over when a child dies as a result of a product,"" said Walter Thompson, former president, American College of Sports Medicine. Chief Executive Officer John Foley publicly apologized in May for Peloton's initial response to the accident reports, and the company also laid out steps to improve on safety. Peloton said on Friday it had been named in several lawsuits associated with the recalls. ""We intend to cooperate fully with each of these investigations, and at this time, we are unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the investigations,"" the company said. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which in April had warned about the dangers of the Tread+ treadmills, is already investigating the injuries.  
Peloton said late on Thursday its near-term profitability would be affected due to a decision to slash the price of its exercise bike and higher commodity and marketing costs. The company's shares were trading down 6.6% at $106.50 in afternoon trade.

""The policy has not been eased or amended,"" a Commerce Department spokesperson said. 
The comments came in response to demands https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-senator-rubio-demands-answers-huaweis-auto-chip-approvals-2021-08-26 from Sen. Marco Rubio that U.S. officials explain why they approved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of auto chip sales to the company, as reported by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-us-approves-licenses-huawei-buy-auto-chips-sources-2021-08-25 this week. 
Rubio called the move ""yet another example of President Biden's failure to protect America's economic and national security.""
Huawei was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019, after the Trump administration said it was operating contrary to national security and foreign policy interests. 
The so-called ""entity list"" restricts suppliers from selling U.S. goods and technology to the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker. The Commerce Department is prohibited from disclosing license approvals or denials, the spokesperson has said. 
But some sales were allowed and others denied as the United States intensified its crackdown on the company and expanded U.S. authority to require licenses for sales of semiconductors made abroad with American technology.
An August 2020 rule said that licenses for products with 5G capabilities were likely to be rejected, but sales of less sophisticated technology would be decided on a case-by-case basis. 
During the Trump administration, $87 billion worth of licenses for Huawei were approved after its blacklisting, but $119 billion were denied as the presidency wound down in January, according to a Commerce Department document seen by Reuters. 

""The Biden Administration has not changed the regulatory restrictions on Huawei and its affiliates on the Entity List imposed in 2019 or 2020 or the policy for implementing those restrictions developed during the Trump administration,"" the Commerce Department spokesperson said.
Other congressional China hawks also have criticized the auto chip approvals, with Mike Rogers (NYSE:ROG), lead Republican on the Armed Services committee, urging that the licenses be revoked.

BRUSSELS/BENGALURU (Reuters) -Nvidia is likely to seek EU antitrust approval for its $54 billion takeover of British chip designer Arm early next month, with regulators expected to launch a full-scale investigation after a preliminary review, people familiar with the matter said.
The world's biggest maker of graphics and AI chips announced the Arm deal last year, sparking an immediate backlash in the semiconductor industry.
Arm has long been a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers who are otherwise intense rivals, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) said it has garnered the support of Arm customers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), MediaTek and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), according to a presentation on its website.
A request to the European Commission for approval of the deal will kick off a 25-working day preliminary review. Nvidia is unlikely to offer concessions during this period, the sources said, which will then prompt a 90-working day full-scale EU investigation.
Sources previously told Reuters in June that Nvidia may not be able to meet a March 2022 deadline for closing its deal due to European regulators' reluctance to consider the case until after the summer holidays.
The Financial Times reported earlier that the European Union was set to launch a formal competition probe into the planned takeover early next month.
Britain's competition regulator said last week that the deal could damage competition and weaken rivals, and required a further lengthy investigation.
""This transaction will be beneficial to Arm, its licensees, competition, and the industry. We are working through the regulatory process and we look forward to engaging with the European Commission to address any concerns they may have."" Nvidia said.

Arm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Arm, currently owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp is a major player in global semiconductors, a sector fundamental to technologies from artificial intelligence and quantum computing to 5G telecoms networks. Its designs power nearly every smartphone and millions of other devices.

(Reuters) -Electric vehicle maker Rivian said it has confidentially filed paperwork with regulators for an initial public offering, setting the stage for a blockbuster year-end market debut as it looks to tap into a red-hot IPO market in the U.S. 
Rivian, which counts Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Soros Fund Management and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) among its major investors, will seek a valuation of around $70-80 billion at the time of its initial public offering, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
At that valuation, Rivian would have a bigger market capitalization than General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), the largest U.S. automaker. But it would still be dwarfed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which boasts of a market cap of nearly $700 billion and is currently planning to build a pickup truck that would compete with Rivian's own version.
Rivian's stock market flotation is expected to lead the year-end line-up for U.S. IPOs, which have so far raised a record haul of over $225 billion this year, according to data from Dealogic. 
A number of high-profile names, including Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global, South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global, have already taken advantage of record-breaking capital markets activity this year and floated their shares on U.S. stock exchanges. 
Several other big names are expected to go public in the last quarter of the year, including the likes of chipmaker GlobalFoundries, restaurant software provider Toast and private equity giant TPG, among others. 
Rivian did not provide any other details on its IPO plans on Friday. It is expected to lift the veil off its finances for the first time in a public filing in the coming weeks. 
The company is one of the most well-funded startups in the United States. It raised $10.5 billion since the start of 2019, including $2.5 billion in July in a round led by Amazon and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. 
RACE FOR SUPREMACY
Founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors in 2009 by RJ Scaringe, the company changed its name to Rivian in 2011. “Rivian” is derived from ""Indian River"" in Florida, a place Scaringe frequented in a rowboat as a youth.
Rivian is looking to start production of an electric pick-up and an SUV this year.
Rivian's filing comes as automakers are racing to develop electric vehicles (EVs) as China, Europe and other countries and regions mandate lower carbon emissions.
In the United States, traditional carmakers such as GM and Ford are retrofitting plants for EV production, while Tesla, Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn and several startups are expanding existing plants or are building them.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Rivian was in discussions to invest at least $5 billion in a new vehicle plant near Fort Worth, Texas.
Rivian is currently pursuing a two-track strategy: building electric delivery vans for Amazon, while developing an electric pickup and SUV brand aimed at affluent individuals.
Amazon has ordered 100,000 of Rivian's electric delivery vans as part of the e-commerce giant's broader effort to cut its carbon footprint.
This year, however, has not been without challenges for Rivian, as CEO Scaringe in July told customers the pandemic had delayed the launch of its vehicles.

Apart from Rivian, a slew of fast-growing EV startups have taken advantage of the capital markets boom in the past 12 months, especially with the rise of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). 
The likes of Lucid Motors, Nikola Corp, Fisker Inc and Lordstown Motors Corp, have all chosen to merge with blank check firms to go public.

Investing.com – Big Lots stock (NYSE:BIG) fell 5% on Friday after the discount retailer warned its 2021 comparable sales and margins will be lower than those of the previous year owing to supply chain disruptions and higher freight costs.
Sales and earnings in the second quarter were also lower than estimates.
The company said its 2021 comparable sales will decline in low-single-digit on a year-on-year basis. The company doesn’t give comparable sales numbers in absolute terms. Total net sales in 2020 were $6.19 billion.
Gross margins are seen lower by 100 basis, owing to costlier transportation. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Earnings per diluted share are seen between $5.90 and $6.05, lower than the $7.35 the company clocked in the last financial year.
President and CEO Bruce Thorn said the company had two-year comparable sales growth across all merchandise categories other than food, with strong double-digit two-year growth in furniture, soft home, hard home, and apparel, electronics and other.
Furniture sales remain strong and were up over 30% from 2019, he said.
Ecommerce demand grew by 10% during May to July compared to 2020’s second quarter.
On a net basis, the neighborhood discount retailer added eight stores to close with 1,422 stores by the end of July.
Net sales for the second quarter totaled $1.45 billion, an 11% decrease from the same period last year. Comparable sales fell 13%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.09.

San Francisco-based Gap also lifted its annual profit estimate, sending shares up 7% aftermarket as both forecasts surpassed market expectations in a strong earnings season for retailers such as Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and discounter T.J. Maxx.
""Our customers embraced summer with optimism, hungry for mood-boosting clothing as vacations and reunions became a reality,"" Gap Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said on an earnings call.
Old Navy's net sales jumped 21% in the second quarter from pre-pandemic levels two years ago, while Athleta surged 35%.
Its tie-up with rapper Kanye West also brought in a windfall for the retailer, as 75% of pre-orders for the Yeezy-Gap jacket came from brand new customers. 
The Banana Republic owner has also been spending more on its digital business to tap the surge in online shopping, and said earlier in the day that it bought Drapr, a startup that lets customers try on clothes virtually.
Gap expects fiscal 2021 net sales growth of about 30%, compared with a prior forecast in the low-to-mid 20% range. Analysts expected a 24.3% growth, according to Refinitiv data.
The company, which has also been sharpening its focus on marketing and inclusivity, forecast annual adjusted profit between $2.10 and $2.25 per share from $1.60 to $1.75 earlier. Analysts expected $1.80.

Net sales of $4.2 billion were the highest second-quarter sales in over a decade, rising 29% to beat estimates.
However, Gap said it is investing in air freight as it deals with delayed inventory deliveries due to shipping congestions and pandemic-led factory closures in countries it sources from, echoing comments from rival Abercrombie & Fitch.

Recently, a couple of CDC studies have shown that the effect of vaccines is decreasing, and that fully vaccinated people are being infected by the new strain of the virus. In addition, a U.K based study reported that the effects of two of the most widely used vaccines start to wane after six months.
In addition, increased employee productivity and lower overhead costs should lead to the worldwide adoption of permanent remote work set-ups in the long run. A new study from Aspen Economic Strategy Group suggests that remote working structures can boost the economy up to $160 billion, provided secure internet access is available.
Because the work-from-home culture is here to stay, established software companies VMware, Inc. (VMW), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM), Dropbox, Inc. (DBX), and Box, Inc. (BOX), which all facilitate remote working, should grow substantially through the remainder of 2021. So, we think it could be wise to bet on their stocks now.

(Reuters) -European stocks rose on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell showed no signs the U.S. central bank will reduce a massive stimulus program, while real estate stocks were led higher by Norway's Entra after a major peer took a stake in the firm. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.4% higher, with mining stocks up 1.9%, while real estate stocks added 1.5%. 
The day's gains helped the STOXX 600 close 0.8% higher for the week, after trading flat for several days. Commodity-linked stocks were the best weekly performers, as they bounced back from steep losses. 
Entra was the best performer on the STOXX 600, rising 4.6% as its peer Castellum bought 11.8% of shares in the firm from the government pension fund in Norway.
The STOXX 600 extended its gains after Powell's highly anticipated announcement, which reassured investors that programs which have flooded markets with liquidity for the past year will remain in place for the time being.
""Powell’s warning about the risks of premature tightening and repeated reference to “much ground to cover” to reach the Fed’s employment objective hint that the Fed may be on hold until Q4 at the earliest,"" said Matt Weller, global head of research at Forex.com.
U.S. stocks touched record highs after the announcement, while European stocks were less than a percent away from their peak, as investors looked past rising COVID-19 cases and concerns over slowing economic growth. 
A survey showed French consumer confidence eased marginally in August, while morale amongst Italian businesses and consumers also fell this month.
The Delta variant of the coronavirus is only expected to have a limited impact on the euro zone economy, which remains on course for robust growth this year and next, European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane said earlier this week.
Just Eat Takeaway.com, which owns GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), fell 7.5% after the New York City Council approved legislation to license food-delivery apps and permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants.
Just Eat was the biggest percentage loser on the STOXX 600 on Friday. 

Norwegian fish farmer Salmar rose 2.5% after the company dropped plans to launch an 11.8 billion crowns ($1.29 billion) cash bid for rival Norway Royal Salmon (NRS). NRS shares fell 11.8%.

(Reuters) - The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy on Friday urged opponents of the OxyContin maker’s reorganization plan, which would resolve widespread opioid litigation, to settle quickly with the company’s Sackler family owners because it would save time and money on appeals later.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, made his remark during a hearing on Friday morning, five days before he is set to rule on the plan. 
The deal, if approved, would clear a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shield the Sackler family owners from future litigation. Opponents of the deal have said the releases are too broad.

“I think, having heard the lawyers from both sides – they are very talented lawyers, they know the risks they face – I would hope their clients would also be realistic about those risks,” Drain said.
Purdue has said the deal, which directs funding toward opioid abatement programs, is worth more than $10 billion. The Sacklers have agreed to contribute approximately $4.5 billion.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 12:02PM ET</span>",Alphabet's Waymo to stop selling lidar self-driving car sensors,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo said on Thursday that it has ended a two-year effort to sell light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors to other companies.
This is a reversal from its earlier strategy to sell the lidars to non-automotive customers to bring down costs of a key and expensive component of self-driving cars.
""We're winding down our commercial lidar business as we maintain our focus on developing and deploying our Waymo Driver across our Waymo One (ride-hailing) and Waymo Via (delivery) units,"" a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement.
The spokesperson, however, said it will continue to build its lidars in-house. 
According to a person familiar with the matter, Waymo is considering both internal technology and external suppliers for its next-generation lidars.
The move to stop selling lidars comes after the departure of CEO John Krafcik and some other executives, which had fueled questions about whether Waymo would rethink its strategy after failing to generate significant revenue for over a decade. 
In 2019, Waymo said it was going to sell one of its three different in-house lidars to customers in robotics, farming and others, not to rival self-driving car firms.
""We can scale our autonomous technology faster, making each sensor more affordable through economies of scale,"" Simon Verghese, Head of Lidar Team, said at that time. 
It was not clear whether Waymo was able to generate enough revenue to offset development and operational costs of its lidar sales business. 
Lidars use laser pulses to measure distances and render precise images of the environment around the car. Most self-driving firms, including Waymo, say lidars are key to achieving full autonomy. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said companies that rely on the expensive sensors are ""doomed."" 
Waymo in 2018 launched the first commercial self-driving taxis, retrofitting Chrysler's minivan with its own self-driving hardware. But it has not yet expanded and scaled up the technology beyond limited areas in suburban Phoenix, and it has recently launched public testing around dense San Francisco with a Jaguar electric car and a new suite of sensors. 
In 2011, Waymo began developing its own set of sensors from the ground up, including three types of lidars, including short-range lidars dubbed Laser Bear Honeycomb.
But Tim Willis, general manager of the company's Laser Bear lidars, left the company in February and joined lidar company Aeva, according to his LinkedIn profile. 

Australian Droid + Robot tested prototype robots with Waymo's Honeycomb lidars in mines in Australia. 
""Everyone knew the risks associated with that venture,"" Mat Allan, manager of perception and AI at Australian Droid + Robot, told Reuters. ""It’s a good product. We haven’t found anything that matches price to performance... It’s a shame though we couldn’t continue the journey,"" he said.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 12:02PM ET</span>",Lordstown Motors new CEO focused on electric truck launch,"By Ben Klayman and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) -Lordstown Motors Corp's new chief executive said on Thursday his focus will be on making sure the electric vehicle maker successfully rolls out its pickup truck in the face of intense regulatory scrutiny. After that, raising further necessary funds will take care of itself.
The Ohio-based startup appointed Daniel Ninivaggi as CEO, handing over the reins to the former employee of investor Carl Icahn, sending shares up as much as 41%, before they later fell back to a 16.5% gain.
""Job No. 1 is to make sure we stay on track from a production standpoint,"" Ninivaggi told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""Without that, you can't raise capital.""
While Lordstown is working to launch the Endurance truck, it will work in parallel on raising further funds, he said, adding he had spoken with a lot of people from his past since he was named CEO, but not yet Icahn. 
""The financing is going to come when people believe in the product and the production,"" Ninivaggi said.
""If they believe the story and we prove to them that we hit these milestones, I'll have a lot of friends,"" he added, referring to potential investors.
The company's founder and largest shareholder, Steve Burns, resigned as CEO in June following an internal investigation into claims made by short-seller Hindenburg Research.
Industry veteran Ninivaggi has also overseen Icahn Enterprises' automotive aftermarket service network and parts distribution businesses.
Ninivaggi, who serves as the chairman for autoparts maker  Garrett Motion  (NASDAQ:GTX) Inc, has also been a director at companies including Motorola (NYSE:MSI) Mobility, Navistar (NYSE:NAV) International and Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ).
Last month, Lordstown said a hedge fund had committed to purchasing up to $400 million of the startup's shares over a three-year period. Executives said that the firm was exploring other financing options, including debt.
Lordstown, which hung an ""open for business"" sign on its northeastern Ohio plant earlier this month, has struggled with the launch of its Endurance pickup truck. 
The company will compete with industry leader Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which is launching the F-150 Lightning electric pickup next spring. Ninivaggi said demand for electric pickups will outstrip supply for a while, so there will be enough business for both Ford and Lordstown.

Lordstown still faces a lot of scrutiny from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and statements it previously made about preorders for its vehicles.
Ninivaggi said the probes won't distract from Lordstown's launch efforts and they don't need to be settled prior to the company raising further funding.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -JOYY Inc's top two shareholders, its Chairman David Li and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) founder Lei Jun, plan to take the Nasdaq-listed company private in a deal that could value it at up to $8 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
They are teaming up for the deal as they believe the Chinese social media company is undervalued in the U.S. market, the people added. JOYY (NASDAQ:YY) had an average market value of $3.9 billion over the past month, while its net asset value totalled $5.6 billion as of June 30, based on its quarterly results.
Li and Lei are looking to offer $75-$100 per share to take the cash-rich JOYY private, two of the people said, a premium of 50-100% to the share's average price over the past month.
The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was private.
Li and Lei did not immediately respond to requests for comment via JOYY and Xiaomi, respectively. Neither did JOYY.
JOYY shares rose 8.6% in pre-market trading on Thursday. 
Li and Lei owned 23.2% and 7.8% of JOYY, respectively, the company's 2020 annual report shows. Li had 76% voting power.
If completed, the deal will add to a growing number of New York-listed Chinese firms that have already opted out of U.S. bourses by going private or returning to equity markets closer to home via second listings.
These moves come amid heightened scrutiny and stricter audit requirements https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-sec-gives-chinese-companies-new-requirements-us-ipo-disclosures-2021-08-23 for U.S.-listed Chinese companies from American regulators amid political tensions between the countries.
Reuters reported last month that Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Chairman Charles Chao and a state investor were in talks to take Weibo private https://www.reuters.com/article/weibo-privitisation-idCNL2N2OI0WL in a deal that could value the Nasdaq-listed Chinese equivalent of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) at $20 billion-plus. 
There were 16 announced take-private deals of U.S.-listed Chinese companies worth $19 billion last year, Dealogic data shows, versus just five such deals worth $8 billion in 2019. 
FINANCE AND REGULATORY NOD
The Li-Lei consortium is in talks with banks to finance the deal and seeks to secure a loan by using JOYY's $4.9 billion cash and cash equivalents as collateral, two of the sources said, adding it aims to finalise the deal by the end of 2021.
The plan is to then spin off JOYY's key asset, Singapore-based Bigo - which runs a live streaming platform Bigo Live and short video business Likee, and list it in Asia, likely in Hong Kong, to take advantage of higher valuations, one source added. 
Founded in 2005, JOYY went public on the Nasdaq in 2012. It also runs game-focused social media platform Hago and owns a 16% stake in Chinese videogame streaming site Huya (NYSE:HUYA).
JOYY said in November that it would sell its video-based entertainment live streaming business in China to search engine giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) for about $3.6 billion in cash.
The sale is waiting to be green lit by the antitrust watchdog State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) to reach a final close in the coming weeks, the sources said.
The SAMR nod would also allow JOYY to receive the remaining proceeds of about $1.6 billion from Baidu, they added.

The SAMR did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. 
JOYY shares have plunged 53% in the past six months while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed on the exchange, has dropped 41%.

In addition, because a robust rollout of vaccines has led to increased outdoor regular and fitness activities, despite the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the demand for footwear is expected to remain strong.

Investing.com – Gap stock (NYSE:GPS) jumped 3% Friday as the clothing retailer revised its guidance one more time after reporting its best second-quarter sales.
The company has predicted its 2021 sales to rise by about 30% which makes it $17.94 billion for the year. This compares to “down low-single digits” forecast it first gave in March. That estimate was revised in May.
Comparable sales were up 3% year-over-year.
On many parameters, the company did comparisons with 2019 owing to that being a pre-pandemic year.
Online sales grew 65% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and represented 33% of the total business. Store sales fell 11% from two years ago due to divestitures and strategic closures.
The Athleta brand recoded the highest jump in sales on a percentage basis. Net sales were up 35% versus 2019 as customers chose for comfort wear even while working. Old Navy sales rose, too, as the company launched customer loyalty drives, leveraged its positioning among kids and parents in the back-to-school season and expanded its offering for women.
Net sales rose 29% from 2020 quarter and 5% from 2019, to $4.2 billion. Profit per share of 70 cents beat the estimated 45 cents.

The deal, Kismet said, is the first cooperation of its kind, involving a company from Russia and a Russian SPAC to list shares in the United States.
It follows another one by a company with Russian roots. In March, British electric automobile startup Arrival, founded by Russia's former deputy minister of communications, debuted on Nasdaq with the help of U.S. vehicle CIIG Merger Corp.
Nexters, a global company with Russian co-founders, entered into an agreement with Russian SPAC Kismet Acquisition One Corp in early 2021 and secured funds to proceed with the Nasdaq listing in July.
Nexters' Inc. ordinary shares and warrants will be traded on Nasdaq under the tickers GDEV and GDEVW, respectively, the company said in a statement.
The transaction will deliver around $132 million in cash to Nexters and its shareholders, comprising funds from the Kismet trust account, Kismet Sponsor Limited, and PIPE investors Mubadala Investment Company and VPE Capital.
One of Europe's top five independent game developers, Nexters plans to spend the raised funds on developing new products and to boost its position in the gaming space.
It was founded in Russia in 2010 but is headquartered in Cyprus. In common with other gaming firms, its sales have risen during the pandemic. In the first quarter, the developer of popular games Hero Wars and Throne Rush recorded a 48% year-on-year revenue increase.

In July, Nexters said investment worth $50 million from Kismet, alongside $50 million from the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co and VPE Capital, took the company to the $100 million minimum requirement for the Nasdaq listing.
Kismet, created by Ivan Tavrin, the former CEO of Russian telecoms firm Megafon, staged an initial public offering on the Nasdaq in August 2020, raising $250 million to invest in telecoms, technology, consumer goods and services.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday but in narrow ranges, ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's keenly-anticipated speech at Jackson Hole. 
Powell is expected to map out a rough timeline for tapering the Fed's bond purchases, currently running at $120 billion a month. The big question of the day is whether the market is confident enough in the economic recovery to withstand any message that the central bank is about to start withdrawing its post-pandemic stimulus. Comments from Powell's colleagues at the regional Federal Reserve banks over the last 24 hours have all suggested that an imminent start to tapering is in the cards, given the U.S. economy's recovery so far in 2021. However Powell and others on the Washington based board of Fed governors have generally struck a more dovish tone. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 101 points, or 0.3% at 35,314 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%, in what amounted to little more than a correction of Thursday's falls.
Data released earlier showed the Fed's favorite gauge of inflation still running well above the medium-term target of 2% in July. The deflator for personal consumer expenditures showed prices rose 4.2% on the year, although the monthly rise was slightly weaker than expected at 0.3%. Personal incomes, meanwhile, rose 1.1% on the month, well above economists' forecasts.
Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock rose 9.3% after the enterprise software company became the latest in the sector to report buoyant revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter. The decision of major employers such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to postpone their plans for a full return to the office has given a new lease on life to business software companies, given the greater requirements for their services from a more distributed workforce. 
That trend has been one factor behind the spectacular rise of small-cap Support.com Inc (NASDAQ:SPRT), which specializes in remote technical support. The stock, which has been heavily shorted, has caught the eye of retail traders who have done well this year out of squeezing short positions in other stocks. Support.com stock was up another 95% after early trading.
Going the other way was HP (NYSE:HPQ) after the PC maker warned of lengthening order backlogs due to component shortages in its quarterly update after the close on Thursday. HP stock fell 3.5% after CEO Enrique Lores said he expected shortages to continue until well into 2022.
Elsewhere, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock fell 8.5% after the maker of connected fitness equipment posted a wider net loss than expected on Thursday, warning of higher marketing costs and slashing the price of its most popular exercise bike. It then followed that with the announcement that it had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department for information about reported injuries (including one fatality) sustained by users of its treadmills.

""I can confirm production at the Sevel plant will be suspended next week due to a shortage of chips from a supplier,"" the spokesperson said. 
Carmakers, increasingly dependent on electronic components, face stiff competition from the consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries, hit by a series of supply chain disruptions during the health pandemic.
In July, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares warned the semiconductor shortage could drag into next year. 
National union Fiom-Cgil said earlier on Friday it had been told the global electronic component shortage was about to impact other plants of the Stellantis group besides Pomigliano, starting with Sevel.

It said production at its Pomigliano site had been expected to restart but remained halted.
""It is clear the effects of this supply shortage could impact workers in all the other assembly plants like Melfi,"" the union said.

Investing.com – Marvell Technology stock (NASDAQ:MRVL) fell 2% Friday in premarket trading as worries over a shortage of chips overshadowed its guidance for revenue touching $1.14 billion in the ongoing quarter.
""Ultimately, what they care about is capacity? 'Can you supply me? If you can't get me the parts, why would I agree to a price increase?”, Marvell CEO Matt Murphy told Reuters.
Marvell designs and makes chips that go into data centers and vehicles. It also gives designs to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor for making chips.
A report Thursday in The Wall Street Journal said TSMC plans to raise prices of its lower-end chips by as much as 20% and those of its higher-end products by 10%. Murphy told Reuters TSMC has not issued any formal communication to Marvell about the reported price increases.
While demand has exceeded supply of digital devices, experts are now questioning how long the party can last given that consumers may now begin to defer their purchases.
Marvell guided for third-quarter revenue to touch $1.14 billion with plus/minus 3% variation. 
Net revenue in the second quarter jumped 48% from last year, to $1.08 billion. Because of rising costs, the net loss per share was 34 cents, bigger than the 24 cent per share loss in last year's second quarter.

816,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Personal Spending Growth Moderates, While Price Index Rises","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. personal spending growth moderated in July, reflecting a slowdown in outlays for merchandise, while a closely watched measure of inflation remained elevated. 
Purchases of goods and services rose 0.3% following a revised 1.1% increase in June, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. The personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Federal Reserve uses for its inflation target, climbed 0.4% from a month earlier and 4.2% from a year ago.
The median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 0.4% increases in both outlays and the price index from a month earlier. 
After adjusting for the change in prices, household demand was more muted, suggesting a softer start to third quarter household outlays, a key component of gross domestic product. Real personal spending fell 0.1% in July. 
Inflation-adjusted spending on services climbed 0.6% from a month earlier, while merchandise outlays dropped 1.6%, the report showed. While the gain in services reflects a shift in spending for things like travel and entertainment, the rapidly spreading delta variant risks setting back progress in industries hardest hit by the pandemic. 
Economists currently project consumer spending to rise an annualized 5% in the current quarter after a robust 11.9% pace in the three months through June, according to Bloomberg survey data. 
Tracking Inflation
The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% from a month earlier after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in June. The measure was up 3.6% from a year earlier, matching the biggest jump since 1991. 
Whether the recent pickup in inflation is transitory -- related to the reopening of the economy and supply constraints -- or a more permanent trend has been a hotly-debated topic among investors, policy makers and economists. 
Personal incomes rose more than forecast, reflecting the distribution of advance child tax credit payments and more compensation. Wages and salaries surged by 1% in July from a month earlier, the biggest gain since November.
Disposable personal income, or after-tax income adjusted for inflation, rose 0.7% in July after declining three straight months.
The saving rate -- which has been elevated for months as a result of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits -- rose to 9.6% in July from 8.8%.

“We are very close and I am hopeful that will happen soon,” Bostic said in a CNBC interview Friday. “My view would be let’s start the taper and let’s do it quickly. Let’s not have this linger.”
Bostic’s comments were similar on timing to his view expressed in early August, when he said he could see a move following another month or two of big gains in jobs. He joins three Fed presidents -- Kansas City’s Esther George, St. Louis’s James Bullard and Robert Kaplan of Dallas -- who urged an early tapering in interviews ahead of Friday’s virtual Jackson Hole conference.
Bostic said the Fed has met its goal needed to taper regarding inflation, and could meet the labor market side of the equation soon. The central bank has pledged to buy $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities a month until the economy shows “substantial further progress” on inflation and employment as it recovers from Covid-19.
“On the employment side, we have made a lot of progress and I think we are on the road to that,” he said. “A lot will depend on what happens in the next couple of months. If we see numbers comparable to what we have seen at the beginning of the summer, I think in my view it will be definitely satisfying the conditions for making that substantial further progress.”
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has struck a more patient tone and will give his take on the outlook Friday in a virtual speech to get the day-long forum under way.

The company expects annual subscription revenue between $4.50 billion and $4.51 billion, up 19%.
Third-quarter subscription revenue is expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.15 billion, 20% higher at the top end.
A huge rise in remote work since the start of the pandemic has underpinned strong demand for its data storage and workflow support applications.
Total revenue in the second quarter rose 19% to $1.26 billion. Of this, subscription revenue was $1.11 billion, rising about 20% from the same period last year.
Expenses rose too but at a slower pace. The company booked $103 million in other income too as against an expense last year. All this combined to help the company spring back to a net profit of $105.7 million.

Chinese airline stocks had tumbled following domestic COVID-19 outbreaks in late July that locked down some cities and closed airports, but rebounded recently as China has nearly halted local spread.
On Thursday, the city of Nanjing, locked down since late July, resumed commercial flights. Zhangjiajie, a popular tourist destination, will also reopen its airport on Aug. 30, an airport official told Reuters.
Third-quarter results will take a hit from the flight cuts, though they were less severe than in the first quarter when outbreaks restricted travel during the normally peak Lunar New Year holiday.
Beijing-based Air China, the country's flag carrier, said its net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to 578 million yuan ($89.27 million) from 6.2 billion yuan in the first quarter, taking first-half net loss to 6.8 billion yuan. 
China Southern Airlines trimmed its loss to 682 million yuan from 4.0 billion yuan in the first quarter for first-half total shortfall of a 4.7 billion yuan. 
Second-half earnings are expected to receive a boost from the pent-up domestic travel demand during the Mid-Autumn Festival and the week-long National Holiday in the fourth quarter, as health experts expect current outbreaks in China to be contained by end-August. 
Unlike in most markets, China's domestic capacity has rebounded past pre-COVID levels and airlines have added widebody planes on some local flights because international borders remain closed.
Zhong Nanshan, a coronavirus expert who helped shape China's COVID-19 response, told local media that vaccination rate in China is expected to reach 80% by the end of this year. 
However, despite the higher vaccination rate, hopes for the reopening of Chinese borders have been delayed as Beijing pushes ahead with its ""zero-tolerance"" approach while other countries are learning to live with COVID.

""Less than 1% of all seats in the Chinese market are allocated to international services; that must change for any recovery to begin,"" OAG analyst John Grant said in a weekly online update.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -Massmart is disposing of all its general merchandise Game stores in West and East Africa to stem losses in that struggling business, chief executive Mitch Slape said on Friday, after the Walmart (NYSE:WMT) majority-owned retailer reported a narrower half-year loss.
Like its peer Shoprite Holdings, forays into African markets including Nigeria have been marred by currency volatility and constrained consumer demand, making it difficult to operate profitably on the continent once touted as the next bright growth spot for retailers.
As part of a turnaround plan to stabilise the business, Massmart had said it will review its store portfolio outside of Southern Africa. That review has now resulted in the disposal of 14 stores across Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.
""The performance and the complexity in running those businesses is something that frankly we needed to address. We've commenced a formal sales process, we're currently in discussions with potential purchasers to take on those stores,"" Slape told investors.
Through the disposal of non-core and underperforming assets and store closures, Massmart hopes to sharpen management's focus and invest in high returning assets and online.
Slape said the move will result in an annual profit before interest and tax improvement of 750 million rand ($50.24 million)
Game sales from the rest of the Africa stores fell by 18.6% in rand terms in the 26 weeks ended June, and by 5% in constant currencies, due to continued currency weaknesses, Massmart with presence in 12 African countries said.
Game reported a narrower trading loss of 347.3 million rand in the period.
Through additional lower overheads, reduced Africa exposure and possible further store closures or disposals, Game will be in a break even position, Slape said.
""But that is not enough. Achieving break even performance isn't going to be sufficient for us to be satisfied, we've got to really get Game back to a healthy level of profitability and performance,"" he said. 

Group chief financial officer Mohammed Abdool-Samad said he hopes Game will break even in the next 12 months.

At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 85 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.3%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 55 points, or 0.4%.
The three major indices closed lower Thursday, with the broad-based S&P 500 dropping 0.6%, ending a five-day win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%, also ending a five-day positive run, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had closed higher for the four previous days, but dropped 0.5%.
The day’s main event is the virtual gathering of the country’s main central bankers, which traditionally takes place at Jackson Hole in Wyoming and has been used in the past to signal changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.
Powell is widely expected, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT),  to provide further guidance of the central bank’s plan to slow its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, the start of the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus put in place to support the country’s economy at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
There are also economic data releases to be studied Friday, including personal income and spending numbers for July as well as the core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, which has been running near a 30-year high.
In corporate news, computer companies Dell (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) will be in the spotlight Friday after they offered up reserved outlooks with their quarterly results late  Thursday, pointing to rising component costs and supply constraints.
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock will likely be hit after the fitness equipment maker cut the price of its most popular exercise bike and posted a wider loss than expected. It also received a subpoena from the Department of Justice over injuries sustained by users of its treadmills.
More positively, retail chain Gap (NYSE:GPS) handily beat expectations after the close on Thursday.
Elsewhere, crude prices rose Friday, on track to post strong gains this week, with oil companies shutting down production in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Ida approaches the region, threatening near-term supply disruption.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's banks are proving slow to act on sustainability and have only a limited grasp of their exposure to environmental, social and governance-related risks, a report for the European Commission by asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) showed. 
The report, which will be used to help integrate sustainability into banking prudential rules, had proved contentious given the U.S. firm's role as an investor in many of the banks.
The bloc's executive was chastised by European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) in November for failing to properly consider conflicts of interest in the awarding of the contract to BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory unit.
O'Reilly said that the Commission had not failed in applying its procurement process, but that its rules on conflicts of interest were too vague and should be changed in the future.
In a 273-page report based on data and insights from a range of banking sector and other stakeholders, released on Friday, the study said policymakers should take more action.
""Despite increased efforts by banks and supervisors, this study finds that the pace of implementation to achieve effective ESG integration within risk management, prudential supervision, and business strategies and investment policies needs to be accelerated,"" the report said.
Banks are increasingly coming under pressure from investors and activists over their role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy, particularly over their role in funding heavy emitting companies in sectors such as energy and utilities. 
Among the findings, the report said banks did not have a common definition of ESG risks, with most lenders yet to map how different ESG risks feed into financial risk and only a few having a risk strategy in place. 
""ESG factors are widely, albeit sometimes superficially, integrated within lending policies, credit application processes, and due diligence, in particular for selected high-risk sectors,"" the report said. 
""However, coverage is often limited and, for example, off-balance sheet investment activity associated with advisory or debt capital markets is often not in scope.""
Integration of ESG risk into risk models and stress testing ""is at an early stage"", and most banks have yet to integrate it into their internal risk reporting frameworks, it added.
Among the conclusions, the report suggested banks and supervisors work to develop a granular definition of the ESG risks, with some stakeholders calling for ambitious strategies with measurable objectives and timelines.

A Commission spokesperson said the executive planned to organise a discussion on the report together with members of the European Parliament and other stakeholders, and would use the content of the report to help formulate future policy proposals.
BlackRock's FMA, which operates separately from the asset management unit, said in a statement that it was pleased to deliver its study, as per its mandate from the Commission.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) fell nearly 10% in Friday’s premarket after the maker of connected exercise equipment said it had been subpoenaed by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security over injuries reportedly sustained by users of its treadmills.
The shares were already trading lower on news late Thursday that the company will slash the price of its Bike machine by $400, after posting a wider-than-expected loss in the quarter and warning of higher marketing costs.
The lowest-cost Peloton Bike will now sell for $1,495. The more expensive Bike+ stays at $2,495.
Peloton said the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission was also investigating the company's public disclosures related to the injuries. It has been named in several lawsuits associated with the recalls.
After much reluctance, Peloton had recalled both its treadmills, Tread and Tread+, in May over safety concerns, after reports of injuries and one death. There were also instances of the touchscreen falling off the Tread.
Peloton said Thursday the Consumer Product Safety Commission had approved its remedial action and it will relaunch Tread on Monday.
Peloton’s revenue in the fourth quarter rose 54% on-year to $937 million. Subscription revenue more than doubled. Cost of revenue more than doubled too, however, and overall expenses soared by more than two-and-a-half times, pulling the company into the red.
Revenue beat estimates but the adjusted loss per share was more than twice expectations.

828,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>","Dell, HP Slip on Worry Over Shortages, Muted Outlook","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Stocks of Dell (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) traded lower in Friday’s premarket on worries over higher input costs and lengthening order backlogs due to component shortages.
HP chief executive Enrique Lores told analysts after the company's quarterly results that it had a full quarter's worth of order backlogs that it hadn't been able to process yet. He added that he expected such problems to last well into 2022.
Demand for semiconductor chips that go into laptops, desktops, mobile, cameras, printers and cars has exploded in the last one year due to work-from-home becoming a way of life for many. Supplies have lagged and capacities take time to come up.
Net revenue from HP’s bread-and-butter business of personal systems was flat at $10.4 billion, with unit sales of notebooks up only 2% and desktops down 7%. That compares with IDC data showing that industry shipments of PCs rose 13% on the year in the three months through June.
The company’s printer business accounted for all the growth registered in the quarter. Net revenue in this segment jumped 24% to $4.9 billion.
HP said it expects adjusted EPS to fall by some 13% in the current quarter, from a surprisingly strong $1.00 in the second quarter. .
Dell’s second-quarter results beat estimates and the company added that it “expects to see above normal sequential revenue growth”.
Revenue at client solutions unit, which houses its hardware business, surged 27% to a record $14.3 billion as demand came from both corporates and retail consumers. The company expects this to grow by around 9% sequentially.
In its infrastructure solution group vertical, home to the company’s servers, networking, and storage business, Dell expects around 1%-4% sequential growth.
Dell’s total revenue was up 15% to $26.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.24, up 17%, and higher than the $2.03 estimate put out by analysts. It now expects annual adjusted EPS to be between $3.69 and $3.75, up more than 50% on the year.

China's top court and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on Thursday published guidelines and examples on what constituted as overtime work, saying they were focusing on the issue as it had attracted widespread attention recently. 
While the authorities used a case involving a parcel delivery company to explain why ""996"" was illegal, working such hours had become a badge of honour for some Chinese companies and employees. 
Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Sequoia Capital's Mike Moritz have highlighted it as a competitive advantage the country had over the United States.
But a backlash surfaced in 2019, prompting a public debate about work hours in China's tech industry that has continued.

Last month, TikTok owner ByteDance on Friday said that it would formally end its weekend overtime policy from Aug. 1, two weeks after its short-video rival Kuaishou announced a similar decision.
The court and ministry's criticism of ""996"" also comes amid a wide ranging Beijing-led regulatory crackdown on country's technology giants that has targeted issues from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY)'s (SGX) Chinese index futures will remain the main tool for investors to hedge their Chinese exposure despite the Hong Kong bourse announcing a rival product, a top executive said, citing SGX's many derivative products.
SGX shares have lost 6% this week after Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) won regulatory approval https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-hkex-futures-idUSL1N2PR0J6 last week following a two-year wait to launch its first derivatives product based on mainland Chinese shares, intensifying competition with SGX.
The move pushed up HKEX's shares by 5%.
The two exchanges are increasingly competing for business as HKEX seeks to diversify its revenues away from fees from share trading and expand further into derivatives, a traditional strength for SGX.
But the Singapore bourse says its China derivatives strategy of offering currency, commodities and equity derivatives for global customers, along with clearing services, means its flagship {{28930|FTSE ChChina A50 futures product, will remain popular.
""Index providers are listing their products everywhere and it's no longer about the product. It's about the platform,"" Michael Syn, head of equities at SGX, told Reuters in an interview this week.
SGX's FTSE China A50 futures, which are traded almost round-the-clock, and was launched 15 years ago, is one of its key contracts accounting for 53% of its total equity derivatives volume in the year to June 2021. 
SGX also offers equity derivatives pegged to Taiwan, Japan and Indian markets.
Syn said SGX still had a 95% market share of Taiwan index futures trading even after its long running partnership with MSCI to provide many derivative products ended https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hkex-msci-deal-idUSKBN23302R and MSCI signed a new agreement with HKEX last year.
The MSCI Taiwan index futures was one of them and SGX launched an alternative FTSE Taiwan index futures contract in July 2020, ahead of the shift to the Hong Kong bourse.

Both exchanges are betting on sustained growth in Chinese derivatives as international investors in China seek to manage their risks.
""China futures volume as a proportion of the stock market is still in its very early stages. Our waterfront is all in China – China currency, China commodities, Chinese equities,"" Syn said.

“DWS stands by its annual report disclosures,” the firm said in a statement late on Thursday. “We firmly reject the allegations being made by a former employee. DWS will continue to remain a steadfast proponent of ESG investing.”
Earlier on Thursday, DWS had plunged as much as 14.2% after revelations that Germany’s financial markets regulator BaFin and U.S. prosecutors were probing claims by former sustainability executive Desiree Fixler that DWS had overstated the amount of assets adhering to social and environmental criteria. The stock decline was the steepest since the onset of the covid pandemic whipsawed markets in March last year. 
At the end of 2020, DWS stuck an ESG label on 459 billion euros ($540 billion) of assets, or roughly half its total portfolio. But by the end of June, only about 70 billion euros of DWS’s assets under management qualified as ESG under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, rolled out in March by the European Union as the region tries to impose the world’s most ambitious anti-greenwash regulation.
DWS fluctuated between limited gains and losses during early trading in Frankfurt on Friday.
The probe adds to existing legal headaches for Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing as he seeks to take advantage of the fast-growing trend for investments that aim to further environmental or social goals. The lender has also been criticized by the U.S. Federal Reserve for failings in its controls, while BaFin has boosted its money-laundering monitor at the bank. There’s also an internal investigation into whether it mis-sold foreign-exchange derivatives.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a subdued fashion Friday, with investors wary of taking positions ahead of a highly anticipated speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France was flat and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%.
The Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed's annual research conference for central bankers, is being held virtually this year, because of the Covid-19 virus. It has been the focus of the market all week as it has been often used by Fed policymakers in the past to provide guidance on future policy.
Powell is set to speak at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), and his comments are expected to sketch a rough timeline for tapering the Fed's bond-buying program. This would mark the beginning of the end for the central bank’s unprecedented monetary support in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
Also prompting caution Friday was the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan after suicide bomb explosions outside the Kabul airport late Thursday killed numerous civilians and at least 13 U.S. soldiers.
Back in Europe, French consumer confidence edged lower in August, with worries about the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus and slowing economic momentum weighing. In Italy consumer confidence fell by less than expected, although business confidence turned down more sharply.
In corporate news, Just Eat Takeaway (F:T5W) stock fell 3.5% after New York approved legislation to license food-delivery apps and permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants. The news will affect GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which JET is in the process of acquiring.
 Morphosys  (DE:MORG) stock added 3.1% after the European Commission approved the German biotech’s cancer drug.
Elsewhere, crude prices rose Friday, on track to post strong gains this week, with oil companies shutting down production in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Ida approaches the region, threatening near-term supply disruption as it nears hurricane status.
Of interest later Friday will be the release of the Baker Hughes rig count data, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s data on net positioning will also be studied for clues about the future direction of the market.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $68.59 a barrel, heading for a weekly gain of more than 8%, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $71.10, on track for a rise of more than 9% this week.

834,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 03:51AM ET</span>",Analysis-Southeast Asia tech dealmaking booms as investors place post-COVID bets,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Fintech and e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia are raising hefty amounts of capital as global investors bet on post-pandemic technology plays, bankers and investors said, a trend that is also stoking concerns about frothy valuations.
Public equity capital raising by Southeast Asian firms has surged to a four-year high of $8.4 billion this year, data from Refinitiv shows, with companies such as Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak attracting strong interest in its IPO.
Private equity investments have also jumped, reaching $8.2 billion, just shy of a record of $8.9 billion in 2020 and expanding the ""unicorn"" club of startups valued at more than $1 billion.
Near-term fundraising activity will be led by Indonesian tech group GoTo's expected completion of a $2 billion pre-IPO funding https://www.reuters.com/technology/indonesias-goto-set-wrap-up-2-bln-funding-round-eyes-ipo-2022-sources-2021-08-19, while about a dozen start-ups are looking to list regionally or in the United States over the next two years, bankers and investors said.
The hectic pace of activity comes as the COVID-19 pandemic boosts consumers' adoption of digital platforms and investors scout for internet-based companies that are able to grow their businesses faster in a region of 650 million people.
Cash-rich global funds are also sharpening their focus on these opportunities, given China's regulatory crackdown https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-regulation-privateequity-idTRNIKBN2FA0EI on technology companies.
""There's strong interest from public market investors to get exposure to the growth profile of this region,"" said Jeffrey Perlman, head of Southeast Asia at buyout fund Warburg Pincus, one of the biggest investors in the region.
Startups looking to list as early as this year include Indonesian travel firm Traveloka and online classified marketplace Carousell, sources familiar with the plans said.
Regional logistics group Ninja Van and Thai e-commerce enabler aCommerce both said an IPO was a possibility but gave no timeline. Other sources said Thai startup Pomelo Fashion was considering an IPO next year. 
Traveloka and Carousell declined to comment. Pomelo Fashion did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We do see more exciting companies emerge. I would be constructive on the opportunities within Southeast Asia,"" said Sukumar Rajah, director of portfolio management at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity.
'REAL OPPORTUNITY'
Southeast Asia's internet economy is forecast to triple https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-economy-sea.appspot.com/assets/pdf/e-Conomy_SEA_2020_Report.pdf to $300 billion by 2025 from end-2020, according to a report from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Temasek and Bain & Company.
The total value of venture capital transactions has already hit a record $10 billion in the first half of this year, surpassing 2020's level of $8.2 billion, data from industry tracker Preqin shows.
""Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand – all these countries have large enough domestic populations where digitisation opportunities can be unicorn size,"" Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, chief investment officer at Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC said last month.
""The difficulty lies in which are the few business models that can really do pan-regional because that's where the real opportunity is.""
The region has also attracted interest from SPACS or special purpose acquisition companies and accounts for four of eight Asia-related SPAC targets unveiled this year, Dealogic data shows.
""Investors have also been to the movie before in China and India, so they are looking to leverage that experience in a bigger way and avoid missing out on some of those same opportunities,"" said Perlman from Warburg Pincus.
Ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab, struck a record $40 billion SPAC deal https://www.reuters.com/business/harvard-nasdaq-listing-grab-ceos-ride-worlds-biggest-spac-deal-2021-04-14 in April as part of a U.S. listing.
""It's rare that our part of the world gets the attention. It's not China or India or Australia or Korea but Southeast Asia,"" said Hari Krishnan, CEO of regional online marketplace PropertyGuru, referring to interest from SPACs.
Singapore-based PropertyGuru agreed a $1.8 billion merger https://www.reuters.com/article/us-propertyguru-m-a-bridgetown-2/propertyguru-to-go-public-in-merger-with-spac-backed-by-richard-li-peter-thiel-idUSKBN2EU09P with a SPAC backed by tycoons Richard Li and Peter Thiel to list in the United States.
Singapore-based gaming to e-commerce firm Sea's stellar U.S. share performance since its listing four years ago has also encouraged investors.
However, some concerns are emerging over whether the abundant global liquidity is inflating company valuations and if they can be sustained in secondary markets.

For example, Bukalapak, which launched Indonesia's biggest IPO https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/bukalapak-indonesias-biggest-ipo-up-25-blockbuster-debut-2021-08-06 of $1.5 billion this month after scaling it up from $300 million, saw its shares jump 55% from its IPO price in the first few days before giving up most of its gains.
""To justify its high enterprise value to sales multiples, Bukalapak will need to maintain annual revenue growth at around 50% over the next five years, which seems like a rather difficult target,"" said Oshadhi Kumarasiri, equity analyst at LightStream Research.

The low-cost carrier on Thursday said it will reduce an average of 27 flights a day from Sept. 7 through Oct. 6 and cut 162 flights a day from Oct. 7 through Nov. 5.
It plans to adjust flight schedules in November and December as well, but said it would protect holiday bookings. 
""We're confident these adjustments will create a more reliable travel experience,"" Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement.
The cuts are on top of its recent reductions in response to slower bookings and increased cancellations due to the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Southwest had added more flights to its schedule to capitalize on a recovery in air travel and gain market share. However, like most in the sector, it has struggled to keep up, grappling with staff shortages.
Both American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest had to cancel summer flights due to the crunch, bad weather and less network flexibility. Now they are recalling crews and resuming hiring.

The Dallas-based airline said it was ""aggressively"" hiring.
To deal with staff crunch, Southwest is recalling employees, who are on voluntary leave. The company expects to have all of those employees back by the end of the year.

GM last week expanded its recall of Bolt EVs https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-recalling-73000-bolt-evs-cost-1-billion-halts-sales-2021-08-20 due to fire risk from what it called battery manufacturing defects, saying the recall would cost $1 billion and it would seek reimbursement from the South Korean firm. 
GM, LGES and LG Electronics Inc are still investigating the cause of manufacturing defects. 
The on-going investigation and media reports that speculate the cause of battery fire have created uncertainty, leading to a drop in LG Chem shares, analysts said.
In April, GM and LGES said they would build a second U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. Their first joint U.S. battery plant is under construction in Lordstown, Ohio. 
In July, GM initially recalled 69,000 Bolt EVs for fire risks, resulting in a recall of a total of 142,000 vehicles at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion.
GM has since said it would indefinitely halt Bolt sales.

Shares of LG Electronics, which assembles LGES cells into battery modules and packs, were trading down 0.7% as of 0305 GMT, versus the broader market's 0.3% rise. 
LG Chem was down 2%.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, with investors digesting hawkish comments from some U.S. Federal Reserve officials ahead of its Jackson Hole symposium and the latest developments in Afghanistan.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.48% by 9:53 PM ET (1:53 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.09%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.11% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.33%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.09% while the Shenzhen Component slid 1.92%. Chinese technology shares slid as earnings disappointed, and the country tightens private industries’ regulations. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index that tracks Chinese shares listed in the U.S. retreated for the first time in five days.
Some Fed officials insisted that asset tapering begin soon ahead of Jackson Hole. Dallas President Robert Kaplan said he favors starting October 2021 or shortly after, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard called for a start in fall 2021 and Kansas City Fed President Esther George urged for an early move to begin in 2021. However, Kaplan, Bullard and George will not vote on policy in 2021.
U.S. Treasury yields edged lower as investors await Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s symposium speech later in the day. Investors are bracing for some market volatility after his remarks, with several Treasury options expiring on Friday.
Some investors remained cautiously optimistic.
The equity market is likely “underestimating all the known unknowns we’re going to be living with for the next three to six months,”  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) Management fund manager Yana Barton told Bloomberg.
“You don’t have to make a bet of whether this is a cyclical recovery or a growth recovery, why can’t you do one alongside the other?” she added.
On the data front, U.S. GDP grew 6.6% quarter-on-quarter, and the GDP price index grew 6.2% quarter-on-quarter, in the second quarter. Americans also filed a total of 353,000 initial jobless claims throughout the week.
Further data, including the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index as well as personal income and spending, is due later in the day.
Meanwhile, blasts outside Afghanistan’s Kabul airport raised tensions amid the U.S. evacuation from the country. U.S. President Joe Biden warned the attackers that “we will hunt you down.”"

843,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 09:46PM ET</span>",U.S. judge declines to stop J&J from splitting talc liabilities from main business,"By Mike Spector and Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge declined to stop Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) from taking steps to offload widespread Baby Powder liabilities from the rest of its business, preserving the option for the healthcare company to move thousands of claims from people who used its talc products to a unit that would file for bankruptcy.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein denied a request from plaintiffs' lawyers to block the move late Thursday. Lawyers for cancer victims wanted her to issue a restraining order against J&J as part of her role overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of one of the company's former talc suppliers.
J&J is exploring a plan https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-jj-exploring-putting-talc-liabilities-into-bankruptcy-sources-2021-07-18 to move its liabilities from widespread Baby Powder and other talc-related litigation into a newly created business that would later seek bankruptcy protection, Reuters previously reported. The company's talc products are currently housed in a subsidiary called Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.
""The court rightly denied the plaintiffs' motion aimed at preventing J&J from engaging in legitimate business transactions, in the event that it chooses to do so,"" said Diane Sullivan, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP lawyer representing J&J, in a statement. 
The legal skirmish was unusual in that plaintiffs' lawyers were asking the judge to forbid J&J from taking steps the company's lawyers said it had not yet decided whether to pursue. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc has previously said it has ""not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate.""
The judge is overseeing the bankruptcy case of Imerys Talc America, which once supplied talc to J&J and filed for Chapter 11 court protection amid mounting litigation. Imerys and J&J have since been battling one another over whether J&J is required to cover the former supplier's legal costs under indemnification agreements. Plaintiffs' lawyers argued that allowing J&J to offload its talc liabilities to a unit that would file for bankruptcy would harm Imerys' reorganization.
The judge decided it would be improper as part of Imerys' bankruptcy case for her to legally bar J&J from undertaking a hypothetical future restructuring that might result in separating the talc liabilities. She said Imerys could take legal action against J&J should J&J decide to separate its talc liabilities in a way Imerys deems harmful or unlawful.
TEXAS TWO-STEP BANKRUPTCY
J&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma.
J&J is considering using Texas' ""divisive merger"" law, which allows a company to split into at least two entities, Reuters previously reported. For J&J, that could create a new entity housing talc liabilities that would then file for bankruptcy to halt litigation.
The maneuver is known among legal experts as a Texas two-step bankruptcy, a strategy other companies facing asbestos litigation have used in recent years.
Should J&J proceed, plaintiffs who have not settled could find themselves in protracted bankruptcy proceedings with a likely much smaller company. Future payouts to plaintiffs would be dependent on how J&J decides to fund the entity housing its talc liabilities.
A 2018 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.

The blue-chip company, which boasts a market value exceeding $450 billion, faces legal actions from more than 30,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc products were unsafe. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J's appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company's talc caused their ovarian cancer.
Separately, plaintiffs lawyers are seeking a similar restraining order against J&J in a Missouri court. One of those lawyers, Andy Birchfield, said in a statement that he and other lawyers would study the Imerys ruling and continue attempts to prevent J&J from using the Texas law to separate its talc liabilities and steer them toward bankruptcy.

The fitness equipment maker also introduced monthly financing options for its Bike+ and Tread products across all regions, as it looks to prevent a slowdown in its business after last year's home fitness boom.
The moves, aimed at making its bikes more affordable, will weigh on its performance in the first quarter. The company's revenue forecast of $800 million was below analysts' average estimate of $1.01 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Its shares fell as much as 15% after the bell but pared losses to trade down 6%.
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON)'s original bike will now cost $1,495, compared with $1,895 earlier, and the company will also shift its product sales mix towards its treadmill.
New York-based Peloton said it expects a return to profitability on an adjusted core earnings basis by the financial year 2023. 
In the near term, it plans on prioritizing subscription growth and reducing the time gap between sales and delivery.
""We are planning fiscal 2022 as an investment year in marketing our products and optimizing operations,"" Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said on an earnings call.

Peloton posted a net loss attributable to Class A and Class B shareholders of $1.05 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of 27 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 45 cents per share.
Peloton, which also disclosed a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, said fourth-quarter revenue rose 54% to $936.9 million. The figure was better than estimates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday, ending a streak of all-time closing highs on concerns over developments in Afghanistan, while fears of a potential shift in U.S. Federal Reserve policy prompted a broad but shallow sell-off the day before the Jackson Hole Symposium.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session in the red, with the S&P and the Nasdaq notching their first down day in six. 
The sell-off firmed after hawkish commentary from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and a blast outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan helped strengthen the risk-off sentiment.
Kaplan, who is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee, said he believes the progress of economic recovery warrants tapering of the Fed's asset purchases to commence in October or shortly thereafter. 
Kaplan's remarks followed earlier comments from the St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said that the central bank is ""coalescing"" around a plan to begin tapering process.
""(Kaplan’s statements) caused a little confusion about the taper timeline, but in my opinion the equity markets are focused on geopolitical issues,"" said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors in Hunt Valley, Maryland. ""There’s a flight to safety during geopolitical tensions.""
""I am surprised the market the market hasn’t fallen more, given the fear that it could take focus away from (U.S. President Joe Biden's) domestic agenda,"" Horneman added. 
The economy grew at a slightly faster pace than originally reported in the second quarter, fully recovering its losses from the most abrupt downturn in U.S. history, according to the Commerce Department. But jobless claims, though still on a downward trajectory, ticked higher last week.

The data did little to move the needle with respect to expectations that the Fed is unlikely tip its hand regarding the taper timeline when Chairman Jerome Powell unmutes and delivers his speech at Friday's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium.
""We’re going to see a lot of market participants analyze every word (Powell) uses, but at the end of the day, they will begin tapering,"" Horneman said. ""I’m more concerned about the speed at which they taper. What are they going to start with? That will give us a clearer indication as whether they’re getting more hawkish.""

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Thursday he now anticipates a ruling on OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP’s bankruptcy reorganization plan on Wednesday of next week instead of this week because he needs more oral argument on certain issues.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain was originally expected to rule on Friday, Aug. 27. Drain did not specify the issues on which he needs to hear more.
If Drain approves the deal, it would clear a path to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits and shield the company's wealthy Sackler family owners from future litigation.
The plan, which Purdue values at more than $10 billion, would dissolve the drugmaker and shift assets to a new company not controlled by Sackler family members. The new company would be owned by a trust run to combat the opioid epidemic in U.S. communities that alleged the company and its owners aggressively marketed the painkiller OxyContin while playing down its abuse and overdose risks.
The plan also includes legal releases shielding Sackler family members from future opioid litigation, a controversial provision that some states opposed. Congressional Democrats in recent weeks circulated legislation to block such legal releases and urged the Justice Department to appeal the plan, efforts that failed to gain traction.
The Sacklers have denied allegations, raised in lawsuits and elsewhere, that they bear responsibility for the opioid epidemic. They have said they acted ethically and lawfully while serving on Purdue's board. 

The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker pleaded guilty to criminal charges in November stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct. 
The Purdue bankruptcy plan https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/15-more-us-states-reach-settlement-oxycontin-maker-purdue-bankruptcy-2021-07-08 includes a $4.5 billion contribution from Sackler family members.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -China's push to wean property developers from excessive borrowing is spilling over into loan losses at banks and pain in credit markets as cash-strapped builders fall into distress, raising the risk of fallout rippling across the economy.
Debt and land-buying curbs and hundreds of new rules are hitting developers far harder than they had expected, setting off a scramble to sell assets as well as a steady drumbeat of bankruptcies, defaults and cut-price takeovers.
The regulatory push is the latest in years of efforts to reduce risks in the real estate sector and, as with crackdowns roiling the internet and education sectors, has not been formally announced. 
Yet, unlike previous iterations, it is driving a heightened level of discomfort in markets as investors grapple with authorities' persistence and with what is at stake for a sector that currently comprises about a quarter of the Chinese economy.
""The government is engineering a gradual decoupling between China's economy and the real estate sector by reducing its importance,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ.
Capital is being reallocated to technology or other targeted areas, he said. What that looks like, so far, is a series of high profile property-sector defaults this year and a sharp deterioration in bond markets' faith in China's corporate borrowers. 
The premium over risk-free yields that investors demand for China's developer-dominated high-yield debt has surged 300 basis points in three months, whereas European and U.S. premiums have fallen. The divergence is the widest on record.
Bank loans are also turning bad where exposure is high, with bad debts in the property sector tripling for Shenzhen's Ping An Bank in the first half and rising 53.5% at the Bank of Jinzhou and 25.8% at Bank of Shanghai.
Court records show about 220 real estate companies filed for bankruptcy so far this year, tracking at a slightly lower rate than the 390 filings during 2020.
""Markets should be prepared for what could be a much worse-than-expected growth slowdown, more loan and bond defaults, and potential stock market turmoil,"" Nomura's chief China economist Ting Lu wrote in a report published this week.
""In a sense, this could be China's Volcker moment, considering Beijing's unprecedented determination to tighten property sector policy and tame property prices,"" he said, a reference to former U.S. Fed chair Paul Volcker whose late 1970s and early 1980s rate hikes triggered recession but cooled inflation.
UNCOMFORTABLY NUMB
For now, the deepest damage is first being inflicted on developers confronting the end of an era of debt-fuelled growth. 
China's no.2 and the most indebted developer, Evergrande Group, issued a profit warning on Wednesday, citing declining prices and rising expenses in the first six months. Scores of smaller developers are faring even worse as the wheels come off from money-go-round models.
Fujian province's Fusheng Group, for example, which in 2018 boasted how it would buy land, begin building within three months, make sales within six months and recover its investment within a year is now ailing and in the process of being bailed out by bigger rival Shimao.
""There'll be no more big profits for developers,"" said an executive at one mid-sized developer in eastern China, who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak publicly. ""We've grown to feel numb about all this tightening.""
In the broader market - where property is a favourite asset - national price growth has hit a six month trough and realtors say transaction volumes have plunged as rising mortgage rates and restrictions on buyers choke the market.
""These measures are the most draconian I've ever seen,"" said Steven Huang, a veteran agent in Shanghai at property broker Lianjia.com.

Another focal point for contagion risk is the financial system, where fears centre on exposure to Evergrande, an emblem of the boom which is now scrambling to meet what S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) estimates is $37 billion in debts due in the next year alone.
Executives were summoned by regulators last week and told to put their house in order to preserve stability - a move markets weren't sure whether to interpret as a hint at support or a warning of what is to come.
To be sure, bad debts at commercial banks are steady and low with non-performing loans at 1.76% last quarter, according to the banking regulator, and some investors do not think a U.S.-style short-term-pain-long-term-gain wipeout is a likely event.
""That whole idea is not the style of how China's government behaves,"" said Tiansi Wang, a senior credit analyst at Dutch fund manager Robeco in Hong Kong. But a slower-burn shakeout may keep credit markets on edge for some time, investors said.
""Stability remains a priority, but not the only thing anymore,"" said Wang. Meanwhile, Evergrande debt is driving the market and its bonds maturing in March have tumbled to trade around 50 cents on the dollar, indicating growing concern the developer will be unable to pay.

""I think the fact that the policymakers are letting market forces drive the pricing of risk for these capital structures suggests that the policymakers are comfortable with where this is going,"" said Salman Niaz head of Asian credit at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management in Singapore.
""(It) is creating some volatility in the short term but is positive for systematic stability in the long run.""

852,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 06:11PM ET</span>","New York City approves licenses, commission caps for food-delivery apps","By Hilary Russ and Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York City Council on Thursday approved legislation to license food-delivery apps including Grubhub, DoorDash Inc and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and to permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants.
The companies say the price controls are unfair and vowed to fight them.
""This permanent price control is flagrantly unconstitutional and will hurt local restaurants, delivery workers and diners across NYC. We will vigorously fight this illegal action,"" Grubhub, a unit of Just Eat Takeaway.com, said in a statement.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has 30 days to sign the legislation, which would go into effect 120 days after becoming law.
The bills limit the amount that companies can charge restaurants to use their platforms to 15% of food orders for delivery services and 5% for advertising and other nondelivery services.
Restaurants have complained that commissions as high as 30% were draining their finances, so the city enacted temporary caps on those fees during the pandemic when so many restaurants were forced to close or rely on delivery and carry-out alone.
The bills also require the companies to obtain operating licenses, which are valid for two years.
DoorDash said commission caps are ""unnecessary and unconstitutional ... New York's restaurants need choice more than ever, and this dangerous government overreach will severely limit the options small businesses rely on everyday to succeed.""
Uber did not immediately provide a comment.
San Francisco has also enacted permanent commission caps on the services.

The New York City restaurant delivery market is split almost evenly among the major platforms, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, which collects payment data from customers. 
DoorDash commanded 36% of July sales in the city, Grubhub 34% and Uber Eats and Postmates a joint 30%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets slipped on Thursday, while U.S. Treasury yields dipped after reaching two-week highs after two hawkish Federal Reserve officials called for the U.S. central bank to start ending its bond-buying program
Ahead of a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he still believes the Fed in September would announce a plan for tapering to start in October or shortly thereafter. Earlier, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Fed is ""coalescing"" around a plan to begin reducing its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.
Powell is due to speak on Friday at the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, policy symposium, held virtually due to the regional spread of the pandemic.
Minutes from the Fed's July meeting released last week showed most policy makers expect the Fed to start tapering bond purchases this year, though consumer sentiment and economic data have weakened since that meeting.
Following Kaplan and Bullard's comments, benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields reached their highest level since Aug. 12 before retreating to 1.3491%% after U.S. markets closed. 
""You're going to see continued commentary around deciding when to start tapering. I think they want to have that digested by the market so it's not a surprise when it begins later this year,"" said Ryan Jacob, chief investment officer at Jacob Asset Management.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was down 0.52%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.32%.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.65%.
On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed lower, with stocks in consumer discretionary, technology, financials and consumer staples among the biggest losers.
""The market has been up five days in a row and so some of it is just people taking some chips of the table in the event there's any surprises out of Jackson Hole,"" said Jordan Kahn, chief investment officer of ACM Funds in Los Angeles.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.54% to 35,213.12, the S&P 500 lost 0.58% to 4,469.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.64% to 14,945.81.
The U.S. dollar jumped from one-week lows after Kaplan and Bullard's comments on bond tapering, pushing the greenback toward a key resistance level.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major trading currencies, was up 0.259%.
Gold prices stabilized after a sharp retreat on Thursday, taking a firmer dollar in stride as investors looked forward to Powell's speech.
Spot gold rose 0.03% to $1,791.1547 per ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.15% to $1,792.20.

Oil settled lower, snapping a three-day rally on renewed concerns over demand due to rising COVID-19 infections and as Mexico restored some output after an oil rig fire.
Brent crude settled down 1.6% at $71.07 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate oil settled down 1.4% at 67.42 a barrel.

854,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 06:09PM ET</span>",China Huarong Set to Divulge Full Damage After Roiling Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- China Huarong Asset Management Co. is set to reveal the full extent of its financial health after flagging record losses last year and clinching a government-orchestrated bailout to keep it from the precipice.
The bad-debt manager, which had strayed far beyond its original mandate into a myriad of risky ventures, will on Sunday release its long-overdue 2020 results as well as its earnings for the first half of 2021. As it outlined the framework of its rescue on Aug. 18, the Beijing-based firm said it suffered a preliminary loss of 102.9 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) last year.
Trouble emerged in late March when Huarong, controlled by the Ministry of Finance, delayed its annual report, roiling markets across Asia amid concern over whether it can cover its $242 billion in liabilities -- including about $21 billion of offshore bonds. The firm said last week that state-owned investors led by Citic Group would step in to restore its capital, ending months of speculation over whether Beijing would deem the troubled financial giant too big to fail.
“The results will definitely show poor performance, but that has mostly been priced in,” said Wu Qiong, head of fixed-income research at BOC International Holdings in Hong Kong. “Investors are looking for some details and hopefully positive signs that can lead to maintaining its rating. There’s still a possibility we will see these positive details.”
Huarong’s loss in 2020 signals the firm is likely to make a massive write-off on bad investments, with potentially a big chunk of still unresolved risky assets on its balance sheet. It would also wipe away nearly 60% of its 168 billion yuan of equity as of June last year. China’s banking regulator set a minimum 12.5% capital adequacy ratio for bad loan asset managers, with at least 9% of core tier-1 ratio.  
The projected 2020 loss “could result in a failure to comply with the minimum regulatory requirements on capital adequacy and leverage, and indicate that the company cannot sustain its operation without support arranged by the government,” Moody’s Investors Service said on Monday, after cutting Huarong’s credit rating and warned of more potential downgrades. 
The unprecedented shortfall highlights the dilemma Beijing faces in resolving a crisis that has hammered markets while trying to instill more discipline in its bloated state-owned firms. The drawn out rescue showed the problem Beijing is grappling with in whether to still shield state-owned borrowers from market forces as President Xi Jinping has revived an old campaign to rein in leverage amid surging defaults.
Huarong is poised to receive $7.7 billion of fresh capital as part of an overhaul plan, people familiar with the matter have said. Control of the company would shift to Citic, the people have said, though details were still being finalized and could change. 
But doubts remain whether it’s out of the woods. The embattled conglomerate has been effectively frozen out of the bond market since the second quarter even though it has met its debt obligations and reassured investors that it wouldn’t seek to restructure its debt. Bondholders will watch out any mention of the size and timing of the bailout on Sunday.
Beijing’s ultimate decision is being closely scrutinized by investors for its broader implications. A recapitalization would neutralize a potential systemic risk to the financial system and make it easier for other state-owned borrowers to tap the country’s $12 trillion credit market.
For shareholders, it’s uncertain whether Huarong’s stock will resume trading after being suspended since late March. The shares had plunged 67% since debuting in Hong Kong in 2015. 
Huarong was once a darling at the top of the financial world. For example, Warburg Pincus and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). were among a group of investors that bought a $2.4 billion stake in the firm before it went public in 2015.
The company is now looking to sell nearly all of its units outside of distressed debt as part of a government-approved downsizing plan, people familiar with the matter have said. 
Huarong, together with China Cinda Asset Management Co., China Great Wall Asset Management Co. and China Orient Asset Management Co., was created to buy bad loans from banks in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, when decades of government-directed lending to state companies had left China’s biggest lenders on the brink of insolvency.
The bad-debt firms later expanded beyond their original mandate, creating a labyrinth of subsidiaries to engage in other financial businesses and borrow billions from the bond market. Huarong was the most aggressive of the four under former Chairman Lai Xiaomin, who was executed in January for crimes including bribery.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>","Tyson Foods offers $10,000 prizes for vaccinated U.S. chicken workers","CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) said on Thursday it is offering U.S. chicken plant workers the chance to win $10,000 once a week for the next five weeks if they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccine lottery is the latest attempt to encourage vaccinations by the country's biggest meat company by sales, as the contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus drives an increase in U.S. cases. 
Tyson employees at nearly 50 chicken facilities are eligible for the prizes, spokesman Derek Burleson said.
The company on Aug. 3 mandated that all employees be vaccinated by Nov. 1, though the requirement for unionized plant workers is subject to negotiations with labor unions.
At that time, about 56,000 employees had already been vaccinated, roughly 47% of Tyson's U.S. workforce of 120,000, according to the company.
Tyson said on Thursday that discussions with union leaders on the mandate are ongoing. 

""We're already in alignment on the need to continue doing everything we can to protect our team members from the health impacts of the COVID-19 virus,"" Burleson said.
Tyson is also paying $200 to any employee who gets vaccinated and compensating workers for up to four hours of regular pay if they are vaccinated outside normal work hours or away from a Tyson location, according to the company.

(Reuters) -Public support for stronger measures to require COVID vaccinations is strong, according to a new Reuters/IPSOS poll, but for Detroit automakers the debate over vaccination policy is far from over. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Thursday it has required its U.S. salaried employees to report whether they have received COVID-19 shots, the first such action by one of Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers.
GM said the information will help ""determine when GM should relax or strengthen certain COVID-19 safety protocols as recommended by the CDC and OSHA, such as mask wearing, physical distancing and facility occupancy rates,"" referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration.
Separately, United Auto Workers President Ray Curry on Thursday expressed support for only voluntary measures to encourage vaccination or survey workers' vaccination status. 
The UAW, with nearly 400,000 members, represents U.S. factory workers at GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Stellantis NV as well as workers at other U.S. manufacturers, colleges, government agencies and casinos. 
""We would be open to discussion about voluntary efforts,"" Curry said during a videoconference on Thursday. 
Steps such as GM's plan to gather information about employees' vaccination status would be subject to bargaining before they could be applied to UAW workers, Curry said. Such data collection would raise medical privacy concerns, he said.
Likewise, Curry said the UAW would expect companies to negotiate before following the example of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which said it will charge unvaccinated employees https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/delta-add-200-monthly-health-insurance-charge-unvaccinated-staff-2021-08-25 an extra $200 a month for company health coverage.
""We have not had an employer reach out to discuss with us"" a vaccine mandate or a penalty for workers who are not vaccinated, Curry said.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds support for employer vaccination requirements.
The poll found that 60% of adults support employers who require people to show a proof of vaccination before allowing them to return to the office, while 34% oppose vaccine requirements. The poll, conducted from Aug. 13 to 19, gathered responses from 4,427 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
About two-thirds of American adults support mask requirements in restaurants, airplanes, gyms and the workplace, while less than one-third oppose them, the poll found.
Detroit automakers have reinstated masking requirements in their factories as the Delta variant of the coronavirus has spread. But they have so far not proposed broad measures to require vaccinations.
GM has about 48,000 salaried workers in the United States, out of which about 46,000 were represented by unions, as per its annual regulatory filing.

""GM earlier this month implemented an expanded vaccination status reporting process that was mandatory for all U.S. salaried employees. We gathered this information via a confidential online tool,"" the company said in a statement.
Ford is requiring salaried staff who travel internationally to get vaccinated. ""We are currently assessing whether we need to expand the requirement,"" the company said in a statement.

(Reuters) - ABC News President Kim Godwin on Thursday indicated she would request an independent investigation into how the TV network handled sexual assault allegations against a former “Good Morning America” senior executive producer, on a call with newsroom employees, according to an employee who was on the call.
The call come a day after Kirstyn Crawford, a producer on the show, sued the former senior executive producer, Michael Corn, and ABC in New York state court, alleging that Corn sexually assaulted her during a 2015 business trip to Los Angeles.
ABC did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit or investigation. Corn denied engaging in improper sexual conduct with another woman.
Godwin's comments and the lawsuit were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The lawsuit also accuses Corn of assaulting a former ABC News producer, Jill McClain, on two occasions in 2010 and 2011. Because the statute of limitations for McClain’s claims have expired, the action says, she is included in the lawsuit in support of Crawford. 
The lawsuit alleges that ABC, which is owned by Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co knew, or should have known, about the sexual harassment and failed to take corrective action for many years. 
In a statement provided by his lawyer, Corn said: “I vehemently deny any allegations that I engaged in improper sexual contact with another woman. 
""Kirsten (sic) Crawford’s claims are demonstrably false — and I am providing contemporaneous emails to prove it. ... I will be pursing (sic) all available legal remedies against these women and defending myself vigorously.”
According to the lawsuit, ABC learned of Corn’s alleged sexual assault of Crawford as early as 2017 and “looked the other way,” elevated Corn through the ranks and “facilitated the hostile workplace that Corn cultivated through his influence over subordinates’ careers, sexual harassment, gaslighting, and anger management issues.”
ABC conducted an internal investigation into Crawford and McClain's allegations after they made a formal complaint in February, according to the lawsuit, and terminated Corn in April. 

ABC did not provide a reason for Corn’s departure when he left the company, according to the employee who participated in Thursday’s call.
The allegations follow a long series of cases of sexual misconduct or harassment involving men in entertainment, the news media and government, some of which sparked the #MeToo movement.

People globally continue to spend on computer devices even after a year of working from home. Figures from International Data Corp showed shipments of PCs rose 13% from April to June, but the pace of growth was much slower than last year's frenzy.
While the industry has faced pressure from components shortage and supply chain woes, revenue at Dell's client solutions unit - home to its hardware devices - surged 27% to a record $14.3 billion.
Its cloud-computing unit, VMware (NYSE:VMW), grew 8%, thanks to orders from companies looking to cut costs and expand their digital presence. 
Total revenue jumped 15% to $26.12 billion, beating the analysts' average estimate of $25.53 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The reopening of the economy has redirected some consumer spending away from computers to other sectors. But a recent rise in COVID-19 cases has prompted renewed curbs and could potentially boost the demand for remote-working equipment.
Dell's net income fell to $880 million, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter ended July 30, from $1.01 billion, or $1.37 per share, a year earlier.

(Reuters) -The lawyers whose action prompted billionaire investor William Ackman to make changes to his special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) could target more such vehicles, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The group, which includes former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Robert Jackson, filed lawsuits last week against three blank-check acquisition firms: GO Acquisition Corp, E.Merge Technology Acquisition Corp and Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine Holdings. 
The lawsuits accuse the SPACs of operating illegally by not registering as investment companies. Ackman last week said the lawsuit against his SPAC was without merit, but acknowledged that the legal uncertainty hanging over it would make it tougher to find a merger partner.
The lawyers group, which includes law firms Susman Godfrey LLP and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, one of the most prolific U.S. shareholder class action firms, is actively monitoring the SPAC sector to identify potential issues at other SPACs, the sources said.
Two of the sources said the number of potential new lawsuits could end up being as high as 50. A third source, however, said this estimate was incorrect and that no new legal action was imminent.
GO Acquisition declined to comment, while E.Merge Technology Acquisition did not respond to requests for comment. 
The lawyers and their firms either declined to comment or did not respond to questions for comment. 
While none of the group's lawsuits have had their day in court, they point to a rapidly escalating legal campaign against SPACs. These shell vehicles raise money in an initial public offering to pursue a merger with a private company. There are currently 438 SPACs, which, like those that were sued, have yet to clinch a merger, according to data from SPAC Research.
SPACs became one of Wall Street's hottest investment trends last year as many retail investors stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic placed speculative bets on them. They lost some of their appeal after many went on to report weak financial performance and a regulatory crackdown ensued over their disclosures. 
'FREQUENT FILER'
The three lawsuits were all filed on behalf of George Assad, a shareholder in the SPACs. He has been named as plaintiff in at least 33 other shareholder lawsuits since 2010 against a range of companies, from oil and gas explorer  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) to consumer credit bureau  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX), a search of legal databases shows. 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records list Assad as an employee of broker-dealer Revere Securities LLC, and public records show he lives in Methuen, Massachusetts, a city north of Boston. 
Assad, 76, referred all questions to his lawyer, who did not return calls and emails for comment. Revere Securities also did not return calls seeking comment.
None of the lawyers in the SPAC lawsuits responded to questions about their affiliation with Assad. 
Two lawyers who have not been involved with Assad's cases said it was common for law firms and their financial backers to enlist nominal shareholders - often referred to in legal circles as ""frequent filers"" - when they target companies.
Thompson Hine LLP litigation lawyer Riccardo DeBari said courts typically focus on the validity of the claims rather than the people who file them. 
The second lawyer, Foley & Lardner LLP corporate partner Louis Lehot, said there is nothing wrong with frequent filers but that it would be ethically problematic for the lawyers involved if Assad was a ""straw man"" for the shareholder lawsuits without having been substantially harmed himself by the companies involved. 
""Our court system relies on actual plaintiffs bringing actual claims that they actually suffered, and having those claims adjudicated,"" Lehot said.
INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
SPACs have traditionally relied on being exempt from registering as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so they can make investments and sell stock without restrictions before merging with a company. They typically park the money they have raised from an IPO in U.S. government bonds and money market funds until they find a merger target.
The lawsuits claim that such investments fall outside a SPAC's primary mission of merging with a company and constitute breaches of the Investment Company Act. They argue that the SPAC sponsors have turned these vehicles into extensions of their hedge funds. 
Many Wall Street law firms that work on SPACs say the lawsuits are unlikely to succeed. In a memo to clients sent this week, White & Case LLP said the lawsuits ""contain no novel arguments or revelations"" and that their thesis ""was rejected long ago by the SEC.""
Douglas Ellenoff, a corporate and securities partner at law firm Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, said the lawsuits may be successful in putting off some companies from proceeding with SPAC mergers while the litigation is ongoing. 
""It has a very chilling effect on all responsible capital markets, participants who are trying their best to do things in compliance with the securities laws,"" Ellenoff said.

Ackman said last week he planned to give his SPAC shareholders warrants in a ""better structured vehicle,"" which he dubbed a special purpose acquisition rights company. The SPARC warrants would give Tontine shareholders the right to invest in a merger with a private company once the target has been announced - unlike a SPAC, in which investors tie up their money while the sponsor searches for a suitable target.
Jackson served as SEC commissioner between 2018 and 2020, and then returned to New York to teach at New York University School of Law. Among his partners on the lawsuits is Yale Law professor John Morley, who has spent years researching investor protections.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stumbled Thursday, as investors erred on the side of caution amid expectations the Federal Reserve could drop its clearest hint yet that loose monetary policy measures will be reined in sooner rather than later.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%, or 192 points, and the Nasdaq fell 0.6%.
Ahead of the symposium on Friday, Fed speakers have signaled that the central bank is keen to begin tapering its monthly bond purchases to avoid having to play catchup later down line and risk more aggressive moves to curb inflation.     
“I think we want to get going on taper. Get the taper finished by the end of the first quarter next year,” James Bullard, St. Louis Fed President told CNBC Thursday. “And then we can evaluate what the situation is and we’ll be able to see at that point whether inflation has moderated and if that’s the case we’ll be in great shape. If it hasn’t moderated, we’re going to have to be more aggressive to contain inflation.”
The remarks arrived as investors digested mixed economic data as the weekly jobless claims climbed, while another take on second-quarter economic growth fell just short of estimates.       
Initial jobless claims totaled 353,000 last week, just above expectations of 350,000, while the penultimate reading of second-quarter GDP was 6.6%, just shy of the 6.7% expected.
The weaker data out from the labor market, however, isn't a reason for worry amid expectations that the trend of the falling claims is likely still intact.
""Although there was an uptick this week, we do not think there is anything to be particularly concerned about here,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note following the weekly jobless claims data. ""The back up is not big enough to signify any fundamental change in the flows of the labor market.""
On the earnings front, meanwhile, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) was in the spotlight, rising  more than 2% after delivering an upbeat outlook on annual performance following quarterly results that topped wall street estimates.
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) gave up its gains to trade flat even as the cosmetics retailer reported a beat on both the top and bottom lines, led by a strong recovery in its beauty business.
Megacap tech stocks were largely below the flatline.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian bank stocks dropped on Thursday as better-than-expected quarterly earnings reported this week were overshadowed by a promise by the ruling Liberal Party to raise corporate income taxes on financial firms if re-elected.
On Wednesday, the Liberals said they would hike the rate to 18% from 15% on all earnings over C$1 billion ($793 million) and impose a special dividend to be paid by the firms. The increases are designed to pay for the cost of the COVID-19 recovery.
""Some digestion is occurring in the marketplace with what happened yesterday,"" said Goodreid Investment Counsel Portfolio Manager Brian Madden.
""The market is taking (the announcement) and ... thinking about the severity and probability of it getting enacted into law,"" he said. ""It would clip the banks’ earnings very very significantly if it were enacted.""
Canada's federal election is Sept. 20. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals have a slight lead over the opposition Conservatives in opinion polls.
The banks index closed down 1.4% on Thursday following minimal moves after the announcement on Wednesday. The broader Toronto benchmark index was down 0.4%.
Royal Bank of Canada shares ended the day down 0.4%, Toronto-Dominion Bank lost 2.4% and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's (CIBC) dropped 2.1%. 
National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine said in a note that the average bank's earnings this year would have been 2% lower as a result of the proposed change, based on annualized fiscal 2021 results, amounting to a cumulative theoretical tax increase of C$1.3 billion ($1.02 billion) for the six biggest banks. 
The proposed special dividend could amount to over C$1 billion a year over the next four years, he said. 
CIBC Chief Executive Victor Dodig, the first executive to comment on the proposal, urged governments on Thursday to refrain from intervening in individual sectors 
Alongside a focus on improving education and access to healthcare, ""what governments should be really obsessed with is making sure that ... they create the conditions for private capital to help everybody grow and to help everybody prosper,"" he said. 
Some of the decline in shares may also be due to investors who had bought ahead of the banks' results taking profits, Madden said. 

CIBC and TD on Thursday closed out third-quarter earnings reporting, with all of the country's six biggest banks posting better-than-expected profits.

From a bottom-up viewpoint, the situation is less clear and favorable for bulls. There’s still a lack of follow-through on breakouts or strong earnings report. The upcoming Jackson Hole Fed meeting on Friday could also provide some clarity on the Fed’s path and timetable in terms of tapering. In this week’s commentary, I will provide a deeper look at the market from both vantage points and discuss our current portfolio strategy.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 03:58PM ET</span>",Forbes to go public via $630 million SPAC merger to expand consumer business,"By Niket Nishant and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) -The publisher of Forbes magazine will go public through a merger with a blank-check firm in a deal that values the combined entity at $630 million, the companies said on Thursday, the latest example of media companies catching the boom of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
Forbes, one of the oldest media outlets in the United States, will merge with Hong Kong-based Magnum Opus Acquisition Ltd, a SPAC led by Jonathan Lin, a former executive at billionaire Steven Cohen's Point72. 
The deal will allow Forbes to invest further in building consumer-focused products as the company reduces reliance on media revenue, Forbes Chief Executive Mike Federle said in an interview.
With print revenue sliding, the business news outlet has been doubling down on live events and leveraging its brand and reader base to build consumer products in areas including education and e-commerce. It reported $163 million in revenue in 2020 and expects it to grow to $193 million this year. 
""We've created this audience and business scale with 150 million people. This funding will allow us to create bespoke products that address these different industry cohorts as we focus on direct-to-consumer conversion,"" said Federle.
Jersey City, New Jersey-based Forbes was founded in 1917 by B.C. Forbes, and his family retains a minority share. The magazine is led by his grandson, Steve Forbes, currently chairman and editor-in-chief, who made failed runs for U.S. president in 1996 and 2000 in the Republican primary. 
The Forbes company was valued at $475 million when Hong Kong-based investor group Integrated Whale Media Investments bought a majority stake in 2014.
The company was also in talks with other bidders, including a consortium led by tech investor Michael Moe, which would have allowed it to stay private, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/exclusive-forbes-pursues-spac-talks-amid-new-takeover-interest-sources-2021-04-29 in April. 
With the SPAC deal, Forbes joins other media outlets, including BuzzFeed, which agreed to a blank-check merger in June, and Vox Media, which is also reported to be pursuing such a merger.
In a sign of renewed deal interest in the digital media sector, German publisher Axel Springer said on Thursday it will acquire U.S. political news website Politico.
The Forbes deal is expected to bring $600 million in proceeds and includes a private investment in public equity of $400 million.
The unusually large PIPE comes at a time when the broader SPAC market has been weighed down by heightened regulatory pressure and saturated demand, with companies struggling to attract the interest of leading Wall Street institutional investors.
Forbes shareholders will own nearly 22% of the combined company, assuming no redemptions by Magnum's investors, and the company will be left with $145 million in cash. Magnum raised $200 million in a March IPO.

SPACs raise funds in an IPO with the aim of merging with a private company, which then becomes public. 
After the deal closes, Forbes will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""FRBS.""

The companies announced the deal on Thursday but did not disclose the terms. This marked the biggest acquisition for Axel Springer to date, as the German publisher stitches together a global network of digital news operations.
The deal, in which Springer will also buy the remaining 50% share of its joint venture Politico Europe, follows its 2015 deal to buy Business Insider and a 2020 deal to buy a majority stake in business newsletter platform Morning Brew.
Robert Allbritton, the owner of Politico, will continue as the publisher of the website following the deal, which is expected to close by end of this year.
Politico was founded ahead of the 2008 U.S. presidential elections by defectors from the Washington Post with an aim to cover Washington and politics with the pace, analysis and rigor of sports journalism.
Springer owns a rich portfolio of news outlets including Bild, Welt and Insider, and is active in more than 40 countries.
U.S. private equity investor KKR, which owns around 48% of Springer, has been building up its portfolio of digital and media assets though the German media conglomerate.

Separately, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC that Springer was no longer in talks to buy digital-news outlet Axios, which was founded by Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei.

Investing.com -- Stocks fell on Thursday as investors awaited a speech Friday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the future of the central bank’s bond buying efforts.
Two deadly blasts outside Kabul’s airport early Thursday left at least 12 U.S. troops and scores of Afghans dead and injured, adding a jolt of volatility to global markets. The attack comes as the U.S. tries to wrap up its military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
All evidence points to the Fed's meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., as the reason for the subdued market action on Thursday. Laying the groundwork for Powell’s speech, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told CNBC that the Fed is ""coalescing"" around a plan to begin cutting its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.
On the employment front the data was mostly positive, with new jobless claims inching higher for the week ending Aug. 21, but still near pandemic lows.
Other than Powell’s speech, which is scheduled for 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), Friday should be a quiet day for earnings and data. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Computer earnings
Two computer rivals report results after tonight’s closing bell, but the stocks could react tomorrow depending on how the reports go.Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)is expected to announce second-quarter earnings per share of $2.03 on revenue of $25.54 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) is seen posting a revenue of $15.87 billion and earnings per share of 83 cents for the second quarter.
2. Data on income
Personal income in the U.S. is expected to rise for the second consecutive month, by 0.2% in July, after gaining 0.1% in June from the previous month.
3. Data on spending
Personal spending is expected to rise by 0.3% in July, its second straight month of expansion, after a 1% gain in June.

870,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",Here's Why You Should Buy These 2 Tech Stocks,"The Nasdaq recently hit new all-time highs as earnings season has been quite strong leading to a flurry of upgrades and EPS estimate revised higher. Taylor Dart identifies two stocks worth buying now: Hewlett Packard (HPQ) and NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK).It’s been a strong year thus far for the major market averages, with the Nasdaq Composite (QQQ) hitting new all-time highs this week, pushing its year-to-date return to more than 16%. While this is great news for investors and has translated to solid returns, this impressive performance has made it quite difficult to add new exposure, given that there are very few names offering a margin of safety after a 110% rally off the March 2020 lows. It’s also made it riskier to add exposure, given that sentiment is through the roof, which often leads to sharp corrections to correct the excess. However, for those looking to build a shopping list, if we do get a correction, a couple of tech names are trading at very reasonable valuations and can be bought on any sharp dips. We’ll look at these two names below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
Hewlett Packard (HPQ) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) have little in common with one being a hardware company and the other being a cybersecurity software company, but both do share one trait, severely discounted valuations to their peer group. In NLOK’s case, the company trades at just 14x next year’s earnings estimates, while HPQ trades less than 8x this year’s estimates. While neither company is an industry leader by any means, these are very reasonable valuations, baking in a significant margin of safety if we do see further pullbacks. As a bonus, both companies also pay ~2.0% plus annual dividend yields, offering investors additional returns from a total return. Let’s take a closer look below:

However, inflation and government policy remain supportive. Taylor Dart explains why you should consider buying these miners trading at cheap valuations: SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM), Newmont (NEM), and Hecla Mining (HL).It’s been a disappointing year thus far for the Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)), with the ETF down more than 10% year-to-date and more than 30% from its new highs 12 months ago. Given the backdrop with high inflation readings and continued money printing, the returns are even more disappointing, causing many to abandon the sector altogether in search of greener pastures. Fortunately, despondence breeds opportunity, and any time that a sector is the most hated it’s been in years, it’s time to be open-minded about a potential bottom in the market and much better returns ahead. This bodes well for the GDX over the medium-term, especially because this correction in the ETF this different. Unlike past corrections, the average GDX constituent is in much better financial shape, is paying a dividend, and is generating significant free cash flow with gold prices above $1,600/oz. In this update, we’ll look at three names that stand out as buy-the-dip candidates, with these being SSR Mining (SSRM), Newmont (NEM), and Hecla Mining (HL).
(Source: TC2000.com)
Hecla Mining, SSR Mining, and Newmont all offer differing exposure to the metals space. One is a silver producer, the second is a silver & gold producer, and the latter is the largest gold producer in the world. However, they all share one key trait, industry-leading margins with some of the best cost profiles in the sector. In Newmont’s case, the company has recently seen inflationary pressures but continues to benefit from silver/copper by-products which are pulling its costs down. In Hecla’s case, the company is one of the highest-grade silver producers globally and the only large-scale silver producer operating out of solely Tier-1 jurisdictions. Finally, SSR Mining has recently beefed up its production profile, merging with Alacer Gold to create a diversified global producer with gold production in the United States and Canada, silver production in Argentina, and gold/copper production in Turkey. Based on recent estimates, these companies are all trading at less than 18x FY2022 earnings estimates despite 40% plus margins while also returning considerable value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

The news, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, sent DWS shares down sharply as trade opened, and they closed 13.6% lower. 
The two people spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations. DWS and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the investigation.
If it progresses, the case will be watched closely by the asset management industry.
Fund managers have rapidly amassed billions of dollars of assets that are meant to have an environmental or social profile, but is facing growing scrutiny over how firms define and apply environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.
The SEC investigation follows a report earlier this month, also by the Journal, citing the former head of sustainability at DWS saying the investment firm overstated how it used sustainable investing criteria to manage investments.
The former manager, who could not immediately be reached for comment, left DWS earlier this year after less than a year in the job.
DWS, in response to the former manager's previous comments, said in a statement Thursday evening that ""we firmly reject the allegations"".
An SEC spokesperson said: ""The SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.""
The Journal, citing unnamed sources, also reported that federal prosecutors in the New York City borough of Brooklyn were looking into the matter. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) declined to comment on the Journal's report. 
Deutsche Bank, which has been expanding its sustainable financing business, has also been trying to restore its image in Washington amid several investigations into its dealings with former President Donald Trump, a long-standing client. 

DWS is the second German fund manager under U.S. regulatory scrutiny.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stumbled  Thursday, as investor incentive to make big bets in either direction on stocks was subdued amid expectations the Fed's Jackson Hole summit may shed some light on the central bank's timeline to taper.
The S&P 500 fell 0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4%, or 137 points, and the Nasdaq fell 0.32%.
Ahead of the symposium, data on the economy was mixed as jobless claims and economic growth were just shy of economists' forecasts, while inflation was in line.
Initial jobless claims totaled 353,000 last week, just above expectations of 350,000, while the penultimate reading of second-quarter GDP was 6.6%, just shy of the 6.7% expected.
The weaker data out from the labor market, however, isn't a reason for worry amid expectations that the trend of the falling claims is likely still intact.
""Although there was an uptick this week, we do not think there is anything to be particularly concerned about here,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note following the weekly jobless claims data. ""The back up is not big enough to signify any fundamental change in the flows of the labor market.""
The mixed data ahead of the meeting is unlikely to filter into the Fed's thinking as some Wall Street believe it is too early for Powell to signal anything meaningful on monetary policy on Friday, as there is just one week until the August jobs report and a month to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next month.
""[W]e do not expect Powell to use Jackson Hole to make any major (taper) announcements but if at all the next Fed meeting in September,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a recent note.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) was in the spotlight, rising  more than 4% after delivering an upbeat outlook on annual performance following quarterly results that topped wall street estimates.
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) gave up its gains to trade flat even as the cosmetics retailer reported a beat on both the top and bottom lines, led by a strong recovery in its beauty business.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday threw out a $1.2 billion ruling against  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD), finding a patent on a cancer therapy it was accused of infringing was invalid, in a blow to rival Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co. 
The two companies have been embroiled in a case involving accusations that Yescarta, the CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy from Gilead's Kite Pharma unit, infringed on a patent for a similar therapy from Bristol's Juno Therapeutics.
Last year, a federal judge increased the damages from a jury trial and ordered Gilead to pay Bristol Myers $1.2 billion in the patent infringement case. The ruling on Thursday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision.
Bristol Myers in a statement said it disagreed with latest ruling and would seek a review of the Federal Circuit’s decision.
Gilead and Kite's attorney Josh Rosenkranz of Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gilead shares were up 0.3%, while Bristol shares were off 0.5% in midday trading.
The Gilead drug, Yescarta, belongs to a class of cutting-edge cancer treatments known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR-T, which reprograms the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells.
Gilead bought Kite Pharma, which developed Yescarta, for $11.9 billion in 2017, with the treatment securing U.S. approval that year. It recorded sales of $338 million in the first six months of this year.
A jury in 2019 found that Kite willfully infringed and awarded Juno and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which licenses the patent to Juno, $778 million. U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez increased the award to $1.2 billion in Los Angeles federal court last year.
Memorial Sloan Kettering did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bristol Myers acquired Juno and its CAR-T program with its $74 billion purchase of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) in 2019.
Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel that the relevant parts of Juno’s patent were invalid because they lacked a sufficient written description and details. 
Moore was joined by Circuit Judges Sharon Prost and Kathleen O'Malley in the ruling.

During a July oral argument https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/fed-circ-probes-validity-cancer-treatment-patent-12-bln-win-2021-07-06, Moore compared the patent's description to trying to identify a specific car by saying it has four wheels.
This story corrects paragraph 1 and 2 to show one patent, not patents.

Let’s discuss.The shares of popular iron ore and steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

However, the company’s weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings, amid a favorable industry backdrop, and with the potential impact of China's slowing recovery on the metals and mining industry, the stock to suffer a price decline in the near term.
In contrast, we think its peers, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (SID), Aperam S.A. (APEMY), and Acerinox, S.A.

A spokesperson for the SoftBank Group Corp-backed company said the contract, awarded by the U.S. General Services Administration to WeWork and four other contractors, is for up to $10 million annually and a period of five years.
The pandemic has marked a shift away from a traditional stand-alone workplace and towards a more hybrid model, where employees have the flexibility to work from offices, co-working spaces, public areas and home.
The fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus and the subsequent tightening of curbs in some places have compounded worries for office space providers, as businesses opt for shorter leases and many employees continue to work remotely.
Earlier this month, WeWork reported a dip in second-quarter revenue from the prior three months, as the Delta variant stoked a slower-than-expected recovery for the first half of the year.

Numerous U.S. federal agencies last month mandated masks at federal buildings in COVID-19 hot spots in line with instructions issued by the White House.
WeWork in March agreed to go public through a merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company, in a deal that valued it at $9 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - FBI investigators have used software from Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc to access restricted evidence they were not supposed to see, according to a letter from a U.S. prosecutor and a spokeswoman for the software firm.
The letter, sent by Manhattan's acting federal prosecutor, Audrey Strauss, to U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, said her office had discovered several FBI employees had improperly accessed evidence gathered in a case because the data had mistakenly been tagged as unrestricted when it was loaded into Palantir's system.
Palantir software marketed to law enforcement agencies is typically used to organize and cross-reference vast troves of data, including case files, arrest records and raw evidence.
The data had been meant to be segregated so that it was available only to those prosecuting the case. However, the error meant four FBI employees unconnected to the prosecution were able to view the data for over a 15-month period, Strauss said.
Strauss said her office and the FBI were looking into the possibility that other unidentified cases could similarly have been affected.
Michael German, a former FBI agent and a fellow at the New York-based Brennan Center for Justice, said ""unauthorized access or use, even if just by FBI employees or other law enforcement officials, creates a substantial risk to the integrity of the evidence and the privacy of innocent people.""

In an email, Palantir spokeswoman Lisa Gordon said its platform was not to blame for the mishap and had strong access and security controls. She added that the FBI ""has rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns, which, in this case, the end user did not follow.""
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment late on Wednesday. The FBI did not return messages.

(Reuters) -Coty Inc said on Thursday it expects to post full-year sales growth for the first time in at least three years, as people splurge on fragrances and cosmetics following the easing of coronavirus curbs, sending its shares surging 20%.
As schools, colleges and offices reopen, people are dressing up and wearing makeup as well as fragrances after snubbing them for skincare products in 2020. That is benefiting cosmetic makers like Coty (NYSE:COTY), which makes Hugo Boss and Burberry perfumes.
Coty has cashed in on the change in customer behavior by rolling out new fragrances, including Burberry Hero and Calvin Klein Defy, marketed by actors Adam Driver and Richard Madden, respectively.
The company said it has a ""robust launch"" scheduled for the first half of the current financial year, adding it would also roll out touchless fragrance testers across the globe.
""Coty is clearly strongly benefiting from a surge in fragrance consumption in two key markets (China and the United States),"" Chief Executive Sue Nabi told Reuters.
Nabi said its cosmetics brand CoverGirl had gained market share for three consecutive months — between April and June — for the first time in five years, as its efforts to target Gen Z and Hispanic consumers pay off.
Coty estimated its fiscal 2022 sales will increase in the low teens percentage range.
Coty forecast fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about $900 million on a constant currency basis, which analysts said was above estimates.

Net revenue in the fourth quarter rose 90% to $1.06 billion, beating Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.01 billion.
Coty, however, reported an adjusted loss of nine cents per share, as it spent heavily on advertising and product launches.

Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, has been hobbled by trade restrictions https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-trump-admin-slams-chinas-huawei-halting-shipments-intel-others-sources-2021-01-17 imposed by the Trump administration on the sale of chips and other components used in its network gear and smartphones businesses.
But in recent weeks and months, people familiar with the application process told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-us-approves-licenses-huawei-buy-auto-chips-sources-2021-08-25 the U.S. has granted licenses authorizing suppliers to sell chips to Huawei for such vehicle components as video screens and sensors. The approvals come as Huawei pivots its business toward items that are less susceptible to U.S. trade bans.
""The Biden Administration cannot be allowed to hide this approval from the public,"" Rubio said. ""Officials need to come forward with what actions they took and why. It is not in America's economic or security interests to help Huawei. Instead of granting waivers, the Biden Administration should be increasing penalties and restrictions on Huawei and other Chinese tech companies.""
The Biden administration, through the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, has been reinforcing the hard line https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-administration-adds-new-limits-huaweis-suppliers-2021-03-11 on exports to Huawei, denying licenses to sell chips to Huawei for use in or with 5g devices. 
But auto chips are generally not considered sophisticated, lowering the bar for approval. One former government official said they were ""non controversial"" while a chip industry source said ""old chips for cars don't harm U.S. national security."" 
The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment but earlier said it ""continues to work with our interagency partners to apply consistently the licensing policies articulated in the Export Administrations Regulations (EAR) to restrict Huawei's access to commodities, software or technology for activities that could harm U.S. national security and foreign policy interests."" 
Rubio was not alone in his criticism. Senator Tom Cotton criticized the approvals, as did the top Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Armed Services Committee.

""The Bureau of Industry and Security's mission is to protect national security and regulate industry — not be its advocate through a permissive licensing regime,"" said the Foreign Affairs committee ranking member Michael McCaul.
The lead Republican on the Armed Services committee, Mike Rogers (NYSE:ROG), urged the administration ""to immediately reverse this decision before further harm is done to U.S. national security.""

(Reuters) -Top U.S. dollar companies said their full-year profits will take a bigger hit than feared due to surging transportation costs, with  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) warning that an acute shortage of shipping capacity could hurt store inventories.
Dollar Tree shares fell 9% on Thursday after the company cut its full-year profit forecast and rival  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) dropped 6%. 
Increasing freight costs caused by bottlenecks at ports as economies reopen and other pandemic-caused global supply-chain disruptions have hit companies across industries, and are likely to especially torment dollar stores that sell products at lowest possible prices. 
Dollar Tree, one of the top U.S. retail importers, said it expects its ocean carriers to fulfill only 60%-65% of their contractual commitments this year, blaming container ship shortages, delays in U.S. and Chinese ports and the lingering effects of the Suez Canal blockage for the shortfall.
Leading international shipping groups have warned clients of delays after a container port in China's eastern marine hub at Ningbo slowed processing partly due to stricter disinfection measures under the country's ""zero-tolerance"" coronavirus policy.
""The Dollar Tree banner imports more containers per $100 million in sales than other large retailers, and combined with our low $1 price point, we have an outsized impact from freight costs,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Witynski said on a call. 
Meanwhile, Dollar General said higher transportation costs significantly contributed to an 80 basis point decline in its second-quarter gross profit margin and it fears a bigger jump in supply chain costs in the second half of the year than expected.

It now expects fiscal 2021 earnings per share (EPS) of $9.60 to $10.20, below analysts' average estimate of $10.24, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

894,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 12:22PM ET</span>",Rent-a-robot: Silicon Valley’s new answer to the labor shortage in smaller U.S. factories,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
LIVERMORE, Calif. (Reuters) - Silicon Valley has a new pitch to persuade small companies to automate: rent-a-robot.
Better technology and the need to pay higher wages to humans have produced a surge in sales of robots to big companies all across America. But few of these automatons are making it into smaller factories, which are wary of big upfront costs and lacking robot engineering talent. 
So venture capitalists are backing a new financial model: lease robots, install and maintain them, charge factories by the hour or month, cut the risk and initial costs. 
Saman Farid, a former venture capitalist who invested in robots for over a decade and saw the challenges of getting robots into factories, set up rent-a-robot Formic Technologies with backing from Lux Capital and Initialized Capital, an early investor in self-driving tech startup Cruise.
Initialized Capital partner Garry Tan sees a confluence of cheaper and better robot computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, low interest rates, and the threat of U.S.-China tensions on supply chains stoking interest in robot subscriptions.
“It's at the center of three of the largest mega trends that are driving all of society now,” said Tan.
Techies and small business owners do not always understand each other, a dilemma that led an industry group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, to set up a San Francisco office a couple of years ago, to bring the two together.
The lease model puts much of the financial burden on robot startups which carry the risk of a manufacturer losing a contract or changing a product. Smaller factories often have small runs of more tailored products that are not worth a robot. And Silicon Valley Robotics, an industry group supporting robot startups, says that in the past, funding has been a challenge.
Still, some high-profile investors are on board.
Tiger Global, the biggest funder of tech startups this year, has backed three robot firms offering subscription in seven months. 
MELVIN THE ROBOT 
Bob Albert, whose family owns Polar Hardware Manufacturing, a 105-year-old metal stamping factory in Chicago, bought Formic’s pitch to pay less than $10 an hour for a robot, compared with over $20 an hour for his average human worker. He watched this month as a robot arm picked up a metal bar from a bin, spun around, and placed it in an older machine that bent it into a 42-inch (107 cm) door handle. 
“If the robot works really well, we’ll use it a lot,” said Albert, who was pleased with the initial results. “And if it doesn't work out, neither one of us comes out very well. We have less skin in the game and they have some skin in the game.”
Westec Plastics Corp, a family-owned plastic molding factory in Livermore, California, got its first robot in January 2020 and now has three - named Melvin, Nancy and Kim - from Rapid Robotics which charges $3,750 a month per robot in the first year and $2,100 from year two.
“Melvin runs 24 hours a day, all three shifts, and that replaced three full operators,” said President Tammy Barras, adding that she is saving about $60,000 in labor costs a year with the one robot alone. “We've had to increase our wages quite significantly this year because of what is going on in the world. And luckily, Melvin has not increased his pay rate. He doesn't ask for a raise.” 

Barras, who has 102 employees, says robots cannot replace humans today as they can perform only repetitive, simple tasks like picking up a round plastic cylinder and stamping a company logo on the correct side. 
Jordan Kretchmer, cofounder and CEO of Rapid Robotics, said he encounters some skepticism. “A lot of times we've walked in and there's a graveyard of robots that they bought in the past,” he said. But he added, ""robots can be easy and they do work when they're in the hands of the right people.""

BANGALORE/SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Cosmetics maker Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc filed on Thursday for an initial public offering of its Brazilian unit to help it deleverage and expand it business, Chief Financial Officer Laurent Mercier said in a call with analysts.
""It's definitely a decision with the goal of supporting the growth of the Brazil business and Coty's personal-care brands,"" he said, adding that this will also help advance Coty's deleveraging agenda.
New York-based Coty's plans to list its Brazilian subsidiary comes as the company decided to divest some assets roughly two year ago to cut debt. Last year, it sold its hair and nail care business to U.S. buyout firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc for $3 billion.
In a filing with the Brazilian securities regulator, Coty said its Brazilian unit also plans to raise fresh proceeds to expand e-commerce and develop new products.
The company has not disclosed yet the offering amount or price per share. One source familiar with the matter said Coty is aiming to raise at least 1 billion reais ($190.68 million) to its coffers in the IPO.
In the first half of the year, Coty posted net revenues of 524.6 million reais and a net income of 57.4 million reais. Stifel said the Brazilian subsidiary has had above corporate average sales growth in recent years.

Investment banks Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Itau BBA and Santander (MC:SAN) will manage the offering.

Daniel Ninivaggi is the former CEO of Icahn Enterprises, a diversified holding company controlled by billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn. He has held a variety of senior leadership positions in the automotive and transportation industries, including  Lear  (NYSE:LEA), where he ultimately served as executive vice president and was responsible for, among other functions, corporate development and strategy.
He later held the positions of Co-Chairman and Co-CEO of Federal Mogul Holdings, an $8 billion supplier of powertrain, chassis, sealing, brake and other automotive components, prior to its sale to Tenneco.
In a sudden development on June 14, Lordstown lost both its CEO and the chief financial officer when the two quit. This happened after the company warned on June 8 that it was close to running out of cash and may go out of business next year.
It reported a second-quarter net loss of $108 million on August 11. The company said it had secured an equity purchase agreement for access to $400 million in capital and that it was pursuing external capital sources including debt and equity-linked securities.

Tech stocks have gained significant momentum amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, with robust digitization occurring in almost every industry, and with 5G being deployed widely, tech companies are seeing a surging demand for their products and services. So, considering the tech sector’s solid growth attributes, we think AAPL and MSFT could be great picks now.
In contrast, the social-media-triggered interest of retail investors, and the excessively stretched valuations of AMC and CLOV, could potentially lead to these shares retreating in price in the near term.

By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Seeds and farm chemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc will partner with farm technology and services provider Indigo Ag to broaden its U.S. agricultural carbon credits program for the 2022 season, Corteva announced on Thursday.
The Corteva Carbon Initiative will initially pay farmers around $15 an acre for shifting to practices that pollute less, use fewer chemicals or farm crops that pull carbon from the atmosphere and lock it in the soil, the company said.
The project is among a string of recent environmentally-focused initiatives by agriculture companies tapping market-based approaches to conservation and carbon capture on the farm.
Some programs have stumbled as farmers are reluctant to make potentially disruptive changes to their farming operations, while credit buyers remain unsure of the environmental value of the new offerings.
The collaboration will expand Corteva's two-crop pilot project in three states this year to an 11-state program that covers 17 different crops.
The credits generated will be sold to companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint, including  Barclays  (LON:BARC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) and New Belgium Brewing.
""We're viewing this as a production contract, like (farmers) are producing carbon credits for us just like they produce a grain crop,"" said Chris Harbourt, global head of carbon at Indigo.
The program will estimate how much carbon is captured and sequestered using soil tests and farming data such as planting dates, seed types, fertilizer applications and weather.
Farmers are required to sign up for a minimum five-year term, with payments doled out gradually over that time to ensure that carbon is not re-released if, for example, the soil is tilled, Harbourt said.

Farmers will receive 75% of the value of the credit, with the remainder going to the companies to cover administrative costs.

Most of their workers were part-time contractors, so companies didn't need to pay benefits. Now, that has changed. A judge recently ruled California Prop 22 was unconstitutional, which could mean bad news for stocks such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash (DASH).California Prop 22 has been ruled unconstitutional. Gig economy stocks are taking a hit as a result of the news. Though gig companies probably won't have to pay comprehensive benefits and provide the extent of niceties awarded to full-time in-house employees, the ruling of Prop 22 as unconstitutional certainly won't help the bottom line of gig businesses.
In plain English, the ruling noted above means the law that permitted companies to classify rideshare drivers as contractors instead of employees has been struck down. Prop 22, previously passed by voters in the fall, was deemed unenforceable and also unconstitutional. Gig companies had spent more than $200 million supporting the law. 
Now that these companies are not exempt from treating drivers as official employees, the power pendulum has swung in favor of labor. Below, I provide a look at three gig stocks investors should avoid after the Prop 22 ruling. These stocks are Uber Technologies (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), and DoorDash (DASH).

TORONTO (Reuters) -Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) closed out Canadian lenders' third-quarter results reporting with better-than-expected profits on Thursday, driven mostly by releases of reserves to cover bad loans, but CIBC's strong loan growth from a year earlier eluded TD.
CIBC's loan balances climbed 8% as of July 31, while TD's fell 0.5% from a year earlier, as declines in the latter's U.S. lending offset strong loan growth in Canada. This contributed to flat revenues at TD, while CIBC's rose 7%. 
""In the U.S., relief programs for consumers and businesses have been quite significant,"" Riaz Ahmed, chief financial officer at TD, Canada's second-largest lender by market value, said in an interview. ""That buildup in liquidity among customers and business owners has been quite significant and resulted in loan growth being anemic."" 
U.S. loan growth is expected to pick up as liquidity shrinks, he said. 
All of Canada's biggest banks this week reported profits that beat expectations, driven by improving provisions for credit losses (PCL). Most also showed signs of recovery in lending, particularly to Canadian businesses even as mortgage growth continued, with that strength helping eclipse continued pressure on margins.
Bank of Nova Scotia, however, stuggled as its loan growth at home was eclipsed by declines in its sizeable Latin American business, although analysts were optimistic about a turnaround in coming quarters. 
On Thursday, TD joined the disappointing contingent.
TD shares dropped 0.9% to C$84.88 in morning trading in Toronto, while CIBC climbed 0.5% to C$152.16, on its way to a record close. The Toronto stock benchmark slipped 0.1%. 
Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) shares also set records this week. 
TD's ""loan growth remains a struggle, which does not appear to be solely a result of (the) run-off"" of the United States' pandemic-driven loan forgiveness program for businesses,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Analyst John Aiken said in a note.
Continued high deposit levels could slow loan growth recoveries in some areas, some of the banks have warned. At CIBC, credit utilization rates, while improving, remain low, and although credit card purchases are rising, outstanding balances are expected to be built up much more slowly, executives said on an analyst call.
Separately CIBC said it aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions in its operational and financing activities by 2050, and will set interim targets to do so starting next year. 

Both TD and CIBC benefited from strong growth in wealth management revenues from a year earlier, which helped drive a 13% increase in non-interest income in TD's Canadian retail unit, and a 25% jump in CIBC's.

CEO Judiney Carvalho told Reuters demand for Brazilian agriculture commodities, fueled mainly by China, supports its plan to grow through acquisitions and greenfield projects.
Amaggi's expansion comes amid a wider boom in Brazil's grain belt driven by high prices. 
Amaggi, which plants, processes and trades in grains, is building two new fertilizer plants, one in Mato Grosso, where it is headquartered, and a second in the northern state of Rondonia, Carvalho said in a rare interview. 
Closely held Amaggi has previously said it is also building its first biodiesel facility in Mato Grosso.
China's Cofco and U.S. firms like ADM,  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) and Cargill own competing soy processing plants in the state, and Amaggi's investment is likely to fuel even more competition to originate and crush oilseeds there. 
""We are in all phases of the supply chain,"" Carvalho said, citing relationships with some 6,000 farmers as well as production from its own farms. ""Our structure makes our decision-making process faster than that of the ABDC's,"" he said, referring to global rivals. 
Amaggi's investment will raise its grain storage capacity as well as expand its electricity generating business, which will have total installed capacity of 90MW by 2023, enough to supply a city of 260,000 inhabitants.
Carvalho, who has worked at the company for more than three decades, declined to say how much Amaggi paid for Grupo O Telhar Agro, a deal announced in March that will boost the group's farmable area by a fifth to nearly 350,000 hectares (864,868 acres). But he confirmed the move is expected to raise Amaggi's oilseeds and fiber output by over a third from the current 1.1 million tonnes. 
Amaggi also has interests in banking and a non-GMO soymeal plant in Norway. 
In 2020, Amaggi traded in some 14 million tonnes of grains globally, an amount seen hitting 17.5 million tonnes this year, Carvalho said. According to shipping data, it was Brazil's largest corn and No. 5 soy exporter through July.
Carvalho credited a ""solid governance structure"" that excludes any members of the billionaire Maggi family that controls the company with helping it to execute its bold expansion and navigate volatility during the pandemic, when some traders faced financing risk.

""The pandemic turned the market upside down,"" Carvalho said. ""If your financial partners are afraid of Brazil or of your businesses, this can be a serious problem.""

“It doesn’t mean that we will move all the way to neutral or tighter policy, but I think it’s a first step,"" George said. ""“When you look at the job gains we saw last month, the month before, you look at the level of inflation right now, I think it would suggest that the level of accommodation we’re providing right now is probably not needed.""
Such signs were evident in the latest weekly jobless claims data, which stayed to last week's post-pandemic low at 353,000. The economy grew by slightly more than expected in the second quarter, at an annualized rate of 6.6%, but the second reading of the GDP report provided no new shocks with regard to inflation. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points, or 0.2%, at 35,460 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, however, were both down by less than 0.1%, after closing at new record highs on Wednesday.
Enterprise software companies were in vogue in early trade, as their quarterly updates and the steady deterioration of the U.S.'s Covid-19 situation both encouraged demand for stocks that have already done well out of the pandemic. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) stock rose 4.7% while Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock rose 4.1%. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock also rose 4.6%, although Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) stock fell 1.1% in the wake of its update and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) fell an alarming 14% after a weaker-than-expected outlook for the rest of the year.
Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) stock was another big gainer, continuing to profit from the greater diversion of consumer spending to home comforts and furnishings during the pandemic. The stock rose 12% after the company increased its dividend, expanded its buyback program and raised its guidance again.
Going in the other direction were Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) stock fell 10.5% and Dollar General (NYSE:DG) stock fell 7.0%, after both discount retailers warned of rising costs that their business model hardly allows them to pass on to customers. 
Elsewhere, the cosmetics sector delivered some more impressive results, profiting from the reopening of both offices and entertainment spaces during the spring and early summer.  Coty (NYSE:COTY) stock rose 14% while Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) stock edged 0.3% higher.

However, given that the company’s top- and bottom-line performance continue to be negatively affected by rising inflationary pressure, is the stock worth betting on now? Read on.Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is involved in the wholesale distribution of non-residential construction and industrial supplies in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and worldwide. Stronger demand from manufacturing and non-residential construction markets, thanks to an increase in economic activity in the second quarter, helped improve the company’s operational results in its last reported quarter. Its shares have soared 12.8% in price year-to-date and 4.3% over the past three months. FAST is based in Winona, Minn.
Although FAST’s growing digital footprint, which represented 41.7% of its sales in the second quarter, and improved demand from onsite customers bode well for the stock, its valuation at its current share price level could be concerning. 
In addition, while President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure deal could boost FAST’s construction parts and equipment-related sales, growing inflationary pressure and a reduction in its national account sales and government customers could hamper its growth.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 09:30AM ET</span>",Western Digital-Kioxia in talks to create chipmaker giant -source,"By Krystal Hu and Makiko Yamazaki
NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) -Western Digital is in advanced talks for a possible $20 billion stock merger with Japanese chipmaker and partner Kioxia, a person familiar with the matter said, a move that would create a NAND memory giant to rival Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF). 
The companies could reach an agreement as early as mid-September, and  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) CEO David Goeckeler would run the combined firm, the person said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential matters. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the talks earlier on Wednesday. Kioxia Holdings Corp and Western Digital both told Reuters they do not comment on speculation about mergers. 
A combination of the two would rewrite the competition to capture robust demand for memory chips that has been driven by 5G expansion and a pandemic-fueled rise in work from home. 
While Samsung (KS:005930) dominates with over a third of the NAND market, according to research firm TrendForce, Kioxia has a nearly 19% share and Western Digital 15%. South Korea's SK Hynix Inc and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) are the other large players. 
""Such a deal would be a defensive, but prudent, move by Western to reinforce its competitive position in the swiftly consolidating chip market,"" Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said in a research note. 
""In the long term, we expect the NAND market to ... consolidate down to about three leading players for a largely commodity-like product,"" Kerwin said. 
The memory chip industry is already consolidating, with Hynix agreeing to buy Intel's NAND business for $9 billion last year, a deal still awaiting anti-trust clearance. 
A Western Digital-Kioxia merger is also likely to draw anti-trust scrutiny in several countries, including in the United States and China. 
Monopoly concerns and a years-long trade conflict between the United States and China have scuppered deals in the past few years. 
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, for instance, walked away from a $44 billion deal to buy  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) after failing to secure Chinese approval in 2018, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's planned $40 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM hit a major hurdle last week in the UK. 
Chinese antitrust watchdog State Administration for Market Regulation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on approval for a potential Western Digital-Kioxia deal. 
KIOXIA OWNERS
In Japan, the two companies jointly produce NAND chips, which don't need power to retain data and are used in smartphones, TVs, data center servers and public announcement display panels.
""For privately held Kioxia, we think $20 billion or more would secure a solid return,"" Morningstar's Kerwin said.
Kioxia, sold by Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion as Toshiba Memory Corp, shelved plans last year for what would have been Japan's largest initial public offering in 2020. 
An IPO is still a possibility should Kioxia fail to reach a deal with San Jose, California-based Western Digital, the source told Reuters. Financial magazine Diamond in June said Kioxia was planning an IPO as early as September. 
Kioxia said in its statement to Reuters on Thursday that it was considering the appropriate timing for an IPO. 
Toshiba, which still owns about 40.6% of Kioxia, is in talks with at least four global private equity firms to seek their ideas for a new strategy, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources. 
Toshiba's shares were up 1.3% in afternoon trading.
Western Digital's shares closed up 7.8% on Wednesday, giving it a market capitalization of more than $20 billion. 

Toshiba said it was not involved in the management of Kioxia and not in a position to comment. It said it continues to consider the most appropriate approach to its investment in Kioxia to maximize shareholder value.
Bain was not immediately available for a comment.

Investing.com – Taiwan Semiconductor stock (NYSE:TSM) rose 0.8% higher in Thursday’s premarket trading after a report in The Wall Street Journal that said the company plans to hike prices of its chips by 10% to 20%.
According to the report, prices of most advanced chips could rise by around 10% while less advanced chips could get pricier by as much as 20%.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of TSMC's biggest customers, traded a tad lower premarket.
TSMC accounts for more than half of the global semiconductor foundry market by revenue, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce.
The company’s decision to raise prices comes in the backdrop of an unprecedented shortage of chips, triggered by work-from-home demand for mobiles, laptops and other digital devices as well as automobiles as more technology gets embedded in them.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -India's SpiceJet Ltd said on Thursday it expects Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX jets in its fleet to return to service at the end of September following a settlement struck with lessor Avolon on leases of the aircraft.
Later in the day, the country's air safety regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, said it had cleared 737 MAX aircraft to fly with immediate effect, after nearly two-and-a-half-years of regulatory grounding.
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people, plunging Boeing into a financial crisis, which has since been compounded by the pandemic.
Around 175 countries have allowed the 737 MAX to return to service, with 30 airlines already restarting their MAX aircraft services.
The resumption of MAX aircraft services would be subject to regulatory approvals, SpiceJet, India's second-largest airline by market share and the only one in the country to fly the aircraft, said. Avolon declined to comment.
SpiceJet, which said earlier this month it was in discussions with lessors of MAX aircraft to restructure present leases, did not provide any further details on the settlement https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/0c9e7a01-f010-42fe-b8ad-e483856d5903.pdf.
With easing of the travel restrictions and increasing pace of vaccinations, there might be some pick-up in air traffic and SpiceJet's settlement to restart MAX aircraft could help it get back on track, said Likhita Chepa, senior research analyst at CapitalVia Global Research.
""However, higher ATF (Air Turbine Fuel) prices might hurt margins and operability,"" Chepa added.
With 13 of its 737 MAX planes grounded, SpiceJet had said it was in talks with Boeing for compensation towards costs and losses it has suffered.

Boeing continues to work with global regulators to safely return the 737-8 and 737-9 to service, the U.S. planemaker said in a statement to Reuters, while declining to comment on the compensation. 
SpiceJet shares had fallen 25.1% this year as of Thursday close compared to a 1.3% rise in shares of rival Indigo's owner InterGlobe Aviation.

 Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) Inc. posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and net sales that exceeded analyst estimates as the average market price for chicken breast tenders and jumbo wings more than doubled. Sales rose to $1.35 billion from $956.5 million a year earlier.
The 74-year-old company, which is preparing to sell itself and go private, continues to benefit from the pandemic-era trend of more consumers dining at home. Sanderson also said demand from its food service customers is improving. The gains helped offset a 46% surge in chicken feed costs due to near-decade high prices for corn and soy meal. 
“Demand for the products we sell to retail grocery store customers remained strong,” Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said in a statement Thursday. 
The poultry processor said it expects supplies of corn and soybeans it uses for chicken feed to remain tight and prices for both commodities to stay elevated “at least for the short term.”
The company has agreed to be bought by agriculture giant Cargill Inc. and Continental Grain Co. for $4.53 billion. The deal would expand on Sanderson’s current position as the third-biggest U.S. chicken producer by creating a venture with about 15% market share. 
The proposed deal values Sanderson at $203 a share, a 30% premium over the share price of $155.74 on June 18, the last full trading day prior to media speculation about the potential sale. The stock rose 0.9% in before regular trading in New York on Thursday, after closing Wednesday at $193.62.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",South Africa domicile is not main reason for Gold Fields' share discount -- CEO,"By Promit Mukherjee
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African miner Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI) is considering leaving its Johannesburg listing, though a move would not eliminate its share price discount compared to global peers, chief executive Chris Griffith said on Thursday.
The bullion miner has sold most of its mines in the country as a widespread sell-off of South African assets by miners has raised speculation among investors that companies could seek to list elsewhere. 
AngloGold Ashanti has already said it plans to do so, and Gold Fields has in the past said it might also consider a move. 
""It is a secondary consideration, and it is still something on the cards,"" Griffith, who was appointed chief executive in April from  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum, told Reuters in an interview. 
""Yes, there may be some discount in our South African domiciliation ... It would be lazy of us to say it's just because of where our postbox address is.""
Griffith said Gold Fields needed to focus on delivering on projects for investors in order to deserve better valuations. 
Analysts and investors say South African mining companies are often given lower valuations compared with global rivals due to issues including regulations, power supply, and transportation issues.
Gold companies are particularly disadvantaged due to depletion of resources at South African mines and the relatively high cost of extracting ore.
Gold Fields, like many of its South African peers, has sought to diversify from its traditional home terrain, selling off all of its mines except its South Deep project.
Griffith cited three reasons for a discount of its shares compared to its global peers -- development of its Salares Norte Project in Chile, years of losses at its sole South African mine and varying mine-life estimates of its Australian assets.
""We must deliver the (Salares) project on time, in the budget...and deliver the volume that we said it would be and if we do that, it will get the full value,"" he said.

He said South Deep had already turned around and will continue to deliver positive cash flows for several years and should see fair value soon. In Australia, he said the company estimates the life of the mines are 10 years and beyond, but the market feels it is less.
Gold Fields' price to earnings multiple (P/E) - a widely used metric to compare companies in the same industry - is at 8.5 as compared with top gold miner Newmont Corp's 17 and Canadian company Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD)'s 14, according to Refinitiv data.

(NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) announced a deal with a Brazilian manufacturer to produce 100 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine annually for Latin America. 
Under the terms announced Thursday, the Brazilian pharmaceutical company Eurofarma Laboratorios SA will perform the so-called fill-and-finish process in which the vaccine is put into sterile vials. 
Eurofarma will begin manufacturing finished doses at its facility in Sao Paulo in 2022. In the interim, Pfizer and BioNTech will help facilitate a technology transfer, on-site development and equipment installation. The vaccine substance will be sent to Brazil from facilities in the U.S., and the finished doses will be distributed by Eurofarma exclusively throughout Latin America. 
With the deal, the Pfizer-BioNTech supply chain will span more than 20 production facilities across four continents. The vaccine partners said they tap contract manufacturers through “a rigorous selection process” that emphasizes a track record of quality and compliance, a highly trained workforce, available capacity and prior working relationship. 
There will now be two facilities in the Southern Hemisphere using the messenger RNA technology underlying the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The first came about through a similar deal with the Biovac Institute, a company partially owned by the South African government. 
Read more: Pfizer deal to produce 100 Million vaccine doses for Africa
The deals follow criticism about inequitable access to vaccines around the world. A lack of shots in some nations has hindered efforts to slow the pandemic, particularly as the more-transmissible delta variant spreads. Countries and regions with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated more than 20 times faster than those with the lowest, leaving many still highly vulnerable to infection. 
Throughout Central America and the Caribbean, Covid cases are currently surging. Meanwhile, South America continues to face a high number of infections, even as hospitalizations decrease.
Lack of Facilities
The World Health Organization has suggested that insufficient manufacturing infrastructure is a part of the problem. Most of the Covid-19 vaccine production facilities are concentrated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Global health experts at the WHO and beyond have called on the Pfizer-BioNTech partnership and its counterparts to help turn the tides. 
The Eurofarma partnership will help provide fair and equitable access to the vaccine, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in a statement. He added that the company will continue to explore similar opportunities.
To date, Pfizer and BioNTech have shipped more than 1.3 billion doses to more than 120 countries and territories. The companies have partnered with Covax, a global program meant to equitably distribute vaccines, and are supplying the U.S. government with 500 million doses that it will donate and distribute internationally. 
Building Out Production
Founded in 1972, Eurofarma has manufacturing plants across Latin America. The company produces brand-name prescription and generic drugs, over-the-counter medicines, veterinary treatments, and hospital products. It has partnered with Pfizer in the past on cardiovascular-focused work. 
As Eurofarma gets its facility up and running to fill and finish the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid shot, the WHO and its Pan American Health Organization unit are simultaneously launching their own program to bring mRNA technology into the region. 
More than 30 public and private companies have expressed interest in participating in the WHO’s mRNA technology transfer program to benefit production in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Carissa Etienne, the director of the Pan American Health Organization. The group will host a series of meetings to promote coordination across countries and enlist partners.
“For regional production to be sustainable, production cannot be concentrated in one place,” she said.

Investing.com – Ulta Beauty stock (NASDAQ:ULTA) traded 5.7% higher in Thursday’s premarket as the reopening of offices, stores and entertainment venues boosted sales of its eyeliners and serums in the second quarter.
Net sales jumped 60% to $2 billion and comparable sales rose 56%. The latter had fallen 27% in the second quarter of the last financial year. A 52% increase in transactions and a 2.5% increase in average tickets helped reverse the graph. The company raised its guidance and now expects its annual net sales to come in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion, up from the forecast of $7.7 billion-$7.8 billion given earlier.
Chief Executive Officer Dave Kimbell attributed higher sales during the quarter to stronger consumer confidence and fewer Covid-19 restrictions.
The recovery in the beauty category also led the company to open six new stores in the second quarter. It had opened none in the same period last year.

Partner's bid to buy Xfone comes after Golan Telecom -- a unit of Cellcom, Israel's largest mobile provider -- offered to buy Xfone. Cellcom said in a regulatory filing that Xfone's debt stood at about 60 million shekels.
Israeli media reported two other bids for Xfone.
Partner, Israel's second-largest mobile operator, said its offer would expire on Sept. 9 and said it was conditional on receiving various regulatory approvals.
Cellcom bought Golan Telecom last year, kicking off some consolidation in the sector. Market reforms in 2012 led to the creation of new, low-cost rivals, driving down prices that have left incumbents in particular struggling to stay profitable.
Israel's telecoms regulator had previously resisted mergers to avoid pushing prices back up. But its approval of Cellcom's purchase of Golan signalled it also wants to avoid company failures.

As part of its bid, Partner said it would offer at least 70% of Xfone's employees continued employment for at least one year, beginning at the date of the purchase.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>","Debt-laden China Evergrande warns of profit plunge, restructuring talk grows","By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -The government of Guangdong province is seeking feedback from major banks of debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group about forming a creditor committee, as the company warned of a further plunge in profits, according to a news report on Thursday.
Financial intelligence provider REDD, citing two sources briefed by bankers, said that the government initiated discussions with banks last week but has yet to make a decision.
The formation of a creditor committee would allow the government to instruct banks and trust firms to extend their exposure, reduce borrowing rates and provide additional support to the company, REDD said, adding it would also be responsible for leading a debt restructuring should Evergrande default on a public bond.
Evergrande and China's central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The company is based in Guangdong, and is the county's second largest developer, with a massive nationwide presence.
Evergrande has been scrambling to raise funds it needs to pay its many lenders and suppliers, with regulators and financial markets worried https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-evergrande-group-says-will-maintain-stability-its-operations-2021-08-20 that any crisis could ripple through China's banking system. 
The central bank and banking watchdog summoned Evergrande's senior executives last week and issued a rare warning that the company needs to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability.
Local media Singtao Daily reported early this week that Evergrande was close to sealing a deal to sell its Hong Kong office tower to Guangzhou-based peer Yuexiu Property at a loss for HK$10.5 billion, but REDD said the provincial government has asked Yuexiu to suspend the purchase this week. 
Highlighting its deteriorating finances, Evergrande said late on Wednesday it expected its six-month net profit to slump as much as 39% from a year earlier, dragged by a drop in its home selling prices and higher expenses.
The expected drop, to between 9 billion yuan ($1.39 billion) and 10.5 billion yuan in the six months ended June, is also partly due to losses of 4 billion yuan and 4.8 billion yuan in the company's property and electric car businesses, respectively, it said in a filing.
Evergrande shares closed down 7.2% on Thursday at their lowest since July 2015, while Evergrande New Energy Vehicle stocks tumbled 18.7%. Shares of the car business have shed over 80% this year.
The developer, however, said an 18.5 billion yuan gain from the sale of some shares and marked-to-market holding in internet unit Hengten Networks had helped offset some losses. 
Hengten shares fell 5%, while the broader marker eased 1%. 

The company is due to report its interim results on Tuesday.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Investors see no speed bump in Fed's Jackson Hole event,"By Karen Pierog and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Despite weeks of anticipation, investors have lowered their expectations for Friday's Jackson Hole event https://www.reuters.com/world/us/feds-jackson-hole-shift-shows-delta-variants-ability-skew-plans-2021-08-23, saying that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has little reason to rock the boat.
Some market-watchers had seen the conference as a potentially key moment when Powell could give hints about tapering https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fed-minutes-likely-detail-bond-buying-taper-talks-inflation-worries-2021-08-18 the Fed's $120 billion in monthly asset purchases that have propped up the market after COVID-19 hit.
However, with a consensus still forming among Fed members on when to taper, some see scant market-moving revelations by Powell in his speech, contending the Fed will want to see upcoming jobs and inflation data and more information on how the coronavirus Delta variant impacts the economy.
""It does feel like the markets and investors are basically going into this event with more of a neutral stance and not taking any big bets one way or another,"" said Anders Persson, Nuveen's chief investment officer.
Amid many characterizations of the conference as a potential ""yawner,"" U.S. stock indexes have hit record highs and derivatives markets are shrugging it off, although bond markets have been a bit more volatile. 
Meanwhile, tapering views may be evolving due to the Delta variant with Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan saying last week he may need to adjust his call for reducing asset purchases this fall.
Even when tapering does start, some say the Fed is unlikely to generate a ""taper tantrum"" https://www.reuters.com/business/post-fed-taper-tantrum-not-this-time-market-strategists-say-2021-07-08 similar to 2013 when Fed chief Ben Bernanke told lawmakers the central bank could slow its pace of asset purchases, sending yields sharply higher. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a research note estimates the magnitude of moves versus 2013 ""is likely to be smaller"" given how well-telegraphed the policy change is likely to be.
Powell in July edged closer to unveiling plans to taper, going so far as to describe the Fed's July gathering as the ""talking-about talking-about meeting.""
“We were always in the nothing-burger camp and at this point we think that ... the Fed has talked about tapering for quite some time and so if you aren't expecting it you live under a rock,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
'SNOOZER' 
At a time when gyrations in the foreign exchange market are particularly muted - the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) FX Volatility Index is near historical lows - traders do not see Powell shattering the calm. 
""Currency markets are overwhelmingly positioned for a snoozer,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto. Activity in the U.S. equity options market is similarly nonchalant, with traders largely looking past the Jackson Hole event, Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy said in a note. S&P 500 options are currently pricing in a one-day move of about 0.6% on Friday, according to Matt Amberson of analytics firm ORATS, about the same as the 0.63% move the S&P 500 has logged on average on the day the Jackson Hole symposium heard from the Fed chief, a Reuters analysis showed. 
In the bond market, the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index, which tracks traders' expectations of swings in the Treasury market, was just a little higher than its 5-year average. Yields moved higher on Wednesday, although that was partly ascribed to low liquidity.
Jason England, a global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, sees thinly traded Treasuries remaining range-bound.
""Until you get some more of that data and get closer to any firm views on tapering from the consensus on the (Federal Open Market Committee), you're not going see much shocks in Treasuries,"" he said. 
Still, there remains some caution. 
Tim Murray, a capital market strategist at T. Rowe Price, said his positioning of being slightly underweight in equities reflects concerns over elevated valuations in most asset classes, slowing growth and waning stimulus.

The company will offer individual and family plans to customers in Georgia, Mississippi and Pennsylvania, as well as counties in Arizona, Florida and Virginia through individual exchanges, totaling to 313 counties spanning 13 states.
In February, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said it would return to selling individual health insurance plans on the ACA-created online marketplaces, citing stability in the market.
CVS Health's Aetna (NYSE:AET) insurance unit and other large health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) exited these online exchanges in 2017 and 2018, due to financial losses and uncertainty as Republicans took aim at former U.S. President Barack Obama's signature law.
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Republican bid backed by former President Donald Trump's administration to invalidate Obamacare, preserving the landmark healthcare law for the third time since its 2010 enactment.

Cigna, which manages insurance plans for big companies and sells health plans on government exchanges, said on Thursday it sees a potential to reach about 1.5 million additional customers through the new markets. 
Customers added under the ACA will get access to free virtual health screenings with doctors through the Cigna's telehealth provider, MDLive.

Investing.com – Pure Storage stock (NYSE:PSTG) climbed 12% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the company’s second-quarter revenue beat estimates and its net loss narrowed.
In a surprise move, the company also raised its annual revenue guidance. It had so far stuck to its previous guidance of 14%-15% revenue growth, but now expects revenue to be $2.04 billion for the year, up 21% from 2020.
Third-quarter revenue is seen at $530 million.
According to Chief Financial Officer Kevan Krysler, growth in the previous quarters had just been too strong to not shift the stance against a revised guidance.
Chef Executive Officer Charles Giancarlo predicted stronger growth for the company as more businesses return to office work and seek more Cloud-based products and services.
Operating profit of $46.6 million was highest for any quarter and total sales of $496.8 million were highest for a second quarter.
Subscription services revenue grew approximately 31% year over year, and was approximately 35% of the total. Product revenue was also strong during the quarter, growing 19%.
Second-quarter total revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $496.8 million. Net losses narrowed to $45.3 million from $65.0 million as expenses rose at a slower pace.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Thursday, struggling to climb from record levels ahead of the release of important economic data and ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 25 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 27 points, or 0.2%.
The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.2% Wednesday, closing at a new record level after crossing the 4,500 threshold for the first time ever. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2%, also a record close, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%.
The economic data slate includes the weekly initial jobless claims release, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to be largely unchanged from the previous week’s 348,000 figure. The first revision of the second-quarter GDP figure is due at the same time, and is likely to show a slight improvement from the annualised 6.5% growth first recorded. 
These numbers create an interesting backdrop for Powell’s highly anticipated speech on Friday at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium. The market is looking for any hints for when the central bank will start tapering its massive bond-buying program.
There are several companies scheduled to report earnings Thursday, including retailers Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), tech companies Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ), and exercise equipment company Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON).
Software giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) will also be in the spotlight after beating market expectations for earnings in the May-July period, while Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) also released strong quarterly results after the close Wednesday.
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) will also be in focus after Bloomberg News reported that the Chinese e-commerce company is nearing a deal to buy a controlling stake in storage facilities manager China Logistics.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell Thursday, correcting after the biggest three-day gain since March, with mounting Covid-19 cases, fuelled by the highly transmissible delta variant, continuing to threaten the global demand recovery in the second half of the year.
That said, the picture in the U.S. looks more promising. Crude inventories in the largest consumer in the world fell last week for a third consecutive week while overall fuel demand increased to the most since March 2020, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $67.69 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $70.65. Both contracts have risen by around 10% over the last three days.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Barclays said on Thursday it is pumping in more than $400 million into its India arm to tap rising corporate and investment banking activity in the country that is now recovering from the pandemic.
This is  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' single largest capital infusion in its Indian business in the last three decades. It comes after the British lender pulled out of the retail business in Asia's third-largest economy in 2011 and exited its equity investment business in 2016.
Barclays said the investment would help grow its corporate and debt investment banking, as well as private clients businesses.
Revenue from investment banking in India so far this year was $498 million, versus $339 million in the same period last year and $538 million in 2020, according to Dealogic.
Barclays leads India's debt capital market by USD bond volume, with a year-to-date share of 14%, according to Dealogic. Rivals such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) have a share of 13% each, while HSBC has 12%.
""As economic activity gathers momentum, there is increased demand for capital from clients,"" said Jaideep Khanna, Barclays country CEO for India.
Barclays India mainly lends to corporates with exposures largely to highly rated clients and subsidiaries of multi-national companies, according to Fitch unit India Ratings & Research.
""Last year was a very good year for debt capital market in India, particularly as domestic bank credit didn't take off much. There was a lot of interest in global credit and the overall market has been robust,"" said Ananth Narayan, associate professor of finance at S.P. Jain Institute of Management and Research.
With the fresh capital infusion, Barclays India's Tier-1 capital has increased by 55%.
""According to central bank norms, there are limits placed on what a lender can do with respect to their balance sheet, but now that the bank's overall capital base has expanded, its ability to lend more has increased,"" according to a source familiar with the matter, who did not wish to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

Barclays inaugurated its international banking unit branch at GIFT City in the western state of Gujarat in February, as part of its expansion plans for India.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South African retailer Woolworths Holdings (OTC:WLWHY) resumed dividend payouts on Thursday after its annual profit surged and the sale of some Australian properties helped it to cut its debt.
The clothing, food and homeware retailer had been renegotiating leases, reducing capital expenditure and cutting costs to help bolster its balance sheet. It has also sold Bourke Street Mens and Elizabeth Street properties in Australia, a part of its upmarket department chain David Jones.
The group reduced net borrowings by over 10 billion rand ($668 million) to 1.1 billion rand, with a slight increase in free cash flow in the 52 weeks ended June 27, Group Financial Director Reeza Isaacs said.
""The significant reduction in our borrowings gives us greater scope in deploying our capital, one of which is resuming dividends,"" Isaacs told investors.
The retailer declared a final dividend of 66 cents per share, a 25.8% decrease on the prior year's 89 cents. It had withheld dividends at the half year stage to preserve cash.
Shares in the company traded 1.5% higher by 1015 GMT.
Its 2022 financial year capex is seen at 2.8 billion rand, up from 1.4 billion rand in 2021 as it looks to aggressively invest in technology and its supply chain.
Woolworths had sold and leased back the Australian properties for a combined 631 million Australian dollars.
The retailer said it continued to see signs of recovery from the COVID-19 fallout although consumer confidence in South Africa is still weak.
In the first seven weeks of the new financial year, sales in David Jones and clothing chain Country Road in Australia fell 26.7% and 13.4% respectively, due to the current multiple lockdowns in parts of the country.

Overall group turnover and concession sales rose by 9.7% to 85.9 billion rand. Headline earnings per share (HEPS), the main gauge of profit in South Africa, climbed more than 200% to 374.4 cents while adjusted diluted HEPS, which strips out certain items, rose by 102.9%. ($1 = 14.9601 rand)

HONG KONG (Reuters) -JOYY Inc's top two shareholders, its Chairman David Li and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) founder Lei Jun, plan to take the Nasdaq-listed company private in a deal that could value it at up to $8 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
They are teaming up for the deal as they believe the Chinese social media company is undervalued in the U.S. market, the people added. JOYY (NASDAQ:YY) had an average market value of $3.9 billion over the past month, while its net asset value totalled $5.6 billion as of June 30, based on its quarterly results.
Li and Lei are looking to offer $75-$100 per share to take the cash-rich JOYY private, two of the people said, a premium of 50-100% to the share's average price over the past month.
The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was private.
Li and Lei did not immediately respond to requests for comment via JOYY and Xiaomi, respectively. Neither did JOYY.
JOYY shares rose 8.6% in pre-market trading on Thursday. 
Li and Lei owned 23.2% and 7.8% of JOYY, respectively, the company's 2020 annual report shows. Li had 76% voting power.
If completed, the deal will add to a growing number of New York-listed Chinese firms that have already opted out of U.S. bourses by going private or returning to equity markets closer to home via second listings.
These moves come amid heightened scrutiny and stricter audit requirements https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-sec-gives-chinese-companies-new-requirements-us-ipo-disclosures-2021-08-23 for U.S.-listed Chinese companies from American regulators amid political tensions between the countries.

There were 16 announced take-private deals of U.S.-listed Chinese companies worth $19 billion last year, Dealogic data shows, versus just five such deals worth $8 billion in 2019. 
FINANCE AND REGULATORY NOD
The Li-Lei consortium is in talks with banks to finance the deal and seeks to secure a loan by using JOYY's $4.9 billion cash and cash equivalents as collateral, two of the sources said, adding it aims to finalise the deal by the end of 2021.
The plan is to then spin off JOYY's key asset, Singapore-based Bigo - which runs a live streaming platform Bigo Live and short video business Likee, and list it in Asia, likely in Hong Kong, to take advantage of higher valuations, one source added. 
Founded in 2005, JOYY went public on the Nasdaq in 2012. It also runs game-focused social media platform Hago and owns a 16% stake in Chinese videogame streaming site Huya (NYSE:HUYA).
JOYY said in November that it would sell its video-based entertainment live streaming business in China to search engine giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) for about $3.6 billion in cash.
The sale is waiting to be green lit by the antitrust watchdog State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) to reach a final close in the coming weeks, the sources said.
The SAMR nod would also allow JOYY to receive the remaining proceeds of about $1.6 billion from Baidu, they added.

The SAMR did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. 
JOYY shares have plunged 53% in the past six months while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed on the exchange, has dropped 41%.

Investing.com – Williams-Sonoma stock (NYSE:WSM) surged in Thursday’s premarket trading as the home retailer revised its guidance for both the ongoing financial year and beyond, increased its quarterly dividend and expanded its buyback program.
The series of positive announcements followed the company’s second quarter results that had it beat estimates for both revenue and earnings.
Williams-Sonoma said its in-house design capability and digital-first policy worked well for it in the second quarter.
President and Chief Executive Officer Laura Alber said the company is benefiting from people prioritizing their homes and home décor, a shift felt by many retailers as more people work from home and look to soup it with all the office paraphernalia in the comfort of their own surroundings.
The CEO said there is no evidence of growth trends waning, and added that the company continues to grab market share.
William-Sonoma raised its outlook for net revenue growth in 2021 to around 20% from its forecast of a little over 10% given in May.
The home retailer also announced an additional 20% quarterly dividend increase to 71 cents per share, and approved a new $1.25 billion stock buyback, more than double the remaining capacity of the previous plan.
Revenue grew 31% to $1.94 billion with strong growth across all brands and channels. Diluted earnings per share came in at $3.21."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd on Thursday said it was preparing for international travel with countries with high vaccine rates to resume in December, sending shares higher, as it reported a narrower annual loss of A$1.73 billion ($1.26 billion).
The airline, which grounded its international fleet in March 2020 due to closed borders, said it planned to bring back five of its 12 Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A380 super-jumbos from mid-2022 to fly to the United States and Britain, a year earlier than previously forecast. 
It is a hopeful sign for travel in the Asia-Pacific region, where borders are largely closed and international travel is 95% below pre-COVID levels, though the Qantas plan is dependent on government decisions and could be delayed. Shares rose as much as 3.7% to the highest levels since April. 
Australia set a target last month for 80% of adults to be fully vaccinated for a calibrated reopening of its international borders.
At present, more than half the population is locked down due to COVID-19 outbreaks and just over 30% are fully vaccinated, though forecasts say the country could reach 80% by the end of the year as more doses of imported vaccines arrive.
Pending government decisions, Qantas said it expected flights to countries with high vaccine rates like Singapore, Japan, the United States, Britain and hopefully New Zealand to resume from mid-December.
Flights to places with lower vaccination rates like Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and South Africa would restart from April 2022 at the earliest, it added.
""One of the biggest unknowns is the quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travellers entering Australia,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. ""If it's 14 days in a hotel, demand levels will be very low. A shorter period with additional testing and the option to isolate at home will see a lot more people travel.""
The airline forecasts international capacity will reach 30% to 40% of pre-COVID levels in the third quarter and 50% to 70% in the fourth quarter. 
It will not revisit an order for up to 12 Airbus SE A350 planes capable of non-stop Sydney to London flights until borders reopen, Joyce told analysts, adding the earliest the flights could start would be 2024 or 2025. 
The company will also retire two A380s and has pushed back delivery of three Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787-9s and two A321neos by a year.
Qantas reported underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of A$410 million for the 12 months ended June 30, in line with the average figure expected by 11 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
""Overall, with vaccination rates continuing to increase, the outlook beyond FY22 remains positive for Qantas, which remains a key COVID recovery stock,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Anthony Moulder told clients.
The statutory loss of A$1.73 billion, including impairments and restructuring charges, was better than last year's A$1.96 billion loss. 
The airline reported A$3.8 billion of liquidity as of June 30, down A$200 million from April 30.
The domestic market had performed strongly in the fourth quarter when state borders, often closed at times of small COVID-19 outbreaks, had been largely open.
But the country's most populous city, Sydney, has been in lockdown since the end of June and the airline this month said it was temporarily idling about 2,500 employees without pay for at least two months as it cut capacity due to lower demand.
Qantas said recent outbreaks and the suspension of a travel bubble with New Zealand were expected to lower the company's underlying EBITDA by around A$1.4 billion in the first half.

Domestic capacity is expected to rise to 53% of pre-COVID levels in the second quarter and then to around 110% of pre-COVID levels in the second half.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, hurt by deteriorating German economic confidence as Covid cases continue to rise ahead of a key meeting of policymakers from the Federal Reserve and other central banks.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%.
The September German GfK consumer climate index dropped to -1.2 earlier Thursday, falling from a revised -0.4 for August, indicating that sentiment is weakening in Europe’s main growth driver. 
On Wednesday, the Ifo Institute’s influential business climate index fell for the second month in a row, with German manufacturers complaining about supply bottlenecks as well as fretting about rising Covid infection numbers. New infections hit a three-month high in Europe's biggest market, according to data released on Wednesday.
Business confidence is on the way down in the U.K. too: a quarterly labor market survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed more companies complaining about labor shortages than ever before. 
Adding to the sense of gloom was news that the European Union could reimpose restrictions on visitors from the U.S. on Thursday, a move that would weigh heavily on the region’s travel and leisure sector. The EU is upset that the U.S. hasn't reciprocated after Europe loosened restrictions on visiting U.S. tourists earlier in the summer.
European markets received a negative handover from Asia, after South Korea became the first major Asian economy to lift interest rates since the pandemic started. 
That said, investors remained focused on the start of the Jackson Hole symposium later this session. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak on Friday, and what he potentially says about tapering the central bank's bond-buying program could determine market sentiment for weeks to come.

Sales rose 28% to $7.4 billion during the three months to June 30, helped by farmers restocking their inventories of seeds and pesticides after reducing their spending last year as well as booming demand in China.
Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation (EBITDA), increased 25% to $1.2 billion, as Syngenta also sold more of its biological products which boast higher profit margins than conventional chemical sprays.
Syngenta, which competes with Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and U.S. agrochemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) said it had seen strong demand from farmers buying products to deal with climate change.
""We are focused on developing and launching products and services that enable farmers to grow good crops despite drought, heat, flooding, and high wind or other weather extremes,"" said Chief Executive Erik Fyrwald. 
""Our results demonstrate that we are meeting the needs of local growers not only with our sustainable products, but also with our digitally enabled services.""
Among Syngenta's products is a spray to coat grapes and protect them against cold weather snaps, while in China the company has used satellite images to identify where the worst flood damage occurred and then send in targeted drones to spray fungicides.
Sales in China increased by 46% as Syngenta added more Modern Agricultural Platform (MAP) centres, which sell products and provide training, by 87 to 413.

Syngenta, which was bought by state-owned ChemChina for $43 billion in 2017, did not give further details on its planned IPO, which is set to be the biggest flotation in the world this year.
The parent company posted its prospectus on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR market in June, with the intention of floating by the end of 2021. The flotation will value Syngenta Group at around $60 billion including debt, or $50 billion without debt.

The Bank of Korea became the latest central bank to start the shift away from pandemic-era stimulus on Thursday after raising interest rates for the first time in almost three years. Policymakers said the economy was overheating and in a notably hawkish tone warned that they could tighten again.
While the Korean economy is running particularly strong, the hike in rates serves as another reminder for investors that the dialling back of extraordinary loose monetary policy is beginning in earnest. The hike comes as the Federal Reserve begins its annual Jackson Hole symposium. 
Emerging market stocks fell after the announcement, as did markets across Asia -- with a rapid rise in cases of the Delta COVID-19 variant also hitting sentiment.
After climbing to record highs on Wednesday, the mood on global stock markets looked a little more cautious with European and Wall Street futures in the red. Many investors are reluctant to place big bets ahead of the 3-day virtual conference.
No one is expecting the Fed to sound the gun on tapering its asset purchases at the symposium, but investors will be listening closely for Chair Jerome Powell's views on Friday on when to dial back the stimulus as the economy recovers all its lost output from the pandemic and inflation rises.
Elsewhere, the dollar was little changed and stood at one-week lows. The safe-haven greenback had been catapulted to a multi-month high last week on nerves about the global economy. 
Oil prices dipped after three days of gains, although the Brent crude price was firmly above $72 a barrel.

947,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 02:06AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; German Consumer Confidence Weakens,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Thursday, hurt by deteriorating German economic confidence, while investors take a cautious stance ahead of a key meeting of policymakers from the Federal Reserve and other central banks.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
The September German GfK consumer climate index dropped to -1.2 earlier Thursday, falling from a revised -0.4 for August, indicating that sentiment is weakening in Europe’s main growth driver. 
On Wednesday, the Ifo Institute’s influential business climate index fell for the second month in a row, with German manufacturers complaining about supply bottlenecks for intermediate products in manufacturing as well as fretting about rising Covid infection numbers. New infections hit a three-month high in Europe's biggest market, according to data released on Wednesday.
Business confidence is on the way down in the U.K. too: a quarterly labor market survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed more companies complaining about labor shortages than ever before. 
Adding to the sense of gloom was news that the European Union could reimpose restrictions on visitors from the U.S. on Thursday, a move that would weigh heavily on the region’s travel and leisure sector. The EU is upset that the U.S. hasn't reciprocated after Europe loosened restrictions on visiting U.S. tourists earlier in the summer.
European markets received a negative handover from Asia, after South Korea became the first major Asian economy to lift interest rates since the pandemic started. The Bank of Korea raised its base rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%, and suggested that further hikes were on the way. 
That said, investors remained focused on the start of the Jackson Hole symposium later this session. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak on Friday, and what he potentially says about tapering the central bank's bond-buying program could determine market sentiment for weeks to come.
In corporate news,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is likely to be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that U.S. authorities are investigating the German lender's asset management arm DWS Group  (DE:DWSG) after its former head of sustainability said the firm overstated how much it used sustainable investing criteria to manage its assets. DWS stock had hit an all-time high earlier this week.
Staying in the sector,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) announced Thursday that it will invest more than 30 billion rupees ($400 million) in its India unit to expand its operations in the country.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell Thursday, correcting after the biggest three-day gain since March, with mounting Covid-19 cases, fuelled by the highly transmissible delta variant, continuing to threaten the global demand recovery in the second half of the year.
That said, the picture in the U.S. looks more promising. Crude inventories in the largest consumer in the world fell last week for a third consecutive week while overall fuel demand increased to the most since March 2020, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $67.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $70.94. Both contracts have risen by around 10% over the last three days.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,787.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1768.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>",Column-Wall Street boom or bubble? Don't blame it all on the Fed: Jamie McGeever,"By Jamie McGeever
(Reuters) - Wall Street is screeching to yet another all-time high, just as the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium is set to address wealth inequality and the central bank's role in fueling asset price inflation is once again coming under harsh scrutiny.
It is undeniable that trillions of dollars of asset purchases and years of official interest rates of zero and 10-year bond yields barely above 1% have boosted stock prices.
But the significance of Fed actions are overstated.
The tech-heavy composition of Wall Street, which benefits more from low interest rates and plain old stronger economic growth, are adding fuel to the U.S. stock surge. And the Fed's large balance sheet expansion is nowhere near the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan's.
Look no further than Wall Street: The S&P 500 has more than doubled from its COVID low of March last year, chalking up 51 record highs this year.
According to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina, only 1964 and 1995 had more than 50 new highs by the end of August. He reckons the S&P 500 could make 78 new highs this year, eclipsing the all-time record of 77 set in 1995.
On a 12-month forward earnings valuation basis, the S&P 500 earlier this year was its most expensive since 1999, just before the tech bubble burst. This price/earnings ratio has since drifted lower. But it is still above 20, which is unfamiliar territory for most of the last two decades.
Official interest rates and ultra-low benchmark bond yields make investing in profitable, cash-generating companies an attractive proposition. To some investors desperate for return, riskier stocks are a no-brainer.
Many argue there is a natural consequence of the Fed doubling the size of its balance sheet to $8.3 trillion since the pandemic outbreak.
As a share of GDP, that is now around 40%.
With stocks and other financial assets mostly in the hands of society's better off, critics say U.S. monetary policy is widening the gap between rich and poor and directly exacerbating wealth inequality.
The world's second and third largest central banks, meanwhile, have also ramped up their pandemic-fighting asset purchases. Their balance sheets, as a share of GDP, are far bigger than the Fed's. Yet stock markets and valuations in the euro zone and Japan are nowhere near as high.
    ""The commonly held narrative centers on the Fed, and if everyone believes that, then it is self-reinforcing,"" said Meb Faber, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cambria Investments in El Segundo, California.
""But there is a limit as to how far you can extrapolate that.""
The ECB has grown its balance sheet to $9.5 trillion since the outbreak of the pandemic. The ECB's balance sheet is now worth more than 60% of euro zone GDP.
Similarly, the Bank of Japan has grown its balance sheet by $1.4 trillion since March 2020 to $6.6 trillion, around 120% of GDP.
Yet the euro Stoxx 50 is up 'only' around 65% from the COVID low, and is still 23% below its record high from March 2000. Euro stocks' 12-month forward price/earnings ratio is around 16.
Japan's Topix is up 55% from the COVID low and has a forward multiple of around 13.
Both figures, again, are significantly below their U.S. equivalents, suggesting factors other than central bank largesse are behind Wall Street's surge.
For one, the U.S. equity market is far more tech- and digital-heavy than its global peers.
A world of zero interest rates benefits tech companies disproportionately because a low discount rate inflates future cash flows for companies where cutting edge innovation is likely to fuel faster growth. By any measure, the big five tech 'FAANG' stocks - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - dominate Wall Street. They have risen more than three times the broader S&P 500 in the last five years and their $7 trillion market cap is 21% of the whole index.
Another is good old-fashioned economic growth.
Some of the more bullish U.S. forecasts have been trimmed recently, but the International Monetary Fund expects 7.0% GDP growth in the United States this year, 4.6% in the euro zone, and just 2.8% in Japan.
On top of that, Corporate America is motoring along nicely.

LPL Financial's Detrick notes that some 85% of S&P 500 companies posted second quarter earnings beats. And 2021 consensus earnings per share estimates are for a 43% jump from last year.
""The Fed backstop helps explain why people are willing to pay higher multiples. But higher earnings are higher earnings, and that justifies a lot. Investors still see better opportunity in the U.S., and are willing to pay that premium,"" he said.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 11:05PM ET</span>",Pfizer seeks U.S. approval for COVID vaccine booster,"(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc on Wednesday said a booster dose of its two-shot COVID-19 vaccine spurs a more than threefold increase in antibodies against the coronavirus, as the company seeks U.S. regulatory approval for a third injection. 
The drugmaker and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) aim to complete the submission for use of booster shots in people aged 16 and over by the end of this week.
The U.S. government has said it was gearing up https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-begin-offering-covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-september-2021-08-18 to roll out the third shot of vaccines from both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc from mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decide that boosters are needed.
That eight-month gap is likely to be narrowed to six months, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
A committee of outside advisors to the CDC is scheduled to meet on Monday to review clinical data.
Pfizer said 306 people given a third dose of its vaccine between five and eight months after their second shot showed levels of neutralizing antibodies that were 3.3 times the levels seen after their second shot.
The study, details of which have not yet been published, also found that side effects of a third shot were similar to second-dose reactions, including mild to moderate fatigue and headache, the company said.
Scientists continue to debate https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/scientists-question-evidence-behind-us-covid-19-booster-shot-drive-2021-08-19 whether waning antibody levels mean that COVID vaccine boosters need to be given widely, but some countries are moving ahead.
Israel began rolling out boosters at the beginning of August to older citizens and this week expanded the drive to people as young as 30, saying the shots were helping https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-show-signs-taming-delta-2021-08-24 to increase protection against the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
U.S. President Joe Biden has said, ""It's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that may arise.""
However, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-says-no-conclusive-data-yet-need-covid-19-booster-shot-2021-08-25/#:~:text=Aug%2025%20(Reuters)%20-%20The,vaccine%20booster%20shot%20is%20inconclusive the data on the benefits and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is inconclusive. 
The health agency called for a delay in rolling out booster shots and a goal of higher vaccination rates in countries where many had not received a first or second shot. 
On Monday, U.S. regulators granted full approval to Pfizer's two-dose vaccine, which has been available up until now under emergency use authorization. 
The approval spurred some local governments, such as New York City and the state of New Jersey, as well as the U.S. military and some companies, to mandate vaccines.
A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not currently authorized for broad use in the United States. 

However, under the amended emergency use authorization, a third dose was authorized for administration to individuals at least 12 years of age who were immunocompromised.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they intend to file the data with the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities around the world in coming weeks.

TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp is in talks with at least four global private equity firms including KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc to seek their ideas for its new strategy, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Bain Capital and Canadian investment firm Brookfield have also been tapped by the scandal-hit Japanese conglomerate's strategic review committee to put together and submit their ideas for Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY), the sources said.
The latest process is not meant to formally solicit buyout bids for the overall company or some of its assets, and it's not immediately clear whether the engagement with buyout firms will result in formal offers in the future.
The step, however, indicates that Toshiba is engaging with potential bidders since shareholders ousted its chairman in June after the company was found to have colluded with the Japanese government to put pressure on foreign investors https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/independent-probe-says-toshiba-agm-last-year-was-not-fairly-managed-2021-06-10.
After the chairman's ouster, Toshiba, which has many lines of business and units and operates in several jurisdictions, launched a full review of its current assets, and also pledged to engage with potential strategic and financial investors.
""As announced, Toshiba's strategic review committee is considering and discussing a wide range of initiatives without delay,"" Toshiba said in a statement to Reuters.
Toshiba, which had a market valuation of about $19 billion as of Wednesday, ""plans to present the achievements when we announce the new business plan in October"", it said, but declined to comment further.
Spokespersons at Bain, Blackstone, KKR and Brookfield declined to comment.
The sources declined to be identified as the talks were private.
At an earnings briefing this month, Toshiba Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said the company https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-toshiba-results-idCAKBN2FD0E6-OCATC had been ""vigorously engaged in dialogue not only with shareholders but also with financial and strategic investors.""
He also said that the company was open to take private bids although it had not received any offers since a $20 billion takeover https://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-ma-idCNL1N2MD0J4 bid from CVC Capital Partners, which was subsequently dismissed in April as lacking details. 
Toshiba's previous CEO left in April https://www.reuters.com/business/toshiba-says-discuss-top-management-issues-wednesday-2021-04-13/#:~:text=TOKYO%2C%20April%2014%20(Reuters),Brookfield%20are%20also%20planning%20offers over controversy about CVC's buyout offer.
Bain, Brookfield, and KKR had earlier weighed potential bids https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bain-capital-weighing-bid-take-toshiba-private-sources-2021-04-21 to take Toshiba private. The conglomerate at that time had said it believed being publicly traded provided a ""capital structure suitable for enhancing long term value creation"".
Toshiba's move to talk with the private equity funds has puzzled some investors who have questioned why the company has not started an official process to elicit bids.
In June, an investigation concluded Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year's shareholders meeting - a finding that put governance at Japan Inc under the spotlight.

Toshiba, whose products range from escalators to seweverage, remains one of Japan's few manufacturers of nuclear power reactors and makes defence equipment, meaning any sale of the company would need government approval.
Shares of Toshiba opened up 3% on Thursday before giving up half of the gains in late morning trade.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 09:55PM ET</span>","Kroger plans for 1 million Covid-19 booster shots a week, including in nursing homes","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grocery chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co is gearing up to administer 1 million COVID-19 booster shots a week once they are available to the general public, and plans to offer vaccines in nursing homes for those who cannot go to its stores.
The U.S. government is planning to make COVID-19 vaccine booster shots widely available from Sept. 20 to Americans if U.S. health regulators give the go-ahead. Only people who are immunocompromised have been eligible for booster shots since early this month. 
Retailers including Kroger, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are likely to play a role in administering the booster shots. 
Colleen Lindholz, president of Kroger Health, told Reuters in an interview that about 100 of its U.S. locations would have dedicated workers providing vaccinations all day long.
Lindholz said the targeted 1 million shots a week would be twice the rate at which it had given first and second doses of the vaccine at the height of the pandemic.
Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by revenue, also told Reuters it plans to provide shots in long-term care facilities. CVS and Walgreens gave most of the first and second doses of the vaccines in those facilities.
""When the vaccine first came out, we were not included in the long-term care facility deployment, but it's great this time that we can be a part of that,"" Lindholz said. ""We've reached out to facilities that we already deliver prescriptions to, or where we've done flu shot clinics in the past.""
A U.S. health official said the government is planning for long-term care facilities to offer COVID-19 vaccine boosters through their usual pharmacy partners or new partners.
CVS CEO Karen Lynch said in an early August interview that if boosters are approved, the company plans to be one of many pharmacies offering them in long-term care facilities.
Kroger expects the bulk of the shots to be administered around the end of November through to January, coinciding with the holiday shopping season.
""We know how chaotic that will be with the holidays and so we're doing all we can to work with the CDC and Advisory Council on Immunization Practices to really influence kind of bumping that up - but obviously that's not our decision,"" Lindholz said.

The CDC did not comment specifically on Kroger. CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said that it has asked pharmacy partners to plan based on the idea that individuals would be eligible for boosters starting eight months after they received their second vaccine dose, subject to FDA authorization and a CDC committee recommendation on the interview. 
Scientists and public health officials have yet to agree that a third booster dose is needed and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said more first doses should be given around the world before wealthier nations start boosters.

The business software maker's revenue has gone from strength to strength over the past year, with the rise of automation and artificial intelligence likely to keep that momentum going even as vaccine rollouts gather force and offices reopen.
A slew of acquisitions, including workplace messaging app Slack, has helped Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) fend off competition from legacy players like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and German competitor SAP.
""Our Customer 360 platform is now fueled by a herd of unicorns perfectly designed for this all-digital world,"" Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said in a statement. 
Revenue in the second quarter ended July 31 rose 23% to $6.34 billion, surpassing estimates of $6.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.48 per share versus estimates of 92 cents.

San Francisco, California-based Salesforce forecast third-quarter fiscal 2022 revenue between $6.78 billion and $6.79 billion, above estimates of $6.66 billion. 
It expects profit between 91 cents and 92 cents per share, compared with expectations of 82 cents.

The probes, by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, are in early stages, the newspaper said https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-authorities-probing-deutsche-banks-dws-over-sustainability-claims-11629923018?mod=latest_headlines, citing sources. 
A DWS spokesperson told Reuters the firm does not comment on litigation or regulatory matters. 
Deutsche Bank and a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on the WSJ report, while an SEC spokesperson said: ""The SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.""

956,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 08:20PM ET</span>",Global stocks set for a correction as rally fizzles: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The blistering rally in global stocks is nearly over, any further gains will be limited and a correction is likely by the end of the year, a Reuters poll of analysts found.
Global stocks have recovered by more than 90% from the troughs hit during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the MSCI world equity index that tracks shares in 50 countries. 
But the rally is struggling to maintain its pace.
The spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and the U.S. Federal Reserve's pending plans to taper its asset purchases are likely to leave equity markets exposed to turbulence over the coming months.
""The positive earnings season catalyst now behind us means some of the macro negativity is spilling over into equities,"" Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in London, said.
""Medium-term though, resilient economic/earnings growth and excess liquidity are likely to remain the dominant market drivers, in our opinion. This should continue to feed the 'buy the dip' mentality, although investors may stay on a wait and see mode for now, given the lack of meaningful correction in the past 12 months.""
Last week, world stocks suffered their biggest fall since June but have recovered from nearly all of those losses.
Still, nearly two-thirds of analysts who answered an additional question - 66 of 107 - said a correction in global equity markets by end-year was likely. The remaining 41 said unlikely.
""The fundamental situation is still very supportive even if markets have rejoiced and risen with vigour. Nevertheless the strongest economic momentum is peaking, which leads to a somewhat more uncertain terrain,"" Tomas Hildebrandt, senior portfolio manager at Evli Bank in Helsinki, said.
""Will the levelling growth be enough for markets?"" he asked.
STIMULUS CAN'T LAST FOREVER
Nearly all of the 17 indices polled were forecast to retain the double-digit gains made so far this year, according to the median views of over 250 equity analysts taken Aug 11-24.
However, a still-uncertain outcome for $3.5 trillion of proposed fiscal spending in the United States and the threat of higher inflation forcing central banks to dial back stimulus measures are likely to dent the risk-on sentiment that has been in play.[ECILT/US]
""The market is being driven now by huge amounts of government stimulus and low rates. But that can't last forever,"" Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust in Atlanta, said.
All but two indices were forecast to trade around current levels or gain less than 4% by the end of this year, that despite analysts upgrading their expectations for nearly all of the equity bourses from a May poll across the polling horizon.
Despite global central banks preparing the ground to end stimulus measures enacted at the height of the pandemic, analysts expected corporate earnings to hold up, underscoring the ongoing recovery in the global economy.
Nearly 90% of analysts - 97 of 110 who answered an additional question - said corporate earnings over the next 12 months will rise. While seven expected them to stay the same, the remaining six said earnings will fall.
If analysts projections are realised, only Japan's Nikkei index was forecast to outperform this year's expected gains in 2022. [EPOLL/JP]
The benchmark S&P 500 index, which hit another record high on Tuesday, its 50th so far this year, was forecast to end the year around the same levels and then gain another 5% by end-2022.[EPOLL/US]
Median projections also found a rally in emerging market equities will peter out by early next year. [EPOLL/BR][EPOLL/IN]
""We suspect low yields were a key factor supporting the gains in equity market valuations last year, which boosted EM stock prices,"" Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics in London, said.

""We don't expect particularly large gains in EM equities over the next few years, even as their economies recover from the effects of the pandemic.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government on Wednesday said it would work with industry to hammer out new guidelines to improve the security of the technology supply chain, as President Joe Biden appealed to private sector executives to ""raise the bar on cybersecurity.""
At White House meetings with Biden and members of his Cabinet, executives from Big Tech, the finance industry and infrastructure companies said they would do more about the growing threat of cyber attacks to the U.S. economy.
“The federal government can't meet this challenge alone,” Biden told the masked executives in the East Room, telling them, ""You have the power, the capacity and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.""
After the meeting, the White House said the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would work with industry and other partners on new guidelines for building secure technology and assessing the security of technology, including open source software. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google, Travelers (NYSE:TRV), and Coalition, a cyber insurance provider, among others, committed to participating in the new NIST-led initiative.
Cybersecurity has risen to the top of the agenda for the Biden administration after a series of high-profile attacks on network management company SolarWinds Corp, the Colonial Pipeline company, meat processing company JBS and software firm Kaseya. The attacks hurt the United States far beyond just the companies hacked, affecting fuel and food supplies.
""We have a lot of work to do,"" Biden said, citing both ransomware attacks and his push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold Russian-based cyber gangs responsible, and the need to fill nearly half a million public and private cybersecurity jobs.
The guest list included Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc CEO Sundar Pichai and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Chief Executive Arvind Krishna.
After the meeting, Amazon said it would make its cybersecurity training available to the public for free, and it would give multi-factor authentication devices to some cloud computing customers, starting in October.
Microsoft said it will invest $20 billion over five years, a four-fold increase from current rates, to speed up its cyber security work, and make available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state and local governments to help keep their security systems up to date.
IBM said it will train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over three years and will partner with historically black colleges and universities to create a more diverse cyber workforce. 
Google said it was devoting $10 billion to cybersecurity over the next five years, but it was not immediately clear what if any of the figure represented new spending. It also said it would help 100,000 Americans earn industry-recognized digital skills certificates that could lead to high-paying jobs.
Vishaal Hariprasad, CEO of Resilience Cyber Insurance Solutions, told Reuters his company would work with the government on setting clear standards for cybersecurity, and would require policy holders to meet those standards.
""So, if a company is willing to adhere to the minimum standards, they'll have insurance, and if not, they'll have to identify those gaps so they can get to that baseline,"" he said.
""It's not just about getting our companies safer, but also ensuring that we're doing something to address the bad guys.""
Congress is weighing legislation on data breach notification laws and cybersecurity insurance industry regulation, historically viewed as two of the most consequential policy areas within the field.

Executives for energy utility firm  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) also attended the event.
The event featured top cybersecurity officials from the Biden administration, including National Cybersecurity Director Chris Inglis and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

(Reuters) - Google will tap Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd to supply the 5G modem for its next flagship Pixel smart phone, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, signaling the first win for the Korean firm in a U.S. market dominated by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
Earlier this month, Google disclosed that it has designed its own processor chip to power its new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro high-end phones, ending its complete reliance on Qualcomm, which will still supply chips for the lower-priced Pixel 5A. 
Nikkei Asia earlier reported Samsung (KS:005930) will manufacture the processor for Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters Samsung will also supply the 5G modem technology. 
Samsung's move to provide the Pixel's modem technology is important because the Korean firm is one of only three companies in the world capable of making 5G modems that connect devices to wireless data networks. The others are Qualcomm, the market leader by a wide margin, and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc.
Samsung widely uses its Exynos modem technology in its own flagship smart phones in Asia and Europe. But it has long relied on Qualcomm to provide modems for U.S. versions. 
That is in part because Qualcomm has a technology lead in a variant of 5G networking called millimeter wave, which provides the fastest speeds available with the new networks. To date, all smart phones released in the United States - including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone - have used Qualcomm chips to tap millimeter wave networks. 
Samsung told Reuters its new modem technology was capable of millimeter wave networking, and Google said its new phones will support millimeter wave networks as previous versions did, though neither company would comment directly on whether they are working together on the new Pixel.

Winning Google's Pixel business gives Samsung its first big chance to show off its chipmaking skills to the wider phone industry, which has long been wary of buying a key component from a fierce rival, said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research. The Korean firm has never before sold its 5G modem chip technology to an outside company.
Qualcomm in a statement said it retained its technology lead because its millimeter wave technology relied on other chips in addition to the modem. ""A modem is not enough to support millimeter wave in phones,"" Qualcomm said.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld the jury convictions of Insys Therapeutics Inc founder John Kapoor and four other company officials, over their roles in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe addictive opioids and defraud insurers into paying for them.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled 3-0 that ""unalloyed greed"" drove the defendants to market the fentanyl spray Subsys to ""pill mill"" doctors, who would then prescribe it to patients with no medical need.
In a 138-page decision, Circuit Judge Bruce Selya wrote that Insys and Kapoor, who had been chief executive, deserved ""great credit"" for developing Subsys to treat cancer pain, but in the pursuit of profit ""turned what should have been a blessing into a curse.""
Kapoor, 77, was convicted in 2019 and is serving a 5-1/2-year prison sentence.
He remains the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive convicted for helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-states-rush-meet-deadline-join-26-billion-opioid-settlement-2021-08-19.
His co-defendants Michael Gurry, Sunrise Lee, Joseph Rowan and Richard Simon were sentenced to terms of one to 2-3/4 years. A lower court judge had set aside some of the jury findings, but the appeals court restored the original verdicts.
""This decision is a decisive win that vindicates the jury's verdict and preserves a just outcome for the defendants and the victims,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell in Boston said in a statement.
Kapoor's lawyer declined to comment. Lee's lawyer Peter Horstmann said ""there are no words to adequately express my displeasure with the court’s opinion."" Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors said Insys used sham ""speaker programs,"" ostensibly to educate the medical field, as a means to pay bribes and kickbacks to doctors who prescribed Subsys, often to non-cancer patients.

Kapoor also directed efforts to defraud insurers that were reluctant to pay for Subsys, prosecutors said.
Fentanyl is up to 100 times stronger than morphine. Insys, based in Chandler, Arizona, filed for bankruptcy in 2019.

BANGALORE/SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazil's Nubank is seeking a valuation in its planned U.S. initial public offering that would push the eight-year-old fintech past the $55.4 billion value of the country's top traditional lender, two sources familiar with the matter said.
In a recent funding round led by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, Nubank was valued at $30 billion. With 40 million clients in Latin America, Nubank is the latest of several fast-growing financial services companies - often serving customers overlooked by banks - grabbing investors' attention. 
If Nubank is listed at a market cap greater than Itau Unibanco Holding SA's $55.4 billion, it would vault into the ranks of the world's largest fintechs, ahead of recently listed  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), for example.
One source said that in recent weeks Nubank's bankers have pitched a valuation of as much as $100 billion. But the source said the Brazilian fintech unicorn was unlikely to be valued so highly at the time it goes public.
Nubank declined to comment on the expected valuation.
Nu Pagamentos, as Nubank was formally known, ended 2020 with a loss of 230 million reais and a loan book of roughly 18 billion reais. In the first quarter it managed to turn a profit, with net income of 6.8 million reais ($1.30 million), according to Brazil's central bank.
Last year, mammoth Itau posted 18.5 billion reais in profit, or a return on equity of 14.5%, despite the pandemic. Its loan book totaled 870 billion reais. 
In a sign of growth potential, Nubank has already issued more debit cards than Itau, luring many clients who had avoided traditional bank accounts. Nubank has also embarked on a wider regional expansion encompassing Mexico and Colombia. 
According to a ranking by CBInsights, Nubank is the seventh most valuable unicorn worldwide, behind fintechs Stripe, Klarna and Revolut.

Nubank has hired investment banking units of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) to help lead its United States.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street gained ground again on Wednesday, with chipmakers and financials helping to push the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record closing highs as investors look to the upcoming Jackson Hole Symposium for assurances that Federal Reserve's timeline for policy tightening remains intact.
With few negative catalysts to sour the risk-on sentiment, all three major U.S. indexes ended the session modestly higher.
""Positive news on vaccination approvals, and expectations that the Fed won’t shock markets at Jackson Hole, are helping to keep equity prices higher,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York, who added ""it's a very quiet market as many investors are sitting on the beach this week."" 
Rising U.S. Treasury yields boosted rate sensitive financials, and sectors that stand to gain most from economic revival - smallcaps, chips and transports - were outperforming the broader market.
Days after the Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, companies and institutions are moving toward either mandated inoculation, or penalization for those who forego the shot.
The Pentagon and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are the latest to enact such measures, with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and others potentially following suit.
For an interactive graphic on global vaccine deployment and new infection rates, click here.
The session marked the S&P 500's 51st record high close so far this year.
Analysts polled by Reuters, however, see the stock market staying rangebound for the remainder of 2021, with the S&P 500 ending the year little changed as the pandemic recovery, along with corporate earnings growth, lose steam.
""Following a long run, equity indexes have cooled off as the next engine of growth is unclear,"" Carter at Lenox Wealth Advisors added. ""Fiscal and monetary stimulus may have lost their oomph to push markets higher still.""
Tame economic data, including flat new orders for core capital goods, reinforced the notion that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is unlikely to hint at a shortened timeline for policy tightening at the virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, due to get underway on Friday. 
""(The) expectation is that Fed won't scare markets, and will announce only a cautious tapering,"" Carter said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.24 points, or 0.11%, to 35,405.5, the S&P 500 gained 9.96 points, or 0.22%, to 4,496.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.06 points, or 0.15%, to 15,041.86.
Financials were the clear winners among 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, gaining more than 1%. Healthcare stocks suffered the largest percentage decline.
Chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) rose 1.9% and 1.2%, respectively, and along with mega-cap growth stocks Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), provided the biggest boost to the Nasdaq.
 Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) tumbled 17.6% after the department store operator posted a 6% decline in quarterly revenue from pre-pandemic levels.
Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) Inc announced a special dividend and raised its annual sales and profit forecast, sending its shares surging 13.3%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 125 new highs and 33 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.29 billion shares, compared with the 9.00 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 03:55PM ET</span>",Delta Air Lines to add $200 monthly health insurance charge for unvaccinated staff,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines on Wednesday said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not be vaccinated against COVID-19.
The move to add a surcharge to health insurance contributions is the latest tactic by corporate America to push employees to get the shots to fight the pandemic.
A number of U.S. companies, including Delta competitor United Airlines, have mandated shots for their employees to protect their operations from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has especially hit parts of the country with lower vaccination levels.
President Joe Biden has also urged private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated.
Hours after Delta Air announced the surcharge, Canadian rival Air Canada said https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/air-canada-mandates-covid-19-vaccination-all-employees-2021-08-25 workers who are not vaccinated by Oct. 30 will face termination or be sent on unpaid leave. It has also made full vaccination a condition of employment for new employees. 
Surging coronavirus infections have clouded the outlook for airline companies. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/american-airlines-warns-august-revenue-rising-covid-19-cases-hit-bookings-2021-08-25 on Wednesday its August revenue was trending below its internal forecast due to a slowdown in bookings and a rise in cancellations.
The comments came two weeks after Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) issued a profit warning https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/southwest-airlines-says-may-not-be-profitable-third-quarter-2021-08-11, citing the impact of the Delta variant on its business. 
Shares of U.S. airline companies, however, have risen in the past two days on hopes that Monday's full approval of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration would drive up the vaccination rate and slow down new infections.
In a staff memo, Delta Air Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the monthly surcharge would take effect on Nov. 1. He said the surcharge is necessary to address the financial risk the Atlanta-based airline faces from the decision to not vaccinate.
Wade Symons, partner and regulatory resources group leader at global consulting firm Mercer, reckons U.S. companies have reached a ""tipping point"" for taking stricter measures to motivate employees to get vaccinated.
""We anticipate more companies will announce vaccine mandates and surcharges in the coming weeks,"" he said.
The firm's data shows a quarter of U.S. employers with workforces of 500 or more charge employees extra for company-sponsored healthcare plans if they use tobacco.
Delta Air did not say whether its employees were subject to any other surcharges.
PROOF OF INOCULATION
A Delta Air spokesperson said the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost the company $40,000 per person. The surcharge would apply to the entire workforce and proof or documentation of vaccination will be needed to avoid it, the spokesperson said.
Chris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said the union does not intend to oppose the proposed surcharge because it would not affect the healthcare plan it has negotiated with the airline for its members.
But since most of the pilots are not covered by the union-negotiated plan, Riggins said they would see an increase in their healthcare costs if they decide to remain unvaccinated.
In the memo, Bastian said 75 percent of Delta Air's workforce has been vaccinated. However, all the employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated, he said.
While Delta had refrained from making the shots mandatory for its staff, its latest move was in sharp contrast to the policy being pursued by rivals such as American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are ""strongly encouraging"" their employees to get vaccinated. 
American Airlines is offering vaccinated employees an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through its employee recognition platform.
Bastian said unvaccinated Delta employees will be required to wear masks in all indoor settings, effective immediately.
Any employee in the United States who is not fully vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test every week. The mandatory testing will start on Sept. 12.

Those who test positive for the virus will be required to isolate and remain out of the workplace, Bastian said. 
The company will offer COVID-19 pay protection starting Sept. 30 only to fully vaccinated employees who are experiencing a breakthrough infection, he said.

The move by Canada's largest carrier was in line with a government mandate that workers in the transportation sector be vaccinated by the end of October and follows similar moves by other major companies, including United Airlines.
Workers who are not vaccinated by Oct. 30 will face termination or be sent on unpaid leave, Air Canada said. It has also made full vaccination a condition of employment for new employees.

However, the carrier will accommodate workers who cannot be vaccinated for reasons such as medical conditions. 
Earlier in the day, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not vaccinate against COVID-19.

There weren’t many negative headlines to dampen stocks, despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus potentially disrupting the recovery. The S&P reached above 4,500 for the first time.
Investors were looking to later this week, when officials of the Federal Reserve meet in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and could discuss the future of bond buying by the central bank. 
Rising U.S. Treasury yields helped financial stocks as banks especially benefit from the extra profit cushion on their loans. Chips and transport stocks also rose. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Discount earnings
 Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR)is expected to announce second-quarter earnings per share of $1.02 on revenue of $6.44 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Retailers have beaten expectations in the recent quarter despite difficult comparisons to last year.
2. More retailer earnings
Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) is seen posting revenue of $4.11 billion and earnings per share of 45 cents for the second quarter. Clothing sellers have seen a boost from the back-to-school and back-to-office trends in the last few weeks. Analysts will be listening for any sign the spread of the Delta variant has put a damper on shopping.
3. Pandemic darling
 Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON)was a huge winner last year as people were forced to exercise from home because gyms were shut down. The question has been whether it and other pandemic darlings can keep the momentum going. It is seen booking a loss per share of 44 cents on revenue of $923.52 million in its fourth quarter.

The ship will now instead return next year for a season of sailings in Japan, the country where it was stranded in last year following hundreds of infections onboard. At the time, the ship had the biggest concentration of cases outside China.
Carnival did not respond to a request for comment on the reason for the delay in the resumption of cruises by Diamond Princess.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A booster dose of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine sharply increased levels of antibodies against the coronavirus, according to interim data from two small, early-stage trials, the company said in a press release on Wednesday.
J&J has been under pressure to produce evidence of whether a booster shot would increase protection from its one-shot vaccine as the U.S. government prepares to roll out a booster campaign next month. The company plans to discuss the data with U.S. regulators as they devise their booster shot regimens.
The preliminary data announced on Wednesday involved a total of 17 people. It found that a second dose of the J&J vaccine delivered six months after the first resulted in a ninefold increase in binding antibody levels over those seen 28 days after the first dose, the company said.
The company did not release data on whether a second dose of its vaccine increases levels of neutralizing antibodies, which block the virus from entering cells.
Those data are still being analyzed, said Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, but who was not involved in the J&J booster study.
Unlike neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies tag the virus for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Barouch said increases in binding antibodies typically correlate with increases in neutralizing antibodies.
Several countries, including the United States, have begun offering booster doses https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-booster/factbox-countries-weigh-need-for-booster-covid-19-shots-idUKKBN2FP168 to vulnerable individuals, including the immunocompromised, as the Delta variant has spread and some vaccinated people have become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But those campaigns have excluded the J&J shot because there has been no evidence that a booster helps increase vaccine protection.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisers in particular have been waiting for word on how to advise immunocompromised individuals who received the J&J vaccine and are already recommended to receive a booster shot.
According to J&J, the studies released Wednesday showed significant increases in binding antibody responses in participants aged 18-55 and in those 65 years and older who received a lower booster dose.
The study summaries are being submitted to the preprint server MedRxiv in advance of peer review or publication in a journal.
The results were released ahead of long-awaited results from J&J's large, two-dose vaccine trial. A spokesman said those results will be available in the coming weeks.
In July, J&J published interim Phase 1/2a data in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed neutralizing antibodies generated by its vaccine remained stable eight months after immunization with a single dose.
""With these new data, we also see that a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine further increases antibody responses among study participants who had previously received our vaccine,"" Mathai Mammen, head of research and development at J&J's Janssen pharma division, said in a statement.
""We look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination.""

Several scientists have raised concerns that individuals who got the J&J shot would need boosters. One study by a team from New York University found a ""significant fraction"" of blood samples from recipients who got the J&J shot had low neutralizing antibodies against Delta and several other coronavirus variants.
J&J said the company is working with the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization and other health authorities about delivering a booster shot with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

Therefore, we think it may be profitable to invest in prominent real estate industry players  CBRE  Group (CBRE) and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) owing to their solid growth attributes. Read on.The housing market in the United States remained robust in July, with previously owned house sales increasing quicker than the previous month as high prices motivated owners to list more properties. According to the National Association of Realtors, sales went up 2% in July versus the prior month. In addition, sales increased 1.5% in July compared to the same period last year.
A low-interest-rate environment and the desire to relocate to bigger and better locations have fostered high demand in the real estate sector over the past year. The global real estate market is expected to reach $3717.03 billion by 2025, growing at an 8% CAGR.
Investors’ interest in growth stocks is evident in the S&P SPDR 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 21.5% return so far this year. Hence, as investors remain focused on growth stocks that can offer substantial returns this year and beyond, major real estate players CBRE Group Inc.

This, coupled with the Fed’s openness to raising interest rates sooner than expected, should boost the industry’s growth. So, Wall Street analysts expect 360 DigiTech (QFIN) and Patria Investments (PAX) to continue to rally in the near term. Let’s discuss.Even though the prolonged low-interest rate environment and rising uncertainties regarding the pace of global economic recovery are unfavorable for financial services companies, increasing financial transactions and capital market activities have been helping the industry attract increased investor attention lately. This is evidenced by the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLF) 5% gains over the past month compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 1.8% returns.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as early 2023 and recently indicated its willingness to reduce asset purchases before the end of the year, moves that should be a boon for the financial services industry. Moreover, the industry is expected to benefit from the continued integration of advanced technologies. According to a Globe Newswire report, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to hit $22.5 trillion this year.
Given the financial services industry’s promising prospects, Wall Street analysts are highly optimistic about the upside potential of 360 DigiTech, Inc. (QFIN) and Patria Investments Limited (PAX). So, we think it could be worth adding these names to one’s watch list now.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>","Universal Music sees revenue growth, dividend payouts after listing","PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Universal Music Group, which is behind singers such as Justin Bieber and is owned by France's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), expects further revenue growth this year as streaming sales boom and it aims to pay out dividends once it lists in Amsterdam, it said. 
Due to be floated on Sept. 21, the company helps to promote and distribute boyband BTS and singers such as Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande as well as making earnings from rights.
Universal is already valued at around 33 billion euros ($38.80 billion), based on deals struck so far to sell off part of the group to investors including U.S. billionaire William Ackman. Vivendi will spin off 60% of the unit to its own shareholders as part of the process. 
Universal executives said at a capital markets day on Wednesday that they expected 2021 revenue to grow by over 10% at constant currencies, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rising over 20%. 
That would mark a bounce from 2020, when annual sales reached 7.4 billion euros, up 4.7% on a comparable basis. 
The company also said it would pay out half of its profits as dividends in the medium term, although it did not detail when payments would start. 
Vivendi shares turned positive after the disclosures and were up 0.48% at the market close. 
""I believe that we're at the beginning of a new cycle, a new wave of growth,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Lucien Grainge said. 
Universal, which competes with rivals such as Warner and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY), reaps streaming revenues from subscription platforms such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), with royalties flowing back to the artists it represents. 
It overcame a challenge to the music industry's model in the 2000s when online piracy was rife by leaning on paid downloads and subscriptions, which have caught on. 
Physical sales of records have also recovered this year after a blip at the start of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, and Universal is pushing ahead with new models, striking music licensing deals with social media sites such as TikTok or in areas like video games and fitness applications. 
Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, has not ruled out share buybacks as a way to support Vivendi's stock after the Universal initial public offering (IPO), which will see it spin off its big cash cow. 

Vivendi also owns pay-TV group Canal Plus, advertising group Havas and publishing unit Editis.

The case of the 74-year-old Winterkorn -- whom a German magazine report said needs a hip operation -- could be split off from four other Volkswagen executives who also face charges for their role in allowing diesel cars with illegal emissions-masking software to hit the road.
If Winterkorn is not able to take part in the planned start of the trial on Sept. 16 due to health issues then proceedings against the other four will start without him, a court spokesperson said, although no final decision has been taken.
The scandal, which was uncovered by U.S. authorities in 2015, has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in refits, legal fees and settlements, and resulted in a drastic management and strategy overhaul.
A lawyer for Winterkorn has said his client denied the charges.
The trial had been due to start in February but has been repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
According to Manager Magazine, which first reported on the delay, Winterkorn needs a hip operation, which would mean he would only be well enough for a trial by the middle of 2022.

However, if the court waits for the completion of the trial against the other four executives, then the main proceedings against Winterkorn might only start in the second half of 2023.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ:BYND) fell 2.5% Wednesday as Argus downgraded the stock to hold saying that the company’s third-quarter guidance of a 27% to 48% increase in net revenue came in below consensus estimates.
Analyst John Staszak earlier had a buy on the stock
The company, known for its plant-based meat substitutes, estimates its net revenue to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million. The analyst expects Beyond Meat to deliver sales just above the midpoint of this range.
Beyond Meat’s August 5 statement recognized near-term uncertainty related to Covid-19 and its potential impact on retail and foodservice demand levels.
According to Staszak, labor shortages and decelerating revenue growth weighed on the company’s third-quarter guidance.
The analyst said the stock remains a buy in the long-term but said margins could be affected in the near-term.

(GPS) are expected to gain significantly in the coming months. So read on for more insight into these names’ prospects.Many retailers are gearing up for the new school year by offering diversified products and expanding their inventories. Following the CDC’s guidance for reopening U.S. schools this fall, retail stores are expected to see higher demand for back-to-school products. While the rapidly spreading COVID-19 Delta variant is hindering the recovery of in-store sales, retail companies with strong digital channels should be able to maintain or increase their sales in the coming months.
The strong vaccination drive and consumer spending helped unit sales volume for apparel stores and brands in the United States rise 21% in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, as President Biden emphasizes reopening schools full-time this fall and takes policy steps he deems necessary regarding this, back-to-school spending is expected to exceed $100 billion this year.
Given this backdrop, we think established retail stocks Target Corporation (TGT), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX), Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST), and The Gap, Inc. (GPS) could be solid additions to one's portfolio.

(Reuters) - OnlyFans, an online subscription platform known for adult content, on Wednesday scrapped its planned policy that would have prohibited users from posting any material containing ""sexually explicit conduct.""
The sudden reversal, less than a week after the company first announced the ban, is good news for a community of sex workers who have turned to OnlyFans to safely earn money online during the pandemic, but demonstrates the fragility of the so-called creator economy, which has allowed content creators to earn money directly from fans.
""We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change,"" OnlyFans tweeted https:// The company did not immediately respond to questions for more detail about the ""secured assurances.""
The announcement comes after a tumultuous week in which the London-based company said https://www.reuters.com/technology/onlyfans-ban-content-showing-sexually-explicit-conduct-2021-08-19 it would begin prohibiting explicit content in October to comply with the requests of its banking partners and payment providers. Critics quickly accused OnlyFans of turning its back on creators and sex workers who helped the site expand aggressively.
Brian Gross, a publicist and president of BSG PR who represents several adult stars who use OnlyFans, including Maitland Ward and Charlotte Stokely, said OnlyFans' ban reversal is ""obviously good news"" for creators, but the rapid about-face has caused ""trepidation and nervousness.""
""There's always a chance (OnlyFans) can implement the policy again,"" he said. ""I think everyone has to keep one eye open.""
The situation has underscored the need for creators to diversify and maintain a presence on several platforms, Gross said.
OnlyFans, which was founded in 2016 and has 130 million users, boomed during the pandemic as it became one way for creators to earn money by selling content directly to paying subscribers.

The company sought to raise funding at a $1 billion valuation, according to a Bloomberg report, but despite its rapid growth, struggled to attract investors due to its image as a platform for users to sell sexually explicit content.
In an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely said the company was forced to ban pornography on the site and blamed ""unfair"" treatment by banks that made it difficult for the company to pay content creators.

By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ:SAVA) stock plummeted 20% Wednesday even as the company defended itself against allegations questioning its scientific integrity.
The stock had fallen to the day’s low of $80.22 in the session so far but recovered some losses to trade at $94.30, still down by a fifth of its market value at close on Tuesday.
The charges, posted online a day earlier, centered around study data of the biotech company’s treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
Saying “it is important for stakeholders to separate fact from fiction”, Cassava disputed all the 15 claims in a point-by-point rebuttal, labelling each charge as ""fiction"" and each of its replies ""fact.""
Disputing the validity of Cassava’s clinical biomarker data and the integrity of Western Blot Analysis, a ‘statement of concern’ was posted requesting the Food and Drug Administration to halt the current clinical study of simufilam.
Cassava said the biomarker data of Alzheimer’s patients was generated by  Quanterix  (NASDAQ:QTRX), an independent company, and presented at the recent Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.
The company said Western Blot Analysis is foundational to the biotechnology industry and is a standard lab technique used worldwide to detect a protein of interest."
1001,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>","After summer of stock market highs, signs of unease emerge","By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets are heading into September near record highs but the fast-spreading Delta coronavirus variant is making some investors reassess how so-called reflation trades could perform in coming months. 
A raft of indicators from consumer surveys to derivatives suggest that without fresh catalysts markets could be in for a pause or even a reversal over the autumn months. Speculators have also been piling into the dollar, with positioning at its highest in a year.
""Although equity headline indices keep registering new highs, there has been a clear rotation to defensive plays,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, Global Head of FX Strategy at Lombard Odier in Switzerland.
Defensives, which are less vulnerable to swings in the global economic cycle, have outperformed their cyclical rivals of late, he noted. Similarly, high-growth sectors including tech that boomed during lockdowns are doing well again.
Below are five charts highlighting these trends:
1/ IS THE CONSUMER RIGHT?
The gap between how U.S. consumers are feeling and what Wall Street expects is at its widest in at least 13 years. 
Analysts expect profit growth at S&P 500 companies to continue at double-digit rates well into the first half of 2023, Refinitiv data indicates. 
The person on the street is less optimistic. U.S. consumer sentiment has collapsed to a decade-low, according to the closely watched University of Michigan index.
That implies sizeable downward moves in earnings in the months ahead. 
Consumers less confident than Wall Street? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopannykova/Pasted%20image%201629897288075.png 
2/ SLOWER LANE
Recent data indicates that the bulk of the reopening economic boost is past. But fears are also growing of a fourth COVID-19 wave, showing up on Wednesday in Germany's IFO survey, with steep declines in business morale and expectations.
Citi's global economic surprises index -- essentially a gauge of whether data is beating or undershooting forecasts -- turned negative this week for the first time since June 2020. 
Early manufacturing surveys for Europe in August dropped to the lowest since January, consistent with recent softening in the United States and China. 
Stock markets usually falter when U.S. PMIs from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) peak but this has not happened this year, Citi analysts noted.
""Equity markets (outside China) have not yet seen the usual wobble associated with a PMI rollover, so could be vulnerable,"" they wrote, adding that a return to the usual trend ""would imply a 10-15% drop in the S&P or the market going nowhere for the next six months."" 
Economic surprises https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzyykzxpw/Economic%20surprises.JPG 
3/NARROWING MARKETS
Record-high world stocks mask one important fact -- the breadth of the market has narrowed significantly, meaning gains are being driven by fewer constituents.
Back in January, 1,876 constituents of the Nasdaq index were in positive territory while 1,039 stocks ended in the red. But so far in August, 1,457 of the stocks are in positive territory and 1,936 constituents are negative, Refinitiv data shows.
Broad participation in the rally indicates bulls are driving the market, but when the converse happens -- with more losers than gainers -- it can imply the market has peaked and further gains will be harder to come by. 
Narrowing markets https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpommjwwpd/Out%20of%20breadth.JPG 
4/RELATION RETHINK
Reflation bets dominated the first half of the year which meant selling gold and other safe-haven assets and piling into shares such as travel, banking and so-called value stocks that benefit as the economy improves. 
But gold prices have bounced 7% in the past two weeks, after losing 12% since May. Materials, emerging markets, value stocks have all come under pressure in recent weeks. 
reflation trades https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjjxolve/reflation%20trades.JPG 
5/STRETCHED POSITIONS
Despite the Delta worries, investors remain heavily positioned towards more stock market upside -- the U.S. S&P 500's index measuring the ""put-call"" ratio on stocks is near its lowest levels this year. 
Essentially it implies more participants expect the market to rise than to fall.
But retail punters who grabbed headlines in early-2021 with bets on a series of unloved stocks, appear less keen. The AAII survey, which measures individual investors' sentiment, is in bearish territory for the first time since October 2020.

(Reuters) - Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc investors want answers to two questions when the company reports results on Thursday: Will the Delta coronavirus variant drive a new surge in sales, and are customers ready to look past a recall by the exercise bike and treadmill makers?
When it comes to COVID, most analysts say it is too early to predict if the stay-at-home stock will get another pandemic-fueled boost as vaccines could bolster confidence to leave home to work out at gyms. The launch of its new treadmill in the United States next week comes at an opportune time. 
Whether due to Delta or delays in workers returning to the office, use of independent gyms was down by 8% compared with pre-pandemic levels while interest in digital workouts and home equipment rose 21%, according to consulting firm ClubIntel. 
“If the Delta variant continues to delay the return to normality -- and worse yet, if it leads to incremental gym closures come winter time -- I do think that could be a positive catalyst for Peloton,” said James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities. He added that “it's way too early to make that assessment right now.” He downgraded Peloton shares from outperform to neutral on July 14 due partly to uncertain future demand. The stock is down 34% from its high on Jan. 14.
Cowen analyst John Blackledge maintains an outperform rating, noting a survey that suggests consumer attitudes on returning to gyms worsened in July given the rise of the Delta variant, which could drive near-term demand. 
Peloton’s new treadmill, analysts say, is key to its next leg of potential sales growth and putting behind acostly recall of its exercise machines over safety reasons.
Peloton’s shares plummeted more than 15% in May after it recalled its Tread+ treadmill. Peloton initially continued to sell the Tread+ despite multiple injuries and a child’s death in March from being pulled under the machine. 
The lower-priced Tread will debut in the United States for $2,495. It had launched in Canada and the United Kingdom but was recalled in May for a manufacturing problem. Peloton announced it will begin selling the Tread in the United States and the United Kingdom on Aug. 30, and in Germany later this fall. The release comes after Peloton found a fix for faulty screws that caused the touchscreen console on the Tread to fall off. 
""The success of Tread could mark an inflection point, given Peloton to date has relied on the popularity of its Bike and Bike+ products, while treadmills as a category represent a larger market,"" Blackledge added.  
Peloton is expected to report $922 million in revenue for the fourth quarter that ended June 30, up 52% from a year ago, according to an average of analyst estimates based on Refinitiv data. Net income was expected to be a loss of $137.9 million or 45 cents a share, compared with a profit of $89.1 million or 27 cents a share a year earlier.
Its stock was down 0.5% on Wednesday morning.
Although Peloton has suffered some recent supply chain challenges, it may be equipped to handle a potential boost in demand after investing $100 million to expedite overseas and air shipping from its manufacturing facility in Taiwan. The company is also expected to capitalize on its acquisition of equipment manufacturer Precor and is currently building a new productionplant in Ohio, which will open in 2023.   
The company is also expected to announce plans to continue international expansion following its entry into the Australian market in July. According to Loop Capital analyst Daniel Adam, Peloton is just scratching the surface of its possible customer base, with roughly 5.4 million total Peloton members, and 2 million being “connected fitness” subscribers who pay monthly fees in order to use the company’s video workouts and equipment. 
As of 2020, the global gym industry was worth $96.7 billion with more than 184 million gym members in total, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA).

In June, Peloton said it expected to sell three times more units in the quarter, which ended June 30, than in the same period in 2019. 
""We think there is a massive opportunity ahead of us,"" Peloton Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said at an investor conference in early June.

In a memo seen by Reuters, the Pentagon ordered the military to start the process immediately but did not put a specific timeline on when it should be completed. 
Earlier in the week it had said that such a move would be coming. 
The U.S. military has said that around half the U.S. armed forces are already fully vaccinated, a number that climbs significantly when counting only active-duty troops and excluding National Guard and Reserve members.
Vaccination rates are highest in the Navy, which suffered from a high-profile outbreak last year aboard an aircraft carrier. 
Because U.S. service members are generally younger and fitter, relatively few of them have died as a result of COVID-19.
The  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) shot became the first COVID-19 vaccine to be fully approved by the FDA.

The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, provided its full approval for use in people age 16 and older based on updated data from the companies' clinical trial and manufacturing review.
There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>","Canada's Royal Bank, National Bank profits beat estimates on provisions, loans","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) -Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) both beat analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, driven primarily by the release of provisions set aside to cover bad loans. 
Earnings excluding the impact of provisions for both banks rose from a year ago, but Royal Bank's performance was viewed more positively by analysts as it was driven by higher fee income and lower expenses. At National Bank, lower net interest income and increased expenses somewhat eroded the benefit of higher fees.
Both banks benefited from revenue growth in their personal and commercial banking divisions, as a pick-up in lending offset margin challenges. The more modest performances in their wealth management and capital markets businesses were largely expected, although National Bank's disappointed more than Royal Bank's.
On Tuesday, Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia both beat estimates, with the former also posting strong pre-tax pre-provision (PTPP) earnings growth, while the latter's performance was driven almost entirely by lower provisions for credit losses (PCL).
Royal Bank shares rose 1.2% to C$133.60 in morning trading in Toronto, on track for a record close, while National Bank's fell 0.7% to C$99.05. The Toronto stock benchmark was flat.
The outsized positive impact on earnings of the releases of reserves previously set aside to cover bad loans is expected to fade in coming quarters, and markets are focused on loan growth and fee revenues to determine the future health of Canadian banks. 
PTPP earnings at Royal Bank, Canada's biggest lender by market value, rose 6% from a year ago but fell 1% from the prior quarter. PTPP earnings at National Bank, the smallest of the country's Big Six lenders, were 15% higher than a year earlier but flat on the previous quarter. 
Analysts expected PTPP earnings across the country's biggest lenders would fall about 1% from the second quarter. 
While both banks released loan-loss reserves as impairments remained low, Royal Bank's came with some caution. 
""While pandemic-related uncertainty has declined... uncertainty does remain elevated due to a rise in cases of the COVID-19 delta variant,"" Royal Bank's Chief Risk Officer Graeme Hepworth said on an analyst call. 
He added that impaired loan provisions are expected to trend above the bank's long-term average in 2022 as a result, but that this is expected to be offset by releases on performing loans. 

Royal Bank reported adjusted earnings of C$3 a share, up from C$2.23 a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of C$2.71.
National Bank had adjusted income of C$2.36 per share, versus C$1.66 a year earlier. Analysts had expected C$2.13.

Investing.com –  Toll Brothers  stock (NYSE:TOL) gained more than 3% Wednesday as the company said FY22 margins will significantly exceed the strong margins it is projecting for the ongoing fourth quarter.
The maker of luxury homes expects the current quarter’s adjusted home sales gross margin, excluding interest and inventory write-downs, to be 25.6%.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Douglas C. Yearley, Jr. said low mortgage rates, favorable millennial-driven demographics, a decade of pent-up demand, low new home supply, and a tight resale market were all driving the market for luxury housing.
“We expect strong and sustainable demand for our homes in the years to come,” he said.
Net signed contracts in the third quarter rose 35% to approximately $3 billion compared to the prior year period.
Quarter-end backlog, in both dollars and units, were all-time records. Net signed contracts, in both dollars and units, were third-quarter records.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) -Smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp's second-quarter revenue rose a record 64% from a year earlier, it said on Wednesday, announcing the purchase of an autonomous driving startup as it prepares to expand into the competitive market.
Sales reached 87.8 billion yuan ($13.56 billion), up from 53.54 billion a year earlier and beating analyst expectations of 84.53 billion yuan. 
Net income reached 6.32 billion yuan, up 87.4% year on year and above analyst expectations.
U.S. government sanctions against Xiaomi's rival Huawei Technologies effectively crippled the tech giant's smartphone division and has allowed Xiaomi, along with Chinese Android makers Oppo and Vivo, to grow their market shares. 
Xiaomi's share of the global smartphone market grew 83% year-on-year in the quarter, ended in June, according to research firm Canalys. It shipped 52.8 million phones, making it the world's second top-selling brand for the first time in its history, behind Samsung (KS:005930) and ahead of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Domestically, however, the company still ranks behind Oppo and Vivo in terms of raw unit shipments.
On Wednesday Xiaomi also announced that it is acquiring autonomous driving startup Deepmotion for approximately $77.37 million, in a bid to boost its own R&D efforts in the area, the company's President Wang Xiang said. 
In March, Xiaomi announced it would spend $10 billion to enter the electric vehicle sector. The company has yet to formally announce any partnerships or plans for its first model, though public posts on job-searching sites show the company is recruiting talent aggressively.
Last week Reuters reported that China Evergrande Group was in talks to sell its EV unit to Xiaomi. Xiaomi said it has been in touch with various automakers, but it has yet to decide which one to work with. 
The company derives the vast majority of its revenue by selling mobile handsets, but it also makes money by selling online ads and other types of consumer hardware.

Growth in Xiaomi's internet services unit, which makes money primarily by placing ads across various apps, grew 19.1% year-on-year.

Therefore, we believe that under-the-radar pharmaceutical stocks Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX), Kamada (NASDAQ:KMDA), and Opiant Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:OPNT) could deliver excellent returns in the near term. Let’s discuss.With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases worldwide, fueled by the rapid spread of the virus’ Delta variant, the pharmaceutical industry is again in the spotlight. This, along with the growing need for personalized therapies and the treatment of rare diseases, has significantly improved the industry's growth prospects. Investors’ interest in pharmaceutical stocks is evidenced by the Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF’s (PJP) 15.1% returns year-to-date. 
Also, the growing use of advanced technologies and artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discovery and provide life-transforming treatments should further propel the industry’s growth. Consequently, the global pharmaceuticals market is expected to hit $1,700.97 billion in 2025, growing at an 18% CAGR.

1012,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>",Meme Stock Cassava Plunges After Alzheimer’s Data Questioned,"(Bloomberg) -- Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ:SAVA) Inc. plummeted 30% on Wednesday after a lawyer sought to stop studies of the biotech company’s experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. 
A citizen petition from a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement lawyer questioned the quality and integrity of the results from the over 20-year-old company with no products on the market. 
“As a science company, we champion facts that can be evaluated and verified,” Remi Barbier, Cassava’s chief executive officer and founder, said in a statement countering the claims in the request.
The stock had rallied more than 1,080% this year, gaining momentum on day trader enthusiasm for the space following the approval of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB).’s Aduhelm, the first new drug approved for the brain disease in over a decade as well as Cassava’s own trial results.
Lawyer Jordan Thomas of Labaton Sucharow alleged that some of the company’s results appeared to show signs of data manipulation, which Cassava denies. 
In response to the allegations Mayank Mamtani, an analyst with B. Riley Securities, recommended investors buy Cassava shares on weakness, seeing as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already reviewed the company’s data.“To our knowledge, citizen petitions are commonly associated with public endorsement (or lack thereof) of drug effects from experts and medical associations, rather than from law firms representing anonymous clients without disclosing conflict of interest,” he wrote. 
In February, Cassava said its experimental tablet, called simufilam, showed improvement in reasoning and behavior in a trial with less than 100 patients and without a control arm to gauge the impact of a placebo. That came after a data snafu whipsawed the stock last year when Cassava first reported a mid-stage study of simufilam had failed, but was later re-analyzed by a different lab which showed improvements in some biomarkers. 
On Tuesday, the company reached an agreement with U.S. regulators on the trial design for a much larger study which is expected to kick off this year. 
The petition could have some valid points, said Soumit Roy, an analyst with JonesTrading who has the highest price target on Wall Street at $215. But it is also potentially “over-interpreted with excessive digital analysis of figures published 15+ years ago,” he writes in a note to clients. 
“Several of the scientific articles brought into questions were published in reputed journals with rigorous peer review process. We would direct readers to Cassava to get finer details around each published figure,” Roy said.
Bearish bets against the company have risen from a February low and now stand at $576 million, or roughly 13% of the company’s available shares, according to S3 Partners data.
Austin, Texas-based Cassava didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Investing.com –  Campbell Soup  stock (NYSE:CPB) dipped 1.5% on Wednesday on a downgrade by Piper Sandler owing to rising commodity prices, particularly steel.
The brokerage cut its rating on the stock to neutral from overweight and the price target to $43 from $51.
The new target is just 4% higher from the stock’s current price of $41.38.
Analyst Michael Lavery said broad exposure to rising commodity prices, especially steel, is becoming a significant risk to Campbell’s 2022 outlook.
Campbell typically has annual calendar contracts for steel, and Lavery said they have little visibility where 2022 will land.
According to the analyst, the company historically has had relatively modest price-mix gains in its Americas Simple Meal & Beverages -- a 9-year average of +0.5% -- so offsetting these costs may be difficult.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Retailers agree to extend Bangladeshi garment workers' safety pact,"By Ruma Paul and Victoria Waldersee
DHAKA (Reuters) -Major global retailers agreed on a two-year pact with garment workers and factory owners in Bangladesh, extending a pre-existing agreement that makes retailers liable to legal action unless their factories meet labour safety standards.
The statement, signed by the deal's deputy director Joris Oldenziel and representatives for UNI Global Union and IndustriALL Global Union, confirms the content of a copy of the pact, exclusively seen by Reuters earlier on Wednesday.
""This is a legally binding agreement between companies and trade unions to make ready-made garment (RMG) and textile factories safe,"" the statement said.
""The renewed agreement advances the fundamental elements that made the accord successful.""
The original agreement, known as the Bangladesh Accord, was due to expire on Aug. 31. The new version comes into force on Sept. 1. and is named the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry to reflect its wider reach.
Some 200 retailers signed up to the accord in 2013, including retail giants H&M,  Inditex  (MC:ITX), Fast Retailing's Uniqlo, Hugo Boss, and adidas. A list of those that have also signed up to the extension will be made available on Sept. 1, sources said.
A spokesperson for Uniqlo said they had not yet seen the new accord, but they ""generally support a new binding agreement... that has independent oversight and can be expanded to other countries.""
H&M, Inditex, Hugo Boss and adidas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The five-year accord, struck in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 that killed more than 1,100 garment workers, instituted an independent body that held thousands of inspections and banned unsafe factories from supplying its signatory buyers. 
That helped to make some 1,600 factories safer for 2 million workers, labour activists say. 
Under a transition deal agreed in 2018 after the original accord expired, a newly-formed body, the Ready-Made Garments Sustainability Council (RSC), which brings together unions, brands, and factory owners, took over the work of running factory inspections.
However, the RSC did not take over one portion of the accord - the ability for retailers to be tried in court in the country in which they are domiciled if they fail to meet their obligations, including cutting ties with factories that do not meet the accord's standards.
Signatories also agreed to discuss within six months to which countries the accord could be extended, with the aim of establishing it in at least one other country within two years, it said.
Negotiations over the accord's extension stalled in May when U.S. retailers resisted agreeing to the legally-binding aspect of the agreement, sources said.
Retailers, including  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), which did not want to sign the original accord in 2013 formed a parallel alliance with similar functions, but no legal powers of enforcement.

Those leading the talks had hoped to negotiate an extension that U.S. retailers would also be willing to adopt, sources said in May. 
But Walmart told Reuters on Tuesday it was not part of the accord's extension. Target and VF Corp did not respond to requests for comment.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened mixed on Wednesday as the approach Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium deterred the taking of new positions.
Earlier, core durable goods orders for July came in marginally above expectations, but did little to stir the general summer lethargy.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50 points, or 0.1%, at 35,316 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite eked out modest gains of less than 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.
Analysts have pared back their initial expectations that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will signal an early start to the reduction of its bond purchases in his keynote speech at the symposium on Friday. After a string of encouraging labor market data and above-target inflation prints, data have started to show signs of the economy weakening under the latest wave of the pandemic, which has forced many high-profile companies to delay their plans for bringing staff back to the office.
Most analysts expect tapering will be announced in November-December, with rate hikes perhaps in late 2022 or 2023,"" said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for fixed income at Franklin Templeton in a blog post. ""This is a very timid start. If the current monetary policy stance was appropriate when COVID-19 struck over a year ago and the economy was shut down, it can’t possibly be appropriate now that we have vaccines, a strong recovery and record fiscal stimulus.""
The Fed is currently buying bonds at a rate of $120 billion a month.
Among early movers, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) stock stood out with a gain of 17%, after it raised its full-year guidance for the second time this year on the back of a better-than-expected spring quarter. Going in the other direction was Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ:SAVA) stock, which fell 28% after a lawyer asked federal regulators to halt clinical trials of its experimental drug for treating Alzheimer's Disease. The so-called 'statement of concern' cited ""concerns about the quality and integrity of the laboratory-based studies surrounding this drug candidate,"" and referenced ""a long-standing pattern of seemingly intentional data manipulation and misrepresentation in scientific papers and corporate disclosures.""
Cassava rebutted the allegations in a statement of its own. 
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock also fell 17% after failing to live up the expectations stoked by better results this quarter from other department stores such as Macy's (NYSE:M).  
Meme stocks were mixed after a day of wild gains in thin trading on Tuesday. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock was down 5.4%, while AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was down 0.8%. Both were up sharply on Tuesday despite a lack of any fundamental news.
Elsewhere, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock fell 0.4%, despite announcing that early-stage trial results showed that a booster jab of its one-shot Covid-19 vaccine strongly enhanced the body's immunity against the coronavirus."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co will delay bringing most workers back to offices until January, and is still considering whether to require employees to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, the company's chief people officer told Reuters. 
Ford is joining a growing number of large employers that are delaying plans to reopen offices as the Delta variant of the coronavirus sweeps through many countries where the automaker does business. Ford said most office workers in North America, Latin America and International Markets groups will not come back to offices before January. The company is reassessing return to work plans every three to four months.
Kiersten Robinson, Ford's chief people and employee experience officer, said the company has not yet decided whether to join employers and government agencies requiring workers to get coronavirus vaccinations.
Ford has required vaccinations for employees who travel internationally for work. Robinson said the company is still assessing whether a broader mandate is appropriate, how employees would respond and how a vaccine requirement would be adapted to different countries.
""We want to understand the sentiment of employees. What's standing the way of them getting vaccinated voluntarily,"" Robinson said. Employee views - and the access Ford workers have to vaccines - vary around the world, she said. ""It's simplistic to have a one-sized fits all mandate.""
Ford has instituted mask requirements and other policies to limit the spread of coronavirus infections in factories and workplaces where employees cannot do jobs remotely. So far, Robinson said, there have not been major outbreaks at any Ford facilities.
Once Ford employees who are able to work remotely return to offices many will do so only part time, and Ford said it plans to reconfigure many offices for hybrid work arrangements. 

Workers who can do their jobs via videoconference and internet connections could get a new perk once offices reopen. The automaker said it will allow employees to work remotely for up to 30 days a year from within their home country, without being required to report to a Ford site.
Under the guidelines, a Ford office worker in Michigan could choose to work for a month from a resort or a relative's home in Florida, Los Angeles or any other U.S. location.

Let’s find out.Automobile manufacturer Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in Dearborn, Mich., manufactures, markets and services trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles internationally. The company operates through Automotive; Mobility; and Ford Credit segments. Its better-than-expected operating results in its last reported quarter and the solid early demand for its full-sized electric pickup trucks ahead of their launch next year have helped the stock gain 91.1% in price over the past year and 44.8% year-to-date. While the company’s Lincoln brand plans to electrify its portfolio of vehicles by 2030, other global automakers are also racing to shift their traditional gasoline-powered cars to all-electric power.
However, because semiconductor chip shortage could worsen due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases worldwide, the auto manufacturer’s production and sales growth could be hampered in the coming months.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 09:25AM ET</span>","Wall Street's pandemic rally to sputter, strategists warn - Reuters poll","By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street's record highs may be challenged as a sharp recovery of corporate earnings from the coronavirus pandemic loses its edge, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
With pressure building for the U.S. Federal Reserve to taper its massive pandemic-era stimulus, the S&P 500 is likely to end 2021 at 4,500 points, essentially unchanged from its current level, according to the median prediction of over 40 respondents. 
Strategists have historically had poor track records predicting stock market returns, but their forecasts provide a valuable glimpse of sentiment on Wall Street. Wealth managers and strategists in Reuters' previous poll, in May, predicted on average that the S&P 500 would end the year at 4,300, which is about 4% below Monday's close of 4,479.53.
The poll showed strategists on average expecting the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 2021 at 36,000 points, up almost 2% from its current level. 
""The market is being driven now by huge amounts of government stimulus and low rates. But that can't last forever,"" warned Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan.
Second-quarter earnings jumped 95% year-on-year in aggregate for S&P 500 companies as the U.S. economy recovered from lockdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic, with industrials and consumer discretionary surging 678% and 356%, respectively, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, that explosive recovery appears to have already lost its momentum. Analysts on average now see September quarter earnings growing just 30% for S&P 500 companies.
With investors on social media fueling trading frenzies in so-called meme stocks like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME), and with the S&P 500 up 19% year-to-date, several strategists in the poll warned the U.S. stock market was overheated and heading for a correction. 
""We believe that domestic equities are very overdue for a decline of at least 10%,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management. ""We suspect that the same is true for the European markets."" 
The S&P 500 is trading at 21 times expected earnings, down from as high as 23 a year ago, but still far above its 10-year average of 16 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv data.
Strategists in the poll also predicted on average that the S&P 500 would be up only about 3% from its current level by the end of next June. 
Adding to worries, higher wages, increased consumer demand and a global supply chain yet to recover from the pandemic have created a spike in inflation. That has led to concerns the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected to tighten monetary policy. Investors on Friday will watch the Fed's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium for clues about when that might happen.

""Things right now are about as clear as mud when it comes to the reopening, the direction of interest rates, Fed commentary at Jackson Hole and tech stocks' continued outperformance,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

Investing.com – Urban Outfitters stock (NASDAQ:URBN) fell 4% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after management said its third-quarter sales would grow in the low double-digit range while it also warned of freight and commodity price increases.
According to Chief Operating Officer Frank Conforti, retail sales growth could land in the mid-teens range, while the wholesale segment sales could decrease at a rate similar to the second quarter’s.
Urban’s wholesale segment sales for the second quarter declined 30% to $59 million, driven by a 34% erosion in Free People Group wholesale sales. This happened as the company cut down the brand’s sales to promotional wholesale customers.
The shift in strategy for Free People Group, muted sales growth forecast and commodity inflation all combined to overshadow the company’s second-quarter performance.
Second-quarter total sales at the retailer rose 20% year-on-year to $1.16 billion due to strong double-digit growth in digital channel sales. Average order value rose and so did conversion rate. Diluted earnings per share was $1.28. Both sales and earnings beat estimates.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said in a blog post on Wednesday its advertising arm will start offering brands a demand-side platform (DSP) that will help them buy digital ad space more efficiently, just months ahead of the holiday shopping season.
A DSP is an automated tool that allows advertisers and agencies to buy, monitor and manage video, mobile and search ads in one place. Prior to DSPs, salespeople and ad buyers were responsible for purchasing and selling ads for companies.
Walmart has been aggressively expanding its ad unit - recently rebranded as Walmart Connect - after years of stuttering progress, making better use of its wealth of shopper data to attract major advertisers. 
The world's biggest retailer faces a huge task chasing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s multi-billion dollar ad business, while also battling smaller rivals including  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) which are building their own ad platforms.
Now, Walmart Connect is partnering with The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), a prominent ad tech firm, to court more advertising revenue.
Walmart touted its vast online, app and in-store shopping data as a means to help advertisers improve how their promotions and ads are targeted to potential customers, and effectively measure how those ads lead to sales.
""Even though the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of e-commerce sales last year, more than 80% of the total retail sales in the U.S. are still happening offline,"" Rich Lehrfeld, senior vice president of Walmart Connect, said. 

""By connecting and measuring both online and in-store performance, the Walmart DSP can offer targeting, reporting, and omnichannel insights down to a granular level.""
The company - which has roughly 4,700 brick-and-mortar stores - said the platform would be available to some brands by the end of October.

1023,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",Treasury Yields Seen Inching Up Even With Balanced Fed Message,"(Bloomberg) -- Signs are growing that U.S. Treasury yields may continue to march higher even if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strikes a balanced tone at Jackson Hole this week.  
The yield on five-year government notes -- the tenor that simultaneously captures expected changes to short-term interest rates and the pace of purchases of longer-dated bonds by central banks -- has climbed almost 20 basis points from a low this month, extending its underperformance against the rest of the curve since February.
It comes as the market appears to have largely discounted the prospect of a hawkish tilt by Powell, who is expected to hint at an eventual reduction of monetary stimulus at the Fed’s annual symposium. For ING strategists led by Padhraic Garvey, their relative cheapness against two- and 10-year peers points to “residual” momentum for higher rates.
“There is enough there, together with more balanced positioning, for market rates to start testing higher levels,” ING’s Garvey said. “It may be tentative, but it looks like the path of least resistance.” The latest clues on investor appetite for U.S. government debt may come later today, when the Treasury sells $61 billion of five-year notes in an auction.
Meanwhile, algo models driven by momentum, volatility and carry considerations have been unwinding long positions in the Treasury market, according to Mohit Kumar, a strategist at Jefferies International. That means flows might be enough to keep Treasuries on the backfoot, even if Powell declines to give a clear signal as to when he’ll begin removing support from the bond market.
“The last two months were positive for duration with supportive carry seasonality and low volatility,” Kumar, who is short five-year Treasuries, said. “We expected some unwind of long positions as we head into the volatility event of Jackson Hole and the carry seasonality wanes.”

Investing.com – Dick’s Sporting Goods stock (NYSE:DKS) climbed more than 11% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as record earnings in the second quarter led it to revise its guidance again.
Same-store sales rose 19% and net sales rose 21% to $3.27 billion, driven by multiple factors that ranged from more people embracing outdoor workout to greater health consciousness as a result of the pandemic.
The company also reaped benefits from people looking for casual wear rather than office clothes as the pandemic spares them regular trips to the office. 
E-commerce sales fell 28% from a year earlier, when most stores were closed because of the pandemic, but were still up 111% from two years ago.
All that helped the company deliver record quarterly earnings that came in at $5.08 per share, well ahead of the $2.83 estimate put out by analysts.
The company now expects to repurchase a minimum of $400 million of its common stock during 2021, double what it previously said. 
Dick’s now sees its full-year consolidated same-stores sales rising 18%-20%. The previous target of 8%-11% growth had been in place since May, when it last raised its guidance. It now sees annual EPS between $12.45 and $12.95.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. dollar stores including Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Family Dollar are likely to see a sales and earnings boost from the Biden administration's plan to hike food stamp benefits, an added payoff for the chains' strategy to tap the $274 billion fresh food market.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said last week that as part of a plan to promote a more nutritious diet among Americans, it is raising average Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by more than 25% versus pre-pandemic levels.
In a $1 trillion food-at-home industry, the additional payout is expected to potentially add about $6 billion of increased funding to shoppers' wallets starting in October, analysts at Evercore said.
Under the new rules, average monthly benefits, $121 per person before the pandemic, will rise by $36. All 42 million people in the program will receive additional aid. 
With the additional $36, ""you would expect they would buy more things like meat, fish, fruits and vegetables because those are high-priced items that tend to be responsive to income changes,"" said Joe Glauber, former USDA chief economist and a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.
Dollar stores count on low-income shoppers, and welfare checks tend to drive sales. In the pandemic, sales have skyrocketed with the help of shoppers benefiting from stimulus money, food stamps, child tax credits and higher wages in a tight labor market.
A Dollar General store in Norridge, Chicago sells 30-cent bunches of bananas and charges 75 cents for a lemon. This compares to a single banana that costs 27 cents at a Kroger-owned Mariano's store in a similar neighborhood in Chicago, where lemons cost 89 cents each.
A GREAT POSITION
""They (dollar stores) are going to have a tremendous benefit from this step-up in government support,"" said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School and former chief executive of Sears Canada. ""It plays perfectly into the hands of their existing customer base, who now will have more money to spend.""
Dollar stores run thousands of outlets that are walking distance from shoppers who use government assistance to buy food.
""We do well when she (the customer) has a little extra money to spend ... Now if things start to more normalize and/or go the other way, then we're in a great position as well because she needs us even more,"" Dollar General Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said at an industry conference in June. 
In securities filings, the company flags the importance of SNAP to its earnings. Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), which declined to comment, will report earnings on Thursday.
If SNAP recipients have more to spend, they're more likely to buy more expensive food at dollar stores like fresh items that require refrigeration, Scott Vinson, the National Retail Federation's vice president for government relations, food and energy policy, said.

Still, not everyone trusts dollar stores for fresh produce, especially with big retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) bolstering their offerings.
""I just don't like the quality of it...I feel produce would be better at other places so I never really looked here, to be honest with you,"" said Laura, 56, an accountant from Harwood Heights, Chicago who was loading up her cart with packaged food at the Norridge store.

A full return to the office has been delayed until Oct. 18, Switzerland's second-largest lender told U.S. employees last week, while those without the COVID-19 shot have been told to stay home until receiving the vaccination or new guidance.
""As concerns increase around the country regarding the Delta variant, we continue to strongly encourage all staff to get a COVID-19 vaccination and keep apprised of the latest updates to mask and physical distancing requirements in your area,"" the bank told U.S. employees in a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the company.
""This is especially important given the Delta variant's higher contagion rate,"" it said.
The news was reported earlier on Wednesday by Bloomberg.

The spread of the Delta variant has prompted some Wall Street firms to rethink their back-to-office plans, while U.S. banks have started enforcing stricter mask and vaccine requirements for staff while trying to avoid a fierce national debate about individual rights.
Credit Suisse's new vaccine mandate puts it in line with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which have also made employee vaccination obligatory for entry into offices in the United States.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded 1% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as the company claimed that its booster dose for Covid-19 led to a strong immunity response in the body.
J&J said data from two early-stage trials showed antibody levels increased ninefold among people who received a second dose of its vaccine.
The company said a booster is needed after eight months based on interim data it reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in July.
Data from the studies are being submitted to the preprint server MedRxiv in advance of peer review.
J&J’s viral vector vaccine is the only single-dose shot against Covid in the world. The US Food and Drug Administration has already approved booster doses for immunocompromised people in the case of mRNA vaccines, to be given 8 months after the second dose. That exercise should roll out from September.
The need for a booster dose has arisen amid studies that said the efficacy of the vaccines declines over time. The rapid spread of the delta variant that has led to a surge in Covid cases in the U.S. and elsewhere influenced the decision in favor of a booster dose."

Previous meetings have been organised and hosted by Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and president of the CUFR. 
The CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The meeting typically includes a first session focused on the financial sector and a second that discusses broader bilateral issues.
It will take place as China has accelerated the pace of opening up its massive financial sector to U.S. firms in recent years despite rising Sino-U.S. tensions, after years of lobbying to get better access.

News of the planned meeting was first reported by Bloomberg.
Participants in last year's event included officials from U.S. financial heavyweights including Fidelity, Citi, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Wednesday, struggling to add to record highs with investors wary of bidding the market too much higher ahead of the Federal Reserve 's virtual get-together at the end of the week.
At 6:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 15 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 6 points, or 0.1%.
The broad-based S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher Tuesday, its fourth-straight positive session and a new closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%, also hitting a record close, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%.
The annual Federal Reserve symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is at the forefront of investor thinking, with sentiment now swinging towards the central bank delaying the tapering of its massive bond-buying program until later in the year.
Also on the radar was the advancement of President Joe Biden’s ambitious domestic agenda, after the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a $3.5 trillion budget framework. The spending package, which is aimed at alleviating poverty and providing a broader social safety net, is likely to be financed in part by tax hikes on corporations and wealthier individuals.
The quarterly earnings season is coming to a close, but the likes of software company Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), cloud-based data storage company Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), and cosmetics and beauty product retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) are due Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) will be in the spotlight after the department store chain’s quarterly revenue was still down 6% from pre-pandemic levels in the latest quarter, while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stated that its Covid vaccine booster shot generated a promising immune response in early trials.
The economic data slate centers around the release of the durable goods orders for July, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show a drop of 0.3% compared with June’s rise of 0.8%.
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Wednesday after recent strong gains on the back of a cut to global supply from a fire on a Mexican oil platform and signs that demand in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer, appears to be holding up despite rising Covid cases.
Data from the industry group the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed crude inventories fell 1.6 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 20, while gasoline stockpiles fell 1 million barrels.
Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to be released later Wednesday.
By 6:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $67.63 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $70.53. Both contracts have risen by around 8% over the previous two days.

1034,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Cargo-Jet Boom Spurs New Abu Dhabi Site for Converting Boeing 777s to Freight,"(Bloomberg) --
Booming demand for freighter planes spurred Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. to announce a new site for converting passenger jets to cargo use in Abu Dhabi, its second such expansion within a week.
IAI will establish two conversion lines for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 777-300ER wide-body planes at a maintenance facility run by Etihad Aviation Group, complementing its own 777 site in Tel Aviv, the companies said Wednesday.
Demand for freighters is surging as coronavirus lockdowns accelerate a shift to online shopping at a time when passenger jets are flying less, limiting access to belly space that usually accommodates most airborne cargo. The pandemic has also prompted the retirement of older planes, swelling the supply of models ripe for conversion, including the relatively efficient twin-engine 777.
“We’ve seen a sharp increase in demand over the past few years and the 777 is going to be the plane for the future, so this will give us the extra capacity we need,” Yossi Melamed, IAI executive vice president and general manager for aviation, said in an interview.
Melamed said the company sees a market for 150 freighter conversions over the next five years, adding that demand for the 777 should be buoyed by its bigger cargo volume versus Boeing’s own purpose-built 777F, which is based on the smaller -200 passenger variant. The aircraft would be a natural successor to 747 and MD-11 freighters, he said.
The agreement with Etihad builds on one signed with the leasing arm of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. for 777 conversions in 2019. Work started in Israel on the first plane under that accord earlier this month and will take about 130 days.
The move into the Middle East comes after IAI said Aug. 19 that it will open a site in Addis Ababa to convert smaller Boeing 767 wide-bodies in conjunction with Ethiopian Airlines Group, adding to facilities in Tel Aviv and Mexico.
The Israeli firm also has two conversion sites for Boeing 737 narrow-bodies in China, and agreed earlier this year to establish another in Naples, Italy, with Atitech SpA.
Melamed said long-haul specialist Etihad is a desirable partner for its engineering expertize, while adding that communication between the companies has been possible only as a result of the normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates last year. 
IAI decided against working on the Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A321 passenger plane, which other conversion specialists are offering, but is looking at options for bigger Airbus models, Melamed said.
The European planemaker said in July it is separately planning to produce a from-new freighter version of its bigger A350 jet by 2025, while Boeing is looking at launching a dedicated cargo variant of the updated 777X.

1035,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 05:42AM ET</span>",Nordstrom Plunges 8% as Sales Fall Below 2019-Levels,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Nordstrom stock (NYSE:JWN) slumped more than 8% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as a 6% decline in the company’s second-quarter sales from 2019 weighed.
The fact that sales doubled from a year ago and that the company raised its annual revenue guidance was offset by the sales slump.
The company attributed the drop in sales, relative to 2019, to the timing shift of the annual anniversary sale, with roughly one week falling into the third quarter of 2021. This had a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points on net sales compared with 2019, the company said.
Sales from the annual anniversary sale rose 1% from levels seen before the pandemic two years ago.
For the record, Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) faced no such hiccups.
""(Nordstrom) straddled the two quarters with the sale because without it, they would have been in deeper trouble come the third quarter,"" Jane Hali, chief executive officer of Jane Hali & Associates, told Reuters.
Sales growth only during the event shows Nordstrom can only do business when there is a sale, Hali told the news agency.
Compared to the end of 2019 second quarter, Nordstrom closed the recent quarter with higher inventories, which it again attributed to the anniversary time shift, and also to its efforts to mitigate continuing supply chain backlogs and support improving sales trends.
For the second quarter ended July 31, net sales increased 101% year-on-year to $3.56 billion. Adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis came in at 49 cents compared to a loss of $1.62 in the second quarter a year ago.
Nordstrom expects current year revenue to rise more than 35%, compared with an over 25% forecast earlier."
1036,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>","S.Korea parliament committee votes to curb Google, Apple commission dominance","By Heekyong Yang and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean parliamentary committee voted on Wednesday to recommend amending a law, a key step toward banning Google and Apple from forcibly charging software developers commissions on in-app purchases, the first such curb by a major economy. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google have faced global criticism because they require software developers using their app stores to use proprietary payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30%. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said the bill ""will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections"", hurt user trust in App Store purchases and lead to fewer opportunities for South Korean developers.
Wilson White, senior director of public policy at Google, said ""the rushed process hasn't allowed for enough analysis of the negative impact of this legislation on Korean consumers and app developers"".
Experts said app store operators could assure security in payment systems other than their own by working with developers and other companies.
""Google and Apple aren't the only ones that can create a secure payment system,"" said Lee Hwang, a Korea University School of Law professor specialising in competition law. 
Others noted that South Korea had some of the most robust legal protections for online transactions in the world, and said app store operators should provide advanced services to bolster profits. 
""Dominant app store operators with large platforms should by now look to profit from value-added services, not just taking a cut from apps sold on its store,"" said Yoo Byung-joon, a Seoul National University School of Business professor who specialises in electronic commerce.
Based on South Korean parliament records, the amendment bans app store operators with dominant market positions from forcing payment systems on content providers and ""inappropriately"" delaying the review of, or deleting, mobile contents from app markets. 
It also allows the South Korean government to require an app market operator to ""prevent damage to users and protect the rights and interests of users"", probe app market operators, and mediate disputes regarding payment, cancellations or refunds in the app market. 
After the vote from the legislation and judiciary committee to amend the Telecommunications Business Act, dubbed the ""Anti-Google law,"" the amendment will come to a final vote in parliament.

That vote was to come on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-set-curb-google-apple-commission-dominance-2021-08-24, but the session was provisionally delayed to Aug. 30, a parliament official told Reuters. 
This month in the United States, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies that they said exert too much market control, including Apple and Google.

1037,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 04:18AM ET</span>",SEC Chief Warns ‘Clock Is Ticking’ on Delisting Chinese Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has a warning for hundreds of Chinese companies that have raised billions of dollars in U.S. markets: Submit to more scrutiny soon or get kicked out. 
In a Tuesday interview, he pledged to strictly enforce a three-year deadline that requires Chinese firms to permit inspections of their financial audits. If businesses refuse, their shares could be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq as soon as 2024. 
“The path is clear,” Gensler said. “The clock is ticking.”
The tough stance would seem to squash the hopes of some on Wall Street that Gensler might drag his feet in implementing the mandate from Congress and give Beijing more time to strike a deal with Washington regulators that allows the gravy train of Chinese stock sales to continue. They’ve been lucrative for big banks, exchanges and asset managers.  
In his comments, Gensler laid out how he plans to deal with a multitude of tricky investor protection issues involving China. The conflicts, which have festered for almost two decades, have come to the fore in recent months as the Chinese government reined in prominent companies that trade on American exchanges, causing massive drops in their share prices and rattling investors.
Read More: Why ‘Delisting’ Is a Worry in China-U.S. Market Mess  
The actions prompted the SEC last month to suspend new initial public offerings of China-based companies until they more clearly detail the potential pitfalls that shareholders face. On Tuesday, Gensler said he expects the same level of transparency from every Chinese firm that sells stock in the U.S., including those that already trade in New York. 
Investors need “full and fair” disclosure, Gensler said, adding that the agency was looking especially for information on “regulatory risks, the various political risks” that companies in China could encounter.
Those enhanced disclosures are likely to come by next year, Gensler said. He declined to say what consequences firms would face for not complying.
IPO Pause
As for the IPO pause, Gensler signaled it would continue as long as companies disclosures aren’t adequate. It could last “three weeks or three months,” he said. “It is really up to the issuers” and their lawyers and accountants.
Tensions between the U.S. and China have flared in recent years, fueled by the Trump administration’s trade policies and its efforts to blame the country for the coronavirus pandemic. Still, Washington’s ire with Beijing is not a partisan issue and President Joe Biden has mostly kept a similar posture.
Read More: Why China Is Cracking Down on Its Technology Giants
The SEC was drawn into the conflict last year when lawmakers passed legislation calling for the agency to close loopholes that have allowed Chinese companies to shield their books from U.S. inspectors. More than 50 other countries permit the reviews of audits, which are conducted by the U.S.’s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. China has refused, citing strict confidentiality laws and national security concerns. 
There are now 281 Chinese companies listed in the U.S., as well as another 110 based in Hong Kong, where American inspectors are also denied full access to financial data. That includes  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., large firms that are owned by many individual investors and widely held emerging market mutual funds.
The turmoil surrounding the July initial offering of Didi Global Inc. has also raised questions about the SEC’s role in signing off on IPOs that can quickly turn into disastrous investments, especially for unsophisticated traders. Gensler declined to comment on any specific companies.
‘Cheap Talk’
“It’s time to turn off the spigot,” said Lynn Turner, a former SEC chief accountant. “Meaningful action, not cheap talk, is what investors deserve now.”
In recent weeks, the Chinese government has signaled that it wants to resolve the standoff over the audit requirement. On Monday the State Council issued guidelines aimed at boosting cooperation with cross-border accounting oversight.
Read More: Why China and U.S. Are Clasing Over Stock Listings
Gensler, however, indicated there was little to negotiate after the bipartisan passage of the December 2020 law, called the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
While he declined to comment on any conversations that the SEC may be having with Chinese regulators, Gensler didn’t indicate that a resolution was near. “I have not been informed about anything yet that is a clear path forward,” he said.
Gensler said that PCAOB inspectors should be given access to any audit they choose and the ability to review so-called work papers, the documents underpinning accountants’ assessments. 
SEC Inaction
Advocates who have been pushing the SEC to demand more transparency from Chinese public companies said they were heartened that the SEC chair, who came aboard in April, is focusing on the issue after years of inaction at the regulator.
“Chairman Gensler is the right man to answer the China question because he cares deeply about investor protection,” said Christopher Iacovella, who runs the American Securities Association, a group of mid-sized brokerage firms. China can’t “continue to manipulate our markets at the expense of America’s working families.”

Investing.com -- European stock markets edged largely higher Wednesday, with the German market underperforming after the release of a disappointing business sentiment gauge.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany largely flat, while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.1%.
European markets received a positive handover from Wall Street overnight, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closing at record highs, but trading in Asia was more low-key and Europe has followed suit.
The German markets have underperformed Wednesday after the country’s exports to China, Germany's second biggest sales market outside the European Union, declined by 3.9% year-on-year, the biggest slump since May 2020, when the world was gripped in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
This difficult economic climate was illustrated with the publication of the German Ifo Institute’s business climate index, which showed a fall to 99.4 in August, dropping for a second straight month from 100.7 in July, and below the 100.4 expected.
That said, the main focus this week is the Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium, held this year online instead of at Jackson Hole, due to the spread of Covid-19. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Friday will be carefully studied for any clues regarding the timing for the central bank's tapering of asset purchases.
The European earnings season is almost over, and it has been a largely successful one, with European profits expected to have jumped 151% in the second quarter, according to the latest Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. This has helped support stocks, with most of the region’s major benchmark indices not far removed from record levels.
One of the sectors in the spotlight has been U.K. supermarkets amid private equity interest. This is set to promote WM Morrisons (LON:MRW) into the FTSE 100 index, Britain's blue chip benchmark, as its share price has surged over 60% since receiving an offer from private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in June. 
Elsewhere, oil prices retreated Wednesday, handing back some of the market’s recent gains with demand in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer, appearing to hold up despite rising Covid cases.
Data from the industry group the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed crude inventories fell 1.6 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 20, while gasoline stockpiles fell 1 million barrels.
Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to be released later Wednesday.
By 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $67.52 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $70.36. Both contracts have risen by around 8% over the previous two days, helped by the loss of more than 400,000 barrels per day of supply in Mexico after a fire on an oil platform.

EY's fine was cut to 2.2 million pounds for admitting to the failings, with Harvey's fine reduced to 70,000 pounds for the same reason.
There were admissions to failings in specific areas of the Stagecoach audit, including provisions for insurance claims relating to accidents, defined benefit pension scheme obligations, and an onerous contract provision relating to the East Coast Mainline railway franchise, according to the FRC.
""Whilst it is not alleged that the Financial Statements were in fact misstated, in several material instances the Respondents failed to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence,"" the regulator said.
The FRC said EY will be required to report to the watchdog for a year in respect of audit work in relation to onerous contract provisions.
EY said it regrettably fell short of the standards it set for itself, adding that no findings were raised in the FRC's review of auditor's most recent audit of Stagecoach for the year-end 2020. It said it had continued to make significant investments in audit quality.
""These will support our focus on delivering the highest levels of audit quality by building a culture of challenge and providing independent oversight of our UK audit practice.""
Harvey could not be immediately reached for comment.

Britain has said it wants to reform the audit market and replace the FRC with a more powerful watchdog after a series of company collapses, but the government has yet to put legislation to parliament to implement any change.

Shares in the company fell 6% in early trade.
The Swedish group said its fiscal operating profit in May-July fell 40% to 201 million Swedish crowns ($23 million) from a year earlier due to higher supply chain, logistics and service expenses caused by the pandemic.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",European shares seen holding tight to record levels: Reuters poll,"By Joice Alves
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks will hold around current record levels for the rest of 2021, supported by stellar earnings while worries around U.S. monetary policy tightening, German elections and a Chinese regulatory crackdown will cap gains, a Reuters poll found. 
The Reuters poll of 18 fund managers, strategists and brokers surveyed over the past week predicted the STOXX 600 would reach 470 points by year end, just 0.4% below Monday's close.
A much stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings season and improving economic data in Europe pushed the benchmark STOXX 600 to its longest winning daily streak in almost 15 years in August. 
With most of the results accounted for, European profits are expected to have surged a whopping 151% in the second quarter, according to the latest Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
And European corporates are set for more quarters of double-digit profit growth, with the European Union pumping more support through its huge post-pandemic recovery fund and vaccines mitigating worries around the COVID-19 Delta variant. 
Refinitiv data points to profit growth of 43% and 35% in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. 
Graphic: STOXX EARNINGS - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbkkowxpq/Pasted%20image%201629730381855.png 
Data has already shown that euro zone business activity grew strongly again in August, only dipping from July's two-decade high monthly pace, with the IHS Markit flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a gauge of economic health, at 59.5, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
European stocks are up 18% this year and have outperformed the MSCI's global stock index, which is up 13% year to date.
But remaining anchored to record levels won't come without challenges, as investors ponder risks that inflation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy conditions, especially in the United States, while China's months-long regulatory crackdown on an array of private companies keeps investors on their toes. 
Equities will ""continue climbing a wall of worry,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), with the regulatory crackdown in China being ""another challenge for investor confidence"". 
Some $120 billion of market capitalization was wiped off the European luxury space, which shed 14% in two days in August, after Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a blow to the sector, with plans for wealth redistribution.
ALL EYES WILL BE ON GERMANY
Investors are also taking into account the prospect of political gridlock in Germany in the wake of the upcoming elections, the first without Angela Merkel in more than 15 years. 
Graphic: Luxury - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzyywjypw/Luxury.png 
""All eyes will be on Germany's federal elections in September 2021"", said Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at SocGen. 
Barclays is not planning to turn more defensive just yet after it moderated its cyclical exposure, as European shares still offer attractive relative value, Cau said.
European indexes are cheaper than global peers as they are heavy in banks and other cyclical stocks which benefit when the economy looks up, and are light on tech and growth stocks for which investors are reluctant to pay hefty premiums amid buoyant economic activity and rising interest rates.
According to the poll, Germany's industrials-heavy DAX index should gain about 1.2% to 16,050 points at the end of the year against Monday's close of 15,852.8 points.
London's blue chip index is expected to rise 1.3% to 7,200 points. France's CAC 40 index is seen rising 1.7% to 6,800 points.

While Italy's FTSE MIB and Spain's IBEX are seen making the biggest gains, jumping 2.9% to 26,810 points and 2.1% to 9,160 points, respectively, before the end of the year.

Index manager FTSE Russell placed Morrisons on its ""indicative FTSE 100 Additions"" list on Aug. 24 and said it would make a final announcement on Wednesday Sept. 1 based on the data collected at the close on Aug. 31.
Morrisons, at the heart of a $9.5 billion bidding war between U.S.-based CD&R and a consortium led by SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment Group, is now valued at about 7 billion pounds ($9.6 bln).
Its membership in the index could prove short-lived with the bidders set to take the supermarket chain private.
Currently a member of the midcap index FTSE 250, Morrisons' market capitalisation now dwarfs several members of the FTSE 100, such as British broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV) and engineering specialist Weir Group (OTC:WEGRY), worth 4.6 and 4.3 billion pounds respectively.
Both companies are set to be expelled from the FTSE 100 blue-chip index along with Just Eat Takeaway.com.

As the COVID-19 Delta variant and supply chain disruptions persist globally, damage inflicted on business sentiment in Europe's biggest economy could become clear in Wednesday's Ifo German business sentiment index.
And with a Sept. 26 national election about to call time on the Merkel era, the already closely-watched Ifo survey may take on extra significance.
Just a month ahead of the key vote, the centre-left Social Democrats have pulled ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives for the first time in 15 years, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday.
Economists expect the August Ifo business sentiment index to decline for a second straight month.
The timing of the German sentiment numbers means markets have something to chew over before U.S. Federal Reserve chief Powell steps up to the virtual Jackson Hole podium on Friday.
Although analysts do not expect Powell to give too much away in terms of the Fed's taper timeline, markets are taking no chances -- Treasury yields and the dollar are clinging to tight trading ranges this week.
Stock markets, however have recovered ground from last week's selloff with Asian stocks higher on Wednesday while U.S. and European stock futures are flat to lower.
Elsewhere, U.S. officials have approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for China's blacklisted telecom company Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, two people familiar with the matter said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) said on Wednesday it signed an agreement with Etihad Engineering to establish a facility in Abu Dhabi that will convert Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-300ER passenger planes into cargo aircraft.
The new facility, which will operate as the company's maintenance centre in Abu Dhabi, aims to meet the growing demand for large cargo jets.
""Not only do we see the demand, but we view it as a greener, more profitable, highly innovative solution for our airline customers, and an excellent way to drive value for our business,"" Tony Douglas, chief executive of Etihad Aviation Group, said in a statement.
Demand for cargo plane conversions has been on the rise with the increase in ecommerce and the decline in value of used planes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
State-owned IAI currently converts Boeing 737, 747 and 767 passenger aircraft for cargo use. It has said it is currently developing a conversion method for the Boeing 777 and expects to finish the licensing process in 2023.
The deal comes a year after Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalise relations under the U.S.-sponsored Abraham Accords.
Over the past year, Israeli firms have forged a number of deals in the UAE. 
In March, IAI said it would jointly develop an advanced drone defence system with the UAE's state-owned weapons maker EDGE.
Yossi Melamed, head of IAI’s Aviation Group, said the latest deal adds a ""significant tier to the relations between Israel and the Gulf States"" and that ""additional agreements with companies in the region will arrive, and they will economically benefit all sides involved.""
IAI already operates cargo conversion sites including an existing line at its headquarters at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv. 

Etihad Engineering is one of the largest commercial aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services providers in the Middle East, and the centre in Abu Dhabi will be the largest and most advanced in the Middle East, IAI said.
It noted the facility will be certified by the UAE Civil Aviation Authority, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, and the European Aviation Safety Agency.

(Reuters) - Global corporate profits in the third quarter are likely to fall for the first time in 18 months after record earnings in April-June, Reuters calculations showed, as the spreading COVID-19 Delta variant squeezes supply chains and raises labour costs.
Massive fiscal stimulus to support economic recovery and loosened pandemic curbs generated high consumer demand in the second quarter, and companies contending with disrupted supplies and falling inventories raised prices to offset James Solloway, chief market strategist at SEI, said a further fall in interest rates could squeeze U.S. banks' profitability rising input costs.
This helped boost the combined net profits of 2,542 global companies with market capitalisation of at least $1 billion to a record $734 billion in the quarter ended June, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. 
But profits are estimated to fall 8% on average to $678.2 billion in the July-September quarter.
China's factory output and retail sales growth contracted sharply in July, as new COVID-19 outbreaks and floods disrupted business operations, while U.S. business activity growth slowed for a third straight month in August.

A strong dollar could hurt U.S. exporters and a further fall in interest rates could squeeze profits at banks, said James Solloway, chief market strategist at wealth manager SEI.
Earnings at European and Asian firms are set to fall 10.3% and 9.6%, respectively.

Investing.com -- European stock markets are expected to open in a subdued fashion Wednesday, ahead of the release of an influential gauge of German business sentiment and a key meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded less than 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped less than 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose less than 0.1%.
European markets received a positive handover from Wall Street overnight, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closing at record highs, but trading in Asia was more low-key.
The main focus this week is the Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium, held this year online instead of at Jackson Hole, due to the spread of Covid-19. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Friday will be carefully studied for any clues regarding the timing for the central bank's tapering of asset purchases.
Ahead of this, investors will look to the publication of the German Ifo Institute’s business climate and expectations indexes for August, at 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), for indications of the strength of Europe’s largest economy.
The European earnings season is almost over, and it has been a largely successful one, with European profits expected to have jumped 151% in the second quarter, according to the latest Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. This has helped support stocks, with most of the region’s major benchmark indices not far removed from record levels.
Radiation therapy equipment maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb) reported a fall in May-July earnings, saying the market continued to recover but costs related to the supply chain and logistics grew.
Elsewhere, oil prices retreated Wednesday, handing back some of the market’s recent gains with demand in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer, appearing to hold up despite rising Covid cases.
Data from the industry group the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed crude inventories fell 1.6 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 20, while gasoline stockpiles fell 1 million barrels.

Afterpay spent heavily over the past year to boost its presence in the largely untapped U.S. market, which overtook the company's home country of Australia to become its biggest.
Underlying sales nearly doubled to A$21.1 billion ($15.30 billion) in the year to June, but also saw bad debts rise from first-time users.
Net transaction losses tripled to A$132.6 million, or 0.6% of total volumes. The company's statutory loss ballooned to A$159.4 million from A$22.9 million, while core earnings fell 13%.
Citi said the ""soft result"" could lead to consensus downgrades. Afterpay's shares were down 1% at A$133.78.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's liquidity-driven stock market rally is expected to cool next year as global and domestic monetary policy starts to tighten, according to a Reuters poll of analysts who expect corporate earnings to rise further.
Despite slumps during two damaging waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benchmark BSE Sensex Index has surged nearly 120% from a record low of 25,638.9 hit in late March last year, when the country's first lockdown started.
Ultra-easy monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of India, which has slashed its repo rate by 115 basis points to 4.0% since the start of the pandemic and injected a massive amount of extra liquidity, was the primary domestic driver of that rally.
With that stimulus expected to remain in place at least for the rest of 2021, the Aug. 11-24 Reuters poll of around 30 equity strategists predicted the Sensex index would gain 2.4% to 56,875 by end-2021 from Monday's close of 55,555.79.
This year's estimated gain of just over 19% would be the highest since 2017. But the index is predicted to rise only 4.6% next year, the weakest annual performance in six years.
""It will not be a smooth ride for the markets from here on, given the run-up recently has been quite strong,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking. 
""Any tightening by the RBI could severely dent the sentiment and may result in a kick-jerk reaction."" 
""Apart from that, new variants of COVID-19 still pose a risk to the overall economic recovery,"" he added.
Inflation has remained above the RBI's medium-term target mid-point of 4% for the past two years, but so far the central bank has focused on growth, keeping policy loose to support the economy.
A separate Reuters survey last month predicted the central bank would hike its key repo rate by 25 basis points twice next fiscal year to 4.5%. [ECILT/IN]
Meanwhile, rising expectations the Federal Reserve will soon announce a taper to its $120 billion of monthly asset purchases are also restraining bullishness in the market.[ECILT/US]
Indian companies have recently posted stellar earnings growth thanks in part to a very low comparison base and a rebound in business activity as most restrictions imposed during the devastating and deadly second wave were relaxed.
""The earnings growth momentum is still positive, but weakening. The best of the earnings growth and margin expansion is over,"" said Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Nearly 90%, or 25 of 29 poll respondents, said corporate earnings would rise further over the next 12 months. But the magnitude of that rise will not likely be anywhere near as large, and that suggests stocks may soon lose momentum. 

""Our analysis of past market rallies suggests the current rally could have limited further runway. We see risk of estimate cuts and with valuations at a peak, we expect markets to correct 9% near term,"" noted analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities.

Investors now look to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, which will take place online from Aug. 26 to Aug. 28.
“As long as the economic and corporate earnings environments continue to improve, the market is likely to withstand ongoing concerns about the virus and policy. That said, risks for the market are becoming more balanced as we move throughout the market cycle,” New York Life Investments economist and portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin told Bloomberg.
On the data front, U.S. new home sales were at 708,000 units, growing 1% month-on-month in July.

TOKYO - Japanese shares are expected to recover from an eight-month low marked on Friday to near a 30-year high by the end of this year, supported by a robust corporate outlook and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines, a Reuters Poll showed. 
The median estimate in the Aug. 11-24 poll of 22 analysts and fund managers forecast the benchmark Nikkei index would gain 6.2% from Tuesday's close of 27,732.1 to reach 29,450 by the end of December. This is lower than a forecast of 31,000 in the previous poll in May.
The Nikkei has been hovering below 28,000 over the past month, as the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus spurred concerns of an economic slowdown even as Japanese companies reported positive outlooks.
But most market participants expected a recovery in the Nikkei as they see its valuations as cheap.
""Overall companies gave positive outlooks when they announced their earnings for the April-June period and a notable number of companies raised their forecast,"" said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist, Monex Securities, who forecast the Nikkei to climb to 31,000 in December.
""That has made Japanese shares cheap. Investors will renew their confidence when companies announce their outlook after the July-September quarter,"" Hiroki said. 
The Nikkei trades at 14.39 times expected earnings, compared with nearly 28 times in early February, when the index was rallying toward its 30-year high on Feb. 16.
Since then it has lost momentum on growing concerns of an economic slowdown, as Japan was lagging behind other developed nations in coronavirus vaccine rollouts. 
Daily infections surged to a record level, driven by the Delta variant, after Tokyo held the 2020 Olympics that started on July 23. 
The country is still battling its worst wave of infections and the situation could deteriorate as the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics kicked off on Tuesday. 
On Friday, the Nikkei fell to an eight-month low, triggered by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM)'s announcement that it would slash its global production by 40% in September. Declines were seen across a wide range of sectors related to auto manufacturing.
""I found the corporate outlook based on the first quarter earnings conservative and expected upward revisions after the end of the half year,"" said Kyoko Amemiya, representative for Amemiya Research Institute. ""But Toyota's production cut crashed that hope."" 

Amemiya still expects the Nikkei to climb to 30,000 but added it may not rise above its February peak of 30,714.

(Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc told employees that from Tuesday anyone entering its offices in the United States must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
The bank will also require that masks be worn in offices regardless of vaccination status from Wednesday, while fully vaccinated employees will receive weekly COVID-19 tests starting on Sept. 7, the memo said. 
A Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo.
The announcement comes a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, a certification that public health officials hope will convince unvaccinated Americans that the shot is safe and effective. 
In June, Goldman was one of the earliest Wall Street banks to require that most employees return to offices, and the vaccine mandate is part of the effort to continue working at offices safely amid a resurgence in COVID cases. 
Goldman's new policy is in line with rival banks  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), which also require vaccines at their U.S. headquarters.
Three of the four largest U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co - do not require vaccines for individuals at their offices. 

Bank of America has asked that only vaccinated employees come into its offices when it begins formally welcoming people back in September.
COVID-19 infections are increasing in the United States at an average of about 150,000 cases a day, and are currently at 60% of the peak level of new daily infections reported in January, according to Reuters tracking data.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo has started taking a few San Franciscans on rides in its self-driving sport utility vehicles and hopes to open the robotaxis to anyone in the city in less than the three years it took to launch in its only other market.
Waymo's announcement on Tuesday of its status and plans in San Francisco, a small peninsula of hills, trolleys, bicycles and narrow streets, shows the length that remains before driverless transport becomes commonplace. 
The company's all-electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs initially are serving the more residential western and southern portions of the city, including Richmond and Bernal Heights. Operators are in driver's seats with hands on their knees - but prepared to steer in an emergency.
Anybody can sign up for Waymo's ride-hailing app, though the company is hand-selecting who it picks up with the list expected to grow gradually to hundreds of people. Waymo bars them from publicly discussing rides.
Sam Kansara, senior product manager at Waymo, acknowledged that autonomous vehicles are rolling out slower than Waymo and its many rivals had originally envisioned.
""There's a lot that remains to be done,"" Kansara said. ""This is a step about starting to now get more information so that we can inform our roadmap.""
The company wants feedback from people with differing backgrounds and commuting needs. It expects many riders to weigh in on challenges with hopping on and off because of San Francisco's limited curb space and rampant double parking.
Employees riding in the city since February gave the company confidence to expand to the public, Kansara said.

Waymo last October in a first-of-its-kind deployment in the United States for the industry started allowing anyone to buy rides in its fully driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans in some Phoenix, Arizona, suburbs.
The launch followed three years of testing, but Kansara said he hopes lessons learned from that experience will bring about swifter progress in San Francisco.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs said on Thursday it will buy Dutch insurer  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Group's asset management arm for around 1.7 billion euros ($1.98 billion) in the biggest acquisition by the U.S. company since David Solomon became chief executive in 2018.
The deal is part of Solomon’s strategy to make the bank’s revenue stream less reliant on earnings from trading and advising on deals. The Wall Street firm wants to bulk up in areas like wealth management and expand its presence in regions outside the United States. 
""This acquisition allows us to accelerate our growth strategy and broaden our asset management platform,"" Solomon said in a statement.
NNIP, or NN Investment Partners, has $335 billion in assets under management, and the acquisition will double the total that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) manages in Europe to more than $600 billion.
Goldman said NNIP's 900 employees will join GS and the Netherlands will become ""a significant location"" in its European business. 
Goldman is the latest major financial firm to bulk up operations in the Netherlands in the wake of Britain's departure from the European Union, though NNIP is based in The Hague, rather than Amsterdam, the country's main financial hub. 
As part of the deal, NN Group, the Netherlands' biggest insurer, has committed to leave its $190 billion portfolio of insurance assets under NNIP management after it joins Goldman.
""The combined investment expertise and scale will enhance the service offering to NN Investment Partners’ clients, including NN Group,"" said NN CEO David Knibbe.
NN said the sale of NNIP will improve its Solvency II ratio by 17 percentage points, from 209% at the end of June, and proceeds would be used for acquisitions or additional returns to shareholders. The ratio is a measure of how much extra money it has to act as a cushion should markets fall. 
""Given the company's already strong capital position which is sufficient to fund its organic growth opportunities, and the lack of obvious M&A targets, the potential for significant excess capital returns in the coming year(s) is apparent,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in a comment on the deal. It said the the price Goldman paid was higher than the 1.5 billion euros it had expected.
Shares in NN Group fell 1.1% to 43.77 by 0844 GMT, but are up 23% in the year to date.
NNIP had also attracted interest from numerous other insurers and asset managers, Reuters reported in June, with Germany's DWS seen as a front-runner. 

""While we saw potential here for a long-term growth partnership beyond management of existing assets ... the seller’s priority was to maximise the immediate price tag,"" said a DWS source close to the transaction.

(Reuters) -Germany's markets watchdog BaFin said on Tuesday it found no evidence to pursue an insider trading investigation in the shares of carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), including the purchase of a stake in the UK's Aston Martin by Mercedes' Formula One boss.
BaFin looked into trading at Germany's Daimler and passed information to counterparts at the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regarding trading in Aston Martin shares, with the FCA also finding no evidence to pursue a probe, the Financial Times newspaper reported earlier.
""I can confirm that BaFin looked into the transaction with regard to possible suspicions of insider trading (in Daimler securities), but did not find any clues,"" the BaFin spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Daimler said it had no comment. FCA and Aston Martin did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular working hours.
Toto Wolff, Mercedes' Formula One boss, who owns about a third of the Mercedes team, purchased shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin in April last year.
Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes, also owns a minority stake in Aston Martin.
Wolff bought a 0.95% stake in Aston Martin from a vehicle controlled by Lawrence Stroll, the UK carmaker's executive chair, according to the FT.

In the following month, Aston Martin appointed Tobias Moers, the former head of Mercedes' AMG business, as its CEO. In October, Daimler said it would raise its stake in Aston Martin to 20% by 2023. 
Mercedes F1 said Wolff had not been aware of either plan when he acquired the shares and that ""all relevant disclosures were made to the UK financial authorities at the appropriate time"", according to the FT. Wolff did not acquire or trade any Daimler shares or securities last year, the newspaper added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tutoring firms are having to learn new ways of making money after a ban on teaching core subjects left them promoting classes such as drama and even parental training in a scramble to replace at least a fraction of a once-lucrative business.
Firms including New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc and U.S.-listed Gaotu Techedu Inc have added a miscellany of courses and even new businesses after the government last month prohibited for-profit tutoring in any school subject and offering classes on weekends or holidays.
The ban is aimed at easing pressure on six- to 15-year-olds in compulsory education as well as reducing the cost burden on parents. However, it threatens to decimate an industry which executives and local media said employs 10 million people.
""The educational giants are in a tight corner, but they have to move forward - like a big ship can't park in the sea,"" said Beijing-based private kindergarten chain operator Richard Zhang.
""But demand for sports or arts training is far more elastic than for academic, so the sales cost is very high,"" said Zhang.
The industry, catering to three- to 18-year-olds, was worth 800 billion yuan ($123.24 billion) in 2019 and set to reach 1.4 trillion yuan by 2025, consultancy Oliver Wyman said last year.
Yet now, while many firms have worked quickly to adapt, thousands of others have closed, local media reported.
New Oriental this month announced ""quality education"" to teach, for instance, computer coding, calligraphy and chess. It also, separately, established a housekeeping services company. 
The firm has also ramped up promotion of its parental training class, teaching skills such as time management and which it said aims to help parents better understand children.
Gaotu has upgraded its app to focus on adult education with classes such as foreign languages, and maths tutor Gaosi Education has begun ""traditional Chinese culture"" classes, taught over three weekends for 19,800 yuan. 
""We will take students to the outskirts of Beijing to learn intangible cultural heritage skills such as kite-making,"" a Gaosi teacher told Reuters.
It will be ""absolutely impossible"" for such classes to support the scale of private tutoring giants, said Tong Diyi, general manager of Beijing-based private equity firm Longwin Asset Management.
Such classes fall into what analysts categorise as ""quality education and vocational education"", which was worth a third of the pre-ban private education sector, estimates showed.
""There are already many players in the quality education sector, and at the moment it's unclear how much bigger this market can grow to accommodate more participants,"" Tong said.
New Oriental and Gaotu declined to comment.
Parent Jiang Ye paid around 20,000 yuan a year for her 11-year-old daughter to attend weekly two-hour maths tuition at Gaosi. Such classes end with the school year's Sept. 1 start.

""Her goal is a good university, and the university won't care if she can dance ballet,"" Jiang said.

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 07:16PM ET</span>","U.S. COVID-19 vaccine approval is 'seismic' shift for legality of mandates, experts say","By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Formal U.S approval of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine will make it nearly impossible to successfully challenge mandates by employers, legal experts said.
The decision by the Food and Drug Administration to give full approval to the vaccine is ""seismic,"" said Brian Dean Abramson, an author on vaccine law.
He said it will become extremely difficult to challenge the FDA's decision and the mandates that flow from it.
On Monday, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine became the first to secure full FDA validation, prompting calls for governments and private employers to make the shots mandatory.
COVID-19 vaccines have been available in the United States since December under the an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA.
Language in the EUA law states that recipients must be informed of benefits and risks of the vaccine and given the option to accept or refuse it.
That language raised some uncertainty regarding employer mandates, which are usually considered legal, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings Law. ""With full approval, that is removed.""
Following the FDA announcement on Monday, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) - the second-largest U.S. oil producer - and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) issued mandates for some employees.
Legal experts said there already was a growing consensus that employers could mandate an emergency vaccine. During the pandemic, both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice issued guidance in support of vaccine mandates, provided exceptions were made for medical conditions and religious beliefs.
But emergency vaccine requirements have not gone unchallenged. At least a dozen lawsuits have been filed, mostly by students against colleges, but also by employees fighting allegations of wrongful termination for refusing a shot.
Most of the cases prominently feature arguments that vaccines approved on an emergency basis could not be required, seizing on language in the emergency authorization law that requires consent from the vaccine recipient.
Isaac Legaretta, for example, said he was never told he could refuse the vaccine required by the Dona Ana Detention Center in New Mexico where he worked.
""Quite the opposite, he was advised that he would be fired if he did so,"" said the Legaretta lawsuit, which was filed in February and is pending.
In July, in one of the few rulings involving a private employer, a federal judge in Texas upheld vaccine mandates for employees at a Houston Methodist Hospital, finding the employees misunderstood the language in the EUA law. 
Legal experts said challenges to vaccine mandates will almost certainly persist, particularly against public employers or public universities and colleges, which involve allegations of governments infringing on an individual's Constitutional rights. That argument does not apply to private employers.
But as long as the government is requiring the vaccine as a condition of employment or education, legal experts said those will be difficult cases to make.
""You can always go work for somebody else or go to a school that doesn't require a vaccine,"" said Jeffrey Nolan, an attorney with Holland & Knight, which represents employers.
Many employers have tried to use incentives such as gift cards and time off to encourage vaccinations. That approach seems to have run its course, legal experts said.

With full FDA approval, employers appear ready to move toward ordering staff to get vaccinated. 
Samantha Monsees, an attorney with Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said: ""I think based on my workload in the last two days the FDA approval is going to tip the scales with a lot of employers.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House is hosting an event on Wednesday that will bring together the largest U.S. technology companies for a discussion about cybersecurity challenges following a raft of high-profile hacking incidents earlier this year, people familiar with the event told Reuters. 
It comes as Congress weighs new legislation concerning data breach notification laws and cybersecurity insurance industry regulation, historically viewed as two of the most consequential policy areas within the field. 
The guest list includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Chief Executive Arvind Krishna, according to two people familiar with the event. 
Another said the topics of discussion will include ransomware, critical infrastructure, supply chain security, cybersecurity education and data breach insurance policy. 
Executives for energy utility firm  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) and financial giant JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) are also expected to attend the event, Bloomberg previously reported. 
One of the people familiar with the event said the participating companies are expected to make public commitments toward better IT security measures and for additional workforce training. 
The event will feature top cybersecurity officials from the Biden administration, including recently confirmed National Cybersecurity Director Chris Inglis, as well as Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, to lead different conversations with industry representatives. 
While the White House has continuously engaged the private sector for months over potential new cybersecurity rules, Wednesday's planned event is unique in its inclusion of the insurance industry, according to three people familiar with the event.
The CEO of property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) Inc, Alan Schnitzer, will attend, they said.
Insurance companies play an important part in covering damages associated with data breaches. Experts contend that influencing the insurance market's policies around cyberattacks could bring widespread improvements to cyber defense systems throughout private industry. 

""The increased use of cyber insurance over the last 10 years has been an unfortunate stimulant to ransomware gangs - it has encouraged more attacks as insured victims are often quite willing to rapidly pull the trigger on ransom payments knowing that they will be reimbursed by insurance,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator. 
Ransomware functions by locking up an infected computer system, typically disrupting services to workers or customers, until an extortion is paid to the hackers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of several retail trading darlings, including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME), surged in heavy volume late on Tuesday, on no apparent news, dealing over $1 billion in losses to short sellers.
While broad market indexes rose modestly on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq up 0.5% and the S&P 500 0.1% higher, several of the ""meme stocks"" notched big gains.
GameStop shares jumped 27.53%, AMC shares climbed 20.3%, Clover Health Investments rose 9.9%, Koss Corp rose 4.4%, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets climbed 9.0% and ContextLogic rose 6.4%.
""When you get a move that big it almost makes you think there is some big hedge fund or something out there that decided to do some trades,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Frederick, however, said he had seen little in the way of news to spur the large share price moves on Tuesday.
The jump in the share price on Tuesday also dealt large losses to investors with bearish bets on some of these stocks, according to analytics company ORTEX.
""Heavily shorted stocks have, for the last month, been less volatile than earlier this year. Today we saw an end to this,"" said Ortex co-founder Peter Hillerberg.
The share price gains in AMC and GameStop generated losses for close to $1 billion for short sellers, Hillerberg said.
Short sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.
Several of these stocks also drew higher-than-usual trading volume in the options market on Tuesday, as traders jockeyed to either take advantage of the rallying prices or moved to cover positions that were under water. 
For instance, GameStop options trading volume was at 407,000 contracts, or about six times its recent average daily trading volume, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. AMC options volume came in at 1.6 million contracts, nearly three times its daily average, making it the most active single stock name in the options market on Tuesday, Trade Alert data showed. 

While the retail trading frenzy that had taken Wall Street by storm earlier this year has subsided somewhat in recent months, the periodic wild moves in the share prices has kept investors on their toes, analysts said.
""Options prices are implying that this is not going away any time soon,"" said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at Ally Invest.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who last year launched the biggest-ever special-purpose acquisition company, said on Tuesday he remains committed to finding a merger partner for his blank-check company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd (PSTH).
""Our plan to return cash to shareholders once SPARC is approved does NOT in any way mean that we are walking away from PSTH and giving up on completing a deal,"" Ackman wrote in the Pershing Square Holdings interim financial statements.
Ackman made the statements just a few days after he told investors he would return the $4 billion raised last year if regulators give him approval for a special-purpose acquisition rights company (SPARC). The news came days after Pershing Square Tontine Holdings was charged with failing to have registered as an investment company, a lawsuit Ackman called meritless.
""We remain committed to finding a transaction for PSTH,"" Ackman wrote on Tuesday, adding, ""If we have not done so by the time SPARC is approved, we will then continue to pursue a business combination, on behalf of SPARC rather than PSTH.""
Ackman created the SPARC as part of a deal to buy a stake in Universal Music Group (UMG), which he proposed earlier this summer for Pershing Square Tontine Holdings but abandoned amid regulatory questions.
Instead his hedge funds promised to purchase between 5% and 10% of UMG by mid-September and have already purchased a 7.1% stake, the financial statement said.

To help raise cash for the purchase, Ackman said he sold his stake in Agilent Technologies Inc (NYSE:A), his portfolio's second-best performer in the first half of the year.
He said again he thinks regulators should grant approval to his SPARC ""within a reasonable time frame, that is in months not years"" and said investors could help the process by contacting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher in a late-summer, light volume rally on Tuesday as the FDA's full approval of a COVID-19 vaccine on Monday and the absence of negative catalysts kept risk appetite alive ahead of the much-anticipated Jackson Hole Symposium.
All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closing at all-time closing highs.
The session marked the S&P 500's 50th record high close so far this year.
Tech and tech-adjacent megacaps were once again doing the heavy lifting, but economically sensitive cyclicals and smallcaps outperformed the broader market.
""Investors are looking at the horizon at the big Jackson Hole meeting on the horizon,"" Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina, referring to the Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium on Friday. ""But for now the feel-good from yesterday’s vaccine news is still in the air.""
The Food and Drug Administration's full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Monday fueled optimism over economic recovery which spilled into Tuesday's session.
Travel and leisure sectors, associated with economic re-engagement, outperformed the broader market. The S&P 1500 Airline and Hotel/Restaurant/Leisure indexes gained up 3.7% and 1.6%, respectively. 
""We have energy, retail, travel, leisure, financials, and small caps all doing well today,"" Detrick said. ""And that’s a sign that the reopening is alive and well.""
Recent economic indicators suggest the recovery from the most abrupt recession in U.S. history is headed in the right direction, but not to the extent that is likely to prompt the Fed to tighten its dovish monetary policy.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to meet with other world bank leaders when the Jackson Hole Symposium convenes later this week, and his remarks will be closely parsed for any clues regarding the Fed's tapering of asset purchases and hiking key interest rates. 
The event will take place virtually and not in person due to the spread of COVID-19 in the county, which has reduced expectations that any major announcement will be made at the event.
""The fact that the Fed is having a virtual (Jackson Hole) meeting tells you that they might be thinking maybe they need to keep supporting the economy,"" said Detrick.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.55 points, or 0.09%, to 35,366.26, the S&P 500 gained 6.7 points, or 0.15%, to 4,486.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 77.15 points, or 0.52%, to 15,019.80.

Therefore, prominent airline operators American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) should benefit in the long run. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out. American Airlines Group , Inc. (AAL) in Fort Worth, Tex., and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW) in St. George, Utah, are two popular airliners in the United States. AAL provides scheduled air transportation services for passengers, cargo, and mail service through its hubs and partner gateways worldwide. SKYW offers aircraft maintenance, airline reservations, conference travel, hotel reservation, car hire, online booking, and visa services worldwide. The company also leases regional jet aircraft and spare engines to third parties.
Although a strong vaccination drive helped the airline industry witness an uptick in demand earlier this year, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases will likely darken the industry’s outlook through the fall. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the industry is expected to suffer a $47.70 billion overall loss in 2021. However, an anticipated increase in vaccination rates across the country with the FDA’s full approval yesterday of Pfizer-BioNTech's two-dose vaccine should help the industry return to its recovery path. Therefore, both AAL and SKYW could witness a solid recovery later this year or early next year.
While SKYW has gained 2.9% in price year-to-date, AAL has surged 21.2%. In terms of their past year’s performance, AAL is a clear winner with 57.2% gains versus SKYW’s 38.3% returns. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as positive U.S. vaccination news lifted sentiment, and as investors grew less worried the Federal Reserve was set to announce a timetable for tapering stimulus measures.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to speak on Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Last week, investors were worried the Fed was edging closer to tapering, or winding down its bond-buying program, but now they are much less confident Powell's speech will indicate such a timeline.
Benchmark 10-year yields rose two and a half basis points to 1.2969%. The yields are in a range after falling from a one-month high of 1.379% on Aug. 12, while holding above a six-month low of 1.127% reached earlier this month.
""I can't see a shift in monetary policy in the next two to three months"", said Mikael Jacoby, head of continental European sales trading at Oddo Securities in Paris. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, rose another 0.57% after its 1.1% gain on Monday, setting it on a recovery course after last week's selloff. 
In Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 was broadly flat, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rallied 2.41%, with Chinese stocks rebounding after being hit by regulatory worries last week. 
Spiking COVID-19 infections caused by the highly contagious Delta variant have fuelled concerns about the recovery, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval on Monday to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), raising hopes inoculations could accelerate.
All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closing at all-time closing highs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.09% to 35,366.26, the S&P 500 gained 0.15% to 4,486.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.52%, to 15,019.80. (N)
The dollar eased further as risk-related currencies benefited from rising commodity prices and markets digested data showing the U.S. economy in strong recovery mode.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.135% to 92.868.
Oil prices rose 3%, supported after Mexico suffered a large production outage due to a fire on an oil platform and also by full U.S. regulatory approval of vaccines for COVID-19.
Brent crude oil futures settled up $2.30, or 3.4%, at $71.05 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained $1.90, or 2.9%, to settle at $67.54.

Gold consolidated above $1,800 as some investors bet the recent surge in COVID-19 cases could steer the Fed away from announcing plans to taper.
Spot gold settled at $1,802.8199 per ounce, down 0.13% while U.S. gold futures gained 0.04% to $1,803.2.

Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) also raised its annual revenue forecast, but that did little to lift the mood after the company flagged supply chain issues and faced stiff competition from Gen-Z favorites ThredUp, T.J. Maxx and  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
Analysts also shrugged off sales at Nordstrom's annual Anniversary Sale event rising 1% from levels seen before the pandemic two years ago. The sale had extended into the first week of the third quarter.
""(Nordstrom) straddled the two quarters with the sale because without it, they would have been in deeper trouble come the third quarter,"" said Jane Hali, chief executive officer of Jane Hali & Associates. 
Sales growth only during the event shows Nordstrom can only do business when there is a sale, Hali said. 
Macy's and Kohl's, meanwhile, returned to revenue growth from pre-pandemic levels in their latest reported quarters as consumers refreshed their wardrobes with new apparel and footwear following the easing of COVID-19 curbs.
Like its peers, Nordstrom also flagged supply-chain issues ahead of the crucial holiday season, saying it could not sufficiently stock up on women's shoes and clothing in its Nordstrom Rack stores.
""We have seen real lumpiness in the global supply chain that has led to some shortages and more so just unevenness ... We do not expect those conditions to change anytime soon,"" Chief Executive Officer Erik Nordstrom said on an earnings call.

Nordstrom expects fiscal 2021 revenue to rise more than 35%, compared with an over 25% forecast earlier. Analysts on average expected revenue to jump 29%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The chain also beat estimates for profit and revenue in the second quarter.

The company, whose existing investors include Tiger Global Management and General Catalyst, did not disclose the number of Class A common shares its stockholders were looking to sell. It will not receive any proceeds from the sale of such shares.
The New York-based firm, known for its fashionable eyewear starting at $95, was valued at $3 billion after a $245 million funding round in 2020, the Wall Street Journal had reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/warby-parker-founders-explain-why-they-are-adding-35-stores-after-pandemic-11622296801. 
The co-founders of Warby, who were classmates at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, got the idea for the company in 2008 after co-Chief Executive Officer Dave Gilboa found the cost of replacing eyeglasses lost on a Southeast Asia backpacking trip to be too high.
Founded later in 2010, the company now has an active consumer base that exceeds two million as rising usage of smartphones, tablets and other devices increases the need for vision correction.

A direct listing like Warby's allows companies to list their stock on public exchanges by sidestepping a costly and time-consuming initial public offering. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a Nasdaq Inc proposal to allow companies to raise capital through direct listings in May. Companies have not raised any capital through such listing procedures so far.

The new entity, referred to as ""NewCo"" in the filing https:// from earlier this month, will be incorporated in China. 
Tim Hortons China will not own any stake in the entity. The local unit will instead enter into a long-term contract with Tim Hortons China to provide services for a cost, according to the filing.
The statement comes against the backdrop of China's internet watchdog, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), launching a probe https://reut.rs/3zdPZEY into Didi Global two days after the ride-hailing giant's New York stock market debut.
The CAC action against Didi and two other firms that went public in the United States was swiftly followed by Beijing's announcement that it will clamp down on overseas-traded Chinese firms, many of them U.S.-listed tech companies, and tighten regulation of cross-border data flows and security.
The blank check firm Silver Crest Acquisition Corp said that TH International Limited, or Tim Hortons China, ""believes that the creation and operation of NewCo directly addresses the valid concerns highlighted by recent statements by the Cyberspace Administration of China."" 

The company will inform CAC and other regulators of its plans and operation of the separate entity, the filing said.
Earlier this month, Tim Hortons China had agreed to go public in a merger with Silver Crest, valuing the business at $1.69 billion, including debt.

Disney's cruise line had earlier said it did not insist on vaccinations, but the change in stance comes after the U.S. health regulator asked people at a high risk of severe COVID-19 illness to avoid cruises irrespective of vaccination status.

The Bahamas, a major hub for cruises, has also said it would not allow those ships to dock in the country unless all passengers 12 and older provide proof of vaccination.

Over the past weekend, Airbnb.org has worked with partners to place 165 refugees in safe housing shortly after they landed in the United States, Airbnb said.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 04:56PM ET</span>","South Korea set to curb Google, Apple commission dominance","By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is likely to bar Google and Apple from requiring software developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commissions on in-app purchases, the first such curbs on the tech companies by a major economy.
An amendment of the Telecommunications Business Act, dubbed the ""Anti-Google law,"" that takes aim at app store operators with dominant market positions, is being considered by lawmakers in South Korea, who have pushed the issue of the commission structure since mid-2020.
In a statement, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said the bill ""will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases.""
The iPhone maker said it believes ""user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal — leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.”
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google was not immediately available for comment. 
Adam Hodge, spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office, said U.S. officials were still considering how to balance the views of the U.S. tech companies with the Biden administration's push to increase competition in the industry.
""We are engaging a range of stakeholders to gather facts as legislation is considered in Korea, recognizing the need to distinguish between discrimination against American companies and promoting competition,"" Hodge said.
Both Apple and Google have faced global criticism because they require software developers using their app stores to use proprietary in-app payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases.
""For gaming apps, Google has been forcing app developers to use its own payment system ... and it wants to expand its policy to other apps like music or webtoon,"" said Kwon Se-hwa, a general manager at the Korea Internet Corporations Association, a nonprofit group representing Korean IT firms. 
""If the new bill becomes the law, developers will have options to use other independent payment systems,"" Kwon said.
Naomi Wilson, vice president of policy for Asia at the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that includes Apple and Google, said the legislation would violate South Korea's multilateral and bilateral trade commitments.
""If enacted, the bill would present challenges both for app developers and app stores seeking to do business in the Korean market,"" she said, urging Korean legislators to re-examine the obligations for app markets and ensure they do not disproportionately affect U.S. companies.
The European Union last year proposed the Digital Markets Act, taking aim at app store commissions. The rules are designed to affect large companies, but some European lawmakers are in favour of tightening them to specifically target American technology giants, Reuters reported in June https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-tech-rules-idCNL2N2NJ22A.
Earlier this month in the United States, a bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-rein-apple-google-app-stores-2021-08-11 that would rein in app stores of companies that they said exert too much market control, including Apple and Google.
In South Korea, the home market of Android phone maker Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, Google Play Store earned revenue of nearly 6 trillion won ($5.15 billion) in 2019, according to a government report published last year. 
Earlier this year, Google said it would lower https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-play-idUSKBN2B82B1 the service fee it charges developers on its app store from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million they earn in revenue in a year. Apple has made similar moves.
For Apple too, commissions from in-app purchases are a key part of its $53.8 billion services business, and are a major expense for some app developers. 

In May, an antitrust lawsuit filed by the maker of the popular game Fortnite against Apple revealed that the game maker paid $100 million in commissions https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-made-more-than-100-mln-commissions-fortnite-executive-trial-2021-05-19 to Apple over two years.

On the economic front, new home sales rose 1.0% in July to 708,000 units, missing forecasts for 3.1%. On annualized basis, sales fell 27.2% following a 16.5% decline in June. 
In others, House Democrats broke the impasse, approving a $3.5 trillion budget resolution package.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 03:50PM ET</span>",Apollo seeks $500 million fund to invest in SPACs -sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc is raising $500 million for a fund to invest in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), the buyout firm's latest move to capitalize on the investment trend, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Apollo's fund, one of the first of its kind, will buy stakes in the initial public offerings and private placements of SPACs, as well as provide liquidity to SPAC managers by acquiring their founder shares, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. 
An Apollo spokesperson declined to comment.
SPACs are shell companies that raise money from stock market listings with the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
They exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as retail investors snapped up many of their offerings. But investor interest has subsided in recent months amid a U.S. regulatory crackdown over their disclosures, investor lawsuits and many cases of weak financial performance. 
Only 14 out of 144 announced SPAC deals are currently trading above the IPO price of $10 a share, SPAC Research data showed.
The SPAC and New Issue ETF, which invests at least 80% of its assets in SPACs, has fallen by roughly 2% since mid-June, despite the wider stock market rally. From February, the height of the SPAC boom, the ETF is down 12%, according to Refinitiv.
Apollo has launched its own SPACs. One of them, Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp, merged with Fisker Inc last year, valuing the electric vehicle maker at $2.9 billion. Fisker shares on Tuesday afternoon were trading at around $13.78, down from a high of $28.50 in late February.

Earlier this year, another Apollo-backed SPAC, Spartan Acquisition Corp II, announced plans to take Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc public in a deal valuing the solar panel lender at $1.3 billion. Sunlight shares have tumbled, trading at $5.46 on Tuesday, roughly half the original IPO price.
Apollo has $471.8 billion in assets under management in credit, private equity and real estate.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500and NASDAQ Composite were on track to hit record closing highs on Tuesday in the final hour of trading, lifted by oil and travel stocks as full regulatory approval for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine stoked hopes for a recovery sooner rather than later.
Cruise operators including Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (NYSE:CCL) rose, as did shares of casino companies MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) and Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN). Airlines also rose.
Soaring Covid-19 infections linked to the highly contagious Delta variant has shaken Wall Street this month on concerns about a slowing economic recovery.
On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval of the vaccine, which  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) is distributing with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), offering hope that more people would get their shots and halt the spreading virus.
Later this week, Federal Reserve officials will kick off their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where Chair Jerome Powell could offer some hints about the central bank’s next policy moves. Many anticipate the Fed will begin to scale back its monthly bond buying, but when and how much is still a matter of debate.
Analysts were also watching for the release of oil inventory data for last week, first on Tuesday by the industry and second on Wednesday from the government. That could set the tone for oil trading and oil stocks going into the Labor Day weekend.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>",FTC urges judge to unwind $7.1 billion Illumina-Grail merger,"By Mike Scarcella
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it seeks to unwind life science company Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc, alleging it would harm innovation and boost prices. 
FTC senior counsel Susan Musser said in her opening statement at a trial in Washington that cancer test-detection company Grail and its competitors rely on San Diego, California-based Illumina's DNA sequencing technology. She argued that Illumina's purchase of Grail would give the company the ""incentive and ability to foreclose downstream rivals.""
Antitrust lawyers are closely tracking https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/illumina-grail-deal-heads-ftc-trial-eu-weighs-penalty-2021-08-23 the FTC trial as a rare enforcement action against a ""vertical"" merger in which two companies are not direct competitors. The FTC's witnesses are expected to include representatives from other companies competing with Grail.
""Evidence will show that the war on cancer, if it is to be won, will be won by competition, not by this acquisition,"" Musser said. Grail is in an ""innovation race"" to develop and market its early-detection test, she added, and Illumina would have the power to ""anoint"" Grail the winner if the deal is not canceled.
Illumina, founded in 1998, owned Grail but spun it off in 2016 while retaining a 12% ownership stake. 
Illumina and Grail closed their merger last week, saying no legal barrier blocked the deal. European antitrust regulators said https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/illumina-eu-antitrust-sights-over-premature-8-bln-grail-deal-2021-08-20 on Friday they ""deeply regret"" the closure prior to regulatory approval.
Illumina's attorney, David Marriott of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said in his opening statement that the ""reunion"" of Illumina and Grail would accelerate the development and adoption of an early cancer-detection product.

""The FTC's theory asks the court to forego the life-saving benefits of this transaction to avoid the potential harm that could not possibly occur for years - that could only occur, we submit, if other tests actually in fact ultimately are developed,"" Marriott said. He said the FTC theory ""needlessly gambles with human lives.""
A lawyer for Grail said at trial that the company's merger with Illumina will provide the fastest way toward ""widespread commercial acceptance"" of its multi-cancer early detection test, which relies on a blood draw.

Read on.The solar industry has witnessed solid growth over the past decade, with a significant increase in the residential installation of solar panels and green energy initiatives across several sectors. However, the industry still faces severe challenges related to efficiency and reliability. For example, even with recent technological advances, the average solar panel is only 17% - 19% efficient.

U.S. crude futures climbed 5.6% in New York on Monday, the biggest one-day advance since March. With concerns about China’s wealth crackdown easing, investors rushed into stocks and commodities. Meanwhile, the world’s most populous nation quashed domestic virus cases to zero while U.S. regulators granted full approval to the nation’s most widely used Covid-19 vaccine. 
“Today is a big snap back,” said Leo Mariani of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.  
Oil’s scorching rally over the first half of the year ran into stiff headwinds in recent weeks on concerns the resurgent virus could prompt OPEC and its allies to pull back on supply increases. Traders will be watching the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole symposium that starts later this week for clues to any changes in policy by central bankers.
“We’ve seen quite some pressure in recent weeks with Covid dominating headlines again,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro Bank. “So that could also explain a big part of today’s support. Bargain hunting and a spillover from the positive sentiment in other asset classes.”
The delta variant has also weakened the oil futures curve. The prompt timespread for Brent was 44 cents a barrel in backwardation -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones. That compares with 92 cents at the end of July.

1094,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",Is it Time to Buy Silver?,"Silver has performed poorly so far in 2021 with an 11% loss YTD. This is despite many positive catalysts including rising inflation and dovish monetary policy. Taylor Dart explains whether it's time to buy the dip.It’s been a rough year thus far for investors in the precious metals space and especially disappointing for those believing that inflation would unlock the key to higher prices for gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) and silver (SLV). Despite multi-year high inflation readings and negative real rates diving deep into negative territory, gold and silver are down year-to-date and have tested their year-to-date lows in Q3. The only good news is that this recent correction has put a massive dent in bullish sentiment and looks like it may have been the capitulation the metals needed to finally shake out the last of the weak hands. This is evidenced by three consecutive low double-digit readings for bullish sentiment last week and a medium-term bullish sentiment reading that’s dipped to new 2-year lows. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
As shown in the chart above, the medium-term moving average for silver sentiment has slid to its lowest levels since early 2019, currently sitting at a reading of barely 25%. This is a massive sea change from six months ago when market participants were trying to incite a squeeze in silver, and the medium-term moving average soared above 75% bulls, with three bulls for every one bear in the market. With this reading now reversed (three bears for every one bull), sentiment has finally become a tailwind, with further weakness likely to present a buying opportunity. This is because when bearish sentiment dominates a market, there’s few left to sell or short. Based on history, sentiment can always get worse, but for the first time in two years, sentiment for silver has flipped to a contrarian bullish reading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retailers from Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) to  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), keen to see the apparel sales momentum of the second quarter keep going, are stocking shelves not just with clothing for the office and school, but for a return to Zoom calls as COVID-19 infections surge in the United States.
Retailers saw a spike in sales of dresses, sport coats and children's clothing in the second quarter as pandemic restrictions lifted. Now, the rapid spread of the Delta variant https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/delta-spreads-like-wildfire-doctors-study-whether-it-makes-patients-sicker-2021-08-02 in the United States is delaying the return to offices and threatening the return of in-person learning.
Durand Guion, head of Macy's fashion office, said that as customers continue to shop for ""above-the-keyboard"" clothing for video calls, they are also ""trying to build a wardrobe to get back a bit of normalcy in their life,"" including styles for special occasions.
Christina Hennington, Target's executive vice president and chief growth officer, said on the company's second-quarter earnings call that the discounter is preparing inventory for hybrid schooling environments after a strong start to the back-to-school season.
""As college freshmen look to move on to campus for the first time, our merchandising and inventory plans account for the fact that many sophomores find themselves in that same position, having attended their first year of college in a completely virtual environment,"" Hennington told investors. 
According to research firm NPD Group, unit sales volume for U.S. apparel rose 12% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
Grade-school children are revamping their pandemic wardrobes with graphic tees and looser denim jeans, while parents' styles are merging business and comfort with ""smart casual"" dress shoes, blouses and slacks to mimic their hybrid remote-work schedules, said Keith Jelinek, managing director of the retail practice at Berkeley Research Group. 
Consumers are trickling back to the office seeking a wardrobe fit for corporate life, but comfortable enough for home offices, Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel analyst at NPD Group, said. 
White House Black Market's senior vice president of design and merchandising, Kirsten Bowen, said shopping trends show customers ""want to pull themselves together again."" White House Black Market is owned by Chico's FAS (NYSE:CHS) Inc. 
Male shoppers are also sprucing up with polo shirts, sport coats, trousers, denim and shoe purchases, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) CEO Patrice Louvet added in a post-earnings call.

Hybrid work models have shifted office dress codes, according to a survey from NPD group. Thirty-five percent of U.S. consumers now have a casual dress code at work, a 7 percentage-point increase from pre-pandemic levels. 
Guion of Macy's Inc said that as corporations continue to experiment with hybrid models, office clothing will ""evolve over the next 12 to 18 months. It will not happen overnight.""

In raising his price target for the index to 4,825 points, Wells Fargo analyst Christopher Harvey said S&P 500 firms had so far seen their earnings per share forecasts raised by 21% ""and the trend shows no sign of abating.""
With the second-quarter U.S. reporting season nearly completed, Refinitiv data shows that about 87% of S&P 500 companies have beaten analysts' profit expectations, the highest on record.
The stunning rebound in corporate profits and a loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve have helped Wall Street's main indexes hit new highs following the coronavirus-driven crash last year.
The S&P 500 has more than doubled since its pandemic-lows in March 2020, although gains have recently been capped by fears the Fed could begin to taper its massive stimulus program sooner than expected. The index is up about 19% so far this year.
""If and when the Fed does finally utter the T-word (taper), we would expect the market to take a step back,"" Harvey said in the note to clients.
All eyes this week are on the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium this week. (N)
UBS analysts also raised their S&P 500 targets for end-2021 to 4,600 from 4,500 and introduced an end-2022 target of 5,000 in a note published on Sunday.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a Tuesday interview that he envisions the enhanced disclosures being included in corporations’ annual reports beginning early next year. The new details would likely include information about the businesses’ shell-company structures, he added.
Investors need “full and fair disclosure,” Gensler said. “Are the disclosures really fit for the times about the regulatory risks, the various political risks?” 
The heightened requirement marks the SEC’s latest response to Beijing’s clampdown on private industry. The moves, including enhanced security reviews of companies pursuing foreign listings, have shocked Wall Street and triggered a deep sell-off of many Chinese stocks trading in the U.S. 
Last month, Gensler said the SEC would halt new IPOs from Chinese companies until they bolster disclosures.

Indeed, Wall Street analysts expect consumer goods stocks Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Lands' End (LE), and Citi Trends (CTRN) to gain more than 60% in price in the near term. So, let’s examine these names.Consumer goods companies have witnessed strong demand in the second quarter of 2021 owing to rising discretionary spending driven by stimulus checks and an improving job market. According to a McKinsey & Company report, pent-up demand and spending on discretionary drove spending to a 20% - 30% year-over-year increase in the second quarter.
While concerns over a slowdown in economic growth due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and rising inflation is expected to keep the market volatile in the near term, many consumer goods stocks are well-positioned to dodge any short-term fluctuations based on their ability to capitalize on the pent-up demand for discretionary goods.
Robust digital infrastructure and impressive product launches should allow consumer goods companies Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) (ADDYY), Lands' End, Inc. (LE), and Citi Trends, Inc. (CTRN) to generate rising sales in the coming months. Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect their stocks to rally by more than 60% in the coming months.

So, Wall Street analysts expect mining stocks Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Vale S.A. (VALE), and Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK) to rally in the coming months. Read on for a closer examination of these stocks.Metals prices have declined recently from their sky-high levels. China’s slower economic growth over the past few months and decrease in demand for steel, among other factors, is partly responsible for the price decline.
Nevertheless, an increasing demand for precious metals as a haven amid growing uncertainties surrounding the global economic recovery and an increasing need for other metals for construction and infrastructure activities should benefit many metals and mining companies. In addition, the $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the Senate on August 10 is expected to boost the demand for metals and mining products.
So, Wall Street analysts expect metal and mining stocks Rio Tinto Group (RIO), Vale S.A. (VALE), and Teck Resources Limited (TECK) to rally by more than 30% in the near term.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -A.P. Moller-Maersk said on Tuesday it had ordered eight vessels which are able to run on carbon-neutral methanol to accelerate the decarbonisation of its fleet and meet increased customer demand for greener transportation.
The Danish company has vowed to only order new vessels which can use carbon-neutral fuel as it seeks to deliver net-zero emissions by 2050. As vessels typically have a lifetime of 20-35 years, this means it must have a carbon-neutral fleet by 2030.
The eight vessels, which can each carry 16,000 containers, will be build by South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries and are expected to be delivered by early 2024. 
The vessels will be 10-15% more expensive than normal ones and will each cost $175 million, Maersk's head of fleet technology Ole Graa Jakobsen said.
The new vessels will be fitted with engines which can run on both green methanol, which is produced by using renewable sources such as biomass and solar energy, as well as normal bunker fuel as there is still not enough carbon-neutral fuel available in the market.
So-called green methanol can be produced either directly from biomass or via renewable hydrogen combined with carbon from either biomass or carbon capture.
Maersk said more than half of its 200 largest customers, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), had set or were in the process of setting targets to cut emissions in their supply chain. 
""We're in it for our customers ... and thankfully they are very appreciative of this and demand is really growing,"" Maersk's head of decarbonisation Morten Bo Christiansen told journalists. 
Maersk said the new vessels would result in annual CO2 emissions savings of around 1 million tonnes or close to a 3% reduction. Last year Maersk emitted 33 million tonnes of CO2.

With around 90% of world trade transported by sea, global shipping accounts for nearly 3% of the world's CO2 emissions.
The Danish firm said this month it had signed a contract securing green methanol to operate its first carbon-neutral ship in 2023 in a first step to tackle the challenges in securing the adequate supply.

However, some appear to have lost momentum lately due to strong competition and uncertainties surrounding the potential for cannabis’ federal-level legalization. Hence, we believe investors are better off avoiding cannabis stocks Flora Growth (FLGC) and Hexo (HEXO (NYSE:HEXO)), which have declined more than 24% in price over the past week. Read on.Owing to increasing state-level legalization of cannabis in the United States and the growing acceptance of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes, the cannabis industry has been gaining steam. The global legal cannabis market is expected to reach $91.5 billion by 2028, delivering a 26.3% CAGR.
While many players in the cannabis space have been taking advantage of the industry tailwinds, some are struggling to stay afloat due to intense competition for market share. Furthermore, given that the industry continues to face barriers owing to the Senate’s disagreement over the decriminalization of marijuana at the federal level, cannabis stocks could witness significant volatility in the near term.
Given this backdrop, we think it is best to avoid cannabis stocks with weak fundamentals and poor growth prospects. Flora Growth Corporation (FLGC) and Hexo Corp. (HEXO) possess these characteristics and have declined more than 24% in price over the past week. So, these two stocks are best avoided now.

So, established real estate services companies FirstService (NASDAQ:FSV) and Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) should witness rising demand. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.FirstService Corporation (FSV) in Toronto, Canada, provides residential property management and other essential property services to residential and commercial customers in the United States and Canada. The company operates in two segments: FirstService Residential and FirstService Brands. In comparison, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (OPEN) in San Francisco operates a digital platform for residential real estate in the United States, enabling consumers to buy and sell homes online.
The continuing low-interest-rate environment, and the desire to move to bigger and better living and remote-working spaces, have increased the demand for real estate services over the past year. Furthermore, after the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure package on August 10, the Senate has turned its attention now to a $3.5 trillion measure that could include more extensive investments in housing and changes to zoning policies. According to a SpendEdge report, the real estate agents and brokerage services market is expected to grow at a 4.8% CAGR from 2020 - 2024. Therefore, both FSV and OPEN should benefit.
OPEN has gained 5.5% in price over the past month, while FSV has returned 3.4%. However, FSV’s 51.9% gains over the past year are higher than OPEN’s 42.9% returns. Moreover, in terms of their past three months’ performance, FSV is the clear winner with 17.7% gains versus OPEN’s 1.9%.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) rose 5% Monday as the company said its new treadmill will begin to sell in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. starting Monday.
The all-fresh Peloton Tread will be available in Germany in fall 2021, a company note said today.
The treadmill will cost U.S. customers $2,495, cheaper than the previous versions. The all-access membership, which enables members to access Peloton content using the Peloton Tread, is separate.
The debut comes after Peloton in early May voluntarily recalled both its Tread and more expensive Tread+ machines over safety concerns, after cases of injury and even a death was reported. There were also instances of the touchscreen falling off the Tread.
Peloton and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recently announced a free repair available for the approximately 1,000 Peloton Tread units sold in the U.S. as part of its pre-launch limited distribution. This repair is also available for all current Tread owners in the U.K. and Canada.
The repair ensures that the touchscreen will remain securely attached to the Tread. New Treads sold after today will incorporate these same changes, according to the note.
The Tread described above is different from the Peloton Tread+ and was only sold in the US. The Peloton Tread+ was voluntarily recalled on May 5. Peloton hasn’t yet set a date for re-commencing sales of Tread+."

(Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Inc forecast stronger annual revenue after beating second-quarter estimates on Tuesday, betting on its online business, drive-thru and new menu items to soften any hit from the COVID-19 Delta variant. 
The doughnut maker's shares rose 2% in extended trading after its first earnings report since returning as a listed company in July. The company also said it plans to raise prices in September to offset higher labor and commodity costs.
Major U.S. restaurants including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have doubled down on their online businesses to cut wait times for delivery and drive-thru, hoping that the lockdown-driven shift to eating at home more is here to stay. 
With the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant driving a resurgence in cases worldwide, using multiple channels for delivery is key, Krispy Kreme Chief Executive Officer Mike Tattersfield told Reuters in a call. 
""You could be closing down your front door but using your drive-thru or using your e-commerce model or using your 'Delivered Fresh Daily' model in the grocery business."" 
The ""Original Glazed"" doughnut maker forecast annual net revenue between $1.34 billion and $1.38 billion, as much as 23% higher than last year and compared with Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.34 billion. 
Across the sector, the easing of coronavirus curbs, reopening of offices and new menu items have allowed chains like Starbucks, McDonald's and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) Co to serve up strong forecasts.
Krispy Kreme has also added new items including doughnuts dipped in  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY)'s chocolate icing to draw in returning customers. 
It expects to pay a cash dividend of 3.5 cents per share for the quarter ending Oct. 3, the company said.

Net revenue rose 42.6% to $349.2 million in the second quarter ended July 4 versus estimates of $333.4 million.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Yale University on Tuesday said it named Matthew Mendelsohn, a veteran money manager from its Investments Office, to oversee the Ivy League university's $31.2 billion endowment less than four months after its long-serving investment chief died.
Mendelsohn, a Yale University graduate who has worked at the investments office for more than a dozen years, is replacing David Swensen, who oversaw the endowment for 36 years and is credited with overhauling endowment investing and adding billions to Yale's coffers.
Mendelsohn, 36, joined the investments office after graduating with a degree in physics in 2007. He most recently managed Yale's venture capital portfolio and contributed to the management of most asset classes in which the university invests.
""In addition to being an exceptional institutional investor, Matt is widely recognized for his ability to build and lead teams and for his devotion to mentoring aspiring investors,"" Yale President Peter Salovey said in a statement. 
Mendelsohn will become chief investment officer on Sept. 1.
Swensen, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Yale, returned to the university after having worked on Wall Street for several years and took a significant pay cut to pioneer investing in hedge funds, private equity and real estate, creating an investment model that became known as the ""Yale Model."" 

His performance - Yale returned 9.9% a year over 20 years ending June 30, 2020 - topped most other endowments and Swensen trained a new generation of investors who have gone on to oversee endowments at Princeton, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bowdoin College.
By growing Yale's endowment from $1 billion when he took over to $31.2 billion, Swensen, who died of cancer at 67, turned Yale into one of the richest schools in the United States, trailing only Harvard University's $41.9 billion endowment.

The stock of the cybersecurity technology company will also be part of Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index and the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index, Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) said Monday.
Being part of the indices means passive investors who manage trillions of dollars will have to include it in their portfolios, as it will now be part of more fund schemes benchmarked against the indices.
The company, which has a market capitalization of roughly $55.5 billion, will replace Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) from the three indices.
Business for cybersecurity firms has boomed in the last one year due to increasing adoption of a hybrid work-from-home-office model by corporates. Demand for cyber security solutions has burgeoned due to the extra security requirements of widespread remote working.

Therefore, we think it could be wise for investors to bet now on shares of ON Semiconductor (ON), Dillard’s (DDS), and COHU Inc. (COHU), each of which possesses solid growth attributes. Read on.Increasing COVID-19 cases due to the fast-spreading Delta variant, rising inflationary pressure, and continued geopolitical tensions related to the government's collapse in Afghanistan have heightened investors’ anxiety over the past few weeks. Consequently, many investors are shifting their focus to quality growth stocks to dodge short-term market fluctuations and benefit from these businesses’ impressive long-term growth prospects. This is evident in the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 14.3% returns over the past three months.
The FDA’s full approval of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine propelled stocks to close higher yesterday. Furthermore, according to Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at the Conference Board, the real GDP growth for 2021 could reach 6% year-over-year. These factors could bode well for already well-performing growth stocks.
So, we think the shares of ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON), Dillard’s Inc. (DDS), and  Cohu  Inc. (NASDAQ:COHU)—companies that possess solid growth attributes—could be ideal bets now.

Furthermore, because the FDA’s full approval of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine could accelerate vaccination rates nationwide, the retail industry is expected to see rising in-store shopping. This, along with the near-zero interest rate environment, we think should drive the performance of small-cap retail stocks The  Container Store  (TCS) and The Cato Corporation (CATO) in the near term. Let’s discuss.The retail industry has benefited immensely from the accelerated pace of economic recovery and increased consumer spending over the past few months. According to the National Retail Federation, retail sales are expected to grow between 10.5% - 13.5% to more than $4.44 trillion in 2021. Furthermore, because the FDA has granted approval to the first COVID-19 vaccine, vaccination rates are expected to improve across the country, boosting in-store shopping activity.
In addition, the declining unemployment rate, continuous government support through fiscal stimulus, and retailers’ strengthening digital infrastructure and home delivery networks are projected to drive the industry's growth.
Moreover, we think small-cap players in the retail space should continue benefiting from the low-interest environment. Therefore, small-cap retail stocks The Container Store Group Inc. (NYSE:TCS) and The Cato Corporation (CATO) could deliver significant upside in the near term.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>","Best Buy sees resilient work-from-home demand, raises sales forecast","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -Best Buy Co Inc said on Tuesday strong sales of home theater systems and work-from-home computer equipment despite market fears of pandemic-fueled growth shrinking prompted it to raise its annual comparable sales forecast, sending its shares up 5%.
The consumer electronics retailer's sales spiked last year when Americans, restricted by stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, raced to buy laptops and other computer accessories for their home offices and remote learning setups.
Best Buy said sustained demand, as well as government stimulus for boosting the pandemic-battered economy, and improving wages helped lift second-quarter comparable sales by 20%. 
The company also forecast a smaller-than-expected fall in third-quarter comparable sales. 
To get ahead of supply chain bottlenecks that have plagued manufacturers and retailers across industries, Best Buy said it stocked up on ""as much inventory as possible"" during the second quarter and was confident it would avoid empty shelves during the crucial holiday season.
It raised its full-year comparable sales growth forecast to 9% to 11% from 3% to 6%. 
""Our original outlook reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out,"" Best Buy finance chief Matthew Bilunas said. 
""Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending, the impact has been less pronounced."" 
The upward revision to its guidance reflect Best Buy's expectation that back-to-school/college and holiday selling seasons will be robust, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Vice President Charlie O'Shea said.

The company earned an adjusted $2.98 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.85 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Best Buy on Tuesday also said it expects to close about 30 U.S. stores this year, compared to roughly 20 closures annually over the last two years.

Analyst John Todaro initiated coverage of the stock with a target of $420, an approximately 62% jump from its current price of $160.
Tadaro expects the company’s exchange business to grow rapidly and sustainably as new investors adopt its crypto assets and services.
Coinbase is the largest crypto exchange by trading volume and the only listed one.
According to the analyst, the exchange’s 2021 revenue is seen 467% higher while the next financial year’s could rise 9%.
Brushing aside concerns that Coinbase charges high fees, Todaro said the company is on the way to establish itself as a “one-stop-shop” for all crypto financial services and the non-commoditized nature of crypto exchanges differentiates them from traditional brokerage firms.
He said Coinbase has become quicker at listing new assets and is setting itself up as the go-to exchange for retail and institutional users.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) and Bank of Montreal kicked off Canadian lenders' third-quarter reporting on Tuesday by exceeding profit expectations, but BMO's revenue-driven results sparked more optimism than Scotiabank's. 
Its earnings beat in the three months through July was propelled almost entirely by lower-than-expected provisions for credit losses, with pre-tax, pre-provision earnings (PTPP) missing estimates as net interest margins declined in its international banking unit.
BMO's better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong revenues thanks to fee growth in Canadian banking and capital markets, with an added boost from the C$70 million ($55.53 million) it released from reserves to cover potential bad loans.
Both had strong wealth management growth.
BMO's shares rose 1.75% to C$130.97 on Tuesday morning, on track for a record close, while Scotiabank's fell 0.1% to C$80.16. The Toronto stock benchmark gained 0.3%.
""Scotiabank's PTPP miss was of particular concern, mostly for international banking, which we continue to view as key to a potential rerating of (its) valuation,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Mike Rizvanovic wrote in a note. 
BMO's strong quarter was driven by ""strength in the bank’s top-line that drove a much better-than-forecast PTPP result,"" he said. 
While declining provisions continue to drive earnings, Canadian bank investors are looking for signs of improvement in lending, particularly as capital markets businesses, which have helped lift profits over the last few quarters, had a mixed performance.
In Canada, Scotiabank's 7% year-on-year loan growth at home, driven by both mortgage and business lending, helped offset a 12% decline in loans overseas. While BMO's Canadian loans increased 5.4% from a year ago, with much of that driven by mortgages, U.S. lending fell 11%. 
Executives at both banks expressed optimism for continued lending recovery, despite elevated deposit levels. 
Those balances helped Scotiabank's Canadian loan write-offs return to below pre-pandemic levels, with write-offs in its international unit expected to return to normal by next quarter, executives said on an analyst call. 
Continued pick-up in loan growth will also be a tailwind against the impact on margins of a flatter yield curve, BMO executives said on their call. 
Scotiabank's pre-tax pre-provision (PTPP) earnings were down 1% both from a year ago and from the previous quarter as net interest margins in its Latin America-focused international banking business fell. 

BMO's PTPP rose 12% from a year ago and 6.8% from the second quarter, helped particularly by higher fee income and growth in Canadian earnings.

Let’s discuss.With a $2.46 trillion market capitalization (AAPL) is the world’s most valuable and most profitable technology company. The price of shares of the iPhone maker have soared 11.7% year-to-date and 16.4% over the past three months.

As the company continues to make significant investments across all its business segments and launch powerful new generation products, it should witness solid growth in users and maintain a robust financial performance in the coming quarters. In addition, major updates to its iOS 15 to further protect user information and enhance their experience and its strategic launches should help it maintain strong sales momentum.

(Reuters) -Healthcare Services Group Inc will pay a $6 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that its failure to account for legal settlements with its employees enabled it to inflate quarterly results, the regulator said on Tuesday.
The SEC said the Bensalem, Pennsylvania-based provider of housekeeping and dining services to healthcare facilities did not set aside enough money in 2014 and 2015 for expected settlements of class-action litigation claiming it violated federal and state wage-and-hour laws.
Had the company properly recorded its settlement costs, it would have missed Wall Street earnings forecasts at least four times and been unable to report multiple quarters of increased earnings per share, thereby misleading investors, the SEC said.
The SEC called the settlement the third in its EPS Imitative, which uses risk-based data analysis to uncover potential accounting and disclosure violations resulting from so-called ""earnings management,"" among other things.
John Shea, Healthcare Services (NASDAQ:HCSG)' chief financial officer since 2012, will pay a related $50,000 civil fine and accepted a two-year suspension from appearing before the SEC as an accountant.

Pinduoduo, which has the biggest e-commerce user base in China, said its profitability going forward was likely to be affected both by intensifying competition and investment in an agricultural sector initiative it launched on Tuesday.
Since being founded in 2015, the Nasdaq-listed company has become a competitive player in China's booming e-commerce space through an approach that melds social media with online shopping to offer attractive discounts. 
In the three months to June 30, it reported net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of 2.41 billion yuan ($372 million) compared with a net loss of 899.3 million yuan a year ago and revenue of 23.05 billion yuan.
Pinduoduo shares jumped 14% when the market opened.
Pinduoduo's profitability has helped comfort investors at a time of heightened scrutiny by China of domestic tech firms on concerns over data privacy and anti-competitive behaviour. Its shares have more than halved in value since February.
""We do not expect profitability to continue,"" Tony Ma, vice president of finance, told analysts on an earnings call. ""We do not think this quarter's profitability should be an indicator, or reference for our future investment in user mind-share and agri-focused infrastructure.""
Chairman and Chief Executive Chen Lei said he expected the competition in China's e-commerce sector which was already ""extremely dynamic and vibrant"" to intensify.
""We are seeing more platforms entering the e-commerce space, so competition is increasing, and will continue to increase,"" Chen said.

The company said it was launching an initiative worth 10 billion yuan to address needs in the agricultural sector and rural areas and profits from the second quarter and future quarters would be allocated to the initiative, ""until the total 10 billion yuan commitment is fulfilled"".

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, helped by rising hopes of a delayed withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve and by a sharp shift in sentiment in China that also supported commodities prices.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 55 points, or 0.2% at 35,390 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4% at a new record high.
The market was supported by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will wait until at least December before it starts to run down its bond purchases, which currently total $120 billion a month. Many who had originally expected Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to signal a 'tapering' at this week's Jackson Hole symposium now expect a more equivocal message.
Chinese ADRs were among the stars in early trading, with  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) rising 5.3% and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) rising 17%, as both Chinese and U.S.-based investors took to bargain hunting after a massive sell-off sparked by regulatory concerns. 
Pinduoduo's rise was all the more remarkable for the fact that the e-commerce company's second-quarter sales grew more slowly than expected, by a mere 89%. While it turned its first-ever profit in the quarter, it said it would give this and its first 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of profits away to Chinese farmers. The move suggests that the company leadership has taken on board warnings of the need to reduce inequality in the country - a realization that may spare it any heavier regulatory intervention in future. 
Elsewhere, JD.com ADRs (NASDAQ:JD) were up 10.7% after reports said that Cathie Wood's ARK Invest firm was sufficiently impressed by its second quarter results to get back into Chinese stocks, which her firm had all but exited earlier in the year. Search giant Baidu ADRs (NASDAQ:BIDU) rose 6.2% and Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) rose 7.6%, also helped by Monday's buyback announcement.
Other stocks benefiting from expanded or accelerated buyback were Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) stock, which also reported a hefty rise in billings due to increased cyber-security demand arising from the spread of remote working, and Cigna (NYSE:CI) stock. Palo Alto rose 16% to a new all-time high, while Cigna rose a more modest 2.1%, still struggling to recover from its 2021 low 
Elsewhere, Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) stock rose 5.6% after beating estimates for its second-quarter profit and forecasting that demand for the many electronic goods most associated with working from home looked set to stay strong, given the continuing uncertainty over the course of the pandemic. With new Covid-19 cases hitting a seven-month high and deaths averaging over 1,000 a day over the last week, a full return to pre-pandemic conditions still seems a long way off.
On a light day for the data calendar, new home sales broke a three-month falling streak to edge up to 708,000 in July. June's figures were revised up by a respectable 25,000 to 701,000.
Oil stocks, meanwhile, were supported by Monday's sharp rally in crude that followed the shift of mood in China.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 1.8%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 0.7%."

MADRID (Reuters) -Santander's U.S. business is to buy the minority stake in its U.S. consumer unit it does not already own for around $2.5 billion, slightly more than it agreed to pay in July.
The deal values the entire Santander Consumer U.S. unit at $12.7 billion, Santander said in a statement.
The offer of $41.5 per share to buy out the stake of around 20% represents an increase of 6.4% from the $39 per share or $2.36 billion it originally offered to pay.
Santander Holdings USA (SHUSA) said Tuesday's offer price http://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid= represents a premium of about 14% to the company's close on July 1, when the deal was first announced.
Santander (MC:SAN) also said it had appointed Ashwani Aggarwal as its chief risk officer to oversee SHUSA and the Santander U.S. businesses.
The buyout comes at a moment when the U.S. economy is in full-swing recovery mode and follows solid earnings by Santander in the United States.
Shares in Santander were down 0.9% at 1223 GMT compared to a fall of 0.6% for the Dow Jones banking European index.
Santander recently offered to buy the 8.3% stake in its Mexican unit that it did not already own as part of its strategy to expand in emerging economies which it hopes will deliver faster growth than its core markets in Europe. 
Santander said the deal would have a negative capital impact of 10 basis points at the group's core tier one capital ratio and would be accretive to its earnings per share by approximately 3% in 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) is promoting its U.S. marketing chief as the burger chain seeks to push growth to younger customers through digital sales.
Morgan Flatley, who helped launch McDonald's ""Famous Orders"" campaign with pop stars including South Korean boy band BTS and rapper Saweetie, will become global chief marketing officer beginning Nov. 1. 
To take over her position running U.S. marketing, the company hired Tariq Hassan, currently chief marketing officer at Petco Inc, McDonald's said in a company-wide note on Tuesday seen by Reuters.
The moves follow the global burger chain's creation of a new unit in July to bring digital, data analytics, marketing, restaurant development and operations under one umbrella.

Investing.com –  Medtronic  stock (NYSE:MDT) traded 2% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as the company revised the lower end of its 2022 guidance for earnings per share after its first-quarter revenue touched $8 billion, ahead of estimates.
The company now sees its adjusted EPS for the year between $5.65 and $5.75 from the previous forecast of $5.60-$5.75.
The company reiterated its revenue growth guidance of approximately 9% on an organic basis.
The revised guidance for EPS came as first-quarter revenue got a boost from people attending to medical procedures that had been put off in the pandemic.
Demand for company’s products targeted at segments like cardiovascular, neurosciences and diabetes rose. There was demand for its spine implants and enabling technology, sutures and hernia product lines and cryoballoon catheters.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 was higher than the analysts’ estimate of $1.32."

More than 300 people died and around 3,000 stores were looted when protests and violence erupted in July, sparked by the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma but later driven by anger over poverty and inequality. 
Sasria, which was set up after private firms stopped underwriting risk relating to political violence during apartheid, currently estimates claims related to the unrest at 18 billion rand ($1.19 billion), according to a presentation on Monday. 
It is relying partially on reinsurance contracts to pay, and the cost of those contracts is now increasing, managing director Cedric Masondo told Reuters by phone. 
""We will increase the rate driven by the increase in reinsurance,"" he said, declining to say by how much. He said the timing of the increase had not been finalised 
A circular communicating the decision to Sasria agents - local private insurers - was published on its website, dated Aug. 4. It said the increase would be effective from Oct. 1. 
As Sasria is the only entity offering insurance coverage for political risks, firms across the country could be in line for higher premiums if they seek protection against losses linked to events like strikes or protests. 
Masondo said it was still deciding whether all clients would be affected. 
The insurer's standard coverage offered by agents runs to a maximum of 500 million rand, while an additional 1 billion rand is available to bigger firms that approach Sasria directly.
Some coverage is also available on the open market, in particular for large corporates looking for protection beyond the 1.5 billion rand maximum Sasria offers. 

A senior executive at one global insurer, who declined to be identified, told Reuters it would also increase its property insurance rates as a result of Sasria's decision.

Investing.com –  Best Buy  stock (NYSE:BBY) traded higher by 4.8% in Tuesday’s premarket as the company revised its guidance once more following better-than-expected second-quarter results.
The company had last revised its forecast in May.
Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remained very strong as people looked for solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home. Overall strong consumer spending ability, aided by government stimulus, improving wages and high savings levels also bolstered demand, he said.
The electronic goods retailer revised its forecast for enterprise comparable sales growth in 2022 to 9%-11% from 3%-6%. Enterprise revenue is now seen between $51 billion and $52 billion.
Barry said consumer appetite for upgrade remains elevated, owing to changes in technology and the adoption of hybrid work and streaming entertainment content.
Enterprise comparable sales rose 20% in the second quarter and enterprise revenue was 16% higher at $11.84 billion. Adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.98 and comfortably surpassed the $1.89 estimate put out by analysts.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 07:41AM ET</span>","Battery pioneer Akira Yoshino on Tesla, Apple and the electric future","By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Akira Yoshino, a co-winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on lithium-ion batteries, can take credit for the upheaval in both the automotive and technology industries.
Lithium-ion batteries have provided the first serious competition in a century to fossil fuels and combustion engines for transportation. Now an honorary fellow at Asahi Kasei, the Japanese chemical firm where he has worked for nearly 50 years, Yoshino sees more disruption ahead as transportation and digital technology become one industry, sharing lithium battery technology.
Yoshino spoke with Reuters about about the next generation of electric vehicle batteries, the potential for shared autonomous electric vehicles that can charge themselves, the prospects for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the possibility that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could lead the convergence of the automotive and information technology industries in future mobility.
Here is an edited transcript:
Reuters: What technical innovations — in design, in chemistry and materials, even in processes — might keep lithium ion as the dominant EV battery chemistry and for how much longer?
Yoshino: There are two major areas of innovation that would be the key. One would be new cathode materials and anode materials. The second one would be the system where the EV is used. In other words, how people will be using the EVs, and how they charge them and discharge them. 
Reuters: Are you speaking of people using electric vehicles in different ways? That is, not owning vehicles, but paying per use, for instance, through ride sharing?
Yoshino: Yes, I think the biggest potential is in sharing. If autonomous electric vehicles can become practical, that will cause a huge change in the way people use vehicles. 
Reuters: How long before wireless charging of electric vehicle batteries will become a reality, whether it's through the roadbed or solar panels on the vehicle or some other means? 
Yoshino: The basic technology for wireless charging is not a problem. The problem is how to apply this in a practical system. There are two possibilities. One is cars that are parked in a certain place where wireless charging is available. The second one is while the car is moving. It's probably not going to be on every road, but on certain roads where this is available, that could be possible.
If you think of autonomous electric vehicles, the vehicles will know when they need to charge and on their own just go to the charging station. That kind of situation can be practical sooner than you think. 
Reuters: Toyota and Honda are selling small numbers of fuel cell electric vehicles, but the hydrogen infrastructure to support fuel cells seems like it's many years away.
Yoshino: With the fuel cell vehicle, there are challenges on the technology and the costs, but you can overcome them. If you think about the longer term, 2030 to 2050, autonomous shared vehicles are going to come about. Hypothetically, an autonomous vehicle could be run by a gasoline engine, it could be electric, it could be a fuel cell. It doesn't matter what the power source is. But it needs to replenish its energy somehow. If the vehicle can't do that automatically without a human intervention, the system is kind of meaningless. The same thing would be true for gasoline or hydrogen. 
In that sense, the electric vehicle is the one that can replace its energy automatically. If you think of the Roomba vacuum cleaner, this goes around the room and it goes and recharges itself. If the Roomba needed a person to come and ""fill up the tank,"" nobody would want to buy the Roomba. 
Reuters: What else should we know about the future of mobility? 

Yoshino: Right now, the auto industry is thinking about how to invest in the future of mobility. At the same time, the IT industry is also thinking about the future of mobility. Somewhere, sometime, with the auto industry and the IT industry, there is going to be some kind of convergence for the future of mobility. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has their own independent strategy. The one to look out for is Apple. What will they do? I think they may announce something soon. And what kind of car would they announce? What kind of battery? They probably want to get in around 2025. If they do that, I think they have to announce something by the end of this year. That's just my own personal hypothesis.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. SEC to scrutinize firms' digital-engagement practices as investor worries grow,"By Katanga Johnson and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will seek input on whether digital customer engagement innovations used by financial firms should be governed by existing rules or may need new ones, commission chair Gary Gensler told Reuters.
While the SEC's thinking on the subject is at an ""early stage,"" its rules may need updating to account for an artificial intelligence-led revolution in predictive analytics, differential marketing and behavioral prompts designed to optimize customer engagement, he said.
The SEC plans to launch a sweeping consultation in coming days that could have major ramifications for retail brokers, wealth managers and robo-advisers, which increasingly use such tools to drive customers to higher-revenue products.
""We're at a transformational time. I really believe data analytics and AI can bring a lot of positives, but it means we should look back and think about what does this mean for user interface, user engagement, fairness and bias,"" said Gensler. ""What does it mean about rules written in an earlier era?"" 
The consultation was partly sparked by January's meme stock saga, which resulted in intense scrutiny of retail broker practices, including ""gamification"" -- game-like prompts designed to optimize customer engagement.
Gensler told Congress in a May hearing about the saga that the SEC would seek public input on gamification.
He now says the agency should examine the gamut of digital-engagement practices. While such features can increase consumers' access to capital markets, they may also expose them to increased risks. 
Certain behavioral prompts could potentially be considered investment advice and regulated as such, he added. 
""These digital engagement practices raise questions as to when marketing becomes advice, when is it a recommendation, what's the duty of care?"" said Gensler, who was previously a professor at MIT where he taught classes on financial technology.
Gensler echoed a growing worry among regulators that such tools may perpetuate discriminatory behavior. With some marketing practices, for example, companies customize product offerings and prices to customers' preferences and profile.
""The data that's coming in to these data analytics, whether it be machine learning or deep learning, will represent the biases in society, as they exist already,"" he said.
SPACS
Since becoming SEC chair in April, Gensler has set out an ambitious agenda, pursuing new climate change and workforce related disclosures, cracking down on the boom in special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, deals and increasing scrutiny of U.S.-listings of Chinese companies.
Gensler said the SEC's planned new SPAC rules would enhance disclosures, particularly regarding the costs of deals and how later stage investors would be diluted.
Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years, SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company and take it public, allowing targets to sidestep the more onerous regulatory checks of an initial public offering.

But some critics say later stage investors are getting ripped off by SPAC sponsors, which are also early investors.
""Think about the cost at every stage: at the beginning, the sponsor fees, the underwriting fees, the lawyers' fees. It all adds up to a very intensive and costly process,"" said Gensler.

Investing.com – Cigna (NYSE:CI) stock was up 0.8% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as the company said it will repurchase $2 billion of stock through accelerated repurchase agreements.
Share repurchases generally boost a stock’s price as the number of equity shares gets reduced which increases the earnings to be distributed for the remaining stock.
The ASRs are part of Cigna's existing share repurchase program, which had remaining authority of $3.8 billion as of August 4.
Under agreements with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Cigna will receive an aggregate initial delivery of approximately 7.7 million shares of its stock in exchange for a prepayment of $2 billion.
Final settlement under the ASR agreements is expected to occur in the December quarter. Shares delivered to Cigna under the ASR agreements will be held in treasury or retired.
The company has returned more than $7 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021 so far, combining previously completed share repurchases and increased dividends.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Tuesday, adding to record highs amid renewed optimism over the country’s economic recovery.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 50 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices posted strong gains Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising 1.5% to close at a record high. The broad-based S&P 500 ended 0.9% higher after touching an intraday record high, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 200 points, or 0.6%.
Driving the positive sentiment Monday, continuing into this session, was the news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine jointly developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX). Investors are hoping that this will result in the acceleration of inoculations, just as the highly contagious delta variant has raised concerns about the U.S. economic recovery.
Adding to the optimism has been an apparent reduction in general confidence that Fed chair Jerome Powell will indicate a timeline for winding down the central bank's bond-buying program at the end of the week.
“The question is whether investors want to add to risk positions ahead of Friday's Jackson Hole event. After all, it seemed like some dovish comments from the Fed's Robert Kaplan on Friday really turned the short-term trend - offering the prospect of a delay in the start of the tapering cycle,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
There are some retail names still to report second-quarter earnings Tuesday, with electronics retailer  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) set to release numbers before the opening bell. Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is due after the closing bell. 
The economic data slate centers around the housing market, with new home sales for July due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT). Monthly sales are expected to rise 3% following a 6.6% decline in June.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher, with investors awaiting U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, amid expectations for a hefty fall in inventories. This report comes a day before the official government weekly petroleum data.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $66.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.9% to $69.65. Both contracts jumped more than 5% on Monday after recording their biggest week of losses in more than nine months last week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,807.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1742.

Sheng Ronghua, vice minister of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), made the comments at a State Council briefing on Tuesday, when asked how the rules would affect such firms as well as those involved in foreign trade.
The rules are to take effect on Sept. 1, the day when the country's new data security law will also be implemented. 
""The rules are published to protect the safety of critical information infrastructure and all companies, no matter what kind they are or where they are listed, must comply with the country's laws and regulations,"" he said. 
Chinese regulators have stepped up their oversight of internet platforms in recent months and have signalled that they want to sharpen their scrutiny of overseas listings. 
Last month, the CAC proposed draft rules calling for companies with more than a million users to undergo security reviews before listing overseas. 

The regulator has also launched a data-related cybersecurity probe into Didi Global, citing a need to protect national security, just days after the company raised $4.4 billion in an initial public offering in the United States. 
Reuters reported last week that Chinese regulators are considering pressing data-rich companies to hand over management and supervision of their data to third-party firms if they want U.S. stock listings.

 Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) was up 11% in Tuesday’s premarket trading, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) 8% and Didi (NYSE:DIDI) 6.7%. Tencent Music (NYSE:TME) gained 5.8% and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) 5.2%.
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) was higher by 4.7% as second-quarter revenue beat estimates.
The announcement of a share buyback worth up to $1 billion, meanwhile, had boosted the share price of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) on Monday. 
Stocks of electric vehicle manufacturers Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) gained 3% and 2.2%, respectively.
Edtech shares, among the most battered of the lot, jumped too. Gaotu Techedu (NYSE:GOTU) and TAL Education (NYSE:TAL) rose 6% and 4.2% respectively.
Wood’s Ark Invest was lured back to Chinese stocks by JD.com’s robust second-quarter earnings, which were announced on Monday. Annual active customer accounts increased by 27% and revenue jumped 26% from a year ago at the Chinese ecommerce giant, which also said that it doesn't expect too big an impact on operations from the new regulatory initiatives published in recent weeks.
This was good enough for Wood, one of Wall Street's most enthusiastic backers of technology stocks, to get her ARK Invest fund to pick up some ADRs of JD.com.
U.S. investor interest in Chinese has recently wavered due to signs that the practices underpinning most Chinese listings in New York may be banned by either U.S. or Chinese regulators.
Regulators in China are currently combing their handling of customer data and edtech companies have been advised to go non-profit. China’s President Xi Jinping has advised the country’s rich businessmen to share their wealth with others. The Security and Exchanges Commission head Gary Gensler has meanwhile called for extra transparency in the accounts of Chinese companies, which some fear may be a price too high for Chinese companies to pay for their U.S. listings.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met company executives in Singapore on Tuesday to discuss supply shortages of essential items that have plagued the Biden administration and contributed to inflation.
The United States faced serious challenges in obtaining medical equipment during the COVID-19 epidemic and now faces severe bottlenecks in a number of areas, including semiconductor chips, stalling production of cars and other goods.
The White House has repeatedly sought to increase domestic production of such items but has struggled to alleviate the supply crunch. 
""Ultimately we need to think of it in the context of a national priority around security... a large part of the emphasis for me and then the discussion was about what it means in terms of the needs of families but also the needs of workers,"" Harris said.
She joined a roundtable with executives from companies including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), GlobalFoundries Inc, 3M Co,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore's state-owned investment company. 
It was unclear what specific commitments or partnerships Harris was able to strike with the companies on Tuesday. On Monday, she announced an initiative that includes starting a U.S.-Singapore dialogue on building supply chains.
Bain & Co's U.S. head of technology, Anne Hoecker, said Southeast Asia plays a key role in ""securing a semiconductor and overall electronics supply chain has become a national priority"". Hoecker expects the chip shortage to last through 2022. 

U.S. President Joe Biden ordered the review of critical supply chains in February, requiring executive agencies to report back within 100 days on risks to U.S. access to critical goods like those used in pharmaceuticals as well as rare earth minerals, for which the United States is dependent on overseas sources.
In June, the White House offered little in the way of new measures to immediately ease chip supply shortages. https://reut.rs/2WhdyOI

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Group will invest 240 trillion won ($206 billion) in the next three years to expand its footprint in biopharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robotics in the post-pandemic era, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd said. 
The jewel of South Korea's biggest conglomerate on Tuesday said the investment through 2023 will help strengthen the group's global standing in key industries such as chip-making, while allowing it to seek growth opportunities in new areas such as robotics and next-generation telecommunications.
Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker, said the group plans to solidify technology and market leadership through mergers and acquisitions. It did not provide a breakdown of the investment figures.
The firm did not say whether the latest investment figure includes the $17 billion it was reportedly spending on a new U.S. chip contract chip factory. The plan is 30% larger than Samsung's previous three-year strategy floated in 2018. The group decided to increase investment to retain technological leadership, especially during ""emergency situations"" at home and abroad.
""The chip industry is the safety plate of the Korean economy... Our aggressive investment is a survival strategy in a sense that once we lose our competitiveness, it is almost impossible to make a comeback,"" Samsung Electronics said in a statement.
Chip rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) are making large investments amid a global chip shortage and intensifying competition in the advanced chip segment.
Samsung Group has 59 affiliates with assets totalling 457 trillion won, according to South Korea's Fair Trade Commission.

The investment plan comes just over a week since Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee was released from jail on parole following convictions for bribery and embezzlement.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",Taiwan seeks again to reassure U.S. over tackling chip shortage,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is doing all it can to address the global shortage of semiconductors, Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said on Tuesday after talks with the newly-appointed de facto U.S. ambassador in Taipei, a problem that has idled some auto production lines.
Democratic U.S. senators from Michigan and Ohio last week asked the Taiwanese government to help address the shortage,given that the island is a major semiconductor producer and seen as central to efforts to resolve the problem.
Wang said the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk, had raised the issue of chip shortages during a meeting on Monday.
""I mentioned that Taiwan is doing its best to assist on the chips,"" Wang told reporters in Taipei.
MCU, or microcontroller units commonly used for auto chips, production rose 60% in the first half compared with the same period last year, she added.
""We are working as hard as we can.""
Wang has been personally involved in seeking to get Taiwanese chip makers to speed up production and has repeatedly said the government and industry are doing all they can.
Wang's ministry, responding to the letter on Saturday, said global supply and demand for auto chips should reach a ""balance"" by the fourth quarter of 2021, reiterating its commitment to doing its part to tackle the shortage that has closed production lines around the world.
The issue has taken on a strong diplomatic hue as Taiwan scrambles to reassure the United States, its most important international supporter and arms supplier, that it is doing all it can, especially at a time when Taipei is facing increased military pressure from China, which views Taiwan as its own.

Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, said the auto chip shortage would gradually ease for its customers from this quarter but it expected overall semiconductor capacity tightness to extend possibly into next year.
Taiwan's Foxconn, which assembles Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones, cautioned this month it needed to watch closely whether the worsening COVID-19 crisis in Asia would further rattle the global tech supply chain.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, helped by stronger than expected German growth and the full U.S. approval of a Covid-19 vaccine.
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%.
Economic data released Tuesday showed that the German economy grew more than expected in the second quarter. Gross domestic product climbed an adjusted 1.6% on the quarter, up from its previous estimate of 1.5%, helped by the easing of Covid-19 curbs.
That's a sharp rebound from the first quarter’s decline but gains have been limited given the Bundesbank's announcement on Monday that the country may miss full-year growth targets due to the delta variant. 
Also helping the sentiment in  European markets Tuesday were the strong gains on Wall Street overnight, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumping 1.6% to a record closing high, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (DE:22UAy).
Investors are also keeping a wary eye on the situation in Afghanistan, with leaders from the Group of Seven industrial countries set to hold a virtual meeting later Tuesday to discuss the situation.
However, the main focus this week will be on the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium that opens on Aug. 26, where further clues on the timeline for the U.S. central bank’s planning on asset tapering and interest rate hikes are expected.
In the U.K. retail sector, J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) stock fell 1.7%, handing back some of Monday’s hefty gains on the back of a report that private equity firms were looking at this grocery chain. Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) stock rose 3.2% with this sector seemingly in play.  
Elsewhere, oil prices pushed higher, continuing Monday’s sharp rebound with the full approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine boosting hopes that greater vaccination levels will lead to a boost in fuel demand.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the {{ecl-656||American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, amid expectations for a hefty fall in inventories ahead of Labor Day weekend.

Surging numbers of coronavirus cases caused by the highly contagious delta variant have fueled concerns that the U.S. economic recovery will be stunted, but this move could accelerate inoculations as companies mandate jabs in order to return to the office.

1161,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",China Tech Stocks Rebound on Buying From Cathie Wood and Tencent,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese technology stocks rallied for a second day, as sentiment was boosted by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s stock buyback and as Cathie Wood bought back into JD (NASDAQ:JD).com after a strong set of results.
The Hang Seng Tech Index extended its advance to as much as 5.3%, adding to a gain of more than 2% on Monday, after a five-week rout that took the gauge to the lowest level since inception last year.
While there’s no indication that China’s regulatory crackdown will ease, the absence of significant new initiatives in recent days has helped draw in bargain hunters. Investors are also taking a cue from technical charts that show the index plunged into oversold territory last week. 
“We are seeing lots of bottom-fishing activities in the market, including strong buying of Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA),” said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “Companies that have fallen the most and prove to have solid fundamentals will lead the rebound.”
JD.com’s quarterly sales beating estimates helped turn the market mood, as did Wood’s ARK Investment Management (NYSE:ARKK) buying American depository receipts of the company on Monday. Tencent’s move to continue purchases of its shares added to the positive tone.
Ark’s purchase of JD.com came after the thematic tech-focused global investment firm reduced its China holdings to almost zero this year, and as Tencent bought back 230,000 of its own shares on Monday.
Shares of Tencent, China’s biggest company by market value, rose as much as 7.8% while its rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which dropped to a record low in Hong Kong on Monday, gained as much as 6.1%. JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce giant, jumped as much as 12%, the most since July 29, after its second-quarter revenue beat average analyst estimate.
Meituan (OTC:MPNGY) climbed 12% while  Kuaishou Technology  (HK:1024) rose almost 17%, the most since February.
While investors are still concerned about regulations, earnings such as those from JD.com “have partly offset some of the worries,” Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong, said by phone. “Valuations look appealing if investors want to hold for 6 months or longer.” 
Tencent is Cheaper Than Days of Trade War Doldrums: Chart
The Hong Kong benchmark tracking the biggest technology stocks in China has lost more than 40% since a February peak as Beijing conducted a sweeping crackdown on private sectors to reduce inequalities in the world’s second-biggest economy.  
MSCI Inc., the world’s biggest index provider, shook off concerns about the “investability” of Chinese stocks, citing previous instances where markets rebounded in the aftermath. 
Regulatory compliance has weighed on China “every three, four, five years and obviously the markets have sold off at the time. But very quickly afterwards, the markets have recovered and gone through to new heights,” MSCI Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry Fernandez told Bloomberg Television’s Haidi Lun and Shery Ahn in an interview.
Some investors have taken the opportunity to buy during the selloff. Veteran fund manager Hugh Young of Aberdeen Standard Investments said earlier this month that his firm bought the dip in Tencent and kept most of its other big-tech holdings largely unchanged.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Co is considering acquisitions worth a few billion dollars in total across several sectors, including a real estate developer in Abu Dhabi, its chief executive Syed Basar Shueb told Reuters.
IHC, now the most valuable company on the Abu Dhabi bourse with a market capitalisation of $72 billion, is also considering a 2022 initial public offering (IPO) for its majority-owned healthcare firm Pure Health, Shueb said in an interview. Pure Health has played a pivotal role in screening for COVID-19 infections in the United Arab Emirates.
Shueb also said the tightly held conglomerate, active in sectors from food to leisure, is close to acquiring a second-tier Abu Dhabi property developer, which would add to its indirect minority stake in Aldar Properties. He didn't identify any targets, nor specify how much the real estate deal might be worth.
""All the sectors across the nine verticals we are operating (in), we are looking for an acquisition,"" Shueb said. ""There are a few billion dollars of acquisitions we are looking at.""
IHC is also looking at three or four targets in the food sector, as well as eyeing targets in the healthcare and leisure and retail sectors, he said.
Shueb said the new deals will be funded by bank loans for the first time, while next year the firm plans to issue debut bonds, which would help it secure a credit rating for more transparency.
IHC has reported surging earnings over the past year and a half, and its share price has more than tripled this year to 146.1 dirhams, as of Monday's close. In June, it overtook telecommunications firm Etisalat as the most valuable company on the Abu Dhabi bourse.
Its shares are closely held by a group headed by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates' national security adviser and a brother of the country's de facto ruler, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. Royal Group, whose chairman is Sheikh Tahnoun, owns about 74% of IHC. Tahnoun is also chairman of IHC.
Shueb said IHC plans to list six companies this year in total, giving domestic investors more opportunities in the Abu Dhabi market.
But he said there are no plans to pay dividends. Instead, the aim is for the growth of IHC's operations and investment in its businesses to support a rise in the share price.

""We acquire, restructure, consolidate in our businesses, with diversification and then divestment,"" Shueb said.

Investing.com – JD.com Inc. shares soared more than 10% on Tuesday after the company exceeded sales estimates thanks to improving consumer spending and seemingly undeterred by tightening regulations on the Chinese internet sector.
JD.com shares in Hong Kong (HK:9618) soared 10.10% to HK$268.20 ($41.32) by 12:51 AM ET (4:51 AM GMT). The company’s New York shares (NASDAQ:JD) rose 3.32% to $65.73.
The company recorded a 26% rise in revenue to CNY253.8 billion ($39.1 billion) for the three months ended June 2021. Higher transaction volumes during the annual JD.com 6.18 shopping festival and the double-digit rebound in retail spending in China during the June quarter, also contributed to the better-than-expected results.
However, the latest outbreak of COVID-19 in China slowed down the country’s economic recovery, as much of the country went under strict lockdown towards the end of July.
Although JD.com hasn’t faced a high-profile probe or crackdown since regulations were tightened, its shares have dropped around 40% from a high hit in February as investors retreat from the sector.
“JD has always paid great importance to data security and personal information, so the arrival of the new regulations is not making a big impact on us in terms of our advertising business,” Chief Executive Officer Xu Lei said during a conference call.
However, “we are faced with multiple challenges,” he added.
Meanwhile, medical device maker  Acotec Scientific Holdings  Ltd. (HK:6669) made a dismal debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) on Tuesday. Its shares tumbled 25.13% to HK%17.82, after opening at HK$18.32.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on Tuesday launched a delivery service for other merchants throughout the United States, an announcement that comes as goods sellers scramble to secure deliveries ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season.
Walmart has this year been trialing its first company-branded ""last-mile"" delivery vans, taking a page out of Amazon's play book as pandemic-led e-commerce demand pressures  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and the U.S. Postal Service.
Through its latest program, called Walmart GoLocal, Walmart will dispatch workers from its Spark delivery network to merchants' stores to pick up items and then deliver them to shoppers. Over the past year, the retailer has doubled Spark's coverage to more than 500 cities, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said last week on an earnings call.
""We were looking at different potential revenue streams, ways to commercialize the capabilities and scale that Walmart has - and so we'll think about what that means as this program unfolds,"" said Tom Ward, senior vice president of Walmart's U.S. last mile business.
Walmart declined to give specifics about the program's fee structure, but said it would be ""competitively priced.""
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world's no.1 online retailer, delivers packages via a same-day service called Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) and contracts with van fleets that drop parcels on doorsteps.
Walmart's move comes as traditional carriers are looking at another chaotic holiday season that, like last year, will see them struggling with more packages than can be delivered.

During the holiday peak season, there are expected to be some 5 million more parcels per day seeking delivery than providers able to handle that demand, UPS Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé told analysts in July.
The company, which delivers packages for both Amazon and Walmart, recently said it was exploring super-fast local delivery apart from the pricey express deliveries offered by the company and rival FedEx.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) Chief Executive Satya Nadella will also attend the White House cybersecurity event, Bloomberg News reported https://bloom.bg/3z7Ev5L on Monday, citing sources. 
The chief executives of other large tech companies, banks, energy companies and water utilities, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp,  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) have also been invited, Bloomberg said.

Apple,  IBM , Microsoft and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular working hours. Google did not comment on who would attend and referred to the White House for more details beyond last month's announcement.
In July, U.S. President Joe Biden signed a national security memorandum, launching a new public-private initiative that creates ""performance controls"" for cybersecurity at America's most critical companies, including water treatment and electrical power plants. The announcement came after multiple high-profile cyberattacks this year crippled American companies and government agencies, including a ransomware incident which disrupted gasoline supplies.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 10:00PM ET</span>","Six U.S. states do not join $26 billion opioid settlements with distributors, J&J","By Nate Raymond and Tom Hals
(Reuters) -At least six U.S. states, including Georgia, did not fully sign on to a proposed $26 billion settlement with three drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which have been accused of fueling the nation's opioid epidemic, according to the states' attorneys general.
States had until Saturday to decide whether to support the $21 billion proposed settlement https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/drug-distributors-jj-reach-landmark-26-bln-opioid-settlement-2021-07-21 with McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and a separate $5 billion agreement with J&J.
But in a sign that talks were continuing despite the passing of the deadline, Georgia - the most populous hold-out state - on Monday indicated it could wind up backing the agreement.
""We have not rejected the deal, but we have not joined because at the present time joining the national settlements does not guarantee the best outcome for Georgia and its counties, cities and citizens,"" said an emailed statement from the office of the attorney general, Christopher Carr. ""We remain active in representing Georgia throughout negotiations, and we’re going to continue to get input from Georgia stakeholders."" 
The state will litigate its claims if needed, the statement said.
New Mexico, Oklahoma, Washington and West Virginia also declined to join the deals, their state attorneys general said. New Hampshire agreed to the settlement with distributors but not the J&J agreement.
The complex settlement formula envisions at least 44 states participating, but ultimately the companies get to decide whether a ""critical mass"" has joined and whether to finalize the deal.
The size of the settlement is based on the number of participating states. Those that decline to join will instead seek a larger recovery by continuing to fight the defendants in the courts. The companies have already paid hundreds of millions in verdicts and other settlements.
The deal, which was unveiled by 14 state attorneys general on July 21, aims to resolve more than 3,000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction.
The money would go toward funding treatment and other services.
The companies deny wrongdoing, saying the drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with others, including doctors and regulators.
McKesson said the companies have until Sept. 4 to determine if there is sufficient support for the agreements and said that process is ongoing. Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen declined to comment and J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The support of two other states, Nevada and Alabama, also appeared to be in doubt, according to sources familiar with the situation. 
Nevada's attorney general declined to comment and the Alabama attorney general did not respond to a request for comment.

The participation of states is tied closely to that of their local governments, which brought the majority of the lawsuits. Cities and counties within participating states would have through Jan. 2 to sign on. Ultimately, $10.7 billion of the settlement money is tied to the extent to which localities participate. 
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead negotiator, last month said he expected ""well north"" of 40 states to join.

1169,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>","JD.com Sales Beat Estimates, Defying Chinese Tech Crackdown","(Bloomberg) -- JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. reported sales that beat estimates after consumer spending improved, defying a crackdown on the Chinese internet sector that has dragged on growth across the industry.   
The e-commerce giant’s shares climbed 3.3% in New York after it posted a better-than-expected 26% rise in revenue to 253.8 billion yuan ($39.1 billion) for the three months ended June. But that was the slowest since China first emerged from the pandemic last year, underscoring how Beijing’s crackdown is chilling growth across the country’s tech arena. 
China’s regulators have this year stepped up oversight of a plethora of industries including online commerce, seeking to curtail the growing power of internet firms and share the wealth. They’ve also imposed wide-ranging curbs on the use of personal information, a major source of their influence.
JD executives said Monday they don’t see major impact from curbs on data collection and usage, which tend to affect companies more reliant on advertising. In fact, the banning of merchant exclusivity arrangements -- the so-called “pick one of two” practice once endemic throughout the sector -- has coincided with the return to JD of brands such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), executives said. The Beijing-based firm also called the government’s effort to curb “disorderly capital expansion” good for business, as JD -- known for selling better-quality, more expensive products like electronics -- will less likely get squeezed by a price war.
“JD has always paid great importance to data security and personal information, so the arrival of the new regulations are not making a big impact on us in terms of our advertising business,” Chief Executive Officer Xu Lei told analysts on a conference call.

 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. posted its first revenue miss in years while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. reported the weakest sales growth since 2019, as Beijing widened a campaign to rein in abuses in the e-commerce arena to encompass issues such as data security, online content and most recently, excessive wealth. While JD.com hasn’t been singled out in any high-profile probe or crackdown, its shares have dropped roughly 40% from a February high, as tightening regulatory scrutiny prompted global investors to flee the Chinese internet sector.   
Sales beat estimates after JD.com boosted total transaction volumes for its annual 6.18 shopping festival by 28%, helped in part by the double-digit rebound in retail spending in its home market during the June quarter. But a recent spike in coronavirus cases across parts of China may cloud that recovery, as tough pandemic restrictions hit retail sales toward the end of July.   
Net income tumbled to 794.3 million yuan, down from 16.4 billion yuan a year earlier, after JD ramped up spending on marketing by 56% to sustain growth. The plunge in profit stemmed partly from a 4.1 billion yuan one-time gain that JD booked a year earlier from the IPO of investee Dada Group. On Monday, JD warned about uncertainty in the current quarter, when a resurgence of Covid and extreme weather prompted lockdowns and disrupted logistics across China. The company continues also to push its Jingxi community commerce business, an area in which Alibaba and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. are also expanding aggressively into.
“We are faced with multiple challenges,” Xu said.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
Retail margin may be set back by increased promotions and marketing in 3Q to spur user purchases amid concerns about the Covid-19 delta variant in China. We believe such spending may be needed to lift JD.com’s 3Q active customers by at least 23% year-over-year and meet the consensus for 565 million users by year-end.

In response to the increasing scrutiny and competition, the firm is stepping up investments in areas including online groceries and social commerce as well as infrastructure. It’s been aggressively growing its Jingxi unit, as part of efforts to siphon off the lead that rival PDD has in lower-tier markets. To fund its newer businesses, the e-commerce giant has been spinning off units -- its JD Logistics Inc. raised $3.2 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering in May.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>",Purdue Pharma judge says Sacklers face 'substantial risk' of liability,"By Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) -The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy said on Monday that some members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker face a “substantial risk” of liability and could be on the hook for ""huge amounts of money"" over claims the company fueled the opioid epidemic.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, made the remark during closing arguments in a trial over Purdue’s proposed reorganization plan.
""I think there is substantial risk that the Sacklers, or some of them, could be liable for huge amounts of money,"" said Drain, who added that “the question is where you draw the line.”
Under the deal, which Purdue says is worth more than $10 billion, the Sacklers would contribute about $4.5 billion and receive legal protections against future opioid-related litigation.
Drain did not explicitly state which way he will rule but suggested he finds the deal was sufficient. But he urged lawyers for the Sacklers and the nine states that oppose the deal to continue settlement talks over next couple of days.
More than 500,000 Americans have died since 1999 from opioid overdoses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Drain told Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Fogelman that it would be ""boneheaded"" to reject billions of dollars from the Sacklers just because it is not enough to solve the entire U.S. opioid crisis.
The judge is expected to issue a formal ruling on the deal this week.
The money would go toward various entities and private individuals with opioid claims, as well as state and local opioid abatement programs.
Critics of the settlement argue that the liability releases are too broad. 
An attorney representing the states of Washington and Oregon, which oppose the plan, told Drain on Monday that approving the deal would be a “historic mistake.” 
The judge also stated that appeals courts generally support the types of releases the Sacklers would receive if they meet certain standards.
At the outset of Monday’s hearing, a lawyer for the Sacklers said they had agreed to narrow the litigation releases to exclude protections for the family against non-opioid-related claims.

But the crux of the releases, shielding the Sacklers against opioid-related litigation, remains intact. 
During testimony last week, members of the Sackler family said they would not contribute if they do not receive the releases.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>",Are lithium-ion batteries in EVs a fire hazard?,"By Heekyong Yang
(Reuters) -General Motors Co has expanded the recall of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles due to a risk of fire from the pouch-type lithium-ion battery cells made by South Korea's LG.
The recall, the second major one involving batteries made by LG Chem's battery unit LG Energy Solution (LGES) underscores the challenges facing battery firms in making a stable product to power electric cars.
HOW DOES A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY WORK?
Cells come in different shapes and sizes, but most have three key elements: Electrodes, electrolyte and separator.
Electrodes store the lithium. The electrolyte carries the lithium ions between electrodes. The separator keeps the positive electrode from coming in contact with the negative electrode.
Energy, in the form of electricity, is discharged from the battery cell when lithium ions flow from the negative electrode, or anode, to the positive electrode, or cathode. When the cell is charging, those ions flow in the opposite direction, from cathode to anode.
WHY DO LI-ION BATTERIES POSE A FIRE RISK?
Lithium-ion batteries, whether they are used in cars or electronic devices, can catch fire if they have been improperly manufactured or damaged, or if the software that operates the battery is not designed correctly. 
The major weakness of lithium-ion batteries in electric cars is the use of organic liquid electrolytes, which are volatile and flammable when operating at high temperatures. An external force such as a crash can also lead to chemical leakage.
""For EV fires, it's been always very difficult to pinpoint the exact root cause of the fire, because it is extremely difficult to 're-enact' the fire incident with the same conditions,"" said Kim Pil-soo, automotive engineering professor at Daelim University.
Also authorities, car makers and battery makers often do not disclose what the exact safety risk is.
WHAT CAUSED THE FIRES ON BOLTS AND KONAS?
In February, South Korea's transport ministry said some defects had been found in some battery cells manufactured at the LGES China factory and used in Hyundai Motor's electric cars, including the Kona EV. Hyundai's recall cost about 1 trillion won ($854 million). 
GM said the batteries supplied by LG for the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV may have two manufacturing defects – a torn anode tab and folded separator – present in the same battery cell, which increases the risk of fire.
For a factbox on major battery fires: 
ARE POUCH-TYPE BATTERIES MORE VULNERABLE?
All three types of lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric cars - cylindrical, prismatic and pouch-type - are fundamentally the same in functionality, but each has pros and cons.
Cylindrical and prismatic batteries are cased in hard materials. Pouch-types use sealed flexible foils and are protected by thin metal bags.
The technology used in cylindrical batteries is old and yields consistent results. These cells can withstand high internal pressure without deforming. They are also cheaper, making them ideal for mass production. But they are heavier and their shape stops cells from being packed as densely as with other battery forms. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc mostly uses cylindrical batteries, some supplied by LGES. 
Prismatic batteries are considered safer and lighter than cylindrical cells and, because they are rectangular, can be more densely packed. They optimize space better than cylindrical cells, but are typically more expensive and have a shorter life cycle. They can also swell.
Compared with cylindrical and prismatic cells, pouch-type battery cells allow for lighter and thinner cell fabrication, and design flexibility for different capacities and space requirements for different vehicle models. However, they are vulnerable to swelling, and are more vulnerable in crashes, posing a greater fire risk. 
GM and Hyundai Motor use pouch battery cells from LG Energy Solution (formerly LG Chem). Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said earlier this year it would shift away from pouch-style cells made by LG and SK Innovation Co Ltd to prismatic technology.
ARE THERE OTHER SOLUTIONS?
Companies such as China's BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) produce EV battery cells that use lithium iron phosphate cathodes, which are less prone to catching fire, but are not able to store as much energy as standard cells that use nickel cobalt manganese cathodes.
Others including GM are testing different chemistries such as nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum (NCMA) technology, which use less cobalt, making the cells more stable and cheaper.
Chinese battery maker CATL unveiled last month a sodium-ion battery that does not contain lithium, cobalt or nickel.

A number of companies including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp are also developing battery cells with solid-state electrolytes, which could minimize overheating issues and fire risks, but could take another three to five years to commercialize.

(Reuters) -U.S. energy companies are moving to require that employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations as infection rates rise across the United States and health surveys show that energy workers remain among those most reluctant to get inoculations.
Calls to require vaccinations for employees working at close quarters in oilfield and refinery operations came as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. 
The second-largest U.S. oil producer,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), and refiner  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) will require jabs for certain field workers or new workers, while leading Permian producer  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) is requiring newly hired employees to be fully vaccinated before their first day of work, according to a job posting. 
A spokesperson for Pioneer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Top oilfield services firm Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) said last week some customers were requesting that its staff be vaccinated or tested before arriving on job sites. 
""We continuously review our internal policies and procedures to ensure that we can meet our customers’ needs while prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees,"" a Schlumberger spokeswoman said in an email. 
This month, San Antonio-based Valero became the first U.S. refiner to require vaccinations as a condition of employment for new workers at Texas and Louisiana refineries.
Oil producer Hess (NYSE:HES) said it will require workers at U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1. In a statement, the company pointed to the ""highly infectious nature"" of the Delta variant and rising number of COVID-19 cases in the United States.
Energy and construction workers have some of the lowest vaccine uptake rates, according to an online survey led by Wendy King, an associate epidemiology professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. Some 45% of extraction and construction workers said they were hesitant to get the vaccine, versus just 7.3% in the computer and mathematical professions, the May survey showed. 

Chevron's mandate will cover offshore workers in the Gulf of Mexico, some onshore support staff, expatriates and employees who travel internationally, a spokeswoman said in an email. 
This month, Chevron postponed a full return of office employees in California and Texas because of a resurgence in cases related to the Delta variant.

1176,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 06:27PM ET</span>","Best Buy, Oil Prices, New Home Sales: 3 Things to Watch","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com –  US stocks rebounded sharply Monday following a slump last week, led by a rally in energy and technology.
Tuesday brings further insight into the housing market, and the impact of supply chain woes on retailers.
But oil prices will likely continue to dominate investor attention after staging a strong rally Monday. The jury is out on whether the rally in oil prices has staying power at a time when the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to cloud the outlook on oil demand.
1. Earnings on Watch:  Best Buy  , Nordstrom
Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) will report Q2 earnings before the opening bell Tuesday, against tough comps as the prior-year's Q2 results included cost cuts that helped boost margins.
Still, the backdrop of a robust housing market and strong demand for tech is expected to have boosted the retailer's second-quarter results.
Best Buy is expected to report EPS of $1.89  on revenue of $11.49B.
 Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) will report Q2 results after the closing bell, with its update on outlook likely to garner investor attention.
Earlier this year, the department store chain's quarterly results stoked worries that it was falling behind its rivals. It reaffirmed full-year guidance just as its rivals were painting a more optimistic outlook.
Nordstrom reaffirmed its fiscal 2021 outlook for revenue to grow by more than 25%, and flagged labor and shipping costs as key headwinds.
The company is expected to report EPS $0.27 on revenue of $3.32B.
 Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT),  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU), and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) are also among the notable names set to report quarterly results.
2. API Crude Inventories in Spotlight 
Following the Energy Information Administration's report last week of a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles, investors will look to the American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data for further clues on domestic supplies.
The API is expected to report that weekly U.S. crude stockpiles fell about 1.2 million barrels. The report comes a day before the official government weekly petroleum data. 
Crude oil prices soared Monday, supported by weakness in the dollar, and signs that China is getting handle on the Delta variant of COVID-19, easing fears of a prolonged setback for travel-infused energy demand.
3. Housing Activity Picking Up, Again?
The Commerce Department releases its new home sales data at 10am ET (2pm GMT).
On average, economists expect that monthly sales rose 3% in July following a 6.6% decline in June. On a seasonally adjusted annual rate new home sales are forecast to rise to 700,000 from 676,000 in June, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
Some suggest, however, there could be a negative surprise following data showing a jump in mortgage rates to a one-month high. 
""As for new home sales, expectations are for a small uptick ... [but] mortgage applications suggest a fourth month in sales decline should be expected,"" National Australia Bank said in a note.  "

(Reuters) -Billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit, a small satellite launch service provider, is going public through a merger with a blank-check vehicle that values it at about $3.2 billion. 
The deal with NextGen Acquisition Corp. II, announced on Monday, includes $100 million in funding from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, AE Industrial Partners and others in the form of private investment in public equity, or PIPE. 
Virgin Orbit and rivals Firefly and Rocket Lab are among firms building miniaturized launch systems to capitalize on an expected boom in demand for compact satellites. They offer a unique ""air-launch"" method of sending satellites to orbit.

The rocket has to ""start work"" when it is already at 35,000 feet, reducing carbon use by 90%, Hart said in an interview. 
He added the company was pursuing $4 billion in opportunities and had $300 million in backlogs across contract and launch service deals, among others. It won a $35 million contract in 2020 from the U.S. Space Force for three missions.

Spun-off from Branson's space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc in 2017, Virgin Orbit reached space for the first time in January when it delivered ten NASA satellites to orbit, after a failed attempt last year.
The deal is expected to provide $483 million in proceeds to the combined company, which will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""VORB"" after the merger.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine gains full U.S. regulatory approval,"By Carl O'Donnell and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) -The U.S. drug regulator on Monday granted full approval to the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine - the first to secure such Food and Drug Administration validation - prompting President Joe Biden to make a fresh pitch to vaccine skeptics to get the shot to fight the relentless pandemic.
The FDA, which gave the two-dose vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, provided its full approval for use in people age 16 and older based on updated data from the companies' clinical trial and manufacturing review. Public health officials hope the action will convince unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective. 
There is entrenched vaccine skepticism among some Americans, particularly conservatives. COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels.
Speaking at the White House, Biden called the FDA approval ""an important moment in our fight against the pandemic"" and urged more private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated.
""If you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened,"" Biden said.
""It's time for you to go get your vaccination. Get it today,"" Biden added. ""... There is no time to waste.""
The Pentagon said it is preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for military personnel. 
U.S. health officials expect that the FDA's action also will prompt more state and local governments, as well as private employers, to impose vaccine mandates. New York City said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-mandates-covid-19-vaccine-public-school-teachers-staff-mayor-2021-08-23 it will require vaccines for public-school teachers, while New Jersey announced that all state workers must get vaccinated by mid-October or agree to regular COVID-19 tests.
""While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated,"" said Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner. 
More than 204 million people in the United States have received the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA's approval extends the shelf life of Pfizer shots from six months to nine months. It also confirms that the vaccine increases risk of heart inflammation, particularly among young men in the week following their second shot. 
The approval makes it easier for doctors to prescribe a third dose of Pfizer's vaccine off-label for people who may benefit from additional protection against COVID-19. 
Pfizer shares closed up around 2.5% and BioNTech shares gained more than 9.5%.
The two other COVID-19 vaccines given emergency-use authorization - made by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - have not yet received full FDA approval. 
The FDA gave emergency-use authorization to Pfizer's vaccine for people age 16 and older in December - the first shot to gain such backing in the United States - and provided further emergency-use authorization for people age 12 and up in May. 
SHOTS FOR CHILDREN
Pfizer and BioNTech said they plan to apply for full approval in children ages 12 to 15 as soon as required data is available. 
Woodcock said the FDA is not recommending that children under age 12 get the vaccine now because it needs to ensure it is safe for them, telling reporters it ""would be a great concern if people vaccinate children because we don't have the proper data.""
Pfizer is expected to submit data this fall to support the shot's emergency-use authorization for children under 12 based on smaller doses. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics, representing children's doctors, discouraged having children under 12 receive the vaccine.
Pfizer's shot has received conditional regulatory approval elsewhere including Britain and the European Union.
The United States leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. More than 625,000 Americans have died, including an average of more than 600 daily in recent weeks.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 71% of Americans age 12 and older - the population eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines - have gotten at least one dose and 60.2% are fully vaccinated. For the entire population, including children up to age 11 for whom no vaccines are yet approved, 60.7% of Americans have received at least one dose, with 51.5% fully vaccinated. 

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement the FDA's approval ""affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed."" In Pfizer's clinical trial, approximately 12,000 recipients of the vaccine have been followed for at least six months. The vaccine will now be marketed under the name Comirnaty. 
The FDA on Aug. 13 authorized a third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people with compromised immune systems. Pfizer's shot has not yet been authorized for more widespread use as a booster.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 05:27PM ET</span>",Exclusive: SEC gives Chinese companies new requirements for U.S. IPO disclosures,"By Echo Wang
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has started to issue new disclosure requirements to Chinese companies seeking to list in New York as part of a push to boost investor awareness of the risks involved, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and people familiar with the matter.
Some Chinese companies have now started to receive detailed instructions from the SEC about greater disclosure of their use of offshore vehicles known as variable interest entities (VIEs) for IPOs; implications for investors and the risk that Chinese authorities will interfere with company operations. 
Last month, SEC Chair Gary Gensler asked for a ""pause"" in U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) of Chinese companies and sought more transparency about these issues. Chinese listings in the United States came to a standstill after the SEC freeze. In the first seven months of 2020, such listings reached a record $12.8 billion, as Chinese companies capitalized on the soaring U.S. stock market. 
""Please describe how this type of corporate structure may affect investors and the value of their investment, including how and why the contractual arrangements may be less effective than direct ownership, and that the company may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements,"" said one SEC letter seen by Reuters.
The SEC has also asked Chinese companies for a disclosure that ""investors may never directly hold equity interests in the Chinese operating company,"" according to the letter. Many Chinese VIEs are incorporated in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. Gensler has said there are too many questions about how money flows through these entities.
""Refrain from using terms such as 'we' or 'our' when describing activities or functions of a VIE,"" the letter stated.
An SEC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The SEC has also provided disclosure requirements pertaining to the risk of Chinese regulators intervening with company data security policies, the sources said. Last month, just days after the blockbuster IPO of Didi Global Inc, Chinese regulators banned the ride-sharing giant from signing up new users. This move was followed by crackdowns on technology and private education companies.
The SEC has also asked some companies for more details in cases where they do not comply with the U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act on accounting disclosures to regulators. China has so far prevented companies from sharing the work of their auditors with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Last month, the SEC removed the chairman of the board, which has been unsuccessful in its push to ensure independent auditing of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. 

The SEC's move represents the latest salvo by U.S. regulators against corporate China, which for years has frustrated Wall Street with its reluctance to submit to U.S. auditing standards and improve the governance of companies held closely by founders.
The SEC is also under pressure to finalize rules on the delisting of Chinese companies that do not comply with U.S. auditing requirements.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose while the U.S. dollar dipped on Monday as investors grew less concerned that the Federal Reserve would soon begin changing its accommodative monetary stance.
Market sentiment was buoyed after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine. New cases, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, have surged in parts of the United States with lower vaccination levels. 
The dollar index slid. Last week it hit a nine-month high on bets that the Fed would start shifting away from its accommodative monetary policy, but that view began to change on Friday when Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he might reconsider his hawkish stance if the virus harms the economy.
Now, investors are less confident Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole this week will indicate a timeline for winding down the Fed's bond-buying program.
The dollar index, which measures the currency's performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.516% to 92.999.
""There was a fear that they were going to announce tapering in Jackson Hole and start in September. But it now looks that will be in 2022,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, rose 1.09%. Last week it had its biggest weekly fall since June. Europe's STOXX 600 closed higher at 0.66%.
The U.S. FDA, which had given the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine emergency-use authorization in December, went a step further based on updated data and fully approved it for people age 16 and older. The Pentagon then said it was preparing to make the vaccine mandatory for U.S. military personnel. U.S. health officials now expect more vaccine mandates from state and local governments, as well as private employers.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.61%, to 35,335.71, the S&P 500 gained 0.85%, to 4,479.53 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.55%, to 14,942.65.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.46% higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 1.78%.
""It's a whole combination of factors, the big one being the FDA approval of the vaccine. A lot of people are taking it as good news and then the Fed may not be as keen on tapering as suspected,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.
Oil prices rose more than 5% after seven days of declines. 
Brent crude climbed $3.57, or 5.5%, to settle at $68.75 a barrel after touching its lowest since May 21 at $64.60 during the session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for October delivery rose $3.50, or 5.6%, to settle at $65.64.
Last week, both crude benchmarks marked their biggest weekly declines in more than nine months, with Brent sliding about 8% and WTI about 9%.

Gold vaulted over the key $1,800 psychological level, boosted by the weaker dollar.
Spot gold rose 1.32% at $1,804.3958 per ounce, after hitting its highest since Aug. 5.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 04:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Ford doubles Lightning production target on strong pre-launch demand -sources,"By Ben Klayman and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has doubled its production target for the F-150 Lightning because of strong early demand for the full-sized electric pickup truck ahead of its 2022 launch, and the company plans to spend an additional $850 million to meet that target, several people and suppliers familiar with the plans said.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker is targeting annual production of more than 80,000 in 2024, up from its prior target of more than 40,000, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified. Shares of Ford rose 1.3% on Monday.
""They were pleasantly surprised by the demand for the Lightning,"" one of the sources said of Ford officials.
Industry observers have questioned whether individual buyers will give up their gas-powered pickups for electric models, but commercial customers are pushing for electric trucks and vans to reduce their carbon footprints.
The ramp to the new production target includes plans to build about 15,000 next year after the electric truck's spring launch and 55,000 in 2023, a second source said. Following the launch of the second generation Lightning in late 2025, the annual target is just shy of 160,000.
The increase is on top of the 50% boost Ford outlined last November, the sources said.
Driving the more optimistic targets is strong pre-launch demand for the vehicle, especially with commercial customers, the sources said. 
""We are excited with customer demand for the F-150 Lightning and already have 120,000 customer reservations, and we will continue to look for ways to break constraints and meet customer demand,"" Ford said in a statement. The company declined to comment further.
Ford and other global automakers are racing to shift their gasoline-powered lineups to all electric power under pressure from regions like Europe and China to cut vehicle emissions. U.S. President Joe Biden has called for $174 billion to boost U.S. EV production, sales and infrastructure.
In May, Ford outlined plans to boost its spending on electrification by 2030 by more than a third to over $30 billion. Ford also announced plans that month to form a battery joint venture with South Korean battery maker SK Innovation Co that would open two plants in North America.
Ford's EV strategy is focused on leveraging its strongest brands, with the electric F-150 and Transit van joining the Mustang Mach-E SUV. The gas-powered F-150 has been the top-selling vehicle in the United States for over four decades.
Other automakers with plans to introduce electric pickups include General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, as well as startups Lordstown Motors Corp, Canoo Inc and Rivian. Ford owns a stake in Rivian.
The increased Lightning production target has some suppliers worried about the extra investment that will entail and unsure the demand for electric pick-ups will meet Ford's expectations.

""It really puts suppliers in a dicey situation if the volume doesn't come true,"" said one supplier executive, who asked not to be identified.
The redesigned F-150 Lightning, due in late 2025, is expected to be the first to employ Ford's new TE1 truck architecture, AutoForecast Solutions previously said. The first-generation Lightning uses a platform that is heavily derived from the standard F-150.

FREMONT, Calif. (Reuters) -Self-driving startups like Cruise and Pony.ai have begun testing their driverless cars in some parts of California in the past year, with an additional feature: Human operators.
While there is no driver behind the wheel, the passenger seat is occupied by a safety operator who ""has a red button that can stop the vehicle just in case anything happens,"" Pony.ai CEO James Peng told Reuters.
The operator will be removed next year when Pony.ai, whose investors include  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, plans to deploy its driverless ride-hailing vehicles in certain areas of California. Still, a remote operator will monitor vehicles and provide guidance when the vehicles run into trouble, Peng said. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo keeps personnel wearing fluorescent yellow vests at the ready to provide roadside assistance for its automated minivans in Phoenix, according to videos and to one of its avid riders, Joel Johnson, who has witnessed this. 
Cruise https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-self-driving-car-unit-cruise-access-5-bln-credit-line-2021-06-15, majority-owned by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), started operating five driverless vehicles in San Francisco at night in October 2020 with a human in the front seat. The minder has ""the ability to stop the vehicle at any point during the ride,"" a Cruise spokesman said.
""Cruise views the development of self-driving vehicles as not only a tech race, but also a trust race,"" the spokesman added. ""Given that, we keep humans in the loop in testing driverless vehicles not only as a means of safe development, but also, beyond that, in order to build trust with the public."" 
South Korea's automotive giant Hyundai Motor Group has invested in remote operation startup Ottopia, which will provide remote assistance for the robotaxi fleets by Hyundai's self-driving car joint venture, Motional. 
TESLA TO DRIVERS: 'BE READY TO ACT'
The continued human presence in what are supposed to be software-driven, automated vehicles underscores the challenges facing the automated vehicle industry, which has consumed billions of dollars in investor capital over the past decade.
With no end in sight to the technical and regulatory obstacles to free-range, driverless robotaxis, some self-driving companies are accepting the need for human minders and scaling down their ambitions so they can start generating revenue in the near future, according to interviews with investors and startup executives. 
Even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc , which recently launched a new test version of what it calls “Full Self-Driving"" software https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-ai-day-confronts-tough-questions-about-teslas-technology-2021-08-18, said in a message to owners that drivers should ""be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations.” U.S. safety regulators have opened a formal investigation of the automaker's Autopilot driver assistance system following a series of fatal accidents https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-safety-agency-says-it-has-opened-probes-into-10-tesla-crash-deaths-since-2016-2021-06-17. 
WAYMO'S ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE 
Waymo has been developing self-driving technology for more than a decade, and launched the first commercial robotaxis in Phoenix https://www.reuters.com/article/us-waymo-autonomous-phoenix/waymo-opens-driverless-robo-taxi-service-to-the-public-in-phoenix-idUSKBN26T2Y3 in 2018. But the successor to the pioneering Google self-driving car project still keeps humans in the loop. 
Waymo told Reuters it runs four teams monitoring and assisting the fleet. Duties range from responding to riders' questions to providing, remotely, a ""second pair of eyes"" in tricky situations such as road closures. One of its teams provides roadside assistance to respond to collisions and other incidents. 
The teams ""work together to orchestrate the operation of our fully autonomous fleet throughout the day,"" Nathaniel Fairfield, a software engineer at Waymo, said in a statement to Reuters. 
Waymo does not operate vehicles by remote control, he said.
""We don’t use remote takeover, or 'joysticking,' because we don't think remote humans actually add safety,"" he said, citing potential wireless connection problems. 
Waymo has applied for a permit to start commercial autonomous vehicle operations in San Francisco with safety drivers initially. The company relies on an army of vehicle operators to ramp up testing in the dense and complex city environment. 
A former Waymo operator who participated in San Francisco testing this year said he had to ""disengage"" and intervene roughly 30 times a day in cases including the car failing to stop fast enough for red lights or vehicles in front that abruptly slow down or stop. 
""You are on your toes... There are times where (you think) 'Oh, I did not predict this behavior at all.' 'This behavior doesn't usually happen,'"" said the experienced safety operator, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to confidentiality concerns. 
Waymo publicly reported 21 disengagements over 628,838.5 miles (1.01 million km) of driving in 2020. 
DIRTY LITTLE SECRET 
Regulators are also keeping humans involved with automated vehicles. California laws ""call for a two-way communication link that allows the manufacturer to continuously monitor the (driverless) vehicle’s location/status,"" the California Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement to Reuters. 
Other robotaxi companies are using remote operation as a way to get vehicles on the road. 
In Las Vegas, startup Halo allows customers to summon a driverless car, which is driven by a remote human operator over fast, fifth-generation wireless networks operated by T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. 

""Just a few years back, remote human assistance was a dirty little secret in this space,"" said Elliot Katz, co-founder of teleoperation firm Phantom Auto. ""Virtually no one talked about it publicly because there was still this facade that these vehicles were just going to be able to drive autonomously, everywhere they need to go and do everything that a human driver would do."" 
He added: ""Everyone now knows that's not going to be the case.""

As the demand for residential housing falters, we think it could be wise to now avoid homebuilding stocks PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), KB Home (NYSE:KBH), and Meritage Homes (NYSE:MTH). Let's discuss.The demand for new houses and renovations rose significantly amid the pandemic, with residential construction hitting a 15-year high in March 2021. However, in July building activities took a step back, owing to the continuing supply constraints that construction companies face nationwide. Also, the housing industry has been adversely affected by surging inflation rates, which have raised housing prices substantially.
In July, housing starts declined 6% from the prior month for both single-family and multifamily projects. Supply constraints and elevated input costs are the major factors that led to the slump in the housing industry. According to senior economist George Ratiu at Realtor.com, “Builders pulled back on housing starts, wary of overcommitting on final new home prices in the face of volatile costs for land, materials and labor.”
So we think given the current volatility in the housing market, fundamentally weak stocks PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM), KB Home (KBH), and Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH) are best avoided now.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed to all-time highs Monday, led by energy as oil prices snapped their longest losing streak 2019, while megacap tech made a strong start to the week. 
The S&P 500 rose 1% and hit an intraday record of 4,490, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, or 250 points, the Nasdaq was up 1.6%, after hitting an intraday record of 14,963.5.
Energy rallied more than 3% as oil prices rebounded from near-three month lows, supported by a weaker dollar, and positive pandemic news as China.
China, the world's largest energy consumer, reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time since July, easing investor fears of a prolonged setback for travel and energy demand.
""The coming weeks will reveal whether the travel restrictions that have been imposed in China and other Asia-Pacific countries will really have such an impact on fuel demand as last week‘s price performance suggests,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) were the among the top gainers in energy, with the latter up nearly 7%.
Technology stocks, up 1%, also supported the broader market melt-up as megcap tech continued to add to gains from the tail-end of last week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were up more than 1%. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was roughly flat. 
A climb in chip stocks also bolstered tech as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hit record highs amid ongoing momentum continues following the chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results last week,
Vaccine stocks were also in the greed after the US Food and Drug Administration granted  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s COVID-19 vaccine full approval, sending their shares up more than 2% and 9%, respectively. 
Pfizer also announced a $2.3 billion deal to buy cancer drug maker Trillium Therapeutics (TSX:TRIL), sending the latter's shares more than 180% higher.
On the economic front, investors digested mixed economic data as manufacturing activity fell short expectations, while home sales unexpectedly increased.
The IHS Markit US Manufacturing PMI fell to a reading of 61.2 in August from 63.4 in July, missing economists' estimates of 62.5.
Existing home sales rose 2% in July against expectations for a small downtick.
""[W]e continue to see the current soft patch in housing as a pause that will ultimately elongate the housing cycle,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said, pointing to a lack of supply that is expected to improve in 2022.
The record session on Wall Street comes just days before annual symposium held in Jackson Hole, with Chairman Powell scheduled to speak on Friday. Investor attention will focus on any new clues on the Fed's plan to begin scaling back its monthly bond purchases."

So, popular communication equipment stocks Cisco (CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) should benefit from the industry tailwinds. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in San Jose, Calif., designs, manufactures and sells internet protocol-based networking and other communications and information technology products. In addition, it provides infrastructure platforms, including networking technologies for switching, routing, and wireless products. In comparison, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) in Palo Alto, Calif., is an edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company that offers general-purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload-optimized servers. In addition, it provides mobility and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions under the Aruba brand, including Wi-Fi access points, switches, routers, and sensors.
Since last year, communication equipment has been in high demand as the need for connected and high-end devices increased amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with people spending most of their time at home. Furthermore, communication equipment, such as LANs, WANs, and routers, are expected to continue witnessing increasing demand in the 5G era because remote working is expected to dominate even after the pandemic is beaten. According to a report by Market Research Future, the global telecom equipment market is expected to grow at an 11.23% CAGR by 2025. Therefore, we think both CSCO and HPE should benefit.

(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts on Monday took a largely upbeat view on  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) in their first ratings on the stock as they bet on the online brokerage's ability to boost its user base, days after it warned of easing retail trading frenzy.
At least six brokerages that participated in Robinhood's IPO started coverage after the quiet period following the stock's market debut expired. Three of them rated it ""buy"" or its equivalent and another two recommended a ""hold"" rating.
J.P.Morgan Securities was the lone bearish voice with an ""underweight"" rating, citing several risks, including regulation, pricing, and market saturation.
To be sure, all analysts have raised doubts about the near-term uncertainty about how sustainable the frantic levels of retail trading that fueled its second-quarter growth would be.
But they were largely upbeat when it came to the company's long-term growth prospects. ""We believe HOOD is well-positioned to continue to see best-in-class user growth, leveraging its innovative referral program and strong word-of-mouth customer acquisition,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note, rating the stock ""neutral"".
Robinhood's shares were up 2.25% at $43.64, compared with the median price target of $55, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
""We expect HOOD will be a continued beneficiary of its strong brand recognition among younger investors, built through an effective, incentive-driven client acquisition model,"" Piper Sandler said, starting coverage with a ""neutral"" rating. 

Robinhood's trading app emerged as the gateway for investors seeking to get in on this year's mania for so-called meme stocks, but in its first earnings report as a public company last week it said it expects retail traders to become less active in the third quarter.
""We view Robinhood not as a meme stock phenomenon, but as a singularity that captures Generation Z's zeitgeist,"" Mizuho analysts said, giving a ""buy"" rating.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 01:42PM ET</span>",Pentagon set to make Pfizer vaccine mandatory after FDA approval,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is preparing to issue updated guidance to require all U.S. service personnel to be vaccinated after Monday's approval of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said.
Kirby told a briefing the completion date for vaccine guidance was still being worked on.
The FDA granted full approval https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-grants-full-approval-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-2021-08-23 on Monday to the vaccine, which had earned emergency-use authorization in December, making it the first to secure such validation as U.S. health authorities struggle to win over vaccine skeptics.
Asked if similar guidance could be given for other COVID-19 vaccines, Kirby replied: ""Right now we're focused on the Pfizer vaccine because of the FDA approval that came in this morning."" 
The Pentagon said this month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-seek-approval-make-covid-19-vaccines-mandatory-officials-2021-08-09 it would seek President Joe Biden's approval by mid-September to require 1.3 million military members to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
After setting COVID-19 rules for federal workers, Biden last month directed the Pentagon to look into ""how and when"" it would require members of the military to take the vaccine. Biden said then he strongly supported the Pentagon's plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for service members by mid-September.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the deadline could be moved up if the FDA approved the vaccine earlier.
The U.S. military said this month that around half the U.S. armed forces are already fully vaccinated, a number that climbs significantly when counting only active-duty troops and excluding National Guard and Reserve members.
Vaccination rates are highest in the Navy, which suffered from a high-profile outbreak last year aboard an aircraft carrier. About 73% of sailors are fully vaccinated, compared with the U.S. national average of about 60% of adults ages 18 and over.
Because U.S. service members are generally younger and fitter, relatively few of them have died as a result of COVID-19 - just 28 in total, according to Pentagon data.

We believe the growing demand should benefit Deere (NYSE:DE), AGCO (AGCO), Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), Terex (NYSE:TEX), and Alamo Group (NYSE:ALG) significantly in the near term because they possess efficient and innovative product portfolios and strong fundamentals. So, let’s pore over these names.The growing demand for food products is incentivizing farmers to buy advanced farm equipment and focus on smart farming solutions to achieve better crop yields. Low borrowing costs and debt relief to farmers promised in the approved U.S. budget resolution should enable farmers to buy or replace farm equipment to reduce their production costs and ease operations. The reopening of construction activities is also driving the demand for farm and heavy construction machinery.
This growing demand has propelled companies to manufacture efficient, eco-friendly, heavy construction machinery despite supply chain constraints and rising input costs. Also, the Senate’s passage of the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill will likely favor the growth of companies that manufacture heavy machinery.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on Deere & Company (DE), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), Oshkosh Corporation (OSK), Terex Corporation (TEX), and  Alamo Group Inc . (ALG). They have the potential to capitalize on the industry tailwinds and deliver solid returns in the near-term. Each of these stocks is rated B (Buy) in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.

But, what no one expected was that it would result in a worldwide semiconductor shortage. As we've recently learned, that shortage is expected to continue, which benefits the stock prices of chip stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).A global shortage of semiconductors has turned the industry upside down. The demand for chips was high even before the pandemic started, due to the rollout of 5G. However, the coronavirus pandemic drove that demand much higher as millions bought laptops, cell phones, and gaming devices as they sheltered in their homes. 
While many analysts thought the shortage would get better towards the end of the year as the vaccines rolled out, that may no longer be the case. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook warned that silicon supply constraints would affect sales of the iPhone and iPad. This week  Toyota  Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) announced it would reduce global production for September by 40% from its previous plan due to critical shortages of semiconductors.
Since the shortage reflects a tight supply, this has been a boon to the semiconductor industry and many chip stocks. With the shortage expected to continue, many chip stocks are ripe for continued gains. That's why investors should consider chip stocks such as Intel Corporation (INTC), Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (SIMO), and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), which are rated highly in our POWR Ratings system.

The Shenzhen Stock Exchange suspended more than 30 IPO plans on Aug. 18 slated for its ChiNext board, including a public share sale application from BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF)'s semiconductor business, according to the official exchange filings. 
The Shanghai Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has pressed the pause button on eight IPOs targeting the city's tech-focused STAR Market since Aug. 19, exchange filings showed.
The companies attributed the halt to an investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) into Tian Yuan Law Firm in Beijing, China Dragon Securities Co, CAREA Assets Appraisal Co and Zhongxingcai Guanghua Certified Public Accountants LLP.
The news was first reported by Chinese media. 
Tighter scrutiny on IPOs comes as Beijing launches a flurry of regulatory crackdowns against sectors ranging from the internet to tutoring. It also comes as China is stepping up efforts to channel household savings into capital markets to fund innovation and economic recovery.
On Monday, China said it would tighten scrutiny over accounting firms in a fight against financial forgery, vowing ""zero tolerance"" toward misconduct.
Over the weekend, the CSRC said it would require IPO disclosures to be of a higher quality and urged intermediaries to be accountable.

The companies whose IPO process have been suspended by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange include Chongqing Yuxin Pingrui Electronic Co Ltd, Suzhou Future Electrical Company and Beijing BlueSky Technologies Co.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange has halted processing IPO applications from companies including Guangdong Baihe Medical Technology Co, Jiangsu Gao Kai Precision Fluid Technology Co and Obio Technology (Shanghai) Corp.

Haji Mohammad Idris was named as acting governor of the bank to help bring order to a war-crippled economy, which has been adrift for more than a week with banks closed and many government offices empty.
He was expected to help organise institutions and address the economic issues facing the population, a statement from Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
Afghanistan's lenders would likely require central bank support to manage afghani and U.S. dollar liquidity once they reopen, said a senior Afghan banker, who asked to remain anonymous.
""If this uncertainty remains, then customers will withdraw more funds and banks would need bigger support from (the central bank),"" the banker said, referring to withdrawals in the immediate run-up to the bank closures.
The appointment, which came as Iran resumed fuel exports https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-resumes-fuel-exports-afghanistan-after-taliban-request-union-says-2021-08-23 to Afghanistan, comes amid increasingly acute economic problems https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rising-prices-shuttered-banks-add-misery-kabul-2021-08-22, with government workers unpaid, many businesses closed and growing pressure on prices of staples including food and fuel.
With many senior officials and others associated with the Western-backed government in hiding or exile, the Taliban have been trying to persuade specialists and technical experts to return to work to get the economy back on its feet.
A senior Taliban official said Idris, from the northern province of Jawzjan, had long experience working on financial issues with the previous leader of the movement, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, who was killed in a drone strike in 2016.
While Idris had no public profile outside the movement and no formal financial training or higher education, he was head of the movement's finance section and respected for his expertise, a senior Taliban leader said.
""There are many people who were unknown to the world but they held key positions and had great contributions. Haji Idris is among them,"" he said. ""I believe he has not even studied religious studies but was expert in financial matters.""

Because several industry players plan to cut their production due to the shortage, the sector is expected to witness weak momentum in the near term. Thus, we think it could be wise to avoid financially weak electric vehicle stocks Faraday Future Intelligent (FFIE), Canoo (GOEV), and GreenPower Motor (GP). Their shares have declined more than 15% in price over the past week. Read on to learn more.Electric vehicles (EVs) are projected to dominate the automobile market eventually because governments worldwide are undertaking various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. However, the global semiconductor chip shortage is likely to stall the industry’s growth because major industry players have plans to cut production significantly.
The chip shortage is projected to reduce global auto output by 7.1 million vehicles in 2021. The rising cost of semiconductor chips is another reason EV manufacturers are scaling down their output. As a result, many EV companies’ revenue and earnings growth forecasts will likely remain weak in the coming quarters.
Given the bleak outlook for the EV industry, we believe that financially unstable EV stocks Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (FFIE), Canoo Inc. (GOEV), and GreenPower Motor Company Inc. (GP) are best avoided now. These stocks have declined more than 15% in price over the past week.

Furthermore, we think it is wise to bet on these stocks now because they are expected to continue gaining even if inflation persists. Let’s discuss these names.Investors’ concerns over the pace of economic recovery due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases have fostered market volatility. In addition, this month consumer sentiment fell to a pandemic-era low. However, due to solid second-quarter corporate earnings results, the major stock market indexes are hovering near their all-time highs. According to a FactSet research report, more S&P 500 companies than average beat EPS estimates in the second quarter. In addition, several retail companies have strengthened their digital presence, positioning them well to gain in the coming months.
Furthermore, many retailers deal with inflation by passing on higher costs to their customers through price hikes. The consumer price index increased 5.4% in July, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation could be persistent. So, while investors are worried about rising inflation, retailers that are passing on higher costs to customers are not expected to be impacted substantially.

As the demand for semiconductors remains strong amid the continuing, global digital transformation, we think buying the dip in quality semiconductor stocks Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC (NASDAQ:SMTX)), Himax (HIMX), and Alpha & Omega (AOSL) could deliver handsome gains in the near term. Read on.A global semiconductor shortage has caused production bottlenecks in multiple industries, including consumer electronics, technology, networking, and automotive. Given the heightened demand for microprocessors amid a remote lifestyle and global digital transformation, governments around the world have been investing heavily to boost production.
The U.S. Senate approved $52 billion federal investment in the domestic semiconductor market under the CHIPS for America Act on June 8. In a similar vein, the European Commission outlined its plans in March to double the EU’s share of global chip manufacturing to account for 20% of the global output by 2030.
Global semiconductor sales have risen 29.2% year-over-year to $133.60 billion in the second quarter, ended June 30, 2021. Furthermore, the semiconductor industry is expected to become one of the most crucial industries over the long term due to its universal applications.

So, we think it could be wise to now scoop up shares of quality hospital stocks  Tenet Healthcare  (THC), Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC), and Select Medical Holdings (NYSE:SEM).The rapid spread of the coronavirus Delta variant has caused a resurgence of COVID-19 cases across several parts of the world. Five U.S. states recently broke the record for the average number of daily new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. So, hospitals are again dealing with a surge in demand for their services.
Investors’ interest in the hospital stocks is evidenced by the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) 5.7% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 2.9% gains. Furthermore, a recent study showed that breakthrough COVID-19 inflections after vaccination could cause long-haul symptoms. So, even though 73% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, the need for hospital services could remain high.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise to bet on fundamentally strong hospital stocks Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC), Encompass Health Corporation (EHC), and Select Medical Holdings Corporation (SEM). They are expected to continue gaining in price in the coming months as COVID-19 cases continue to climb.

Furthermore, given that GRNQ’s current valuation is not justified by its weak financials, is the stock worth owning now? Read on. Let’s find out.Based in Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Greenpro Capital Corp. (GRNQ) offers investment planning, financial and corporate services to small- and medium-sized businesses in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China. Last week, GRNQ’s Angkasa-X formed a strategic partnership with Silkwave Holdings to develop the world's first GEO-LEO integrated satellite network. While investors are optimistic about the partnership’s goal of establishing a space technology ecosystem in Malaysia and ushering in a new era of digital transformation in the ASEAN market, its shares are down 13.1% in price over the past month and 62.9% year-to-date. GRNQ is currently trading 81.7% below its 52-week high of $4.15.
Although its strategic investments to promote internet connectivity through Angkasa-X's ""LEO"" satellite constellation and intensify its digital transformation journey could strengthen its business portfolio, its negative profit margin could be concerning.
Furthermore, GRNQ’s current valuation is not in sync with its staggering losses and rising expenses. So, here is what we think could influence GRNQ’s performance in the near term:

Furthermore, robust consumer spending and continued online shopping trends should help the industry outperform the broader market. Therefore, we think fundamentally sound retail footwear stocks Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS),  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), and Hibbett (HIBB) could soar in price in the near term. Let’s discuss.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, retail sales for May 2021 - July 2021 were up 20.6% year-over-year. While a resurgence in COVID-19 cases could lead to a substantial increase in online shopping, the rapid rollout of vaccines and pent-up demand for in-store shopping should continue to drive brick-and-mortar store sales.
Also, substantial fiscal stimulus has bolstered consumer spending significantly. And because retailers are launching new products and diversifying their portfolios to capitalize on the pent-up demand and consumers’ changing taste and shopping preferences, the retail industry is expected to get a much-needed boost.
As people increasingly leave their homes and participate more in outdoor fitness and sports activities, footwear retailers (among others) are witnessing a rise in demand. Indeed, the global athletic footwear market is projected to grow at a 4.6% CAGR between 2021 - 2026.

LONDON (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week, the company said on Monday.
The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class. 
With over 403 million active accounts globally, the San Jose, California-based company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies.
PayPal launched cryptocurrency buying and selling in the United States early this year, later enabling customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network.
The company hoped its foray into the new asset class would encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by corporations and central banks.
""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support— and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role 
digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said in a statement. 
In the UK, PayPal's service will rival that of established cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc, as well as well fintech startups such as Revolut. 

Customers will be able to buy bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash through their PayPal wallets online or on the mobile app.
The move comes as more established financial companies have started offering their clients, both consumers and institutions, access to digital assets, amid rising cryptocurrency prices.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, supported by hopes that the Federal Reserve may put off tapering its asset purchases until at least December amid signs that the latest global wave of Covid-19 is slowing the global economic recovery. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 194 points, or 0.6%, at 35,314 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.5%.
Sentiment was also lifted by China's announcement on Monday that it had not registered any Covid-19 cases through community spread for the first time since July. The heavy-handed reaction to localized outbreaks of the coronavirus in China has hit global oil demand and led to a fresh round of disruptions of global supply chains, notably through capacity restrictions at the country's ports. 
The supply squeeze has been sharpest in sectors such as semiconductors, and these again stood out in early trading, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rising 2.6% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rising 2.3%. 
Elsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock quickly shook off the disappointment of a Friday court ruling in California that struck down its exemption from a new law that stands to raise its operating costs substantially. The court ruled the Proposition 22 - which allows the likes of Uber,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Doordash to pay their drivers as contractors rather than employees - is unconstitutional. Uber said it plans to appeal. 
After losing as much as 5% in premarket, Uber stock was up 0.1% while Lyft stock was down only 0.4%. DoorDash stock was down 1.8%.
Vaccine stocks were in demand again, with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rising 2.7% and BioNTech stock rising 9.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave their Covid-19 drug full approval for use by people over 16, upgrading the Emergency Use Authorization that had previously been in place. The vaccine's new status affords greater legal protection to companies who impose vaccine mandates on their staff (  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) became the latest to do so on Monday), and is perceived as helping to boost confidence in the drug more broadly. 
Pfizer stock was also supported by news that it will buy out the rest of smaller biotech company Trillium Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TRIL) at a valuation of $2.6 billion, news that almost tripled Trillium's stock price.
Elsewhere, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 2.6% while other cryptocurrency proxies made larger gains as Bitcoin rallied back above $50,000. 
Chinese ADRs continued to underperform, however, as U.S.-based investors continued dumping them in anticipation of regulatory actions from both Beijing and Washington.  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) fell 2.6% and Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) fell 2.7%, while Tencent ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) eked out a gain of only 0.4%. JD.com ADRs (NASDAQ:JD) were essentially flat after posting second-quarter results that showed a marked drop in profit despite revenue growth of over 25%.

The acquired business includes a manufacturing site in China's northern city of Taiyuan. Volvo said it aimed to start production of its new heavy duty Volvo FH, Volvo FM and Volvo FMX trucks there at the end of next year. 
The plant will have an annual production capacity of 15,000 trucks within a few years, with the potential to increase capacity further, Volvo said.
Chinese Geely, which owns passenger car company Volvo Cars, also holds a stake in AB Volvo. U.S. automaker Ford holds a stake in JMC, which makes Ford-branded vans and sport-utility vehicles in China.
Global truck makers are planning truck production in China due to the booming logistics services, including e-commerce, and new orders as authorities introduce increasingly tougher safety and emission regulations.

Scania, a unit under Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s commercial vehicle arm Traton SE, is building a wholly-owned factory in an eastern Chinese city, while a joint venture between Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Foton said it would make Actros heavy duty trucks there.

The company was valued at nearly $2 billion after its last funding round, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/federer-backed-shoe-firm-running-targets-autumn-ipo-sources-2021-05-28 in April.
Federer had invested in On in 2019, according to the filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1858985/000119312521253415/d175570df1.htm#rom175570_14. It was not immediately known how much the Swiss tennis star has invested in the shoe firm.
The 20-times Grand Slam winner had also teamed up with the company earlier this year to develop the Roger Pro tennis shoe.
U.S. venture capital firm Stripes holds 12.4% of the company's ordinary shares, the filing showed.
On said it had not set the terms for its offering yet. Sources told Reuters in April that the company could seek a valuation of between $4 billion and $6 billion in its IPO.
For the six months ended June 30, net sales jumped to 315.5 million Swiss francs ($344.01 million) from 170.9 million Swiss francs a year earlier, the company said. It also reported a net income of 3.8 million Swiss francs, compared to a loss of 33.1 million Swiss francs a year earlier.
Running-shoe makers have seen sales spike in the COVID-19 pandemic as people turn to running, with gyms closed and team sport activities banned.
On was founded in 2010 in Zürich, Switzerland by Olivier Bernhard, David Allemann and Caspar Coppetti.

Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and J.P. Morgan are among the underwriters for the offering. The company said it would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""ONON"".

The regulator had set an action date of Aug. 22 to decide on the drug, but notified Axsome earlier this month of some deficiencies with its marketing application that could lead to a delay in deciding the fate of the oral pill.
Analysts had expected the FDA to decline Axsome's application, with Truist Securities analyst Joon Lee saying the lack of a ""complete response letter"" from the FDA was positive as it implied previously identified deficiencies can be remedied.
Shares in Axsome are down 74% this year through Friday's close.
AXS-05 had succeeded in reducing symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in a late-stage trial in December 2019 and also showed benefits for treatment-resistant patients in a mid-stage study in 2020.
Depression affects about 16 million American adults every year, and existing antidepressants including Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)'s Prozac and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s Zoloft are designed to increase the availability of a mood-regulating neurotransmitter called serotonin. 
But a large number of patients do not respond to those therapies, which could take up to six weeks to show any effect. Companies are developing new drugs that target the treatment-resistant population, which could reach 2.5 million in the United States by 2025, according to SMBC Nikko Securities America analyst David Hoang.

Axsome's AXS-05 targets several neurotransmitters including serotonin and is designed to reduce symptoms of depression in one week. 
Rival Sage Therapeutics in June reported data from its late-stage study showing its drug candidate, zuranolone, improved symptoms of depression, but there were concerns about durability.

Annual active customer accounts increased by 27% to 531.9 million by end of June from 417.4 million a year ago.
Growth was helped by several tie-ups the company sewed up with international brands during the period, including the start of a distribution agreement with LVMH's (PA:LVMH) BVLGARI brand, which began to sell its jewelry and watches on the platform. Berluti, a luxury menswear fashion house that is also part of the LVMH group, established its first official global flagship store on JD.com during the period.

(Reuters) -EasyJet on Monday named former Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) boss Stephen Hester to succeed John Barton as chairman, as the budget airline seeks experienced leadership to help it navigate post-pandemic recovery. 
Hester, 60, has more than three decades of experience in several industries, most recently serving as the chief executive of RSA Insurance (OTC:RSNAY). He was widely praised https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbs-hester/rbs-boss-hester-to-step-down-this-year-idUSBRE95B0UY20130612 for restructuring RBS (LON:NWG) in the aftermath of its state bailout during the 2008 financial crisis.
""I am very much looking forward to working with Stephen (Hester) at this important time in our history, as we continue to ... take advantage of the many opportunities that lie ahead following the pandemic,"" easyJet (LON:EZJ) Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said in a statement.
The British airline said last month it planned to fly 60% of its pre-pandemic capacity between July and September, compared with 17% of 2019 levels in the previous quarter, after it shed staff, cut its fleet and took on new debt to survive the crisis.
Hester, who will join the airline as a director in September, said he was ""very excited"" to be taking on the role of chairman from Dec. 1 after Barton steps down after nine years.
Shares of the London-listed company rose as much as 3% to 821.8 pence in morning trade following the announcement. The stock lost more than 40% of its value last year when COVID-19 hammered the aerospace industry. 
EasyJet, which had posted a slightly smaller loss of 318.3 million pounds ($434.6 million) for the three months to June 30, has cautioned of limited visibility and ongoing uncertainty and did not provide guidance for the rest of the year. 

Hester, a former investment banker and gardening enthusiast https://www.reuters.com/article/rbs-hester-idUSLQ37860120090226, will be paid 314,568 pounds a year, including remuneration for his duties as a non-executive director, the company said.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>",Sainsbury's shares jump 14% on report of possible bids,"By Yadarisa Shabong and Abhinav Ramnarayan
(Reuters) -Sainsbury's shares surged 14% on Monday after a report that private equity firms could launch bids worth more than 7 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) for Britain's second biggest supermarket chain.
Buyout groups including New York-based Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) were circling Sainsbury's, the Sunday Times reported https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bidders-train-guns-on-sainsburys-sh8228nst.
Sainsbury's, whose market value was about 6.9 billion pounds at Friday's close, declined to comment. 
Its shares were up 13.8% at 335 pence by 1035 GMT on the London Stock Exchange after hitting 338.1 earlier in the session, their highest since Feb. 26, 2014.
The reported interest in Sainsbury's is the latest example of corporate America's voracious appetite for British companies across industries including retail, defence and healthcare. 
Morrisons, Britain's fourth largest supermarket chain, is currently the target of a takeover battle involving at least two U.S. groups.
The Sunday Times said Apollo's interest in Sainsbury's was exploratory and that the U.S firm remained in talks to join a consortium led by Fortress Investment Group in bidding for Morrisons.
""Sainsbury's is undeniably a good target for private equity with a considerable store estate, with the company having more than $10bn in property assets,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said via email. ""The supermarkets are generating the kind of yield that is hard to get elsewhere.""
Sainsbury's traces its roots back to 1869 when John James Sainsbury and his wife Mary Ann opened a shop in London's Drury Lane. The company now has a 15% share of the UK grocery market, a distant second behind leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) on 27%.
Qatar's sovereign wealth fund is the largest shareholder in Sainsbury's with almost 15% of the voting rights while Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has a roughly 10% stake.
A bond investor who declined to be named told Reuters they had steered clear of buying Sainsbury's bonds last month because they believed it was likely to be a takeover target.
Private equity buyouts typically pay for acquisitions with debt that is then put on the target company's balance sheet - known as a leveraged buyout - which can hit the target's credit ratings and bond prices.
The bond investor said there had long been rumours of a Sainsbury's buyout but a deal could have more chance this year because the company is in a relatively defensive sector, offers reliable cash flow and owns many of its assets.
Shore Capital analysts said that if Apollo did not end up participating in any Morrisons deal, it and other bidders could go after Sainsbury's.

Apollo lost out last year on buying Asda, the No. 3 British supermarket chain, to brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and TDR Capital. That deal https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/apollo-global-management-considering-offer-britains-morrisons-2021-07-05 valued Asda at 6.8 billion pounds.

A global chip shortage over the past year has caused a major delay in manufacturing activity and forced several automakers to cut down on production.
""Due to the current material shortage situation, triggered by a combination of global semiconductor shortages and new Covid-19 outbreaks, Volvo Cars has decided to pause production in Torslanda for the week of Aug 30-Sep 3,"" Volvo Cars said in an e-mailed statement.

""Production is planned to resume on Sunday, Sep 5,"" the Swedish firm, which had a similar interruption of output at its Gothenburg plant only two weeks ago, added.

1224,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 07:18AM ET</span>","Goldman, BofA See Lost Decade Over for Emerging Markets","(Bloomberg) -- Expectations for a recovery in commodity prices and earnings growth are igniting bullish bets on emerging-market equities after more than a decade of underperformance that left them approaching a 20-year low against developed-nation stocks.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management expect a boost for developing equities as investors capitalize on cheap valuations once vaccine rollouts pick up, helping the global economy to recover from the pandemic. South Africa, Russia and Brazil are among markets set to benefit, even as China’s regulatory crackdown continues to weigh on Asian equities.
In the decade following the global financial crisis, MSCI Inc.’s emerging-market stock index gained just 8%, while the benchmark for developed nations more than doubled. That’s partly due to the slowdown of Chinese economic growth from above 10% in 2010 to around 6% by the end of the decade, resulting in a decline for commodity prices and weak earnings growth.
Then came the pandemic. While stocks across the board initially recovered strongly from March 2020 lows, those in emerging markets have fallen behind again. MSCI’s developed-market stock index has returned about 15% since the beginning of 2021, while its emerging-market counterpart fell more than 4%.
That may change in coming months as the global economic recovery gathers steam, inflation picks up, and raw materials rebound from their worst weekly performance since June, driven by infrastructure projects from China to the U.S.
There are signs the turn has already started. Capital flows into emerging-market equities in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa accelerated since March -- beating flows into bond funds by the most since 2014 -- as investors rotated into value stocks, according to BofA.
“We expect this trend to continue given supportive macro drivers and equity valuations,” BofA cross-asset strategist Jure Jeric said in a note. While the energy sector has been the biggest beneficiary thus far, supporting Russian equities, there’s scope for increased inflows into other value sectors including financials and materials, with South Africa a receiving a boost from the latter, he said.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is tactically “quite upbeat” on developing stocks, according to Caesar Maasry, head of the emerging-markets cross-asset strategy team, which favors equities and currencies in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia. “We generally find a ‘return to normalcy’ not priced into the market.”
Franklin Templeton Investments flags technology as a driver of emerging-market stock gains, benefiting countries like South Korea and Taiwan which are rebounding on Monday after tumbling 3.5% and 3.8% respectively last week. Those two nations have managed the pandemic better than most, and their tech-dominated markets made them an attractive investment during the crisis, said Andrew Ness, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton. The firm remains cautious on emerging-market equities but has turned more optimistic due to low valuations, according to Gene Podkamine, head of research at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions.
While GDP growth in emerging markets has lagged that in developed nations in 2021, that may start changing as soon as the fourth quarter as activity starts to slow in developed economies and amid higher commodity prices, according to Lazard.
“Given the position many emerging-markets companies hold in the global supply chain, a pick-up in capital spending around the world is a very good signal for emerging markets equities overall,” Lazard strategists wrote in a report. That holds particularly for “growth-sensitive stocks, names that benefit from higher commodities prices, and those that produce goods, rather than services,” they said.
Over the last decade, the outperformance of U.S. stocks had a lot to do with the plush liquidity from the Fed -- money that mostly failed to reach emerging markets. When the liquidity is taken away, stocks around the world may suffer a temporary shock, but the U.S. would lose its edge. That supports the idea that emerging-market stocks can outperform in a post-stimulus world.
That’s not to say there aren’t any key fundamental risks lying ahead for emerging-market stocks. Beijing’s regulatory crackdown on technology companies has been a factor in the underperformance of MSCI’s EM index this year, as Chinese equities account for almost one-third of the gauge. 
While regulatory reforms could continue to depress Chinese stocks, it’s unlikely to spill over into the wider emerging-market complex, according to Goldman Sachs. Concerns about China’s economic growth, however, are warranted, the lender said in an Aug. 18 report. Developed nations outside of North Asia will continue to outperform the MSCI EM index, making them a “higher-conviction” holding, it said.
Developing-nation equities also proved their sensitivity to the prospects of tapering after they slumped along with global stocks after the Federal Reserve signaled that it could start paring stimulus from later this year. The Fed’s minutes also led to a dip in commodity prices as they boosted the dollar on Thursday, further pressuring developing-nation equities.
Not everyone is fully sold that the worst has passed. The BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute downgraded emerging-market equities to neutral in July over uncertainty about the U.S. dollar outlook and tighter policy.
‘Permanent Scarring’
“We believe that EM growth is more at risk of permanent scarring over the long term due to slow vaccination rates and limited policy space,” said Wei Li, the firm’s global chief investment strategist, adding that the equity risk premium is below the historical average for developing-nations.
Others are buying into the growth story, but warn that it may take time.  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets multi-asset strategist Daniel Gerard thinks emerging-market headwinds, like uncertainty around the Chinese regulatory environment, will prevent their equities from outperforming in the medium-term. Over the long haul, he sees “tremendous opportunities” as countries reduce reliance on physical infrastructure in favor of technology.
“Once vaccination rates improve in emerging markets, we expect not only for EM equities to outperform EM debt, but EM equities to catch up to developed-market equities,” Gerard said. “Don’t discount the EM consumer when the pandemic’s grip on consumer activity fades.”

1225,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Rise 145 Pts; Jackson Hole Symposium in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, rebounding after a difficult week and ahead of the key Federal Reserve event, where the central bank could hint at the prospects for withdrawing its extraordinary monetary stimulus.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 145 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%.
The major indices suffered last week, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.1%, the broad-based S&P 500 declined 0.6%, breaking a two-week winning streak, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite fell 0.7%.
Weighing on sentiment have been concerns the Fed could begin reducing its bond buying as soon as this year, even as the economic recovery is hindered by the surge in new Covid-19 cases linked to the highly contagious delta variant.
With this in mind, the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, starting on Thursday and held online this year, will hang over the market for much of the week. The main event will be the keynote speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, scheduled for 10 AM ET (1400 GMT) on Friday, which is likely to provide the market with hints as to what September’s policy meeting will bring.
The main averages remain not far off record levels, supported by a stellar earnings season - of the 476 S&P 500 companies which have posted results, 87.4% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv data.
Additionally, global dividends are forecast to rise to $1.39 trillion this year, according to a report from Janus Henderson published Monday, up 2.2 percentage points from its previous report, and just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak.
There are still a few companies left to report, including JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Madison Square Garden (NYSE:MSGS) Monday, while the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) will be in the spotlight after a judge in California declared unconstitutional a ballot outcome that meant drivers for the companies could be regarded as independent contractors.
The economic data slate includes figures on existing home sales for July as well as August manufacturing and services PMI data.  
Elsewhere, oil prices traded higher Monday, rebounding from three-month lows amid some bargain hunting, helped by the news that China, the world’s largest importer, had no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in August.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.1% higher at $64.06 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3.3% to $66.91. Both contracts had been on a seven-day losing streak and had hit their lowest levels since May 21 earlier in the session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,792.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1710.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stocks traded higher on a day when the two companies expect a full approval from the Food and Drug Administration fo the Covid-19 vaccine that they have jointly collaborated on.
Shares of the American company traded 3.3% higher in Monday’s premarket while BioNTech exchanged hands 6.3% higher.
There was more news around the companies keeping their shares buzzing. The two companies will supply 35 million more doses to the U.K. under a new contract. The vaccines are to be delivered from the second half of next year.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), the second of the three American companies whose Covid-19 shots are being administered in the country, is also seeking the FDA’s full approval of its vaccine, though a decision reportedly may take several more weeks.
Stocks of the company were 2.2% higher. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the third manufacturer, traded 0.5% lower. There’s no word yet on J&J’s plans for a full approval for its shot, the only single-dose vaccine in the world.
Any vaccine being administered currently has only secured the FDA’s emergency use authorization. Full approval would allow manufacturers to market their vaccines directly to consumers, and make it easier for government agencies, companies, institutions and schools to require vaccinations.
In an unrelated development, Pfizer said it will buy Trillium (TSX:TRIL), a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer. Pfizer has valued the equity of the company at $2.26 billion or $18.50 per share. That price is more than three times Trillium’s Friday closing of $6.09.

Investing.com – General Motors stock (NYSE:GM) traded 2.4% lower in Monday’s premarket following the company’s decision to suspend sales of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles after it ordered another recall of the automobile due to the risk of fires from the high-voltage battery pack.

GM said it will replace defective battery modules in Bolt EVs and EUVs with new modules.
The carmaker said the recall covers all the remaining Bolt vehicles not covered in the July exercise. That installment had cost the company $800 million.
GM said it will seek reimbursement from battery supplier LG. The latest recall covers 73,000 units of model years 2019 through 2022.

(Reuters) - Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc said on Monday one of its customers used artificial intelligence software to get a 26% gain in the power efficiency of a computer chip, a leap that usually has to wait for a new generation of chip manufacturing technology.
Modern computing chips are made of billions of transistors and wires laid down on a piece of silicon the size of a fingernail. Precisely how all the elements are placed on the chip, along with other design and architecture choices, has a major impact on how well they perform and how much they cost to make. 
Major chip firms like  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp can spend two years and hundreds of millions of dollars to perfect their designs. Synopsys is one of the major makers of software used to do that work.
The company has started weaving artificial intelligence called DSO.ai into its flagship chip design suite to help chip designers get better results, faster, while trying to balance trade-offs on speed, power efficiency and cost to meet their business goals. Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Renesas Electronics Corp have begun using it, with Samsung (KS:005930) last year saying it had cut a chip design step that would have taken months down to weeks.
On Monday, Synopsys said the AI system can now take into account what software will eventually run on a chip to squeeze out more gains. A major cloud computing provider that it did not name got a 26% gain in power efficiency versus the best solution found by human designers.
In the past, gains like those came from a new generation of chip manufacturing technology that would come every two years rather than purely from the design. The new software can squeeze much more out of existing chip factories, said Aart de Geus, chief executive of Synopsys. 
""It is significant because design is now actually more of the enabler than ever before,"" de Geus told Reuters in an interview.

Investing.com –  Sainsbury  's (LON:SBRY) stock climbed 12% in Monday’s trading in London on a report in The Sunday Times that Sainsbury’s could be next in line of acquisition targets for private equity companies.
The report named U.S. buyout firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) as a likely suitor for the supermarket chain.
Last week, buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice outbid Fortress to win the backing of the WM Morrison (LON:MRW) board for its 7 billion-pound offer ($9.59 billion) to buy the U.K.’s fourth largest supermarket chain.
After Morrison's, it is believed that Sainsbury's is the most obvious target in a field where valuations of public companies have suffered from a chronic discount as Brexit and other problems have kept international investors out of U.K. equities.
In April, Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský raised his stake in the company to nearly 10%, setting off a 30% surge in the share price.
According to the report, what could mar Apollo’s bid for Sainsbury's is the former’s interest in Morrison's. It continues to be in talks to join the Fortress-led consortium to bid for Morrisons and any involvement in that deal may then kill its interest in Sainsbury, according to the report."

LG Chem, which is preparing an initial public offering (IPO) for battery unit LG Energy Solution (LGES), lost more than $6 billion in market value, marking its biggest intraday percentage loss since March 2020.
""The market expected that LGES would launch its IPO in September, but with GM's expanded recall, LGES IPO is likely to be delayed for a month or two, because the company needs to reflect the recall cost before finalising the IPO paperwork,"" said Samsung (KS:005930) Securities analyst Cho Hyun-ryul.
GM initially recalled 69,000 Bolt cars in July. Its expanded recall comes about a week after a fire involving a Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) ID.3 EV carrying an LGES battery.
Six months earlier, Hyundai recalled 82,000 EVs over LGES battery fire risk at an estimated cost of about 1 trillion won ($851.90 million).
Both GM's and Hyundai's recalls involve pouch-type batteries, rather than cylindrical batteries supplied to LGES customers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
In February, South Korea's transport ministry said a joint investigation with LGES and Hyundai found defects in battery cells at an LGES factory in China. The investigation is ongoing. 
Neither LGES nor Hyundai have disclosed how they plan to split recall costs, though analysts expect LGES to assume 60%.
Batteries are a big component of LG Group earnings. LG Chem earned 40% of operating profit from batteries - including EV batteries - in April-June. Earlier this month, LG Electronics Inc cut its second-quarter operating profit by more than a fifth to reflect GM recall costs.

Shares of LG Electronics, which assembles LGES cells into battery modules, closed down 4.1%, versus the local benchmark KOSPI's 1% rise.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank aims to regain lost market share in credit cards in the next 3-4 quarters after the central bank removed a ban imposed more than eight months ago.
The bank plans to issue up to 300,000 credit cards from next month which will be scaled up to half a million in the coming months, Parag Rao, Group Head-Payments at HDFC Bank said in a press briefing on Monday.
""We have significant headroom to grow...our conservative approach to credit will continue,"" Rao added as the bank's predominant focus on offering credit cards to its own bank customers will continue.

In December, the central bank barred the bank from issuing new credit cards due to outages in the bank's digital payment services.
As of May, HDFC's market share in the cards segment had fallen by two percentage points, according to a Macquarie report, but it is still the largest card issuer in India, commanding nearly 24% the total market.

1236,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft Lower As Judge Rules Drivers Are Not Contractors","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Uber (NYSE:UBER),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) stocks fell in Monday’s premarket trading, after a judge in California struck down a ballot outcome that declared drivers for the companies were independent contractors.
Lyft stock fell 4.4%, Uber stock fell 3.7% and DoorDash stock a relatively modest 0.6%.
Proposition 22, passed in a statewide vote in November and bankrolled by Uber, Lyft and others, exempts the gig economy businesses from a law requiring more companies to register workers as employees and provide them with benefits such as statutory sick leave and vacation.
Companies are typically not required to pay those benefits to independent contractors.
The ruling threatens to raise the companies' operating expenses at a time when they are still far from sustainable profitability at an operating level, despite a recent improvement in their performance as the U.S. economy reopened in the spring.
The judge sided with three drivers and the Service Employees International Union in a lawsuit that argued the measure improperly removed the state legislature’s ability to grant workers the right to access to the state workers’ compensation program.
Uber said it plans to appeal against the order.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Monday has given police three weeks to conclude an investigation into claims from a former Paytm director who said he co-founded the digital payment platform but did not receive shares owed.
Ashok Kumar Saxena, 71, in legal documents said he invested $27,500 two decades ago in Paytm parent One97 Communications but was never allotted any stock, Reuters reported this month https://reut.rs/3j746WJ.
Paytm has said the claim amounts to harassment and cited it under ""criminal proceedings"" in the prospectus for its proposed $2.2 billion initial public offering (IPO). Saxena, a director from 2000 to 2004, has written to the market regulator urging it to stop Paytm from proceeding with the IPO.
Corporate governance experts said the tussle could spark regulatory inquiries and complicate the approval of an IPO that could value Paytm, backed by Chinese e-commerce leader  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, at up to $25 billion https://reut.rs/2WeMXlg.
On Monday, a Delhi district court judge requested the final report of the police's investigation within three weeks.
""I am directing them to conclude the inquiry as soon as possible,"" said Metropolitan Magistrate Animesh Kumar.
The police has submitted a status report to the court but is yet to conclude the investigation, senior lawyer Anupam Lal Das, representing Saxena, told Reuters after the hearing.
A Delhi police official declined to comment. Paytm did not respond to a request for comment. 
The heart of the dispute is a document seen by Reuters, dated 2001 and signed by Saxena and current Paytm Chief Executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma, stating Saxena was to own 55% of One97 Communications with Sharma owning the remainder.
Paytm, in a response to a police notice and which was seen by Reuters, denied Saxena was a co-founder and said the document in question was ""merely a letter of intent"" which ""did not materialise into any definitive agreement.

Sharma did not respond to a request for comment.
The case will next be heard on Sept. 13.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday helped by bargain hunting after last week’s sharp selloff, but confidence remains brittle with European manufacturing surveys pointing to a slowing global economic recovery in the face of the new Covid outbreak.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
The week opened with a rebound after markets recorded their sharpest decline since February last week, amid concerns that the measures taken to stop the spread of the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus will hit global growth just as the U.S. Federal Reserve considers starting the withdrawal of its extraordinary monetary stimulus.
Helping the tone at the start of the week was the news that China, one of the globe’s main economic drivers, reported no new locally acquired Covid-19 cases for the first time since July.
That said, sentiment remains frail with business activity in Germany’s important manufacturing sector, as well as France’s dominant services sector, slowing in August compared with July, according to flash PMI survey data.
Earlier Monday, Japan's factory activity growth slowed in August, while that of the services sector shrank at the fastest pace since May last year, also highlighting the impact of the recent wave of Covid-19 infections on the world's third-largest economy.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium that opens on Aug. 26 will cast a long shadow over this week, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expected by many to signal a start to reducing bond purchases from their current level of $120 billion a month before the end of the year. 
In corporate news, J  Sainsbury  (LON:SBRY) stock rose over 8% following a report private equity firms were looking at the U.K. supermarket chain with a view to a potential bid. Rival WM Morrison (LON:MRW) is already the subject of competing offers from a couple of private equity firms.
BioNTech (DE:22UAy) stock rose over 5% amid expectations the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will give full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine it has developed with partner  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
Elsewhere, oil prices traded higher Monday, rebounding from three-month lows amid some bargain hunting, but sentiment likely remains bearish with growing concerns over slower fuel demand worldwide.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2% higher at $63.38 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2% to $66.04. Both contracts had been on a seven-day losing streak and had hit their lowest levels since May 21 earlier in the session.

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 02:42AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Gathering Clouds?,"A look at the day ahead from Saikat Chatterjee. 
European stocks posted their biggest weekly drop last week since February. A large part of the reason behind the sharp drop is growing concerns over a slowing global economy, as well as increasing fears over rising infection rates and vaccine durability. Investors hoping for a bounce this week from a clutch of ""flash"" European manufacturing surveys for August out on Monday may be disappointed going by the recent softening trend in U.S. and Chinese PMIs. 
The broad message from the European PMI camp is likely that the strong recovery in growth seen over Q2 is now in danger of fading as a combination of rising prices, ongoing supply chain issues (see Toyota news last week) and labour shortages take their toll on business activity. 
Indeed, investors in an August global fund manager survey by investment bank BoFA Securities cut their expectations for global growth to their lowest since April 2020. Notwithstanding a wave of short covering lifting Asian markets in early Monday, signs of growing caution are rife in asset markets. 
Base metals, bulk resources and oil are struggling after global growth jitters took a heavy toll on commodities last week. The dollar index consolidated gains below a November 2020 high while the yield curve held near a one-year low. 
The focus will shift to the Fed later in the week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes the stage at the Jackson Hole symposium. Markets will be keenly watching the tapering plan and potential next steps from officials. 
While much of the tapering news value is already baked into markets, it remains to be seen whether the global rise of the Delta variant prompts the Fed to soften its rhetoric.

The vaccine, developed in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology, is the second home-grown shot to get emergency authorization in the country after Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.

The approval gives a boost to India's vaccination programme, which aims to inoculate all eligible adults by December, and will provide the first shot for those under 18, as the country still struggles to contain the virus spread in some states.

The nod comes at a time when there are looming concerns over a possible third wave of COVID-19 infections during the winter months, which could hit children.

Investing.com –  LG Chem Ltd . (KS:051915) shares slid nearly 10% after General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) said it would recall around 73,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles fitted with the South Korean company’s batteries.
LG Chem shares slid 8.13% to KRW367,500 ($312.39) by 12:05 AM ET (4:05 AM GMT).
GM expanded its recall of Bolt electric vehicles on Friday due to fire risks from what it claimed were battery manufacturing defects. The expansion is expected to cost $1 billion, for which GM will seek compensation from LG Chem. GM will also halt sales of the electric vehicles beginning model year 2019.
The recall will impact the preparations to list spinoff LG Energy Solution (LGES), on the South Korean bourse, with around $5 billion of LG Chem’s market value shaved off and the company’s shares headed towards their biggest intraday percentage loss since March 2020.
""The market expects that LGES would launch its IPO in September, but with GM's expanded recall, the LGES IPO is likely to be delayed for a month or two, because the company needs to reflect the recall cost before finalizing the IPO paperwork,"" Samsung (KS:005930) Securities analyst Hyun-Ryul Cho told Reuters.
""If LG does not manage to solve its battery defect issues, it will eventually hit its future orders from carmakers. If more fire risks/accidents arise, LG's position in the global EV market would be weakened,"" Cho added.
The Bolt recall comes a mere six months after  Hyundai Motor  Co. (KS:005380) said it would recall around 82,000 electric vehicles, including the Kona, globally due to fire risks, with the cost estimated at around KRW 1 trillion ($850 million).
LG Chem’s other high-profile customers include Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and  Volkswagen AG  (DE:VOWG), with KRW815 billion, or 40% of operating profit, generated by its battery business, including electric vehicle batteries, in the April to June 2021 period."

The bourse on Friday signed an agreement with MSCI Inc. to launch futures contract based on the MSCI China A 50 Connect Index, tracking performance of 50 Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks that are traded via a link to Hong Kong. The futures will start trading on Oct. 18, according to a statement. 
HKEX shares rose as much as 6.6% early Monday. Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) Ltd., which had introduced the first index futures tracking A shares, slumped 4.7% as of 10:14 a.m. in Singapore.
“HKEX receiving the green light to launch a competing product to SGX’s {{28930|FTSE ChChina A50 futures we believe will be viewed as negative for SGX’s share price,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts including Robert Kong and Yafei Tian wrote in a note. They forecast about HK$1 billion ($128 million) revenue contribution to the Hong Kong bourse from the MSCI A Share futures by 2024.
“This is significant for China as the new A-share derivatives products will drive even more international investor interest into, and demand for, mainland China equities, supporting further development and internationalization of China’s capital market,” HKEX Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Aguzin said. The product will be a “game changer” for the mainland’s financial market, he said.  
After a long wait, the bourse on Friday was granted approval by the city’s Securities and Futures Commission and the mainland regulator. It will bring China closer to an expanded inclusion in major global indexes. MSCI has listed a lack of access to hedging and derivatives as one pressing issue for the Chinese market. 
It reinforces Hong Kong’s role as the leading global market in Asia, demonstrating its “pivoting role” in connecting China and the world, Aguzin said at a press briefing. He declined to provide an estimate on how much the new product could add to the exchange’s revenue. 
While Beijing’s crackdown on its private sector has brought volatility to the capital market, Aguzin said demand from international investors in investing in China through the Hong Kong remains strong over the long term. 
The SFC said in a statement that the instruments will provide a significant new risk management tool and enable further growth of capital flows into the mainland. 
In a separate statement, China Securities Regulatory Commission gave its support for the launch and said it will continue to work with the SFC on derivatives regulations and cross-border risk management.    
Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the introduction of the futures could strengthen the city’s function as an offshore yuan hub, as well as an international asset management and risk management center.  
The MSCI and HKEX first agreed on a pact to issue A share futures back in 2019.

Together with Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, Griffin's Citadel had invested $2.75 billion in January into Melvin Capital, the hedge fund which was at the center of the GameStop (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy earlier this year.
According to the WSJ, it could not determine whether Citadel plans to redeem more money later. Citadel is expected to remain a large investor, the report added, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Melvin Capital, the fund founded by Gabe Plotkin, lost 49% on its investments during the first three months of 2021, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters in April.

Melvin had established itself as a strong performer posting annualized returns of 30% between 2014 and 2020.
But Plotkin had bet the retailer GameStop's stock price would tumble and then faced off with retail traders who used online trading apps and exchanged information on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum to push the stock price significantly higher in the early weeks of January.

1254,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2021 09:50PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, but COVID-19 and China Regulatory Concerns Cap Gains","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning as investors bargain-hunted after the previous week's selloff. However, concerns about the spread of COVID-19's Delta strain and regulatory tightening in China continued, capping some of the gains.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.38% by 9:41 PM ET (1:41 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.05%, with the Bank of Korea handing down its latest policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.27%. China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.61%. China looks set to continue its regulatory tightening across sectors, with investors monitoring the impact on shares in Chinese and Hong Kong shares which lost more than $560 billion in the previous week alone.
All eyes are also on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium that opens on Aug. 26, where further clues on the timeline for asset tapering and interest rate hikes are expected. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan did provide a potential clue ahead of the symposium, saying that he could adjust his opinion that asset tapering should begin soon if the COVID-19 Delta variant continues to spread and impacts the economic recovery.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen endorsed Jerome Powell for a second term as Fed Chairman.
It is also a busy week data-wise in the U.S., with existing home sales and Markit Composite purchasing managers index (PMI) data due later in the day alongside the manufacturing and services PMIs. The U.S. GDP is out on Thursday, followed by the core personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure closely watched by the Fed, on Friday alongside personal income and spending data.
Global shares are slowly starting to recover from the previous week’s carnage, but the COVID-19 concerns and worries about the Fed beginning asset tapering sooner than expected that contributed to reduced risk appetite remain.
“Markets react to interest-rate hikes much more than tapering and we expect a pause between tapering and the first hike, suggesting liftoff in 2023 and not before,” Natixis Investment Managers head of global market strategy Esty Dwek said in a note, which added that COVID-19 is still with us and growth will soften into 2022."

The outage on Nov. 16 last year nearly wiped out an entire session and damaged the reputation of the bourse operator ASX Ltd.
The independent review conducted by  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Australia found that while the ASX met industry practices in 58 out of 75 of the capabilities assessed, it missed in 17. 
The report found gaps in project testing and compliance that ""did not meet accepted industry practices,"" the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) said. 
""The conclusion that the project was not ready for go-live is very disappointing,"" Joe Longo, the ASIC chair said in a statement, referring to the ASX's equity trading system upgrade. 
IBM has made seven recommendations covering risk, governance, delivery, requirements, vendor management, testing and incident management.
""We acknowledge the findings in the report... the report does point to some important areas for improvement and we will address all of its recommendations,"" the ASX Chief Executive Dominic Stevens said in a separate statement. 

Stevens said the ASX is at an ""advanced"" stage of developing a plan to execute in the next 12 to 18 months with oversight by ASIC and the central bank. 
A separate investigation into whether the ASX met its market licence obligations is still ongoing, the ASIC said.

The non-binding indicative proposal is pitched at NZ$3.78 a share, Wellington-based Z Energy said Monday, valuing the company at NZ$1.97 billion. Z Energy shares surged as much as 19%. Confirmation of the offer follows a Bloomberg News report Sunday that the companies were in advanced talks.
Ampol, which recently re-branded from the name Caltex, would be adding New Zealand’s biggest fuel retailer. Z Energy was formed by local investors to buy Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc’s distribution business in 2016 and later added  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX).’s Caltex-branded outlets.
“Z Energy is a logical growth opportunity for Ampol as both companies are market leaders in their respective home markets and have very similar business models,” Ampol Managing Director Matt Halliday said in a statement. “Should a transaction proceed, Ampol believes that it will bring considerable benefits to the New Zealand market, helping to maintain fuel security and support New Zealand industry.”
Z Energy shares rose 54 cents to NZ$3.59 at 11:32 a.m. in Wellington. The offer is a 35% premium to trading levels in late July immediately before speculation emerged that Z Energy had suitors.  
Z Energy said the offer represents a 22% premium to the share price before the proposal was received on Aug. 12. It followed earlier approaches that began at NZ$3.35 a share in early June, the company said. 
Ampol had been given four-week exclusivity to undertake confirmatory due diligence and develop its proposal. The final offer is likely to be a scheme of arrangement that will be put to Z Energy shareholders for approval. While engagement is progressing well to date, there is no guarantee a binding transaction will be agreed, Sydney-based Ampol said. 
Subject to further discussions, Ampol said it is also willing to consider an amendment to the proposal to include partial Ampol share consideration. Z Energy said those talks could also lead to a secondary listing of Ampol shares on the NZX.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2021 07:26PM ET</span>",China eyes pushing U.S. IPO-bound firms to hand over data control -sources,"By Julie Zhu and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese regulators are considering pressing data-rich companies to hand over management and supervision of their data to third-party firms if they want U.S. stock listings, sources said, as part of Beijing's unprecedented scrutiny of private sector firms.
The regulators believe bringing in third-party information security firms, ideally state-backed, to manage and monitor IPO hopefuls' data could effectively limit their ability to transfer Chinese onshore data overseas, one of the people said. 
That would help ease Beijing's growing concerns that a foreign listing might force such Chinese companies to hand over some of their data to foreign entities and undermine national security, added the person. 
The plan is one of several proposals under consideration by Chinese regulators as Beijing has tightened its grip on the country's internet platforms in recent months, including looking to sharpen scrutiny of overseas listings.
The crackdown, which has smashed stocks https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-markets-slump-crackdowns-shatter-sentiment-herd-mentality-kicks-2021-08-20 and badly dented investor sentiment, has particularly targeted unfair competition and internet companies' handling of an enormous cache of consumer data, after years of a more laissez-faire approach.
A final decision on the IPO-bound companies' data handover plan is yet to be made, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
The regulatory officials have discussed the plan with capital market participants, said one of the sources, as part of moves https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-step-up-supervision-overseas-listed-companies-2021-07-06 to strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore. 
IPO advisers are hopeful a formal framework on the data handover issue could be delivered in September, said the source. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) did not respond to faxed requests for comment. 
Chinese regulators have recently put companies' overseas listing plans, particularly in the United States, on hold pending new rules on data security. 
Last month, the CAC proposed draft rules https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-drafts-new-cyber-security-industry-plan-2021-07-12 calling for companies with over 1 million users to undergo security reviews before listing overseas. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees U.S.-listings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
STEPPED UP SUPERVISION 
U.S. policymakers are already worried that Chinese firms are flouting U.S. rules https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-us-regulator-freezes-chinese-company-ipos-over-risk-disclosures-2021-07-30 requiring public companies to disclose a range of potential risks to their financial performance, and Beijing's data handover plan sparked renewed calls for caution.
""This is one more piece of evidence that private companies do not actually exist in the People’s Republic of China – they are all under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,"" U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, said in a statement.
""Any company that does business in the PRC must answer to the CCP, threatening investor transparency, consumer privacy, and national security,"" he added.
Senator Bill Hagerty, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement to Reuters: ""The Biden Administration and the SEC must continue to take action to ensure that Americans are aware of all the risks of investing in companies that are in anyway subjected to the Chinese Communist Party’s rule, including the CCP’s management of key data.""
A total of 37 Chinese companies have raised $12.6 billion via U.S. IPOs so far this year, according to Dealogic, nearly double the $6.6 billion raised over the same time last year.
The plans to step up supervision of Chinese companies listed overseas came days after Beijing launched a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc on the heels of its $4.4 billion U.S. stock market listing.
Didi is now in talks with state-owned Westone Information Industry Inc to handle its data management and monitoring activities, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-didi-talks-with-westone-hand-over-data-control-after-ipo-dustup-2021-08-06 earlier this month. 
The proposed restrictions on Didi could become a possible template for other data-rich Chinese companies that look to go public in the United States, said one of the people.
Beijing's increasing sensitivity about the collection and usage of onshore data comes as the top legislative body on Friday passed a new law https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20 designed to protect online user data privacy. It will implement the policy starting on Nov. 1.
In September, China is also set to implement its Data Security Law, which requires companies that process ""critical data"" to conduct risk assessments and submit reports to authorities. 

The government has in recent years increasingly seen user data as key to the country's financial and social stability and pushed tech giants including Ant Group, Tencent and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com to share consumer loan data to prevent excess borrowing and fraud, Reuters reported in January.
Ant is also in the process of spinning off its consumer-credit data operations, as part of the business revamp to revive its public share sale.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",Global dividends to near pre-pandemic levels in 2021 -report,"By Stefano Rebaudo
MILAN (Reuters) - Global dividends are forecast to rise to $1.39 trillion this year, up slightly from a previous estimate to reflect a stronger than expected recovery in the company payouts, Janus Henderson said in a report published on Monday. 
Its latest estimate, up 2.2 percentage points from an earlier one, is just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak. 
Dividends, a company payout to shareholders, slumped last year against the backdrop of the COVID-crisis as regulatory constraints and government pressures to restrict payments weighed.
But a strong recovery is currently under way, with headline growth at 26.3% in the second quarter, data from the investment manager's Global Dividend Index showed.
Underlying growth - adjusted for special dividends, changes in currency, timing effects, and index changes – was 11.2%.On a year-on-year basis, 2021 growth is expected at 10.7%, equivalent to an underlying rebound of 8.5%. 
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmvjoorqbpr/Pasted%20image%201629445753334.png 
Dividends from companies restarting payments totalled $33.3 billion and accounted for three-quarters of the underlying growth in the second quarter, the report said.
""Global dividends in aggregate will likely regain their pre-pandemic levels within the next 12 months,"" Jane Shoemake, client portfolio manager on the global equity income team at Janus Henderson, said in a statement.
The current ""recovery will not be hampered by a weak banking system as it was after the global financial crisis a decade ago,"" as policymakers continue to provide fiscal and monetary support to the economy, she added.
Limits on bank dividends had a significant impact in 2020 as lenders accounted for half of the fall in global payouts, but constraints have since been lifting.
In early August, European banks announced billions of euros in payments to shareholders. These included  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), whose interim dividend will be subject to discussions with regulators. 
European Union banks meanwhile have benefited from a strong performance in stress tests by the region's banking watchdog.
Among U.K. banks, HSBC reinstated dividend payments flagging higher payouts in the future, after the Bank of England scrapped its remaining pandemic curbs in mid-July. 
Europe is staging a solid rebound after a wave of cancellations and suspensions last year. 
At the same time, companies continued their payouts during the first year of the pandemic in the United Sates and in Canada, the Janus Henderson report said. 
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlggdqapb/Pasted%20image%201629445888516.png 
Booming commodity prices boosted payouts by mining companies, with industrials and consumer discretionary coming back strongly, the report also showed.

Defensive sectors, like telecoms, food, food retail, household products, tobacco and pharmaceuticals, registered characteristic low single-digit growth rates.

The actress last month sued Disney alleging that the company breached her contract when it offered the movie on streaming at the same time it played in theaters.
The entertainment company, in the filing, has countered Johansson's request for a civil trial in Los Angeles by asking for the suit to be sent to arbitration in New York. 
Johansson's suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, argued that the dual release strategy of ""Black Widow"" had reduced her compensation.

Disney had said there was ""no merit"" to the lawsuit, adding that online release of the film ""significantly enhanced her (Johansson's) ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20 million she has received to date.”
The outcome of the suit could have wider ramifications in the entertainment industry as media companies try to build their streaming services by offering premium programming to attract subscribers.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>","Investors stick to stocks, but gear up for bumpier ride","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are preparing for a rockier ride ahead for markets, as worries over slowing growth, a looming rollback of the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies and a global COVID-19 resurgence threaten a rally that has seen the S&P 500 double from last year’s lows.
Signs of caution abound, even as U.S. stocks hover near record highs. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists recently lowered their tracking estimate of U.S. economic growth in the third quarter to 5.5% from 9% due to the impact of the Delta variant, while fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research said they boosted cash overweights to the highest level since October 2020 while adding to positions in defensive sectors such as healthcare and utilities.
Worries over slowing growth in China and other major economies have hit prices for oil, copper and other raw materials while the U.S. dollar, a key destination for nervous investors, stands at its highest level in nearly nine months against a basket of currencies. 
Even retail investors, a group that has supported rallies in everything from tech stocks to crypto over the past year, appear to be cooling their heels. Online brokerage Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the gateway for many retail investors into so-called meme stocks, said Wednesday its clients are likely to slow their trading in coming months. 
Past warnings of a coming pullback have so far failed to play out this year, and cutting exposure to stocks has been a losing strategy during the market’s run from its 2020 lows, reinforcing the idea that there are few assets where investors have been able to notch the type of returns seen in equities. Still, the looming risks have bolstered the view that markets may be more turbulent in the months ahead.
""We have gotten past that euphoria-type of rally where everything, all asset classes and all stocks, continued to rally,"" said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors, which oversees about $3 billion in assets. Now “you have to be a bit more selective.”
Among investors’ key worries is the risk that the Fed, faced with stronger-than-expected inflation, begins pulling back on its support for the economy just as growth starts ebbing and the coronavirus’ Delta variant threatens to rollback reopenings across the country.
""We got such tremendous Federal Reserve monetary support for the economy for some time, so the market has trepidation about Fed taper and what that is going to do for growth,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Investors will be watching next week’s central bank symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for clues on when the Fed will begin slowing its $120 billion purchases of U.S. government bonds.
BofA Global Research analysts earlier this week moved up their timeline for the start of the Fed’s taper to November, from a previous forecast of January, believing that minutes from the central bank’s most recent policy meeting, released Wednesday, signaled a greater likelihood of an unwind beginning this year.
Rich valuations are also giving investors pause. The S&P 500's P/E ratio on a forward 12-month basis stands at 21.1, a more than 34% premium to its 20-year average, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
Despite all these worries, many investors are employing strategies that will allow them to stick with stocks, which have benefited from ultra-low Treasury yields and standout growth in the U.S.
Horneman, of Verdence Capital Advisors, has added alternative investments such as some liquid long-short hedge fund strategies that aim to be less correlated with the prices of stocks and bonds.
Greg Bassuk, chief executive at AXS Investments, said interest has recently grown in liquid alternatives such as private equity and venture capital and strategies like managed futures, which aim to hedge risk while still maintaining exposure to stocks. In the U.S., inflows into such investments stand at their highest levels since 2013, Morningstar said in July.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a Friday note that investors should prepare for volatility by diversifying across regions and asset classes, including hedge funds. Haefele said the S&P will finish next year at 5,000, from 4,437.18 today, though he expects a bumpy ride to those levels.

Among the biggest arguments for owning stocks has been the market’s resilience over the past decade, where investors have largely been rewarded for jumping in when equities weaken. For Horneman, that strategy remains in effect.
“We are still on the buy on dip mentality, not sell on strength,"" she said.

(Reuters) - A 2020 ballot measure that exempted ride-share and food delivery drivers from a state labor law is unconstitutional, a California judge ruled on Friday, as it infringes on the legislature's power to set workplace standards.
The ballot measure aimed to cement app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees.
Gig economy companies such as Uber (NYSE:UBER),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), Doordash and Instacart were pushing to keep drivers' independent contractor status, albeit with additional benefits.
However, in a ruling, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch wrote that the measure, known as Proposition 22, was unconstitutional.
""It limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers' compensation law"", making the entire measure unenforceable, the judge wrote.
The measure was the culmination of years of legal and legislative wrangling over a business model that has given millions of people the convenience of ordering food or a ride with the push of a button.
""We will file an immediate appeal and are confident the Appellate Court will uphold Prop 22,"" a group supporting the measure, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services Coalition, said in a statement.
Gig economy companies scored a decisive win in California in November, when voters of the Democratic-leaning state supported the company-sponsored Prop 22, overwriting a state law that would have made them employees.

The companies, whose business model relies on low-cost flexible labor, say that surveys show the majority of their workers do not want to be employees.
""Prop 22 has always been an illegal corporate power grab that not only stole the wages, benefits and rights owed to gig workers but also ended the regulating power of our elected officials,"" Gig Workers Rising, which advocates for more benefits, said after the ruling.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Friday it would take a hit of $1 billion to expand the recall of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles due to the risk of fires from the high-voltage battery pack - a blow for the largest U.S. automaker as it seeks to ramp up EV sales.
The Detroit company also said it would indefinitely halt sales of the EVs due to the issue and will seek reimbursement from battery supplier LG. The latest recall covers 73,000 vehicles from model years 2019 through 2022.
“The reserves and ratio of cost to the recall will be decided depending on the result of the joint investigation looking into the root cause, currently being held by GM, LG Electronics and LG Energy Solution,” LG said in a statement, referring to its subsidiaries. 
LG added that it is actively working with its client and partners to ensure that the recall measures are carried out smoothly. 
GM shares were down 2.2% in after-hours trade after dipping 0.6% during Friday's regular session.
Earlier this month, South Korea's LG Electronics Inc cut its second-quarter operating profit by more than a fifth to reflect costs for the GM recalls.
LG Electronics has supplied GM with battery modules made with cells produced by LG Chem's wholly owned battery subsidiary LG Energy Solution (LGES).
Earlier this year, Hyundai Motor Co said it would spend $900 million to replace LG batteries in some 82,000 EVs due to fire risks.
On Friday, GM said the recall covers all remaining Bolt vehicles not previously recalled in July. GM said it will replace defective battery modules in Bolt EVs and EUVs with new modules. The $1 billion price tag for the latest recall comes on top of $800 million GM said previous Bolt recalls had cost.
GM and LGES have a joint venture, Ultium Cells LLC, that is building battery cell plants in Ohio and Tennessee, with plans to add two more after that. GM has said it will use a different-generation battery when it launches electric Hummer and Cadillac vehicles over the next year.
In July, GM issued a recall for nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolts for fire risks after reports of two fires and said it would replace defective battery modules as needed. Friday's action expands the population of vehicles for the same issue. 
NEW CONSUMER WARNING
GM, which said Bolt sales would cease until it was satisfied with the fix, said it is ""working aggressively with LG to increase (battery module) production as soon as possible."" GM added it will notify customers when replacement parts are ready. 
Some Bolt EVs recalled in July were previously recalled last November to update software to address fire risks, but at least one fire occurred after the software update. GM said on Friday there had been a total of 10 Bolt fires.
The July recall came after GM and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urged Bolt owners to park their vehicles outside and away from homes after charging. GM on Friday reiterated that owners of the newly recalled vehicles should park them outside after charging and not leave them charging indoors overnight.
On Friday, NHTSA issued a new consumer warning to Bolt owners about the issue and said it is still investigating.
The automaker said in rare circumstances, the batteries supplied to GM for these vehicles may have two manufacturing defects – a torn anode tab and folded separator – present in the same battery cell, which increases the risk of fire.

After the 10th fire in Chandler, Arizona, GM said it ""discovered manufacturing defects in certain battery cells produced at LG manufacturing facilities beyond the Ochang, Korea, plant."" 
The new recall includes 9,335 Bolt EVs from model year 2019 that were not included in the previous recall and 63,683 2020–2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs and EUVs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied to close sharply higher on Friday, closing a tumultuous week on easing concerns over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin tightening its dovish monetary policy sooner than expected.
While all three major U.S. indexes ended solidly green, all posted weekly losses after a steep mid-week sell-off pulled the S&P 500 and the Dow away from a string of record closing highs.
""Towards the beginning of the week you saw traders balancing their books ahead of the Fed statement,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""And once the statement came out, you saw a bit of 'sell the rumor buy the news.'"" 
Market-leading tech and tech-adjacent megacaps, which weathered the pandemic recession better than most, once again provided the biggest lift.
Growth stocks were also given a boost by U.S. Treasury yields, which ended the week lower due to concerns the health crisis could be a longer than expected hindrance to economic revival.
Announcements from a host of Asian nations that they are implementing drastic measures to curb the resurgence of COVID-19 due to the rise of the disease's highly contagious Delta variant, put a damper on stocks associated with economic re-engagement.
Mixed economic data from the U.S. and China suggested the ongoing recovery from the most abrupt recession on record has passed its peak and lost some momentum.
Market participants now look to next week's Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming, a gathering of major central bank leaders, for clues from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding the expected pace of recovery and the timeline for policy tightening.
""We’ve seen times in history where the Jackson Hole Symposium has drawn a lot of eyeballs but this year more so,"" Keator added. ""The Fed might use this opportunity to communicate what their plan is going forward.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.96 points, or 0.65%, to 35,120.08, the S&P 500 gained 35.87 points, or 0.81%, to 4,441.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 172.88 points, or 1.19%, to 14,714.66.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session higher, with tech stocks and utilities enjoying the largest percentage gains.
Second-quarter reporting season has essentially run its course, with 476 of the companies in the S&P 500 having posted results. Of those, 87.4% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv data.
Farm and construction equipment manufacturer Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co beat quarterly profit expectations and raised its full year guidance due to robust demand. Still, its shares ended the session down 2.1%.
Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) advanced 1% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker's cancer drug Opdivo.
U.S.-listed shares of China-based tech-related companies oscillated market participants as they digested recent sell-offs resulting from Beijing's ongoing regulatory crackdown, which has wiped half a trillion dollars from Chinese markets this week.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Holding Group closed down 1.6%, while  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), Didi Global and iQiyi Inc gained between 1.6% and 3.7%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 200 new lows.

Thus, we think entertainment stocks Live Nation (LYV), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Madison Square Garden Sports (MSGS), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) are best avoided for now. Let’s discuss.The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected entertainment companies last year, particularly movie theaters, production studios, and live entertainment organizations. entertainment houses remained closed for several months due to social distancing mandates and other restrictions. Consequently, global theatrical revenue declined 71.6% year-over-year to $12 billion in 2020. Also, theatrical entertainment accounted for only 15% of the total global entertainment revenue, compared to 43% in 2019.
While the industry has attracted record foot traffic over the past few months, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases is threatening the progress the industry has made this year. Entertainment companies are concerned about a decline in foot traffic in the coming months. The pandemic has also accelerated the shift toward digital entertainment, which is expected to affect the demand for in-person entertainment companies for an extended period.
Thus, we think it is better for now to avoid the stocks of Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC), Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (MSGS), and Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (SIX).

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive-China eyes pushing U.S. IPO-bound firms to hand over data control -sources,"By Julie Zhu and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese regulators are considering pressing data-rich companies to hand over management and supervision of their data to third-party firms if they want U.S. stock listings, sources said, as part of Beijing's unprecedented scrutiny of private sector firms.
The regulators believe bringing in third-party information security firms, ideally state-backed, to manage and monitor IPO hopefuls' data could effectively limit their ability to transfer Chinese onshore data overseas, one of the people said. 
That would help ease Beijing's growing concerns that a foreign listing might force such Chinese companies to hand over some of their data to foreign entities and undermine national security, added the person. 
The plan is one of several proposals under consideration by Chinese regulators as Beijing has tightened its grip on the country's internet platforms in recent months, including looking to sharpen scrutiny of overseas listings.
The crackdown, which has smashed stocks https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-markets-slump-crackdowns-shatter-sentiment-herd-mentality-kicks-2021-08-20 and badly dented investor sentiment, has particularly targeted unfair competition and internet companies' handling of an enormous cache of consumer data, after years of a more laissez-faire approach.
A final decision on the IPO-bound companies' data handover plan is yet to be made, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
The regulatory officials have discussed the plan with capital market participants, said one of the sources, as part of moves https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-step-up-supervision-overseas-listed-companies-2021-07-06 to strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore. 
IPO advisers are hopeful a formal framework on the data handover issue could be delivered in September, said the source. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) did not respond to faxed requests for comment. 
Chinese regulators have recently put companies' overseas listing plans, particularly in the United States, on hold pending new rules on data security. 
Last month, the CAC proposed draft rules https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-drafts-new-cyber-security-industry-plan-2021-07-12 calling for companies with over 1 million users to undergo security reviews before listing overseas. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees U.S.-listings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
STEPPED UP SUPERVISION 
U.S. policymakers are already worried that Chinese firms are flouting U.S. rules https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-us-regulator-freezes-chinese-company-ipos-over-risk-disclosures-2021-07-30 requiring public companies to disclose a range of potential risks to their financial performance, and Beijing's data handover plan sparked renewed calls for caution.
""This is one more piece of evidence that private companies do not actually exist in the People’s Republic of China – they are all under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,"" U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, said in a statement.
""Any company that does business in the PRC must answer to the CCP, threatening investor transparency, consumer privacy, and national security,"" he added.
Senator Bill Hagerty, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement to Reuters: ""The Biden Administration and the SEC must continue to take action to ensure that Americans are aware of all the risks of investing in companies that are in anyway subjected to the Chinese Communist Party’s rule, including the CCP’s management of key data.""
A total of 37 Chinese companies have raised $12.6 billion via U.S. IPOs so far this year, according to Dealogic, nearly double the $6.6 billion raised over the same time last year.
The plans to step up supervision of Chinese companies listed overseas came days after Beijing launched a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc on the heels of its $4.4 billion U.S. stock market listing.
Didi is now in talks with state-owned Westone Information Industry Inc to handle its data management and monitoring activities, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-didi-talks-with-westone-hand-over-data-control-after-ipo-dustup-2021-08-06 earlier this month. 
The proposed restrictions on Didi could become a possible template for other data-rich Chinese companies that look to go public in the United States, said one of the people.
Beijing's increasing sensitivity about the collection and usage of onshore data comes as the top legislative body on Friday passed a new law https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20 designed to protect online user data privacy. It will implement the policy starting on Nov. 1.
In September, China is also set to implement its Data Security Law, which requires companies that process ""critical data"" to conduct risk assessments and submit reports to authorities. 

The government has in recent years increasingly seen user data as key to the country's financial and social stability and pushed tech giants including Ant Group, Tencent and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com to share consumer loan data to prevent excess borrowing and fraud, Reuters reported in January.
Ant is also in the process of spinning off its consumer-credit data operations, as part of the business revamp to revive its public share sale.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Stocks recovered ground on Friday despite concerns about economic growth amid rising COVID-19 cases, which continued to take its toll on oil prices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.65%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.81% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.19%. However, all three indices ended with weekly losses following a steep mid-week sell-off after Federal Reserve meeting minutes underlined the U.S. central bank's plans to pare back stimulus by year's end.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 0.43%. 
""We are seeing a relief rally in European and U.S. assets today,"" said Phil Guarco, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
The Fed is likely to dominate the economic conversation next week as well with an annual meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Markets will be watching for any clearer indication on plans for a Fed taper of monthly bond purchases, which minutes showed officials believed would happen this year if the economy recovers as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver remarks on the economic outlook next Friday.
Economic uncertainty also helped boost safe-haven investments this week, although most ended Friday flat or declining. The U.S. dollar touched highs not seen in 9-1/2 months Friday before ending the day slightly down. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.13%.
Gold was up slightly, with spot gold prices climbing 0.07% to $1,781.51 an ounce. Benchmark 10-year yields rose two basis points on the day to 1.260%, but are down from 1.283% last week.
OIL'S SLIP
The concern that rising COVID-19 cases globally could handcuff travel demand continued to weigh down oil markets, which fell for the seventh straight session. Brent crude ended the week down 2.17% at $65.01 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 2.26% at $62.25 per barrel.
Overall, oil faced its biggest week of losses in more than nine months.

Rabobank analysts said in a note they believed much of the downturn was due to systemic selling rather than a fundamental reorientation of market expectations.
""We are attributing a large portion of the recent fall in oil prices to the herd-like behavior of systematic funds rather than to any material shift in the fundamental outlook for oil markets,"" Ryan Fitzmaurice, Rabobank's senior commodity strategist, wrote in a note. ""We expect oil balances to remain tight and for prices to stabilize and grind higher as soon as the aggressive systematic selling we have been witnessing starts to wane.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a two-week Friday, as its strong end to the week failed to offset losses earlier the week after the Federal Reserve signaled bond tapering could be on the horizon by year-end.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, or 225 points, the Nasdaq was up 1.2%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT ended higher with the latter ending more than 2% higher.
Microsoft was boosted following news earlier this week that the tech giant will raise business subscription prices on its suite of Microsoft 365 products.  
The climb in big tech comes as other corners of the market including cyclicals are struggling to hold onto gains amid concerns about the impact of the Delta variant on economic growth.
""[A]bout 56% of the S&P stocks are above their 50 day moving average, [but] that's down from about 92 or 93%,"" Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts.com told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
But tech, given its larger weighting in the S&P 500, has cushioned the fallout, supporting the broader market.
As well as the tech, utilities, a bond proxy and defensive corner of the market, were one of the top sectors gainers on the day. This, however, is another sign that investors are growing worried about uncertainty ahead.
""I'm more concerned now by what I'm seeing by the emergence of sectors like utilities rallying on a week like this […] that speaks more to not just hiding out in Microsoft or getting defensive, but investors trying to look for higher yield opportunities to ride out uncertainty,"" Keller added.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, steadied but remained set for steep weekly losses following a slump in oil prices as rising Covid-19 infections and restrictions, particularly in China, have muddied the outlook on energy demand.
On the earnings front, investors digested mostly bullish quarterly reports as the earnings season winds down.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended modestly higher in a choppy session on Thursday, with gains in tech shares countering losses in cyclical sectors, as investors took the pulse of the economic rebound and gauged when the Federal Reserve might temper its monetary stimulus.
Tech also supported the Nasdaq, while economically sensitive sectors such as energy and materials were particularly weak.
Data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 17-month low last week, pointing to another month of robust job growth.
Stocks had sold off sharply a day earlier after minutes from the Fed's July meeting showed officials felt it was possible that a key benchmark for decreasing support ""could be reached this year.""
""It’s very much investors grappling with the growth outlook for the global economy, and how aggressive the Fed will taper when they get around to it,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.57 points, or 0.19%, to 34,894.12, the S&P 500 gained 5.53 points, or 0.13%, to 4,405.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.87 points, or 0.11%, to 14,541.79.
After opening sharply lower, the benchmark S&P 500 erased its declines while swinging between gains and losses during the session. 
""Money on the sidelines ... was deployed into the market on weakness, and that has been a tale of the markets for the past six to 12 months,"" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Wealth Management. 
Technology shined among S&P 500 sectors, rising 1%, helped by a 4% gain for shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. The chip company forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations late on Wednesday as it benefits from a boom in demand.
Consumer staples and real estate - generally considered defensive sectors - both rose about 0.9%.
Financials and industrials were among the sectors in the red, falling about 0.8% each.
In company news, shares of U.S. department store chains Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) rose 19.6% and 7.3%, respectively, following increased annual sales forecasts.
A rebound in the U.S. economy including a stellar second-quarter corporate earnings season on top of accommodative monetary policy has underpinned positive sentiment for equities, with the S&P 500 up about 100% since its March 2020 pandemic low.
But with the market in a period that has seasonally been weak historically, investors have said stocks may be due for a significant drop, with the S&P 500 yet to experience a 5% pullback this year.
Focus is shifting to the Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week for any read about the central bank's next steps.
“The key economic variable continues to be inflation,"" Mortimer said. ""Is it temporary, is it permanent, what number will the Fed tolerate in order to achieve its full employment mandate?”
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.43-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 274 new lows.
About 10.3 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 9.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

As such, we think popular semiconductor companies Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Micron (MU) are well-positioned to benefit. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) in Hsinchu, Taiwan, and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in Boise, Idaho, are two prominent players in the global semiconductor industry. TSM manufactures and markets integrated circuits and semiconductor products. It provides wafer manufacturing, wafer probing, assembly, and testing, mask production, and design services. MU, in comparison, manufactures and markets a portfolio of memory technologies for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages, and other system solutions.
Rising demand for tech devices from enterprises and their remote workforces has helped the semiconductor industry see a 29.2% year-over-year improvement in sales in the 2021 second quarter. Also, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of its Delta variant should continue to buoy demand for semiconductors primarily from the consumer electronics industry. Furthermore, the demand for semiconductors should continue growing, driven by the ongoing global digital transformation.
Massive government and corporate investments in the semiconductor industry to address the chip shortage have boosted investor optimism in this space. This is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 7.2% gains versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.5% returns over the past month. According to a WSTS report, the worldwide semiconductor market is expected to grow by 25.1% in 2021 and 10.1% in 2022. As such, both TSM and MU should benefit.

(Reuters) -Deere & Co on Friday raised its full-year earnings forecast after quarterly profit topped Wall Street estimates on the back of strong demand for farm and construction equipment.
The world's largest farm equipment manufacturer, however, said it continues to grapple with inflationary pressure and supply chain challenges, which are set to intensify and expected to persist beyond this year.
The company expects soaring raw material prices and freight rates to cost it about $675 million in its fourth quarter to end-October. Overall, it expects to spend $1.5 billion on raw material and freight in the 2021 fiscal year compared with $500 million estimated in February.
In response, it has raised prices for planters, sprayers, combines and large tractors in North America by about 8%, saying price increases would more than offset higher input costs.
However, worries about the potential impact of inflationary pressure on profits drove its shares down as much as 4%. They were last trading down 2.5% at $349.75.
Higher farm income following a run-up in commodity prices and the need to replace aging fleets are driving up demand for new tractors and combines.
Illinois-based Deere (NYSE:DE) revised up the outlook for industry sales of agricultural equipment in Europe and Asia, though it left estimates for sales in the United States, Canada and South America unchanged.
""It appears demand is going to be above the industry's ability to supply, given the supply constraints that we're facing,"" Josh Jepsen, head of investor relations, told analysts on an earnings call.
The company said it has lost days of production at different facilities due to supply challenges, but does not expect a ""significant"" shutdown of operations.

Upgrading its earnings estimate for the third time in seven months, Deere said it expects net income in fiscal 2021 to be between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion, up from a range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion forecast in May. 
Third quarter earnings came in at $5.32 per share, up from $2.57 per share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected the company to post a profit of $4.55 per share.

Abbott had argued that state officials did not have time to go through the regular appeals process and allowing local governments to set their own mandate rules would cause confusion, the report added.
The ruling comes amid the coronavirus political battle in the southern United States where new infections are highest.
Several states across the U.S. have announced the change in plans on masking due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the country and the announcement of new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that requires fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks.

However, a few republican states clashed with local officials who are resisting their orders banning school mask mandates, to which, the U.S. President Joe Biden reacted by saying on Aug. 12 that wearing masks is not about politics but about keeping children safe.
On Aug. 18, Florida's Miami-Dade County School Board had imposed a mask mandate for the district's 360,000 students, as well as staff from Monday, defying the Governor Ron DeSantis' rule of banning local mask mandates.

So, let’s examine these names.Investors rotated away from expensive growth stocks earlier this year, but these stocks have again been attracting investors’ attention lately as the major stock market indexes hover near their all-time highs.

With this, despite the ongoing semiconductor shortage, VR companies Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE), Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX), and Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) are expected to grow substantially in the coming months. So, let’s take a closer look at these concerns.Virtual reality (VR) technology is increasingly being adopted by the gaming and entertainment industries worldwide. As demand for in-home entertainment climbed last year amid social distancing norms, VR headsets saw high demand. Also, the virtual operations of companies worldwide, coupled with rising demand for virtual events, have driven the VR industry’s growth. Indeed, global VR sales rose 31.7% year-over-year to $1.80 billion in 2020.
This trend is likely to continue because VR is an integral component of the global digital transformation of enterprises. The global virtual reality market is expected to grow at an 18% CAGR over the next seven years.
The current semiconductor shortage has been a significant obstruction to the VR industry’s growth. However, hefty federal investments to bolster chip production coupled with disruptive innovations each day should offset the short-term headwinds.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada's five biggest banks are mandating that employees working from their offices must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 this fall, taking a firmer stance than some of their U.S. counterparts and some other Canadian companies. 
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) will all require staff to show proof of vaccination to enter their premises, they said in internal memos seen by Reuters. 
RBC, TD, BMO and CIBC require employees to be fully vaccinated by the end of October, the banks told employees on Thursday and Friday. 
Scotiabank has not set a date yet, but it is ""moving in the direction of making vaccinations mandatory"" for all employees and contractors based in Canada later in the fall, according to an internal note sent to employees on Friday.
The Canadian banks' moves come on the back of a mandate by the federal government last week that all federal public servants and employees in the federally regulated air, rail and marine transportation sectors must be vaccinated. That requirement extends to air, train and cruise ship travelers as well.
While some Canadian businesses, including Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc and Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF), have also mandated vaccines for employees, many others have so far held off on doing so. 
And some U.S. banks, including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), have required staff entering their New York headquarters to be vaccinated. Others like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) have not taken that step.
BMO employees and contractors must complete a new vaccine status survey by Sept. 8 and TD employees must register their vaccination status by Sept. 30, according to the communications. 
RBC employees, beginning in Canada and the United States and expanding elsewhere afterward, and Scotiabank said they will also require staff to provide their vaccination status but did not provide a deadline for doing so. 
CIBC staff already on site can continue to work as they have, but ""if you haven't been vaccinated and are able, now is the time,"" human resources chief Sandy Sharman said in an internal blog. 
BMO and TD staff who remain unvaccinated must take additional measures, they said. These include twice-weekly testing at BMO and the completion of a learning module about the benefits of vaccination, mandatory rapid testing and a face covering for staff, they said. 

A spokesperson for National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), the country's sixth-largest lender, said the firm currently has nothing to add. 
Sun Life Financial has been requiring employees to be fully vaccinated if they choose to work from an office as part of its re-opening pilot, according to guidance from Canada's second-biggest life insurer.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>",‘Paw Patrol’ unleashed: Behind ViacomCBS’s plan to take on Disney,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) -When “Paw Patrol: The Movie” hits theaters and the Paramount+ streaming service on Friday, it will kick off one of ViacomCBS’ most ambitious efforts to take on Disney in the streaming wars. 
The release of the feature film based on the animated children’s series about a group of rescue dogs who protect their community, will be backed by an “eight figure” marketing blitz, with 1,800 TV ads across channels like Nickelodeon. It involves partnerships with almost 200 companies - from Kellogg’s cereal to Best Western hotels - on tie-ins for toys and other products, many of which will come with a free trial of Paramount+.
The strategy is the highest-profile example of a game plan ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) has developed to build out its kids’ franchises - including “SpongeBob,” “iCarly,” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” - and use their success to help become a credible competitor in the war for paying streaming subscribers at a time when consolidation in the industry is leaving the company at a disadvantage. 
“Disney is the gold standard in terms of really creating and monetizing franchises,” said CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi. 
“ViacomCBS is looking to do the same thing, but they haven’t been as aggressive in terms of actually getting an early start and pivoting into streaming and taking some of the potentially game-changing actions that we’ve seen from other companies, especially with the way COVID affected the industry. So the ‘Paw Patrol’ film could be a litmus test in terms of going day-and-date streaming and theatrical.”
Friday will mark the first time ViacomCBS has debuted a film in theaters and on Paramount+ simultaneously, a decision the company announced in June. According to executives, it assessed the likelihood of parents bringing their unvaccinated children to theaters amid rising cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant. 
In the near-term, ViacomCBS’ family films will likely debut theatrically and on Paramount+ on the same date, via a very short theatrical window followed by a Paramount+ release, or skip a theatrical release altogether, said Brian Robbins, the president of Nickelodeon, the ViacomCBS kids’ channel where “Paw Patrol” debuted as TV series in 2013. 
The “Paw Patrol” film, the first theatrical spinoff of the TV show, has among the most tie-in products and global retailers of any film the company has distributed, said Pam Kaufman, President of ViacomCBS Consumer Products.
Canadian toy and children's entertainment company Spin Master Corp, which owns the intellectual property rights to ""Paw Patrol,"" kicked off the franchise with a partnership with ViacomCBS's Nickelodeon in 2013. 
It is also the first time ViacomCBS is using the full force of its properties and partnerships to drive people to Paramount+, the streaming service it crafted from the merger of CBS and Viacom. Many of the consumer product tie-ins include a free one-month subscription to the service, which costs $5 per month with ads and $10 per month ad-free.
The marketing push around the film “is not just in service of Paramount+,” said Robbins. “This is in service of the franchise of 'Paw Patrol' which, in turn, as that franchise grows, so should our streaming service.”
New franchise content is crucial to Paramount+ subscriber growth, executives say, because it helps drive new subscribers, who then stay on the service so their children can watch older franchise content, like the six seasons of “Paw Patrol” currently available on the streaming service. 
ViacomCBS is also betting on its “Star Trek” franchise, among others, premiering its first-ever animated “Star Trek” series for families - “Star Trek: Prodigy” - later this year on Paramount+, followed by a second viewing window on Nickelodeon.
Yet for “Paw Patrol: The Movie,” success across consumer products sales, box office tickets and new streaming subscribers is far from guaranteed. Families may prefer to stay home rather than go to movie theaters or shop at brick and mortar stores that are promoting the film in their aisles. A preschool film has a limited audience compared to multi-generational offerings from Marvel and others.
And on streaming, ViacomCBS is among the smallest of its peers, with 42 million total streaming subscribers compared to Disney’s 174 million. Even as ViacomCBS is seeking organic growth, non-Executive Chair Shari Redstone has sought partners as Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bulk up through their acquisitions of AT&T’s WarnerMedia assets and MGM, respectively. 

On Wednesday, ViacomCBS and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced a joint streaming service, SkyShowtime, that will launch in smaller European markets next year.
“You want to create a virtuous cycle of content creation and monetization, and I wouldn’t say that ViacomCBS is the gold standard of doing that yet, and that’s probably one of the strategic rationales of the CBS-Viacom merger: to create more scale and create more franchises,” said Amobi.

1290,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 02:09PM ET</span>",Kaplan Open to Shifting View on Taper If Delta Curbs Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he’s open to adjusting his view that the Federal Reserve should start tapering its asset-purchase program sooner rather than later if the delta variant persists and hurts economic progress.
The Fed is currently buying $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities in an effort to inject liquidity into the market and buoy an economy rocked by widespread lockdowns. Kaplan has said he favors gradually reducing those purchases from October, saying the support is leading to unintended consequences like an elevated housing market and higher rents.
“I’ve got to be agile, open-minded, avoid being rigid about if I saw that the Delta variant was going to be persistent enough, or unfold differently, say than it has in other countries -- the U.K. or India -- and be more challenging to where it starts to affect demand,” he said in an online event hosted by Texas Tech University’s Rawls College of Business. “I’ve got to take that into account, and will adjust my views accordingly.” 
Most Federal Reserve officials agreed last month that they could start slowing the pace of bond purchases later this year, judging that enough progress had been made toward their inflation goal, while gains had been made toward their employment objective, minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 27-28 gathering released Wednesday showed. 
Covid-19 cases have spiked across the country as the delta variant spreads, spurring companies to re-evaluate return-to-work plans and schools to return to virtual education, quarantines and mask requirements. U.S. central bankers next meet Sept. 21-22.  
“We’ve got a month to see how how this all unfolds,” he said.  
While the U.S. unemployment rate fell to a pandemic-era low of 5.4% in July, vacancies rose to a record 10.1 million in June, highlighting businesses’ persistent struggles to hire enough workers as ongoing child-care obligations, health concerns and enhanced unemployment benefits have kept some Americans from returning to the workforce.
“I don’t know how effective these purchases are at this stage, in improving the ability to match open jobs with workers,” Kaplan said. “So when I weigh the efficacy of that versus the side effects, that’s why I’ve said I think we’d be a lot healthier to start weaning off these purchases as soon as we’re able to.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. life sciences company Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) could face a hefty fine for completing its $8 billion cash-and-stock takeover of cancer detection test maker Grail without first securing EU antitrust approval.
Illumina closed the Grail takeover on Wednesday and said it would hold the company separate while waiting for the European Commission to decide whether to clear or block the deal.
But the EU executive said on Friday it would investigate if Illumina has breached its standstill obligation, which requires companies to secure EU antitrust approval before closing any merger deals. 
""We deeply regret Illumina's decision to complete its acquisition of Grail while our investigation into the transaction is still ongoing,"" Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
""This obligation, that we call standstill obligation, is at the heart of our merger control system and we take its possible breaches very seriously,"" Vestager said.
Illumina on Friday referred Reuters to the statement it issued on Wednesday that said re-acquiring Grail and keeping it separate was the only way to meet the deadline for completing the deal.
Violations of EU rules can lead to fines of as much as 10% of the aggregate turnover of the companies. French telecoms group Altice for instance was hit with a 125 million euro ($146 million) fine three years ago for closing its 2015 takeover of PT Portugal before gaining regulatory approval.
EU antitrust regulators had warned on July 22 that Illumina's bid could curb innovation and competition as they opened a full-scale investigation into the matter. 

Illumina's decision to close the Grail deal came ahead of an Aug. 24 trial by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has also voiced concerns about the impact of the deal.
Grail makes a non-invasive, early detection biopsy test to screen for many kinds of cancers using DNA sequencing.

""I'm not sure it's reached its climax yet. There's still more to go,"" Andrew Lloyd, electromobility segment leader at Stellantis-owned supplier Comau, said in an interview. ""Over the next 18 to 24 months, there's going to be a significant demand coming our way."" 
Growth in the EV sector, propelled by the success of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, comes on top of the normal work manufacturing equipment makers do to support production of gasoline-powered vehicles. 
Automakers will invest over $37 billion in North American plants from 2019 to 2025, with 15 of 17 new plants in the United States, according to LMC Automotive. Over 77% of that spending will be directed at SUV or EV projects.
Equipment providers are in no rush to add to their nearly full capacity. 
""There's a natural point where we will say 'No'"" to new business, said Comau's Lloyd. For just one area of a factory, like a paint shop or a body shop, an automaker can easily spend $200 million to $300 million, industry officials said.
'WILD, WILD WEST' ""This industry is the Wild, Wild West right now,"" John Kacsur, vice president of the automotive and tire segment for Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), told Reuters. ""There is a mad race to get these new EV variants to market.""Automakers have signed agreements for suppliers to build equipment for 37 EVs between this year and 2023 in North America, according to industry consultant Laurie Harbour. That excludes all the work being done for gasoline-powered vehicles.
""There's still a pipeline with projects from new EV manufacturers,"" said Mathias Christen, a spokesman for Durr AG, which specializes in paint shop equipment and saw its EV business surge about 65% last year. ""This is why we don't see the peak yet.""
Orders received by Kuka AG, a manufacturing automation company owned by China's Midea Group, rose 52% in the first half of 2021 to just under 1.9 billion euros ($2.23 billion) - the second-highest level for a 6-month period in the company's history, due to strong demand in North America and Asia.
""We ran out of capacity for any additional work about a year and a half ago,"" said Mike LaRose, CEO of Kuka's auto group in the Americas. ""Everyone's so busy, there's no floor space.""
Kuka is building electric vans for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) at its plant in Michigan to help meet early demand before the No. 1 U.S. automaker replaces equipment in its Ingersoll, Ontario, plant next year to handle the regular work. Automakers and battery firms need to order many of the robots and other equipment they need 18 months in advance, although Neil Dueweke, vice president of automotive at Fanuc (OTC:FANUY) Corp's American operations, said customers want their equipment sooner. He calls that the ""Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) effect"" in the industry.
""We built a facility and have like 5,000 robots on shelves stacked 200 feet high, almost as far as the eye can see,"" said Dueweke, who noted Fanuc America set sales and market share records last year.
COVID has also caused issues and delays for some automakers trying to tool up. 
R.J. Scaringe, CEO of EV startup Rivian, said in a letter to customers last month that ""everything from facility construction, to equipment installation, to vehicle component supply (especially semiconductors) has been impacted by the pandemic."" 
However, established, long-time customers like GM and parts supplier and contract manufacturer  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) said they have not experienced delays in receiving equipment. 
Another limiting factor for capacity has been the continuing shortage of labor, industry officials said. 
To avoid the stress, startups like Fisker Inc have turned to contract manufacturers like Magna and Foxconn, whose buying power enables them to avoid shortages more easily, CEO Henrik Fisker said. 
Growing demand, however, does not mean these equipment makers are rushing to expand capacity. 

Having lived through downturns in which they were forced to make cuts, equipment suppliers want to make do with what they have, or in Comau's case, just add short-term capacity, according to Lloyd. 
""Everybody's afraid they're going to get hammered,"" said Mike Tracy, a principal at consulting firm the Agile Group. ""They just don't have the reserve capacity they used to have.""

There has also been a massive spike in workers' contributions to their 401K plans. So, to benefit from the market rally and to swell one’s 401(k) balance, we think winning stocks Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Cintas (CTAS) could be great picks now. Let’s take a closer look.Many investors pulled money from the stock market last year on concerns over the pandemic-led recession. But as the economy recovers and stock market indexes are hitting their all-time highs, investors are unwilling to miss opportunities to capitalize on the momentum. According to the latest data from Fidelity Investments, even though people faced financial hardships over the past year due to the pandemic, retirement account balances have hit new highs. The average 401K plan balance climbed 24% year-over-year and hit $129,300 as of June 30, while individual retirement account balances increased by 21% from their year-ago value.
The S&P 500 doubled this month on a closing basis from its pandemic low on March 23, 2020. And this bull run is expected to continue for the foreseeable future owing to an improving job market, rising consumer spending, and continuing government efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates.
So, we believe investors seeking to boost their 401(k) balances further could bet on Infosys Limited (INFY) and Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS). These companies are fundamentally sound and exhibit strong growth attributes.

Against this backdrop, we think it is wise to avoid famous stocks DoorDash (DASH), Palantir (PLTR), and Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB). They look overvalued at their current price levels. Read on.The rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant and an inflationary environment have been worrying investors regarding the pace of economic recovery. In addition, consumer sentiment last week fell to a pandemic-era low. However, there exists the potential for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as soon as early 2023, and it recently indicated its willingness to reduce asset purchases before the end of the year.
Impressive second-quarter corporate earnings and the Senate’s passage of a$1 trillion infrastructure bill have been helping the major stock market indexes hover near their all-time highs. This, in part, has led to stretched valuations for several popular stocks with weak fundamentals.
Ultra-Popular stocks DoorDash, Inc. (DASH), Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), and Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB) are examples. They look significantly overvalued at their current price levels and could be due for a price retreat. So, we think it best to avoid these three stocks now.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday refused to resurrect fraud claims against shareholders involved in Tribune Co's disastrous $8.2 billion leveraged buyout, but revived claims against two banks that advised the media company.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a trustee representing Tribune creditors failed to show that large investors who sold back their stock in the media company's Dec. 2007 LBO were unjustly enriched.
Writing for a two-judge panel, Circuit Judge Denny Chin also said that while it was a ""close call,"" the trustee could try to show that  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s Merrill Lynch unit did not deserve $12.5 million ""success fees.""
Marc Kirschner, the trustee, had accused shareholders of pushing for the buyout despite knowing Tribune would be insolvent, portending its December 2008 bankruptcy.
He also said the banks knew Tribune's financial forecasts had been too rosy and the company would become insolvent by more than $1 billion, yet failed to act.
The panel rejected claims that the banks intended to defraud creditors or committed professional malpractice.
It also rejected all claims against another Tribune adviser,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), but revived a claim against a valuation research firm that had projected Tribune would remain solvent.
Tribune, which then owned the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Baltimore Sun and WGN superstation, sought Chapter 11 protection as ad revenue plummeted and more readers went online for news.
The LBO left Tribune with about $13 billion of debt.
Sam Zell, the real estate billionaire who led the LBO and became Tribune's chief executive, has called the buyout the ""deal from hell.""
Lawyers for the trustee and Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Citigroup said it was pleased with the decision.

In July 2019, a Delaware bankruptcy judge approved a $200 million settlement of the trustee's fraud claims against about 50 defendants, including Zell. None admitted wrongdoing.
The case is In re Tribune Company Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 19-449 and 19-3049.

By Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -T-Mobile US Inc said on Friday an ongoing investigation into a data breach revealed that hackers accessed personal information of an additional 5.3 million customers, bringing the total number of people affected to more than 53 million.
The third largest U.S. wireless carrier had earlier this week said that personal data of more than 40 million former and prospective customers was stolen along with data from 7.8 million existing T-Mobile wireless customers.
In its latest update, which comes days after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened an investigation into the breach, T-Mobile revealed it had identified 5.3 million additional wireless subscribers who were impacted by the breach as well as 667,000 more accounts of former customers.
The data includes addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers of customers, the company said, adding that it had no indication that the accessed data contained financial information such as credit card or other payment data.
Some T-Mobile customers sued the company for damages late Thursday night in Seattle federal court, saying in a proposed class action that the cyberattack violated their privacy and exposed them to a higher risk of fraud and identity theft.
The wireless carrier is the latest victim of cyberattacks on large corporations in the United States as hackers exploit weakened user system privacy and security due to work-from-home policies instituted since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
In 2018, the company had informed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-t-mobile-data-idUSKCN1L90NA about a potential security breach that could have affected about 3% of its 77 million customers.
""T-mobile has had 6 other data breaches in the past 4 years,"" said Doug Schmidt, a professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University.

""It appears that their IT system is particularly vulnerable since they haven't been able to rectify their known security issues during this time period, which should be concerning to customers.""
T-Mobile said in a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000119312521251974/d362750d8k.htm on Friday that while the investigation was ongoing, it was confident that it had ""closed off the access.""

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 12:56PM ET</span>","In COVID-19 hangover, as more around world get vaccinated, fewer give blood","By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) -From Seoul to Paris, and Moscow to Bangkok, concerned citizens are lining up for vaccine shots as COVID-19 case numbers swell. That may ease pressure on stretched hospitals around the world, but with it comes a hangover - a severe shortage of blood donors. 
A number of countries don't allow people who have just been vaccinated to give blood, as well as banning those in recovery from coronavirus. With others simply staying home as new infections rise https://www.reuters.com/world/india/beyond-delta-scientists-are-watching-new-coronavirus-variants-2021-08-08, doctors say donor pools have shrunk to alarmingly low levels, menacing urgent operations.
In South Korea, now grappling with record cases https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2PQ0VO, donors can't give blood for seven days after a COVID-19 vaccine shot - and supply is down to just 3.2 days, as of Wednesday, from 6.5 days' worth this time last year, according to the Korean Red Cross.
The Korean Medical Association (KMA) has launched a blood drive, starting with doctors themselves, warning that patients in need of urgent surgery or transfusions could face emergency situations, KMA spokeswoman Park Soo-hyun told Reuters.
""There have been increasing times when hospitals notify us of postponement of surgeries or treatments and crowding due to lack of blood,"" Park said.
Recurrent waves of infections, driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant, and extension of lockdowns have started taking a bigger toll on donations, according to a Reuters review of the situation in different countries.
In Thailand, confirmed cases topped 1 million on Friday with authorities reporting record increases in deaths https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-reports-record-covid-19-deaths-second-day-row-2021-08-18 in recent weeks.
""Due to the COVID situation, not many people are donating blood so there is not enough and some surgeries have to be postponed,"" said Piya Kiatisewi, a bone cancer surgeon at Lerdsin Hospital in Bangkok.
'SEPTEMBER WORRIES'
Like South Korea, Russia prohibits blood donations from the fully vaccinated - but for a whole month, not just seven days. It also doesn't accept blood from those in the middle of COVID-19 vaccination cycle.
The Kommersant business daily reported last week that donor activity in Russia has slumped, hit by the vaccination campaign, with blood service workers in six different regions reporting the problem to the paper.
In the United States, supplies of donated blood - already strained by the pandemic - tightened further in the spring as hospitals ramped up surgeries that had been on hold, according to Dr. Claudia Cohn, chief medical officer at AABB, previously known as the American Association of Blood Banks.
Under U.S. guidelines, people receiving authorized vaccines do not have to wait before donating blood, but individuals given a different type of vaccine, possibly in another country, need to wait 14 days. 
To be sure, in western Europe concerns over vaccination-hit donations have been exacerbated by the traditional summer holiday period.
France's blood supply agency, the Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS), said stocks were too tight for comfort. It said there are 85,000 red blood cell bags in reserve, below a comfortable level of 100,000 or more.
""No sick person will miss out on a transfusion but we are worried for September,"" an EFS spokesperson told Reuters, when the volume of surgical operations would typically increase.
In Italy, the National Blood Centre said there were worrying shortages in a number of regions, including Lazio, centred on the capital Rome, which had led some hospitals to postpone planned operations to conserve stocks for emergencies. It blamed the shortfall mainly on many people being away on holiday and a lack of staff in some collection centres. 
'AFRAID TO DONATE'
    Across Europe, donation levels have also been plagued by uncertainty over whether people can give blood if they have not been vaccinated, officials in various countries said. Spain's Health Ministry, for instance, issued a call for donations this week, telling people it's safe to donate during the pandemic.
In Greece, ""People are afraid to go and donate blood to hospitals because of the coronavirus"", said Konstantinos Stamoulis, scientific director of Hellenic National Blood Center in Athens. ""There are days when there is a reduction of up to 50% in blood donations compared to 2019,"" he said.
Back in Asia, many countries are now facing their most severe outbreak of coronavirus so far amid the Delta variant surge.
In Vietnam, the country's National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion said it could meet only 50-70% of demand. 

""We haven't been able to deploy mobile donor centres,"" said Le Hoang Oanh, head of the blood transfusion centre of Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's coronavirus epicentre.
""Instead, we have to call for donors to go to our permanent centres, which is a challenge given the movement restrictions in the city.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said on Thursday it has nearly achieved its goal of sourcing all of its paper food packaging in restaurants from recycled or sustainable fiber.
The Chicago-based global burger chain said in its annual sustainability report that in 2020 99.6% of the paper bags, food wrappers, napkins, cup carriers and other fiber-based materials it used to package meals for customers came from recycled or certified sustainable fiber sources, up from 92% in 2019. 
Many restaurant chains are working to reduce environmental harm from packaging, including using more recyclable or compostable materials and letting customers reuse cups or bowls.
An Adweek-Harris Poll survey of U.S. adults in April about single-use fast-food packaging found that 62% of respondents said they would think more highly of a brand that switched to recyclable packaging, and 81% were concerned about litter and pollution from fast-food restaurants.

Because McDonald's has more than 39,000 restaurants globally, small changes can ripple into other companies and industries.
McDonald's has set a larger goal for all of its customer packaging to come from renewable, recycled or certified sources by 2025. Currently, 80% of its packaging comes from such sources. It is also using paper straws and wooden cutlery in multiple markets, it said, and is exploring fiber lids and reusable cups.

The $11 billion project doubling the capacity of the first Nord Stream pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres a year has been a focal point of tensions between Moscow and the West.
Despite U.S. sanctions, Nord Stream 2 is almost complete and the key question is how Russia will ship its gas to Europe once a current transit deal between Kyiv and Moscow expires in 2024.
After meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Kremlin on Friday, Putin said Russia planned to fully comply with its obligations on gas transit via Ukraine. 
He said Moscow was ready to send gas via its neighbour even after 2024 but Russia needed to understand the scale of demand for its fossil fuel first.
""And for this, we need to get an answer from our European partners on how much they are ready to buy,"" Putin told a news conference. ""We cannot sign a transit contract if we don't have supply contracts with our consumers in Europe.""
The European gas market is eagerly awaiting Russian flows via Nord Stream 2 as European gas prices have reached record highs due to low liquefied natural gas supplies.
Putin said future gas supplies were a matter for talks given Europe's green energy drive.

Ukraine has opposed the construction of Nord Stream 2, saying it was politically motivated. 
Before the Putin-Merkel talks on Friday, Ukraine's state energy firm Naftogaz said the project breached European Union regulations, could not work commercially and should be stopped.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 11:41AM ET</span>",Half a trillion dollars wiped from China markets in a week as clampdowns shatter confidence,"By Tom Westbrook and Samuel Shen
(Reuters) - China's tech stocks slumped to new lows on Friday and Hong Kong's benchmark index hit an almost 10-month trough, as an unrelenting series of Chinese regulatory crackdowns crushed investors' confidence.
More than $560 billion in market value has been wiped off Hong Kong and mainland China exchanges in a week as funds capitulate out of once-favoured stocks, unsure which sectors regulators will target next.
The Hang Seng fell 1.8% and its weekly drop of 5.8% was the largest since the height of the pandemic panic in financial markets in March 2020.
Stocks in Shanghai also fell, while investors sold risky corporate debt and the Chinese currency. The yuan was poised for its biggest weekly loss in two months as investors rushed to safety amid global coronavirus concerns. [CNY/][.SS]
U.S.-listed shares of China-based tech-related companies gained ground as bargain hunters took advantage of recent sell-offs resulting from Beijing's ongoing regulatory crackdown, which has wiped half a trillion dollars from Chinese markets this week.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Holding Group,  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), Didi Global and iQiyi Inc advanced between 1% and 4.5%.
""There isn't really one trigger, but many bits and pieces that add to the narrative to stay away from China,"" said Dave Wang, a portfolio manager at Nuvest Capital in Singapore.
""Almost on a daily basis you have negative news coming out, so it forms the impression there's no end in sight."" 
This week alone China announced tougher rules on competition in the tech sector, summoned executives at property developer Evergrande to warn them to reduce the firm's massive debt and state media reported looming regulations for liquor makers, a favourite tipple for foreign fund managers.
On the heels of crackdowns spanning from steelmaking to e-commerce and education, the moves are sapping faith in a market that seems yet to find a floor after months of selling. 
The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1% to its lowest close in more than two weeks on Friday and blue chips fell 1.9%, with liquor makers leading losses.
China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) was a rare bright spot and surged on its debut in Shanghai. 
Graphic: Sell the dip?, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykkdbzpg/Pasted%20image%201629441872893.png 
The epicentre of the selloff has been the tech sector, which had been popular with foreign investors who are now afraid they can't quantify the regulatory risk and are selling in droves.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech index, comprised of many one-time darlings, dropped 2.5% on Friday to a new record low and has shed about 48% since February.
E-commerce titan Alibaba's Hong Kong shares fell 2.6% to a record closing low and have halved from an October peak. Internet giant Tencent touched a 14-month low and food deliverer Meituan hit a one-year low. 
""There's a herd mentality at the moment,"" said Louis Tse managing director of Hong Kong brokerage Wealthy Securities. ""People see one person selling and then they do the same.""
As a result, Alibaba now commands its lowest price-to-earnings ratio since its listing in New York in 2014 and Tencent its lowest in more than eight years. 
""Tencent and Alibaba wouldn't be trading around 20 times earnings if the general mood around them was optimism,"" said Tariq Dennison, managing director at GFM Asset Management in Hong Kong, who was actually a buyer of both on Friday.
Adding to regulatory worries are concerns that China's economic recovery is losing momentum and debt risks are rising, as data points to slowing demand and factory output and suggests authorities are cracking down at a delicate time.
Policymakers' persistence with curbing red-hot property prices, for example, has markets on edge and corporate credit fell further on Friday with the news that heavily-indebted Evergrande had been rebuked by regulators.

The yuan has fallen through its 200-day moving average against a broadly rising U.S. dollar and weakened past the psychological 6.5 per dollar mark, hitting a three-week low of 6.5059 during onshore trade on Friday.
The Hong Kong dollar sits close to its weakest in a year and a half, also suggesting money is moving out of the city.

This underperformance is creating an opportunity to pick up some quality small cap stocks for a year-end rally.For much of the past few years, small caps have consistently underperformed large caps. From December 2018 to February 2020, the S&P 500 was up 45%, while the small cap-index the Russell 2000 was up 36%. Needless to say, this is unusual as historically, small caps outperform large caps during bull markets. Some potential factors for this change in behavior are interest rates trending lower, the dominance and growth of mega-cap tech stocks which have become a large portion of the S&P 500, and lackluster economic growth. 
This trend continued in the initial months of the pandemic following the stock market bottom in March 2020 as money flowed into tech stocks whose revenues were accelerating and large-cap stocks which were able to take advantage of lower rates. Entering 2021, there was optimism about small caps outperforming large caps especially with rising interest rates and an acceleration in economic growth. From November 2020 to March 2021, the Russell 2000 was up 55%, while the S&P 500 was up 33%. 
Since then, large caps have grabbed the baton once again with the S&P 500 up 15%, while the Russell 2000 is down 6%. Although small caps face some notable headwinds in the coming months, this weakness is creating an opportunity in a handful of stocks with improving fundamentals. Investors who are looking to increase exposure to this asset class should consider buying Build a Bear Workshop (BBW), Eurodry (EDRY), and Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR).

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 11:20AM ET</span>",Nvidia's $40 billion deal for ARM dealt blow by UK regulator,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -Nvidia Corp's planned $40 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM hit a major hurdle on Friday after a UK regulator found it could damage competition and weaken rivals, and required a further lengthy investigation. 
Struck in September last year, the deal for Britain's most important technology company by the world's biggest maker of graphics and AI chips sparked a swift backlash from politicians, rivals and customers. 
In Britain, it has also become politically charged, with critics arguing that a rise in economic nationalism and greater awareness of the need to own key infrastructure means ARM, owned by Japan's SoftBank since 2016, should not be sold again.
On Friday, Britain's competition regulator added to the pressure, saying the merged entity could reduce competition in markets around the world and in sectors as large as data centres, the internet-of-things, automotives and gaming. 
To pass a deal with serious competition implications, the regulator would normally require a disposal of the part of the merged business that has the power to harm rivals. But the concerns around ARM and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) span the whole business. 
The deal also raised alarm because it poses a threat to innovation in industries that form the backbone of modern economies.
""We're concerned that Nvidia controlling ARM could create real problems for Nvidia's rivals by limiting their access to key technologies, and ultimately stifling innovation across a number of important and growing markets,"" said Andrea Coscelli, head of Competition and Markets Authority.
POWERFUL COMBINATION
ARM is a major player in global semiconductors, a sector fundamental to technologies from artificial intelligence and quantum computing to 5G telecoms networks. Its designs power nearly every smartphone and millions of other devices.
Semiconductors also underpin critical infrastructure in Britain and the government has said they are in technology related to defence and national security matters. 
The deal also sparked anger in the semiconductor industry, where Arm has long been a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers who are otherwise intense rivals, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The fear among chip firms is that Nvidia will give itself early access to Arm's innovations rather than distributing them to the entire industry on an equal basis. 
While Nvidia had offered remedies to lessen the impact, the UK regulator did not believe they would alleviate its concerns. 
Nvidia, which had hoped to wrap up the deal by March next year, said on Wednesday it was taking longer to win the necessary approvals than expected and some U.S. based analysts have said they believe the takeover will be blocked. The deadline for the deal is September next year. 
Nvidia said on Friday it believed the deal remained beneficial to the industry and ARM's CEO has said the proposed merger would better support the creation of jobs and enable it to invest in the technologies of the future, as opposed to it becoming a standalone public company. 
The sale of ARM last year came as SoftBank sold a string of other assets to reduce its debt. 
The UK government will now consider the findings and give a fuller response at a later date, which will also include its thinking on any impact on national security. A full in-depth inquiry takes around six months. 

Britain's government could then block the takeover, approve it or allow it to pass with certain undertakings. 
Britain has seen a record number of takeover bids this year, with private equity and listed firms pouncing on everything from supermarkets to pharmaceutical groups and even the maker of its torpedoes and submarine sensors.

The awards, first held in 1966, are the longest-running honors in country music and had been broadcast live in the United States on the CBS broadcast channel. CBS decided to instead air the CMT Music Awards, country music honors voted on by fans, in April 2022.
That opened an opportunity for Amazon, which has been buying rights to live events, including the NFL's ""Thursday Night Football,"" to draw more viewers to Prime Video.

Audiences for live events including the Oscars, Emmys and Olympics have been declining on traditional television as streaming video has exploded.
The 2022 date and location for the Country Music Awards has not been announced. For the past two years, the show has taken place in venues around Nashville, rather than its former home in Las Vegas, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

And with the USDA lowering its production forecasts, food inflation is expected to climb further in the coming months. This could drive the performance of commodities like coffee, wheat, and corn. Hence, commodity ETFs Teucrium Corn (CORN), iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return (JO), and Teucrium Wheat (WEAT) could be solid bets now. So, please read on for a discussion of these funds.Extreme weather conditions worldwide have been reducing agricultural commodity yields, leading to a spike in food prices. Rising temperatures and debilitating droughts in the Dakotas and Central Canada have pushed wheat prices up to their highest level in nearly eight years. 
As dry conditions hamper production, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects wheat production for the 2021-22 marketing year to be 1,697 million, down 49 million bushels from its July forecast. This has sparked a rally in the commodity futures market, with Wheat futures rising to their highest level last week since May. Corn futures also gained momentum after the USDA slashed its supply and yield forecast for the commodity. Coffee prices are also on the rise, driven by the devastating frost in Brazil. And as restaurants reopen, growing demand along with constrained supply will surely translate to further price increases. Furthermore, a rise in freight costs due to pandemic-related shipping disruptions and a shortage of shipping containers could push prices to multi-year highs in the coming months. Therefore, coffee, corn, and wheat futures are positioned to skyrocket.
With this in mind, we think it could be wise to invest in commodity ETFs Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN), iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return ETN (JO), and Teucrium Wheat (WEAT).

The challenge lies in balancing the risk inherent to a tech investment with the prospect of a nearly guaranteed dividend. Though dividend payment is not absolutely guaranteed, it is highly likely.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",White House withholds support of Democratic carbon border tax,"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) -The White House is withholding support for a Democratic proposal to impose a pollution tax on imports from China and other countries, casting doubt on whether Democrats will be able to deploy what environmentalists consider one of the greatest weapons to tackle global climate change in a massive spending bill this year. 
The United States is the closest it has ever been to imposing a carbon border tax - which seeks to level the playing field between U.S. companies which face environmental regulations at home and foreign competitors with less rigorous standards - after Democrats included the proposal in their $3.5 trillion reconciliation package last week that they hope to pass along party lines by mid-September. 
U.S. President Joe Biden and top members of his administration have said publicly they support a carbon border tax as a tool to advance climate goals, but the White House has not endorsed the Democratic proposal, spearheaded by longtime Biden ally Senator Chris Coons. The tax, as outlined by lawmakers, would raise billions by levying a tariff on carbon-intensive imports, but leaves specific details up to the Biden administration. 
The White House is concerned the Democrats' proposal will raise prices on a host of consumer goods, from cars to appliances, and conflict with Biden's pledge not to tax any American earning less than $400,000 per year, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. The White House is also worried any tax that raises prices could fuel Republican attacks that his policies are driving up inflation, they say. 
The White House plans to withhold support as the U.S. Treasury and other administration officials try to coordinate tax policy with trading allies like the European Union, which recently announced its own carbon border tax.
""We believe that carbon border adjustments in relation to carbon-intensive goods represent a potential, useful tool. We do not have a comment on any specific proposals at this time,"" a White House official said. ""We will continue to engage with Congress, our partners around the world, and other stakeholders, including workers and domestic industry, on this issue.”
PROTECT JOBS, CUT EMISSIONS 
The idea of a carbon border tax was aimed at helping rich countries retain manufacturing jobs and investment that have gone for decades to lower-regulation countries, and encourage other countries to also price carbon and drive down emissions. The EU's tax, proposed https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/eu-proposes-worlds-first-carbon-border-tax-some-imports-2021-07-14 last month to go into effect in 2026, was the world's first. 
It is also considered a way to keep American companies whose manufacturing processes emit heavy amounts of carbon pollution from relocating to countries with looser environmental rules, a phenomenon known as leakage. The U.S. economy lost https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-manufacturing-china-insight/away-from-spotlight-u-s-manufacturers-battle-back-from-china-shock-idUSKCN10F0CT almost a third of its manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, as China emerged as a low-cost manufacturing superpower. 
More than a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions globally come from the industrial sector, notes Collin O’Mara, president of the National Wildlife Federation.
""A key way to reduce that source of pollution is to ensure the foreign polluters reduce emissions to match U.S.-based manufactures, while expanding exports of low-emission American-made products around the world,"" O'Mara said.
In the U.S. congressional proposal, companies that want to sell concrete, steel, aluminum or other commodities into the United States would be required to pay a tariff if their country imposes fewer carbon-cutting regulations than American companies. 
The tax could hit companies like Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) while making such products from U.S. companies like  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) and  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) more competitive. 

The White House's concerns about a carbon border tax hitting less wealthy Americans are valid if foreign companies raise prices in response to protect profits, said David Weisbach, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an expert in carbon border tariffs. 
“The tariff will raise consumer prices on people that buy, say, automobiles, since it's going to be on steel and aluminum used to make automobiles,"" he said, adding it would ""unquestionably"" raise prices for U.S. consumers earning less than $400,000 a year.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - In Israel's COVID-19 wards, doctors are learning which vaccinated patients are most vulnerable to severe illness, amid growing concerns about instances in which the shots provide less protection against the worst forms of the disease. 
Around half of the country's 600 patients presently hospitalized with severe illness have received two doses of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) shot, a rare occurrence out of 5.4 million fully vaccinated people. 
The majority of these patients received two vaccine doses at least five months ago, are over the age of 60 and also have chronic illnesses known to exacerbate a coronavirus infection. They range from diabetes to heart disease and lung ailments, as well as cancers and inflammatory diseases that are treated with immune-system suppressing drugs, according to Reuters interviews with 11 doctors, health specialists and officials. 
Such ""breakthrough"" cases have become central to a global debate over whether highly vaccinated countries should give booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and to which people. 
Israel began offering booster doses to people age 60 and up in July, and has since expanded that eligibility. 
The United States, citing data out of Israel and other findings, said on Wednesday it would make booster doses available to all Americans beginning in September. 
Other countries, including France and Germany, have so far limited their booster plans to the elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
""The vaccinated patients are older, unhealthy, often they were bedridden before infection, immobile and already requiring nursing care,"" said Noa Eliakim-Raz, head of the coronavirus ward at Rabin Medical Centre in Petach Tikva. 
In contrast, ""the unvaccinated COVID patients we see are young, healthy, working people and their condition deteriorates rapidly,"" she said. ""Suddenly they're being put on oxygen or on a respirator."" 
Israel's Health Ministry raised new alarm this week with a report showing the effectiveness against severe disease of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with Germany's BioNTech, appeared to have dropped from more than 90% to 55% in people age 65 and up who received their second jab in January. Disease experts say it is not clear how representative the figures are, but agree it is concerning given evidence that overall vaccine protection against infection is waning. 
They cannot say whether that is due to the amount of time that has passed since inoculation, the ability of the highly contagious Delta variant to evade protection, the age and underlying health of the people vaccinated, or a combination of all of these factors. 
Health officials in the UK and United States, two other nations with high vaccination rates and a spike in Delta infections, have reported similar trends. In the UK, about 35% of the people hospitalized with a Delta case in recent weeks had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. breakthrough infections that led to hospitalization or death were among people age 65 or older, according to federal data. 
U.S. officials said their booster plan is based on concern that over time, the vaccines will provide less protection against severe disease, including among younger adults. 
""We are watching other countries carefully and (are) concerned that we too will see what Israel is seeing, which is worsening infections over time"" among vaccinated people, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said at a press conference on Wednesday. The World Health Organization has repeatedly urged wealthy nations to refrain from providing boosters while much of the world has yet to access their first COVID vaccine doses. 
IMMUNE RESPONSE 
The Delta variant, first identified in India, has become the dominant version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus globally, accelerating a pandemic that has killed more than 4.4 million people. 
In Israel, daily new cases have increased from the single digits in June to around 8,000 since the arrival of Delta. Approximately half of the cases - the majority of them mild to moderate - are in vaccinated people. 
Those vaccinated first in Israel were at high-risk, including people age 60 and up. The immune response of some may have weakened by the time Delta hit Israel. But for others with underlying health conditions, the vaccine may have not kicked in at all. 
""For some of them the vaccine did not trigger an immune response, they had no antibodies, because of the illness itself or because they are treated with medication that suppresses the immune system,"" said Dror Mevorach, who heads the coronavirus ward at Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem. He cited examples such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. 
Among 3 million vaccinated Israelis covered by Clalit, the country's largest healthcare provider, 600 have suffered severe breakthrough cases since June. Around 75% of them were above the age of 70 and were at least 5 months after their second dose, according to Ran Balicer, Clalit's chief innovation officer. Nearly all of them have chronic illnesses. 
""We are hardly seeing young vaccinated people in severe condition,"" said Balicer. 
In the UK, doctors described similar characteristics among vaccinated patients who fall severely ill. 
""In those people who come in, because of their age, because of their co-morbidities, they might be people that you would expect that the vaccine is not quite so efficacious as other age groups,"" said Tom Wingfield, a clinical lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. 
A new surge in U.S. coronavirus cases and deaths has been fueled by Delta, particularly in states where vaccination rates remain low. Among vaccinated patients who become infected, there is evidence of older people being hit harder. 
In Texas, 92% of the vaccine breakthrough cases that resulted in death were in people over the age of 60 and 75% had a known underlying condition that put them at high risk from COVID-19, according to a public health department spokesperson. 
Initial data in Israel suggests the booster shots administered in the last few weeks are reducing the risk of infection in older people compared with those who have received only two doses.. 
Even without boosters, Israeli doctors say that vaccinated patients tend to recover more quickly. 
""The vaccinated patients I've treated usually left the ICU in about three days. The unvaccinated patients took a week or two until they stabilized,"" said Yael Haviv-Yadid, head of the critical care ward at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv. 

Even if the vaccine did not stop them getting ill, it may have mitigated their illness, said Alex Rozov, head of the coronavirus ward at Barzilai Medical Centre in Ashkelon. 
""Our cautious impression is that the vaccinated patients suffer an easier course of illness - the treatment is more effective among those who have antibodies.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, correcting modestly ahead of the weekend after three days of selling since the Federal Reserve tilted toward tapering its bond purchases as early as this year. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 98 points, or 0.3% at 34,992 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
The market was cheered by comments from Robert Kaplan, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve and one of the Fed's more hawkish members, as saying that policy-makers may need to revise their opinions about timing the withdrawal of monetary stimulus if the spread of the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus results changes consumer and business behavior again. 
Kaplan told Fox News that the situation was ""unfolding rapidly."" 
""So far it’s not having a material effect” on much consumer behavior, he said, although last week's data showed a sharp drop in consumer confidence. But “it is having an effect in delaying return to office, it’s affecting the abilty to hire workers because of fear of infection,” and may be affecting production output, Kaplan argued.
Investors have fretted for much of the week that the Fed could withdraw support just as the economy starts to lose momentum again, The seven-day average for new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. hit its highest since February this week, while the country also had its worst day for Covid deaths since April. Additionally, reports of sustained snarl-ups in supply chains due to China's efforts to bring the virus under control are threatening to ensure that shortages of many goods, especially electronics, continue into the U.S. holiday season.
Chipmaker Nvidia' (NASDAQ:NVDA)s stock was one of the most conspicuous gainers, rising 2.6% after a routine disclosure showing that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had bought up to $1.5 million in stock and call options on the company. That news is arguably of less material importance to the company than the publication of a review by U.K. antitrust authorities saying its proposed acquisition of chip designer ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) would seriously damage competition. The news makes the deal for U.K.-based ARM less likely to be completed, substantiating widespread expectations of that regulators may block it.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) stock rose 9.0% after strong earnings through July showed that the company has largely absorbed the shock of major suppliers  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) trying to shift business to direct sales online. 
On the downside, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stock fell 2.5% despite beating expectations, while Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock fell as much as 11%, amid reports of a note from Cleveland Research warning of increased pressure on its sales from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Investing.com – Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) was up more than 1% in Friday’s premarket trading after a disclosure that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had bought stock and call options on the chipmaker.
Official disclosures show that Pelosi made the transactions, worth as much as $1.5 million, on July 23rd. The trading activities of Pelosi and her family have caught the eye before, most notably when her husband took a position in Slack stock before the software company agreed to be bought by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
Members of Congress routinely trade stock on their own account but are compelled to disclose major transactions.
The news, interpreted (without any substantiating evidence) by some as suggestive of the company enjoying a privileged relationship with lawmakers, outweighed less positive news released slightly earlier in the U.K., where the Competition and Markets Authority warned that its proposed $40 billion acquisition of chip designer ARM would have materially negative effects on competition.
According to reports, several chipmakers including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), had objected to the deal, saying they would be disadvantaged by the deal.
The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority agreed and said it does not believe any form of behavioral remedy offered by the two companies would address its concerns.
Nvidia, with annual revenue of $16.68 billion, is a leading manufacturer of chips, particularly those used for graphics in computers and in graphics processing units used in data center servers.
ARM is a holder of multiple IP technologies that go into designing of chips. It primarily supplies IP relating to central processing units to semiconductor suppliers and systems-on-chip developers globally. Such suppliers, including Nvidia, use ARM's IP to produce semiconductor chips and related products for a variety of applications.
ARM estimates 70% of the world’s population engages with ARM-based technology.
ARM also has a joint venture, headquartered in Shanghai, with Chinese private equity firm Hopu Investments. Nvidia will need the approval of the authorities there and many experts don’t see that approval coming through either.
Nvidia had set an 18-month deadline last September while proposing the acquisition.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>",Fortress mulls options after Morrisons agrees rival CD&R takeover,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Shares in Morrisons jumped above the level of an agreed takeover offer from U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) on Friday, indicating a protracted bid battle for the British supermarket group may yet have further to run.
The UK's fourth-largest grocer is the subject of the most high-profile deal amid a raft of bids and counter bids playing out in Britain, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK Plc.
The latest twist in the saga came late Thursday when Bradford, northern England, based Morrisons said its board would unanimously recommend CD&R's 285 pence a share offer worth 7 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) and drop its previous recommendation for a 6.7 billion pound bid from a consortium led by SoftBank owned Fortress Investment Group.
The latest offer represents a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid-June.
However, shares in Morrisons, which lags Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda in UK market share, were up 4.3% at 291.2p by 1128 GMT on hopes Fortress will return with an even higher bid before shareholders vote on CD&R's offer at meetings expected around the week of Oct. 4.
Major Morrisons investors Silchester, M&G, JO Hambro and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) declined to comment on their intentions.
Having previously said it is ""committed to becoming the new owner of Morrisons"", Fortress has now said it is considering its options and urged shareholders to take no action, pending a further statement.
If Fortress remains keen it is also possible the Takeover Panel, which governs deals in the UK, could instigate an auction process.
Analysts said the Fortress consortium, which also includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Koch Real Estate Investments and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, certainly has the firepower to go higher.
The question remains however whether it can make a return on its investment at a higher level without needing significant asset sales.
Morrisons, which has more than 110,000 staff and a largely freehold store estate, is unique among British supermarkets in making half of the fresh food it sells. It owns meat and fish processing sites and even its own trawler.
Analysts have speculated that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could also still enter the fray, though most believe it would have done so by now if interested.
TESCO FRIENDS REUNITED
CD&R has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser and a takeover of Morrisons would reunite him with its Chairman Andrew Higginson, Chief Executive David Potts and Chief Operating Officer Trevor Strain, who all worked with him at Britain's biggest retailer.
Potts would make 10.3 million pounds by selling his shares to CD&R, while Strain would pocket 4.1 million pounds.
In line with the assurances Fortress had given, CD&R has committed to retain Morrisons' existing management and execute its strategy. It does not plan material store sale and leaseback transactions.
One change that is expected is CD&R could combine its 918 Motor Fuel Group (MFG) fuel forecourts with the 339 owned by Morrisons, opening Morrisons convenience stores on the sites. 
That could face scrutiny from the competition regulator. 

Earlier this year, when rival Asda was sold to TDR Capital and the Issa brothers in a 6.8 billion pound deal, the regulator insisted on petrol forecourt disposals.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's king appointed Ismail Sabri Yaakob as the prime minister on Friday, returning the job to a party tainted by graft accusations as the southeast Asian nation grapples with a COVID-19 surge and an economic slump.
Ismail Sabri replaces Muhyiddin Yassin, who stepped down on Monday after coalition infighting cost him his majority, but the new prime minister's backing by the same alliance raises concerns that he will also lead an unstable government. 
Ismail Sabri is to be sworn in on Saturday, the palace said, after he secured a slim majority with the backing of 114 of parliament's 222 members. 
""His Majesty expressed the hope that with the appointment of the new prime minister, the political crisis can end immediately and all lawmakers can unite to put aside political agendas,"" it said in a statement.
King Al-Sultan Abdullah has previously said the new prime minister would have to face a confidence vote in parliament to prove his majority.
Ismail Sabri's appointment restores the post to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysia's 'grand old party', which was voted out in a 2018 general election, after a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB.
He becomes Malaysia's third prime minister since the 2018 election, after UMNO pulled its backing for Muhyiddin last month, citing his failure to manage the pandemic.
""With a razor-thin majority, he will need to make sure he does not face rebellions of those who are eyeing his position,"" said Sivamurugan Pandian, a political analyst at the Malaysian Science University.
Ismail Sabri, who was Muhyiddin's deputy and one of the ministers who helped fight the pandemic, takes over at a time when Malaysia's infections and deaths per million rank as the region's highest.
Friday's 23,564 cases represented a third straight day of record infections, carrying the tally beyond 1.5 million.
A trained lawyer and member of parliament since 2004, Ismail Sabri has been minister for rural and regional development, agriculture and domestic trade in previous governments.
Markets had little immediate reaction. The ringgit currency,, which has been pressured by the political instability and the pandemic, held steady.
THE RETURN OF UMNO
Malaysia has been in a state of political flux since the defeat of UMNO, which had governed for more than 60 years since independence. Two coalitions have collapsed since then because of the infighting.
Mahathir Mohamad led the opposition to a historic election victory for the first time, but his alliance collapsed from infighting.
Muhyiddin then put together a coalition with parties that had been defeated in the polls, including UMNO, but it, too, proved fragile, as the party balked at playing second fiddle.
Corruption could worsen under UMNO's leadership, with no guarantee of the stability its past governments brought, said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
""Having an unreformed UMNO back at the centre of power hardly bodes well for the future,"" he added. 

UMNO politicians facing corruption charges include president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and former premier Najib Razak, who was convicted last year over a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). 
Both men deny wrongdoing. They remain highly influential and were among the UMNO lawmakers who pulled support from Muhyiddin.

Investing.com – Deere stock (NYSE:DE) traded 1.4% higher in Friday’s premarket as the company revised its outlook after strong demand for its farm and construction equipment doubled its profit in the third quarter.
Higher offtake of its equipment and improved realizations drove the operational performance of the company in the quarter ended August 1. The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and led to higher demand for commodities, farm and non-farm. Equipment makers of all hues have benefited as economies have boomed and demand has come from farms and mines alike.
As a percentage of net sales, Deere's costs and expenses, relative to net sales, fell by 1 percentage point from a year earlier. 
Net income is now seen in a range of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion, up from the $5.3 billion-$5.7 billion range given by the company in May. The midpoint of the new range is over 5% higher than the previous range's. Deere's revised earnings estimate assumes an 8% gain in prices for large farm machines, Reuters said.
“Looking ahead, we expect demand for farm and construction equipment to continue benefiting from favorable fundamentals,” John C. May, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said in a note.
Net income of $1.67 billion was more than double last year's $811 million. Net sales were 29% higher at $11.52 billion and comfortably topped the analysts’ estimate of $10.3 billion.

The spread of the highly infectious Delta variant and the announcement of new guidelines from a U.S. health agency have forced companies in the United States to rethink their plans on vaccinations, masking and return to office.
Several big companies, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, have mandated vaccinations for their U.S. employees.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has pushed back its office return date for all U.S. employees until January 2022.

According to the Bloomberg report, the iPhone maker told staff it would confirm the re-opening timeline one month before employees are required to return to the office.

(Reuters) - Air Canada sees a ""strategic advantage"" for its cargo business in Canadian hubs like Toronto as shippers seek to bypass logjams at some U.S. gateways.
Lifted by e-commerce demand, cargo-only flights emerged as a lifeline for carriers during the pandemic when commercial traffic slumped. Half of air cargo normally travels in the belly of passenger jets.
While North American airlines are reducing all-cargo flights as passenger traffic rebounds, that shift is more gradual in Canada due to a slower easing of travel restrictions. 
Cargo remains important for Canada's largest carrier, accounting for 43% of second-quarter revenue, even as it restores passenger flights, a company executive told Reuters. 
""We (cargo) were a single-digit piece of the business before COVID. We hope to be a bigger part of that in the future,"" Jason Berry, Air Canada's vice president for cargo, said in an interview, without providing a target.
Air Canada's ambition comes as international air cargo volume hit its strongest first-half growth since 2017, airline trade group IATA said. But staffing shortages and space constraints have exacerbated congestion at hubs like Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and at some U.S. ports.
U.S. railroad operator  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) recently warned that bottlenecks at West Coast ports have spread East, impacting some inland terminals, including Chicago.
BYPASSING CONGESTION
Air Canada, which trucks cargo arriving at Toronto Pearson International Airport to its facilities in Chicago and New York, could appeal to freight forwarders seeking alternatives like secondary U.S. airports to bypass the congestion, said Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders Association.
""Many of the airports in the U.S. in particular have ramped up quickly, and with that rapid growth there has been operational challenges. We’re seeing congestion, massive lines and wait times to recover product at major gateways,"" Air Canada's Berry said.
""We have our own facility in Chicago with our own employees, while a lot of our competitors are suffering because the U.S. has seen such a quick rebound that there is a lot of struggle for manpower down there,"" he said.
""With our own facilities we can control our own destiny and effectively bypass much of the disruption. We believe we have a strategic advantage in our Toronto hub, actually all of our hubs: Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.""
Keeping employees to handle cargo, as opposed to contracting out such tasks, helps airlines have more control over service and workforce when there is a labor shortage, said Stan Wraight, president of Montreal-based Strategic Aviation Solutions International (SASI).  
Air Canada's services could be competitive on time against carriers that fly indirectly to O’Hare, said Wraight, of SASI, which advises airlines, airports and financial organizations on air cargo logistics.
However, the Canadian carrier would lose advantages in efficiency against airlines that offer non-stop direct service to Chicago, he said.
""Competitors of Air Canada with direct flights are on the ground and unloading cargo a day earlier,"" said Wraight, whose company has previously done work for the carrier.
Shawn Richard, vice president for global air freight at SEKO Logistics, said the company has increased its volumes with Air Canada, which he said can save two to three days' time. 
SEKO, a U.S.-based global logistics and freight forwarding specialist that also uses certain U.S. carriers, would increase business with Air Canada if the ""situation deteriorates,"" Richard said. 
CARGO SURGE
O'Hare has processed nearly 1.3 million metric tonnes of cargo through the first half of 2021, a near 50% surge from a year ago, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA).
Soaring shipments ""challenge O’Hare’s cargo ramps, both airside and landside,"" but the CDA is taking steps to alleviate congestion and expand cargo facilities, a spokeswoman said by email.
Berry said Air Canada's introduction of new converted Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767 freighters this year will help its business even as it draws down cargo-only flights on widebody passenger jets from roughly 285 a week during the second quarter to around 125 flights a week later this year.
Freighters, equipped with pallets and a main deck cargo door, are easier to unload than ""loose-loaded"" passenger planes that moved cargo onto the main deck during the pandemic, Wraight said.

Berry said the return of fully vaccinated American travelers to Canada this month will also help cargo.
""We know that means more airplanes flying into the U.S. and that opens trade lanes for the globe to feed into and out of the U.S. on our network.""

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson stock (NYSE:JNJ) traded nearly 1% lower in Friday’s premarket as the company said Alex Gorsky, its Chairman and CEO of nine years, will don the role of Executive Chairman and hand the CEO’s role to company veteran Joaquin Duato.
Doato is currently J&J’s vice chairman of the executive committee and will take the new job from January 3.
Gorsky cited ""family health reasons"" for the decision to move away from the high-pressure job.
During Gorsky’s tenure, the company had its highs and lows, most of which the CEO negotiated with mixed degrees of success. This year alone, the company has been ordered to pay $2.1 billion in restitution to users of its baby powder who subsequently developed cancer, and agreed to pay $5 billion to settle charges that it helped fuel the opioid epidemic. Duato will be able to take over relatively free from any uncertainties around those two long-running issues. 
Gorsky also established J&J as a major player in the rare diseases market and led its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the only single-shot jab in the market - albeit one that has struggled to overcome negative publicity associated with allegations of associated thrombosis risk.
Duato has held a variety of roles in his more than 30-year-association with J&J. He most recently oversaw its pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses, which have a combined $60 billion in sales.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 06:24AM ET</span>",Cannabis firms catch a whiff of opportunity in Brazil,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - International cannabis companies are showing interest in Brazil, both its large consumer market for medicinal products and a proposal that could legalize planting of the crop. 
Major producers like Colombia's Clever Leaves and Canada's  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) are developing and selling medicinal cannabis products to a Brazilian consumer segment estimated at 10 million to 13 million people. This results from a 2019 regulatory change allowing the import, sale and manufacturing of such products. 
But permission for cultivation of hemp and cannabis in Brazil would be a bigger prize. If granted, the industry could blossom in four to five years, based on the experience of other countries such as Colombia.
""By 2025, I would like to be planting hemp in the interior of Pernambuco,"" said José Bacellar, founder of Canada's VerdeMed, referring to a northeastern state known for illegal marijuana growing. 
A proposal that would legalize cultivation was approved in June by a congressional committee. Lawmakers are weighing if it could be fast-tracked to the Senate for approval. If passed there, President Jair Bolsonaro would have to sign it into law. 
While Bolsonaro's far-right positions may seem an unlikely match for the bill, the proposal has support from some members of the powerful farm sector, a key constituency that helped him win the 2018 election. 
SILICON VALLEY OF CANNABIS 
In the quiet town of Viçosa in southeastern Brazil - which some call the Silicon Valley of cannabis - researchers are developing a hemp variety better suited to the tropics.
If the law is changed and research is successful, Brazil could become a top grower of cannabis and hemp, experts said.
Sérgio Rocha, director of ag-tech startup Adwa which is developing the hemp strain for Brazil, said about 3 million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles) of land would potentially be suitable for cultivating the new variety.
Brazil could overtake China, the world's largest hemp producer, which has about 670 square kilometers (259 square miles) planted.
""Using a part of Brazil's agricultural land would be enough to give the country the title of world's largest producer and exporter of hemp fibers, seeds and flowers for medicinal and industrial purposes,"" said Dennys Zsolt, an agronomist specializing in the plant.
Brazil bans growing of Cannabis sativa L, the plant that produces hemp and marijuana. Hemp, which has less than 0.3% of the psychoactive compound THC, contains CBD or cannabidiol. This non-intoxicating ingredient has been touted as beneficial for many health conditions including childhood epilepsy.
Growing the plants in Brazil would lay the foundation for a vertically integrated industry. A stable source of the raw material would support manufacturing of medicinal cannabis products, growth of a retail market and exports. Recreational cannabis would remain illegal.
Gabriela Cezar, chief executive of New York-based Panarea Partners investment banking firm, sees Brazil playing a leading role in hemp in Latin America, a region she calls the ""epicenter of world hemp production."" 
Panarea plans to form a Brazilian cannabis company focused on pharmaceutical products for pets while seeking to broker more cannabis deals in Brazil. 
TROPICAL ADVANTAGE 
Among Brazil's advantages are lower growing costs because its warm climate allows plants to grow outdoors compared to greenhouses in some countries. Stable hours of sunlight due to Brazil's proximity to the equator are another plus. 
Canopy Growth is ""actively monitoring the advancement of hemp regulations in Brazil,"" David Culver, the company's vice president of global government relations, said. 
But nothing is certain without the change to Brazil's law, though some signs suggest the prospects are favorable. When Rocha spoke to a congressional committee about hemp in 2019, he was surprised that conservative lawmakers were not hostile.
    ""After I finished presenting the maps and hemp's potential, I was applauded,"" he said.

Although the farm caucus has not taken a formal position, members of the group said a majority in both houses of Congress back the proposal. The farm caucus controls slightly fewer than half the seats in the two chambers, and the law requires approval by a simple majority. 
Center-right lawmaker Fausto Pinato, a member of the farm caucus, said he supports the bill. ""If you are authorizing the sale, why not cultivation?,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Mizuho Financial Group's main banking unit suffered a system glitch that left branches nationwide unable to process transactions on Friday, the latest in a series of embarrassing system errors at Japan's No. 3 lender.
The glitch in Mizuho's core ""Minori"" banking system prevented in-person transactions on Friday morning, with service at about 460 branches mostly restored by 09:45 a.m. (0045 GMT) local time.
Mizuho shares closed down 1%, in line with the benchmark index. 
The outage is the latest blow to the reputation of Mizuho, which suffered a series of breakdowns between February and March this year despite a $3.6 billion overhaul of its systems in 2019. 
That revamp followed two large-scale breakdowns in 2002 and 2011.
The fresh outage piles further pressure on group CEO Tatsufumi Sakai and banking unit head Koji Fujiwara, who both took temporary pay cuts following the earlier tech trouble.
""As this is the fifth glitch in a short period of time, we take this extremely seriously,"" Sakai told a press briefing.
Asked about his responsibility, Sakai said he wants to fulfil his responsibility by beefing up prevention measures which the bank has been pursuing since the previous glitches.
The glitch also affected the group's trust bank unit, while automated teller machines (ATMs) and online banking services were unaffected.
Mizuho first detected the glitch on Thursday evening, but said its backup system failed to operate immediately. 
In-branch services are widely used by Mizuho's older and corporate customers.
""This latest trouble has pushed me towards thinking about closing my account,"" Yoshiyuki Sakata, 41, a Mizuho customer in Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo, told Reuters.
Japanese chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference that the system glitch was regrettable and that regulators must respond firmly.
""We want Mizuho to restore its system and respond carefully,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters. ""We have not received any report from Mizuho yet as to how they are dealing with it.""

Mizuho shares have gained 18.6% this year outperforming the Nikkei 225, which is down 1.6%. 
A report https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/mizuhos-system-failures-caused-by-corporate-culture-third-party-probe-says-2021-06-15 in June commissioned by Mizuho found that its corporate culture - including an atmosphere where managers are reluctant to express their opinions and unable to respond well to crises - was to blame for its tech problems.

(Reuters) - Chinese steelmakers Ansteel Group and Ben Gang formally began the process of merging their operations on Friday, the official Xinhua news agency reported, in a move that will create the world's third-largest producer of the metal. 
State-owned Ansteel is taking a 51% stake in smaller rival Ben Gang from the regional state assets regulator, with no money changing hands in a government-backed restructuring that is part of a drive to consolidate production in China's bloated steel sector.
The merged entity, which will retain the Ansteel name, will have annual production capacity of 63 million tonnes of crude steel, Xinhua said, after combining the operations of the companies whose headquarters are only some 60 km (37 miles) apart in northeast China's Liaoning province.
A special conference on the merger was held on Friday morning in the city of Anshan, it added.
The extra production will see Ansteel leapfrog HBIS Group to become China's second-biggest steelmaker and put it third globally behind only China Baowu Group and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) . 
Ansteel produced 38.19 million tonnes of crude steel in 2020, data from the World Steel Association show, while Ben Gang churned out 17.36 million tonnes.
By 2025, Ansteel aims to be producing 70 million tonnes of crude steel per year, as well as more than 50 million tonnes of steelmaking raw material iron ore and generating 300 billion yuan ($46 billion) in annual revenue, Xinhua said.

A combination of Ansteel and Ben Gang has been discussed for more than a decade. The merger appeared to be off https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-steel-benxi-ansteel-idUSKCN1QN16E in 2019 but a ""strategic restructuring"" of the companies was announced in April this year.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) traded 0.6% lower in Friday’s premarket as the Federal Trade Commission slapped it with a fresh suit alleging abuse of its dominant market position..
A federal judge had in June dismissed the agency’s original lawsuit, saying its allegations weren’t substantial enough to support claims of unlawful monopolization. Judge James Boasberg had given FTC another chance to file a fresh case.
The allegations, now more substantial, center around the same cause that Facebook unlawfully suppresses competition. Its purchase of messaging app Whatsapp and image-sharing app Instagram have been cited as instances of that practice. The commission seeks to unwind those deals.
Adopting strong-arm tactics, such as preventing third-party app developers from accessing Facebook’s platform, have also been presented against the company in the new 80-age lawsuit.

Investing.com – Marks and Spencer stock (LON:MKS) climbed 11% in Friday’s premarket trading as robust sales in its fiscal first quarter pushed the retailer to raise its forecast for annual profit.
Sales were so strong in the first quarter that the company brushed aside uncertainty about consumer demand and the possibility of pent-up demand inflating the numbers to revise its outlook.
The high-street fashion retailer now expects adjusted profit before tax for the year to be above the upper end of its previous guidance of £300 million-£350 million ($408 million-$476 million).
Tweaking the approach to trading, including more focused ranges, fewer promotions and a substantially smaller summer sale helped drive the retailer’s sales of its clothing and home product line. Revenue from the business grew 92% year-on-year in the 19 weeks to August 14. It is now down a mere 2.6% from the pre-pandemic period.
Online traffic drove sales as many high-street locations remained in slow recovery. The company added third-party clothing and footwear brands to its online portfolio and the company said they performed well.
Food revenue rose 11% and the company relied on cost reductions to mitigate inflation in prices and disruption in supply chain.
International revenue rose 40% as impetus on online helped mitigate the impact of lockdown in India and Brexit-related impact on the supply of food to its businesses in the Republic of Ireland and France.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 21.4% from a year earlier to $55.3 billion in July, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Friday. 
That was the 17th month of expansion, and the pace was faster than the median forecast of a rise of 20.85% in a Reuters poll. 
The ministry attributed the performance to demand for 5G telecom equipment and semiconductors. 
Demand for electronics like laptops to support the ""home economy"" also remained strong, with the COVID-19 pandemic still restricting the movement of millions around the world, theministry added. 
In June, export orders surged 31.1% from a year earlier to$53.73 billion. 
Taiwan companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech firms. 
The ministry warned of uncertainty over the spread of COVID-19 variants around the world, saying that tighter anti-virus measures in some countries were impacting supply chains. 
However, it saw upside in countries speeding up COVID-19 vaccinations, plus continued strong demand for 5G and the auto sector, which has been badly affected by a shortage of chips. 
It expects export orders in August to rise between 20.9% and 24.2% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States jumped 16.5% in July from a year earlier, a slower rate of expansion compared with the 24% logged in June, while orders from China were up 20.1%, versus a gain of 36.7% the previous month.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 04:31AM ET</span>","For bank regulators, tech giants are now too big to fail","By Iain Withers and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - More than a decade on from the financial crisis, regulators are spooked once again that some companies at the heart of the financial system are too big to fail. But they're not banks.
This time it's the tech giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that host a growing mass of bank, insurance and market operations on their vast cloud internet platforms that are keeping watchdogs awake at night.
Central bank sources told Reuters the speed and scale at which financial institutions are moving critical operations such as payment systems and online banking to the cloud constituted a step change in potential risks.
""We are only at the beginning of the paradigm shift, therefore we need to make sure we have a fit-for-purpose solution,"" said a financial regulator from a Group of Seven country, who declined to be named.
It is the latest sign of how financial regulators are joining their data and competition counterparts in scrutinising the global clout of Big Tech more closely.
Banks and technology companies say greater use of cloud computing is a win-win as it results in faster and cheaper services that are more resilient to hackers and outages.
But regulatory sources say they fear a glitch at one cloud company could bring down key services across multiple banks and countries, leaving customers unable to make payments or access services, and undermine confidence in the financial system.
The U.S. Treasury, European Union, Bank of England and Bank of France are among those stepping up their scrutiny of cloud technology to mitigate the risks of banks relying on a small group of tech firms and companies being ""locked in"", or excessively dependent, on one cloud provider.
""We're very alert to the fact that things will fail,"" said Simon McNamara, chief administrative officer at British bank NatWest. ""If 10 organisations aren't prepared and are connected into one provider that disappears, then we'll all have a problem.""
RAPID PACE
The EU proposed in September that ""critical"" external services for the financial industry such as the cloud should be regulated to strengthen existing recommendations on outsourcing from the bloc's banking authority that date back to 2017. 
The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) meanwhile wants greater insight into agreements between banks and cloud operators and the Bank of France told lenders last month they must have a written contract that clearly defines controls over outsourced activities. 
""The FPC is of the view that additional policy measures to mitigate financial stability risks in this area are needed,"" it said in July.
The European Central Bank, which regulates the biggest lenders in the euro zone, said on Wednesday that bank spending on cloud computing rose by more than 50% in 2019 from 2018.
And that's just the start. Spending on cloud services by banks globally is forecast to more than double to $85 billion in 2025 from $32.1 billion in 2020, according to data from technology research firm IDC shared with Reuters.
An IDC survey of 50 major banks globally identified just six primary providers of cloud services:  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft, Google, Amazon,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) – the largest cloud provider according to Synergy Group - posted sales of $28.3 billion in the six months to June, up 35% on the prior year and higher than its annual revenue of $25.7 billion as recently as 2018. 
While all industries have ramped up cloud spending, analysts told Reuters that financial services firms had moved faster since the pandemic after an explosion in demand for online banking and emergency lending schemes.
""Banks are still very diligent but they have gained a higher level of comfort with the model and are moving at a fairly rapid pace,"" said Jason Malo, director analyst at consultants  Gartner  (NYSE:IT). 
(Graphic: Bank spending on cloud tech set to soar Bank spending on cloud tech set to soar - https://graphics.reuters.com/BANKS-CLOUD/zjvqkqbnzvx/chart.png) 
NO MORE SECRECY
Regulators worry that cloud failures would cause banking systems to fall over and stop people accessing their money, but say they have little visibility over cloud providers.
Last month, the Bank of England said big tech companies could dictate terms and conditions to financial firms and were not always providing enough information for their clients to monitor risks - and that ""secrecy"" had to end.
There is also concern that banks may not be spreading their risk enough among cloud providers.
Google told Reuters that less than a fifth of financial firms were using multiple clouds in case one failed, according to a recent survey, although 88% of those that did not spread their risk yet planned to do so within a year.
Central bank sources said part of the solution may be some form of mechanism that offers reassurance on resilience from cloud providers to banks to mitigate the sector's aggregate exposure to one cloud service - with the banking regulator having the overall vantage point.
""Regardless of the division of control responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the bank, the bank is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness of the control environment,"" the U.S. Federal Reserve said in draft guidance issued to lenders last month.
FINRA, which regulates Wall Street brokers, published a report on Monday ahead of potential rule changes to ensure that using the cloud does not harm the market or investors.
Being able to switch cloud providers easily when needed is, however, a task that is more easily said than done and could introduce disruptions to business, the FINRA report said.
'THE BUCK STOPS WITH US'
Banks and tech firms contest the suggestion that greater adoption of the cloud is making the financial system's infrastructure inherently riskier.
Adrian Poole, director for financial services in the United Kingdom and Ireland for Google Cloud, said the cloud can be more effective in bolstering a bank's security capabilities than by building it in-house.
British digital lender Zopa said it had moved 80% of its transactions to the cloud and was working to mitigate risks. Zopa Chief Executive Jaidev Janardana said the company was also deliberately leaning on tech firms' expertise.
""Cloud providers invest a lot of resources in security at a scale that few individual companies could manage,"" he said.
Google's Poole said the company was open to working more closely with financial regulators.
""We may one day see regulators pulling data on demand from regulated banks with cloud-enabled application programming interfaces (APIs), instead of waiting for banks to periodically push data at them,"" he said.
NatWest's McNamara said the bank was collaborating closely with tech firms and regulators to mitigate risks, and had put alternative services in place in case things went wrong.
""The buck stops with us,"" McNamara said. ""We don't put all our eggs in one basket."" 

One problem, though, is that not all banks have a full understanding of the risks to resiliency that could come with a wholesale shift to the cloud, said Jost Hoppermann, principal analyst at Forrester, particularly the smaller lenders.
""Some banks do not have the necessary know-how,"" he said. ""They think doing this will vanish all their problems, and certainly that isn't true.""

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Friday, with the U.K.’s retail sector in the spotlight after a slump in the country’s retail sales adding to concerns of a slowing global economic recovery.
At 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
The U.K. retail sector has been in focus Friday, with private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice raising its offer for WM Morrison Supermarkets (LON:MRW) to 7 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) as the battle for Britain’s fourth-largest grocer heats up.  
The move puts pressure on Fortress, the owner of Majestic Wine, which had increased its bid to 6.7 billion pounds at the start of August, and Morrison’s stock climbed 4.7%, to a 52-week high, as the market anticipated a further counterbid.
Meanwhile, Marks and Spencer's (LON:MKS) stock soared almost 11% after the giant of the U.K. high street raised its profit guidance for the full year, as revenue recovered to just 3% below its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter.
Still, U.K. retail sales dropped 2.5% in July, a sharp slowdown from the revised 0.2% growth in June, which the ONS put down to the combination of Euro 2020 - which saw England reach the final of the tournament - and bad weather keeping shoppers away from shops.
European markets have struggled this week as investors turned more risk averse, driven by concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be on the verge of reining in its pandemic-era monetary stimulus measures. That’s added to worries about the spread of Covid-19 variants and their impact on global growth, China’s regulatory crackdown and turmoil in Afghanistan. 
Earlier Friday, Chinese authorities passed a major data protection law on Friday, along the lines of Europe's Global Data Protection Regulation, the latest in a series of moves that will hit the way the country’s technology giants operate.
Back in Europe, German factory prices soared 1.9% in July, up 10.4% on the year and at a level that is likely to catch the attention of the European Central Bank.
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Friday, near three-month lows, but are still heading for hefty weekly losses amid concerns about global demand growth, as measures to tackle the delta coronavirus variant hit mobility.
By 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $63.48 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $66.37. Both contracts are on course for weekly losses of around 6% after falling to their lowest levels since May on Thursday.

China Telecom has sought more diversified financing channels after the U.S. removed the company and two other Chinese wireless giants from the New York Stock Exchange following an executive order by former president Donald Trump. 
China Telecom could be followed by more listings by Chinese companies in the mainland or Hong Kong, as Beijing extends a crackdown on local firms listing abroad. 
China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., the world’s largest mobile operator by subscribers, is also seeking a second listing in Shanghai, planning to raise 56 billion yuan to invest in projects including 5G networks. China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. announced on Thursday that it’s considering a mainland listing for its technology arm.
While the three companies are seeing a recovery in subscriber addition and user revenue, China Telecom is growing the fastest, with 11.5 million new customers in the first half of the year. China Mobile had 3.6 million users and China Unicom added 4.6 million. 
Unlike China Mobile -- which has been building 5G networks mostly on its own -- China Telecom co-develops its infrastructure with China Unicom, putting less pressure on its budget. 
China Telecom could also see accelerating sales growth from its enterprise and industrial digitalization businesses as it looks to diversify, driven by increasing demand for cloud and data center services, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai said in a note earlier this month. 
Proceeds from the new listing will be used to develop 5G infrastructure and applications, cloud businesses and further research and development, according to China Telecom’s filing to the Shanghai stock exchange.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A lacklustre end to a painful week,"A look at the day ahead from Karin Strohecker. 
It hasn't been a pretty week for equity investors - or many others really. 
The Delta variant keeps spreading, economies keep slowing, China keeps going with its regulatory crack down. And on top of that, Fed tapering remains likely this year - leaving some to fear that Jerome Powell's team could deliver what they see as a policy mistake, tapering into a slowing economy.
World stocks are set for a 2.5% weekly drop, the Hang Seng tech index has tumbled 12% over the same period - both suffering their worst such falls since February. 
With Beijing just having passed a new personal data privacy law - another plank in its push to regulate cyberspace -- Asian stocks fell again. European futures fare mixed, U.S. futures flag losses ahead.
Hopes that more stimulus from China could shore up sentiment faded after Beijing's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a 16th consecutive month.
Predictably, the safe-haven dollar is enjoying all this and scaling fresh 9-1/2 month peaks, inflicting some losses on commodities. Oil is on track for a weekly loss of over 5%, while global bond yields stayed subdued.
Now it's all eyes on the Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, where Powell will give a closely watched speech.
In the meantime, Germany said its economy is on track for a lasting, probably stronger recovery in the third quarter driven by lively domestic demand as markets fret over another coronavirus wave rippling through the region. 
It's pretty slim pickings on the corporate front. 
British supermarket Morrisons is in focus after it upended a take over bid from a consortium led by Fortress Investment Group by agreeing to a higher offer worth 7.0 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) from U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R).
Irish construction material firm Kingspan reports a record H1 profit, U.S. machinery maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co posts earnings later in the day. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:

1345,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 02:08AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Largely Lower; U.K. Retail Sales Slump,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely lower Friday, with a slump in U.K. retail sales adding to concerns of a slowing global economic recovery as China continues its regulatory clampdown.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
European markets have struggled this week as investors turned more risk averse, weighed by concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be on the verge of reining in its pandemic-era monetary stimulus measures. That’s added to worries about the spread of Covid-19 variants and the impact on global growth, China’s regulatory crackdown and turmoil in Afghanistan. 
Earlier Friday, Chinese authorities passed a major data protection law on Friday, along the lines of Europe's Global Data Protection Regulation, the latest in a series of moves that will hit the way the country’s technology giants operate.
Back in Europe, U.K. retail sales slumped 2.5% on the month in July, a dramatic slowdown from the 0.5% growth in June, while German factory prices soared 1.9% in July, up 10.4% on the year and at a level that will surely catch the attention of the European Central Bank.
Remaining in the retail sector, private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice has raised its offer for WM Morrison Supermarkets (LON:MRW) to 7 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) as the battle for Britain’s fourth-largest grocer looks set to heat up.  Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS), meanwhile, will be in the spotlight after raising its profit guidance for the full year, as revenue recovered to just 3% below its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter.
The move puts pressure on Fortress, the owner of Majestic Wine, which had increased its bid to 6.7 billion pounds at the start of August.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher Friday, rebounding from three-month lows, but are still heading for hefty weekly losses amid concerns about global demand growth, as measures to tackle the delta coronavirus variant hit mobility.
Crude has also been buffeted this month by the rise in the dollar on the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting back its extraordinary monetary stimulus in the near future.
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $63.84 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $66.72. Both contracts are on course for weekly losses of around 6% after falling to their lowest levels since May on Thursday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,789.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1684.

Investing.com – Shanghai  HeartCare Medical Technology  Corp Ltd.'s (HK:6609) shares plunged on their first trading day on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange while  China Telecom  (NYSE:CHA) Corp’s shares surged in its market debut in Shanghai on Friday.
HeartCare Medical’s Hong Kong shares slipped 23.51% to HK$130.8 ($16.81) by 1:26 AM ET (5:26 AM GMT). It comes after healthcare technology platforms need to get approval from the government for the methods of diagnoses, prescriptions and use of medicine to ensure safety, Chinese media said earlier in the day.
Founded in 2016, HeartCare Medical focuses on developing neuro-interventional medical devices, aiming to reduce the mortality rate and improve the prognosis of stroke.
Its product portfolio includes both neuro-interventional and cardiac medical devices, with both commercialized products and product candidates.
It has two core products, including CaptorTM thrombectomy device (Captor) and left atrial appendage (LAA) occlude. Captor is for the treatment of atacute ischemic stroke and has been commercialized in China, while and the LAA occlude is for atrial fibrillation and is in the process of NMPA registration review.
Nearly half of the net proceeds, or around HK$444.2 million, will be used for the R&D, manufacturing, and marketing of its core products. Four of its products have been commercialized. Moving forward, it expects to commercialize up to nine candidates in 2021 and about 10 candidates from 2022 and 2025, including the sirolimus intracranial drug-eluting balloon catheter for intracranial stenosis treatment.
Meanwhile, China’s largest mobile operator China Telecom’s shares surged nearly 44% on Friday. However, its Hong Kong shares (HK:0728) slid 5.12% on Friday.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",China Evergrande vows to resolve debt risks after regulators' warning,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande, the country's most indebted property developer, pledged on Friday to do everything it can to resolve its debt issues, a day after receiving a rare warning from concerned regulators to get its house in order.
Financial markets are worried that any crisis at Evergrande could ripple through China's banking system as the company struggles to find the cash it needs to pay its many lenders and suppliers.
Evergrande also said it would work to maintain the stability of the real estate market, in a statement issued hours after the People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission summoned company executives and warned that it needed to reduce its debt risks and prioritize stability.
The unusual summons came days after President Xi Jinping highlighted efforts to forestall major financial risks and as a flurry of regulatory crackdowns roil China's equity markets.
""Evergrande Group will fully implement the requirements of the interview and unswervingly implement the central government's strategic deployment of the stable and healthy development of the real estate market,"" the developer said https:// in the statement. 
Despite Evergrande's sale of a number of assets recently and bond repayments, analysts said the summons shows that the regulators are not satisfied with the company's progress in resolving its debt problems so far.
""This (is) a strong warning to the company and (we) expect an acceleration in asset sales, introducing strategic investors, and advancing negotiations with suppliers,"" Lucror Analytics credit analyst Chuanyi Zhou said. 
But investors appeared divided over its prospects. 
Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed shares reversed early gains to drop 2% by noon, taking their tumble so far this year to more than 75%.
Its yuan bonds due July 2022 rose 6.4%, but bonds maturing in May 2023 lost 8.6%, suggesting investors were more optimistic about repayments of its short-term debt than longer-term obligations. Respectively, the bonds were the biggest gainers and losers in Shanghai.
Wei Liang Chang, a strategist at Singapore's DBS Bank, said the summons should assure markets that policymakers will not be slow to respond to risks, though he added it might be too early to draw too many conclusions.
""While Huarong was granted a state-led recapitalisation, there is no equivalent policy relief for Evergrande,"" he said, referring to a rescue of one of China's bad debt managers announced earlier this week. Evergrande is privately owned.
Evergrande, which had $88 billion of interest-bearing indebtedness at the end of June, has been pursing asset sales, with Reuters reporting https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-evergrande-talks-with-xiaomi-consortium-sell-ev-unit-stake-2021-08-19 on Thursday of efforts to offload part of its electric vehicle business.
Evergrande said in a statement on Friday that its unit, Evergrande New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Group, had held preliminary talks with smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) regarding it coming on as a strategic shareholder, although there was no in-depth discussions. 

Evergrande also has more than 240 billion yuan ($37 billion) of bills and trade payables from contractors to settle over the next 12 months, according to ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
Concern over the developer's financial health intensified in June when it failed to pay some commercial paper on time. It has faced a growing number of legal claims over late payments.

Wyloo and Tattarang did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their intentions with the stake.

1349,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 11:54PM ET</span>",Evergrande Pledges to Fix Debt After Rare Rebuke From Regulators,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group pledged to fix its debt problems following a rare public rebuke from regulators as the developer struggles to stave off a liquidity crisis.
Evergrande said it will do its best to maintain stable operations, resolve debt risks, and keep stability in housing and financial markets. The People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission earlier told the group to address its debt woes and refrain from spreading “untrue” information. 
The regulators issued the joint statement late Thursday after meeting with the developer’s executives. Evergrande will disclose material events in accordance with laws and regulations and clarify untrue information in a timely way, the company said in a statement.
The rebuke is the clearest sign yet that Chinese authorities are losing patience with Evergrande, which poses a potential systemic risk to the world’s second-largest economy. With more than $300 billion of liabilities, the conglomerate’s fate has broad implications for China’s $50 trillion financial system and the nation’s banks, trusts and millions of homeowners.
“This is a strong warning to the company,” said Chuanyi Zhou, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics. “We expect an acceleration in asset sales, introducing strategic investors and advancing negotiations with suppliers.”
Analyst views were mixed on what the regulatory statement signaled about Beijing’s willingness to provide financial support to Evergrande via state-owned banks and investors. While some see the developer as too big to fail, market hopes for a government bailout have been fading in recent weeks.
Shares of Evergrande fell 1.8% at 11:24 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday after earlier climbing as much as 6.4%. Its 8.75% dollar bond due 2025 rose 0.9 cent on the dollar to 37.4 cents. A 6.98% local bond due 2023 climbed 6.1% to 67.9 yuan and is on pace to erase this week’s decline.
Evergrande also said its board will hold a meeting Aug. 31 to approve first-half results ended June 30. 
This isn’t the first time regulators have urged the developer to fix its debt problems. At a meeting in Beijing in June, officials at the Financial Stability and Development Committee asked billionaire founder Hui Ka Yan to consider bringing in strategic investors to stabilize the property giant, emphasizing the need to avoid major shocks to the economy, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Chinese government has so far kept quiet about whether it will provide financial support for Evergrande, leaving investors to guess at its odds of becoming the next casualty of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to rein in moral hazard and tighten the state’s grip on key sectors of the economy.
Shares of Evergrande have lost two thirds of their value this year amid mounting concerns over the financial health of the world’s most indebted developer. The sell-off deepened earlier this week after Hui stepped down as chairman of the conglomerate’s main onshore real estate unit. A capital injection for China Huarong Asset Management Co. announced on Wednesday did little to alleviate investor concern. 
The developer announced at the end of June that it had cut interest-bearing debt by about 20% in the first half to $88 billion. That enabled it to meet one of China’s “three red lines,” a trio of metrics that policy makers have used to encourage the property industry to deleverage.
Evergrande has been selling assets including stakes in units. Its China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. unit held preliminary talks with Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. to introduce strategic shareholders, but the companies didn’t go forward with further communications, Evergrande said in response to a media report on the discussions. 
“The developer may rush to find buyers for its stake in a new energy vehicle unit” after the talks with Xiaomi ended, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Patrick Wong and Lisa Zhou wrote in a note. Its 65% stake is worth HK$63.5 billion ($8.2 billion), based on Thursday’s closing price. Shares of Evergrande New Energy fell as much as 4.6% on Friday morning. 
Still, Evergrande’s debt-reduction efforts have failed to convince investors, partly due to concerns that the company is simply shifting obligations to other parts of its balance sheet. The developer’s total liabilities -- which include short-term payables such as commercial bills -- grew to a record 1.95 trillion yuan ($300 billion) last year. Several Evergrande units have fallen behind on commercial bill payments this year.

China's central bank, banking and insurance regulator summoned executives of Evergrande to a meeting on Thursday and issued a rare warning that the company ought to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability.
The Evergrande New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Group had a market capitalisation of $12.5 billion on Thursday and one of the sources said the consortium is looking to buy a significant minority stake.
Evergrande said in a statement on Friday that its unit, Evergrande NEV, had held preliminary talks https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-evergrande-group-says-will-maintain-stability-its-operations-2021-08-20 with Xiaomi regarding it coming on as a strategic shareholder, although there was no in-depth discussions.
Xiaomi has been in touch with various automakers, but it has yet to decide which one to work with, a spokesperson said on the company's official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account on Friday. Shenzhen's state asset regulator did not respond to a request for comment.
The talks were said by the sources to be at an early stage and subject to changes.
The developer said last week that it was in discussions with several independent third-party investors on the proposed sale of certain assets, including stakes in Evergrande NEV, as part of its efforts to reduce its debt. 
Smartphone maker Xiaomi has been ramping up investments in EV suppliers after it unveiled its EV ambition with an investment of $10 billion in March, following its peers from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Huawei Technologies Co as they bet on more cars becoming battery-powered and smart.
The potential deal would give Xiaomi EV production facilities to push forward its auto business, the sources said.
DEBT WARNING
Evergrande has been struggling to raise funds to pay its debts after Beijing stepped up curbs on the real estate sector to contain the risks of a bubble.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 11:10PM ET</span>",Ackman seeks SPAC relaunch to fix lawsuit's 'harm',"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Thursday he would pursue changes to his blank-check acquisition company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd to address ""the overhang"" of a lawsuit filed against it this week.
The lawsuit, filed by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Robert Jackson and others on behalf of a Tontine shareholder, argues that Ackman's special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) - the largest ever formed - broke the law by investing in securities while not properly registered with regulators.
It comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a closer look at potential abuses at blank-check companies as these vehicles have become extremely popular.
Ackman said in a letter to shareholders that the lawsuit was meritless but could not be resolved quickly at a time when Tontine has 11 months left to find a company to merge with before having to return capital to investors. SPACs are meant to merge with private companies and usually have two years to find a target to take public.
The legal uncertainty could deter potential merger partners from entering into a deal with Tontine, and weigh on other SPACs, Ackman said.
As a remedy, Ackman said he planned to give Tontine shareholders warrants in a ""better structured vehicle"" which he dubbed a special purpose acquisition rights company (SPARC). The SPARC warrants would give Tontine shareholders the right to invest in a merger with a private company once the target has been announced -- unlike a SPAC, where investors tie up their money while the sponsor searches for a suitable target.
The SPARC structure, devised by Ackman and never before tested on Wall Street, would have to be approved by the SEC as well as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Neither immediately responded to requests for comment.
""If we are successful in securing SPARC's approval, and I am confident that we will get it done, we will have a clear path to mitigate the harm that this litigation has and will continue to cause to Tontine shareholders and warrant holders,"" Ackman said.
If it gets the green light, and Tontine has yet to find a deal for itself, then Ackman said he will return the $4 billion Tontine raised from its initial public offering in July 2020 to its shareholders and also give them one SPARC warrant for each share they own.
Ackman's move and offer to ""mail back over $4 billion worth of checks to investors...validates the strength of our claims and the urgent need to enforce existing investor protections in this industry,"" Jackson told Reuters.
ACKMAN'S SEARCH FOR A TARGET PLAYS ON
Ackman last month abandoned a deal for Tontine to buy a 10% stake in Universal Music Group (UMG), which was already in the process of being taken public by its French parent Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SE.
It was an unusual SPAC deal that the SEC took issue with, and Ackman was forced to substitute Tontine as an investor in the deal with his main hedge fund and Pershing Square Holdings Ltd, his Amsterdam-listed permanent capital vehicle.
The climbdown disappointed investors that had pushed Tontine shares as high as $34.10 in February. Tontine's stock dropped below its $20 IPO price for the first time on Thursday, as doubts grew over Ackman's ability to secure an attractive SPAC merger.

The lawsuit against Tontine took issue not just with general features of SPACs, such as investing in money market funds and U.S. government bonds, but also Tontine's doomed deal with UMG, which was not a traditional SPAC merger with a private company. Capital markets experts have said it is not clear whether the lawsuit's fallout will extent beyond Tontine.
Ackman's jittery start as a SPAC dealmaker has yet to deliver the successes he scored during his hedge fund career. His hedge fund posted returns of 70.2% return in 2020 and a 58.1% return in 2019. The successes followed double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 and smaller declines in 2017 and 2018.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 10:35PM ET</span>",J&J says veteran Duato to replace Gorsky as chief executive,"By Carl O'Donnell and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson on Thursday appointed Joaquin Duato as chief executive officer to replace veteran Alex Gorsky to steer the healthcare conglomerate through the remainder of the coronavirus pandemic.
Duato, the current vice chairman of the executive committee, will take the reins and a seat on the board from Jan. 3. Gorsky, who was at the helm for nine years, will become executive chairman. 
The transition will put the world's largest drugmaker by market value in the hands of a company veteran who took a leading role in J&J (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 response and helped shape its pharmaceutical business strategy. 
Gorsky said in a statement it was the right time to make the switch for both the company and him personally as he focuses more on family due to ""family health reasons.""
Gorsky oversaw massive growth during his tenure, establishing J&J as a major player in the rare diseases market and leading its development of the first single shot COVID-19 vaccine. 
But he was also at the helm during some of the biggest crises in the company's history, including allegations its Baby Powder contained cancer-causing asbestos and litigation claiming it contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The ""surprise and unexpected"" leadership change comes at a challenging time for J&J, but the transition is likely to be smooth given that Duato is a well-known executive with a successful track record, CFRA Research analyst Sel Hardy said in an email.
Duato has held a variety of roles during his more than 30 years at J&J, most recently overseeing its pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses, which have a combined $60 billion in sales. 
He helped establish a focus on the company's fastest growing therapeutic areas and helped lead the integration of data science and computer automation into J&J's research and operations.
During the pandemic, Duato led global initiatives ""to safeguard the health of employees and ensure business and supply chain continuity,"" Gorsky said. Duato was also the chairman of the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
J&J's market capitalization rose from nearly $180 billion to more than $470 billion under Gorsky's tenure, while its its share price increased by more than 170%.
The company's cancer drug business grew from $2 billion in sales in 2011 to over $12 billion in 2020 thanks in large part to blockbuster blood cancer treatments Darzalex and Imbruvica.
The move into medicines for rare diseases was boosted by its $30 billion acquisition of Actelion, the largest in its history. The vaccines division made significant breakthroughs beyond its COVID-19 shot, including innoculations against Ebola. 
But Gorsky's tenure has been colored by lawsuits and product recalls. 
Along with litigation over its Baby Powder and painkillers, J&J in 2019 paid over $100 million to settle claims from states that it misrepresented the safety and effectiveness of its transvaginal surgical mesh devices.

The drugmaker recently recalled certain spray sunscreen products after discovering some of them contained low levels of benzene, a carcinogen. 
J&J also faced major setbacks in its COVID-19 vaccine rollout earlier this year, when quality problems at a Baltimore manufacturing facility wasted millions of doses and delayed its production.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.80% by 9:49 PM ET (1:49 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.93%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.14%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.30%, with China's National People’s Congress Standing Committee expected to approve an anti-sanction law for the city later in the day.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.23%. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) released its latest one-year loan prime rate (LPR), which remained unchanged at 3.85%, and the five-year LPR, at 4.65%, earlier in the day.
PBOC and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission also released a joint statement on Thursday urging China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) to resolve its debt problems.
Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. continued their fall, with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. (HK:0700) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (HK:9988) shares tumbling more than 6%, as Chinese authorities continue to tighten private industry regulations.
Investors also continue to monitor the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next steps towards asset tapering and interest rate hikes, with the minutes from the latest Fed meeting hinting that the former could start as soon as 2021. More clues are expected to be given at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium, due to take place from Aug. 26. to 28.
Meanwhile, the global spread of COVID-19's Delta strain shows no sign of slowing down, with U.S. hospitals recording the highest death rates since February 2021.
“The Delta variant of COVID-19 is significantly more serious than anyone is really even pricing into the market,” Kramer Capital Research chief investment officer Hilary Kramer told Bloomberg.
“We know that tapering is coming. We know that the market is getting tired,” she added.
The combination of COVID-19 concerns and Fed concerns put global shares on track for one of the worst weeks in 2021 to date. Investors are also monitoring options expirations later in the day that could fuel volatility."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department on Wednesday said it will limit some flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after the Chinese government imposed similar limits on four United Airlines flights.
China told United on Aug. 6 it was imposing sanctions after it alleged five passengers who traveled from San Francisco to Shanghai tested positive for COVID-19 on July 21.
The U.S. order said the department will limit over a four-week period each of four Chinese carriers to 40% capacity on a single China-U.S. flight.
United Airlines said it was ""pleased to see this action by the (Transportation Department) in pursuit of fairness in this important market.""
Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that the United States has no ground to limit inbound air passenger capacity on Chinese carriers. 
China's ""circuit breaker"" policy treats all airlines fairly, including domestic carriers, said Hua, adding that China will continue with its epidemic control policies to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus. 
The U.S. government says China's ""circuit breaker"" policy violates the nations' air services agreement and ""places undue culpability on carriers with respect to travelers that test positive for COVID-19 after their arrival in China.""
The department added carriers ""have no means to independently verify positive test results alleged by Chinese authorities. Furthermore, there is no way to establish where or when a traveler may have contracted"" the virus.
Chinese authorities gave United three options: cancel two San Francisco to Shanghai flights; operate two without passengers; or operate four flights with up to 40% of passenger capacity.
The limits were imposed on four Wednesday United 
San Francisco-Shanghai flights, beginning with an Aug. 11 flight.
The Biden administration said it will impose identical limits on four flights over four weeks - one each from Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), China Southern Airlines Co and Xiamen Airlines.
The limits come as many Chinese students are headed to the United States for the start of fall classes.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, China and the United States have sparred over air services.
In June 2020, the United States threatened to bar Chinese passenger flights after Beijing did not immediately agree to restore flights by U.S. airlines.
U.S. carriers voluntary halted flights to China after the coronavirus outbreak. Then-President Donald Trump on Jan. 31, 2020 barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens from traveling to the United States who had been in China within the last 14 days.

Those restrictions on Chinese travelers remain in place. The Biden administration in April eased restrictions on Chinese students traveling to U.S. schools effective Aug. 1.
A long-standing air agreement between China and the United States allows both countries to operate more than 100 weekly flights between the two nations but only a fraction of those are currently operating.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Workers at a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) pickup-truck plant in central Mexico have voted to scrap their collective contract, opening the door for them to oust one of Mexico's largest labor organizations as their union under a new trade deal.
The vote, with safeguards agreed upon by Mexico and the United States to ensure a fair vote, was the first test of labor rules under an accord https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-autos-town-labor-rights-falter-despite-us-trade-deal-2021-05-03 that replaced the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The outcome marks a defeat for one of the most powerful unions in Mexico while representing an opening for workers to freely choose independent groups they feel will best fight for their interests.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the vote results demonstrated the role of the trade accord's rapid-response mechanism and congratulated the Mexican government for overseeing the vote.
""Free and fair union votes are a critical component of freedom of association and collective bargaining and the related labor provisions of the USMCA,"" Tai said in a statement.
An initial vote in April was suspended after Mexico's labor ministry found irregularities in the process, prompting the United States to lodge the first complaint under the labor enforcement mechanism of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which took effect last year.
The unionized workers will keep the same terms for pay and benefits as they seek new representation or create a union from scratch. Choosing a new union will require another vote, in which the current union could also vie to take back the contract.
Of 5,876 GM employees who cast ballots in the Tuesday-Wednesday vote at the plant in the city of Silao, 3,214 workers rejected the bargaining agreement while 2,623 workers voted to keep it, the labor ministry said. 
Many workers who campaigned for the ""no"" vote said their current union did not fight hard enough https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/gm-workers-historic-vote-mexico-tests-new-trade-deal-2021-08-17 for better salaries at the plant that produces thousands of profitable pickup trucks a year. 
""It's a huge peace of mind knowing we're no longer tied to this union,"" said G.D., a plant employee for more than 25 years who said he reached the top salary level for his position years ago, and who asked not to disclose his name for fear of reprisals.
The ballot count was led by the plant's Miguel Trujillo Lopez union - part of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) - alongside observers from the Labor Ministry, Mexico's National Electoral Institute (INE) and the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO).
GM said it respected the outcome and would continue production under the terms of the current contract until a new one is negotiated.
The Miguel Trujillo Lopez union said it respected the will of its workers who voted against keeping the contract.
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents thousands of GM's U.S. workers, said the vote would create a fairer playing field in Mexico, marking a win on both sides of the border.
Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, said the vote modeled what USMCA had aimed to achieve by giving workers a voice.
Mexico's labor ministry said the vote took place ""without incident"" and would help set a precedent for best practices. 
Such votes are required at unionized workplaces across Mexico under a labor reform that underpins USMCA labor rules and is geared at eliminating so-called sweetheart contracts between business-friendly unions and companies.
GM workers and labor activists hailed the outcome, saying it could inspire workers at other auto plants or elsewhere to follow suit by ousting unions that have long held power.
Richard Neal, chairman of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and other top Democrats said the vote showed how ""vigorous enforcement"" of labor standards in U.S. trade agreements could help dismantle pervasive obstacles to freedom of association and other workers' rights.

Still, the GM vote was only a first step on what could be a long path for workers to establish a new union, said Willebaldo Gomez, a researcher at Mexican labor rights group CILAS.
""The other victory will be building an independent union, an organization that looks out for their interests and watches over their rights,"" Gomez said.

(Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has given up its 49% stake in a Dominican refinery as part of a swap for some of its defaulted bonds, the Dominican Republic's finance ministry and Venezuela's oil minister said in statements on Thursday. 
The transaction represents a small breakthrough between the company and its creditors as U.S. sanctions, aimed at ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, complicate efforts to restructure billions of dollars in debt that PDVSA and the government have defaulted on amidst an economic collapse. 
As part of the deal, PDVSA subsidiary PDV Caribe S.A. first swapped its shares in the 34,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Refidomsa refinery for bonds held by a company named PATSA Ltd, a unit of Dominican cocoa company Grupo Rizek, which the finance ministry described as a ""facilitator"" of the transaction.
PATSA then immediately sold the shares to the Dominican government, which already owned the remaining 51% stake in the plant, for 74 million euros ($88.1 million). The plant is now fully-owned by the Dominican government.
That was far below the $135 million PDVSA paid for the minority stake in Refidomsa in 2010 as part of the late former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez' efforts at boosting the OPEC member's influence in the Caribbean through petrodiplomacy. PDVSA has neither sent crude to the refinery, nor received refined products from the plant, for several years. 
Venezuelan oil minister Tareck El Aissami said in a statement posted to Twitter that Venezuela and PDVSA reduced its outstanding debt as a result of the deal, without providing details. 
""This transaction demonstrates the firm commitment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and PDVSA to comply with their contractual obligations, despite the criminal external restrictions,"" the statement said, referring to U.S. sanctions on the company.

The Dominican Republic's finance ministry said the sanctions had complicated Refidomsa's ability to get credit and invest in expansion projects. It said it informed the U.S. government of the deal and that Washington did not object. 
The United States under President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on PDVSA in 2019 to cut off cash flow to Maduro, who it labels a dictator and accuses of corruption, election-rigging and human rights violations. The Venezuelan government denies this and accuses the U.S. of pushing for regime change.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and LinkedIn said this week they had moved to secure the accounts of Afghan citizens to protect them against being targeted amid the Taliban's swift takeover of the country.
Facebook has temporarily removed the ability for people to view or search the friends lists of accounts in Afghanistan, its security policy head Nathaniel Gleicher tweeted on Thursday.
Gleicher also said the company had launched a ""one-click tool"" for users in Afghanistan to lock down their accounts, so people who are not their Facebook friends would be unable to see their timeline posts or share their profile photos.
Human rights groups have voiced concerns that the Taliban could use online platforms to track Afghans' digital histories or social connections. Amnesty International said this week that thousands of Afghans, including academics, journalists and human rights defenders, were at serious risk of Taliban reprisals.
The former captain of the Afghan women's soccer team has also urged players to delete social media and erase their public identities.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it was in touch with civil society partners to provide support to groups in the country and was working with the Internet Archive to expedite direct requests to remove archived tweets.

It said if individuals were unable to access accounts containing information that could put them at risk, such as direct messages or followers, the company could temporarily suspend the accounts until users regain access and are able to delete their content.
Twitter also said it was proactively monitoring accounts affiliated with government organizations and might temporarily suspend accounts pending additional information to confirm their identity. A LinkedIn spokesman said the Microsoft-owned professional networking site had temporarily hidden the connections of its users in Afghanistan so other users would not be able to see them.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",U.S. judge signs off on $850 million Boy Scouts sex abuse settlement,"By Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) -The judge overseeing the Boy Scouts of America bankruptcy on Thursday approved the youth organization’s request to sign off on an $850 million settlement to resolve tens of thousands of sex abuse claims.
The ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein of Delaware will enable the Boy Scouts to move ahead with a proposed reorganization plan that would allow the group to exit bankruptcy by the end of the year.
""I find that debtors have met the relevant standard,"" she said in a court hearing.
The organization must still obtain approval from creditors to move ahead with the deal in a formal plan to exit bankruptcy. 
The creditors include victims of the abuse, who generally supported the settlement.
Founded in 1910, the Boy Scouts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2020 after being hit with a flood of sexual abuse lawsuits.
Claims multiplied after several U.S. states passed laws allowing accusers, including adults, to sue over allegations dating back several decades.
The Boy Scouts have apologized and said they are committed to fulfilling their “social and moral responsibility to equitably compensate survivors.” The organization has said ""nothing can undo the tragic abuse that victims suffered"" and that it believed the bankruptcy process was the best way to compensate them.
The Boy Scouts said in a statement that Silverstein's ruling is ""an important development in Boy Scouts of America’s financial restructuring.""
The settlement is backed by 250 local councils but opposed by insurers, who say representatives of the abuse claimants had too much say in the negotiations. 
The Boy Scouts' insurers, which include Century Indemnity Company and Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG), had argued throughout the bankruptcy process that some claims may be fraudulent. 
Unless the Boy Scouts reach a resolution with the insurers, they are likely to fight over the final bankruptcy plan. 
Century declined to comment on the judge's ruling.
Hartford did not immediately return a request for comment.
About 82,000 sex abuse claims have been filed against the Boy Scouts. 
In addition to the $850 million, the settlement includes the creation of a “child protection committee” designed to ensure safety for Scouts in future.
The judge rejected a provision of the deal that would have allowed the Boy Scouts to pay up to $10.5 million in fees and expenses accrued by lawyers representing several thousand victims.

She also rejected the organization’s request to toss a prior deal through which insurer Hartford Financial Services Group agreed to contribute $650 million to a settlement, leaving its dispute with Hartford lingering. The Boy Scouts effectively abandoned the Hartford agreement after representatives of victims said they would not support it.
Lawyers for the Boy Scouts, the insurers and victims of abuse are expected to appear before Silverstein on Aug. 25.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global banks and other financial institutions in Hong Kong are scrambling to find out details of China's planned imposition of an anti-sanctions law on the city, and trying to understand how it could impact their operations in the financial hub.
Beijing adopted a law in June under which individuals or entities involved in making or implementing discriminatory measures against Chinese citizens or entities could be put on a government anti-sanctions list.
Financial firms are closely watching a meeting this week https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-top-legislature-discuss-adding-anti-sanctions-law-hong-kong-friday-media-2021-08-17 of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the highest organ of China's parliament, for signs on how and when similar legislation will be introduced in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she did not have an explicit timetable for its implementation.
The move came as the U.S. government imposed several rounds of sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials over Beijing's crackdown on the city's freedoms under sweeping national security legislation.
Under the planned law, if financial institutions in Hong Kong implement U.S. sanctions, they may be exposed to legal risk in Hong Kong for doing so, financial sector executives and lawyers said. 
""Many foreign multinational companies are asking about the impact of the anti-foreign sanctions law, especially international banks and financial institutions,"" said Shaun Wu, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings.
""It is significant because international banks and financial institutions may find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place.""
Concerns have swirled over foreign financial institutions' prospects in one of their most lucrative markets since Beijing's implementation of the security law in the former British colony last year.
The anti-sanctions law now raises the spectre of financial firms getting caught in the crossfire as sparring between the world's two largest economies escalates. 
While top executives at Hong Kong's biggest financial firms have not aired their concerns in public, people familiar with the matter said there had been intense discussions internally on how to deal with it.
A senior executive told Reuters that Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan had abruptly cancelled a meeting with business groups scheduled for Thursday, without providing a reason. 
The executive, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter, said businesses were scrambling for information and Chan had made no effort to allay concerns despite repeated requests for meetings. 
Offices of the Hong Kong government and Chan did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
Hong Kong is the regional hub for many global financial firms, and accounts for the bulk of the profits for firms such as HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""Some of our financial institution clients are trying to plan out different scenarios ahead of the anti-foreign sanctions law, trying to decide what they would do if someone is sanctioned by the U.S. and subsequently run the risk of prosecution in Hong Kong for complying with such sanctions,"" said Rod Francis, head of FTI Consulting (NYSE:FCN)'s financial crime practice.
""But while scenario planning is useful, there's only so much of that kind of navel gazing you can actually do.""
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
The U.S. last year imposed sanctions preventing American companies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-hong-kong-sanctions-idUSKCN253215 and non-U.S. banks https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-hongkong-report-idUSKBN27008Q from doing business with several Chinese and Hong Kong officials whom it said implemented Beijing's national security law on Hong Kong.
A separate U.S. ban on investments in companies Washington considers linked to China's military forced U.S. banks in Hong Kong https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-hkex-idUSKBN29F0EY to cut exposure this year to several Hong Kong-listed Chinese telcos.
A lawyer at one international law firm in Hong Kong said they had been inundated with calls regarding the anti-sanctions law but they were in no position to provide advice, given the complete lack of clarity.
""We're waiting like everyone to see what is contained in the law ... it's hard to guess what will be in there,"" one U.S. bank executive said, also declining to be identified.
Senior executives at two large foreign banks in China told Reuters they had not received any specifics about the law even in the mainland and their efforts to seek clarity from regulators had not been successful.

Some financial and legal professionals hoped Hong Kong would implement a watered-down version of the mainland law to make sure the city is able to maintain its finance hub status.
Paul Hastings' Wu said a lot would depend on who will enforce the new rules and how. ""That agency is going to determine, in practice, how wide the space between the rock and the hard place will be.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has agreed a takeover offer worth 7.0 billion pounds ($9.54 billion) from U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), dropping its recommendation of a lower bid from a consortium led by Fortress Investment Group.
Morrisons, which started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899, said CD&R's offer is worth 285 pence a share, trumping a 272 pence a share offer, worth 6.7 billion pounds, from the consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress.
CD&R's offer gives the supermarket chain an enterprise value of 9.7 billion pounds once debt is included. Morrisons' board intends to recommend it unanimously.
The battle for Britain's fourth-largest grocer after Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda, is the most high-profile looming takeover amid a raft of bids and counter bids, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK Plc.
CD&R's agreed bid represents a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid-June.
Morrisons' shares closed on Thursday at 279.2 pence, indicating investors expected a higher offer.
CD&R, which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, had a 5.52 billion pounds proposal rejected by Morrisons on June 17.
Morrisons subsequently recommended a bid from Fortress worth 6.3 billion pounds, which was then raised after major shareholders, including Silchester, M&G and Hambro, indicated they wanted more.
CD&R has committed to retain Morrisons' existing management team led by CEO David Potts, and execute its strategy. It said material store sale and leaseback transactions are not planned.
TESCO OLD BOYS
""The Morrisons board believes that the offer from CD&R represents good value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders,"" said Chairman Andrew Higginson.
Potts, Higginson and Morrisons' chief operating officer Trevor Strain all worked with Leahy at Tesco.
Leahy said: ""CD&R is delighted to have the opportunity to support the management of Morrisons in executing their strategy to grow and develop the business.""
CD&R's current investments include Motor Fuel Group (MFG), which operates 918 fuel forecourts in the UK.
With Morrisons owning 339 fuel forecourts, CD&R is targeting a partnership to develop Morrisons' wholesale business and convenience store portfolio.
However, the forecourt overlap will likely face scrutiny from Britain's competition regulator.
Morrisons shareholders will vote on CD&R's offer at meetings expected around the week starting Oct. 4.
Under British takeover rules, Fortress could still come back with a higher offer.
Fortress said it was ""considering its options"" and urged shareholders to take no action.

Analysts have speculated that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could still enter the fray, though most believe if it was interested it would have done so by now.

Despite the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant that is threatening the global economic recovery, the EIA expects the global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels to average 97.60 million b/d for all of 2021. This reflects a 5.30 million b/d increase from 2020. The EIA also expects Brent prices to remain near current levels for the remainder of 2021, averaging $72/b from August through November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Oil fell to its lowest levels since May while the U.S. dollar surged to a nine-month high, as rising COVID-19 cases worldwide and the prospect of a looming Federal Reserve taper threw cold water on risk appetites.
On Wall Street, stocks ended the day mixed, with defensive and tech-heavy stocks regaining ground after two days of losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.11%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.73%.
Oil was down for its sixth straight session, with investors retreating over fears of weak demand amid a worsening pandemic and a rising U.S. dollar. Brent crude lost 2.6%, to settle at $66.45 a barrel. The most-active contract for U.S. West Intermediate (WTI) fell 2.6%, to $63.50 a barrel. It fell earlier to $62.41 a barrel.
The rise in Delta variant cases across the United States is weighing on hopes the economy could recover quickly, with recent economic data painting a murky picture.
Reticence to take on risk helped drive a decline in U.S. Treasury yields Thursday, with the benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR dipping to 1.242%.

Minutes from the Fed's July meeting loomed over markets this week, which showed officials dicussing easing back on unprecedented economic stimulus by year's end. While there was some division among Fed officials, steady progress on the economic front, particularly in job gains, could clear the way for an upcoming taper to monthly bond purchases.
The minutes solidified expectations the Fed will step back on stimulus before year's end barring some unpleasant economic surprise. 
""Any decision to begin tapering asset purchases will be highly conditional on the data flow. With the recent rise in COVID cases, the Fed will be monitoring the incoming data closely to make sure that the economy continues to make 'substantial further progress' toward its dual mandate (especially on employment) before announcing any changes to its asset purchase program,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analysts in a note, moving up their taper timeline to November from January. 

There was positive news on the employment front Thursday, with the Labor Department reporting that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a 17-month low last week. But gains in the job market also help nudge the Fed toward ending its stimulus effort.
The Fed focus now shifts to its annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech that will be scoured for clues on the central bank's next steps.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eked out a gain in a wild session Thursday, as strength in tech helped lift investor sentiment a day after the Federal Reserve's minutes signaled bond tapering by year-end.
The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, after falling by as much as 0.7% intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%, or 66 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.1%.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the rally in technology, ending the day up 4% after the chipmaker reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
The better-than-expected results were ""driven predominantly by datacenter […] in addition to strength in professional visualization,"" Wedbush said in a note as it reiterated its outperform rating on the stock with a $220 price target.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), meanwhile, climbed about 4% after reporting fiscal fourth quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, underpinned by strong order growth amid growing demand for 5G, digital transformation cloud security.
In big tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), cut its intraday gains to end lower amid fresh legal troubles after the Federal Trade Commission refiled its antitrust case against the social media company.
The FTC alleges that Facebook resorted to an ""illegal buy-or-bury"" scheme to maintain its dominance after failing to develop innovative mobile features for its network. The trade watchdog is called for the break-up of the company. 
""After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat,” said Holly Vedova, FTC Bureau of Competition Acting Director.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were flat, while  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT rose 1%.

The less robust forecast on the economic outlook comes as investors continue to digest the prospect of the tightening from the Federal Reserve by year-end.

""[M]ost participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year,"" the Fed's minutes showed."

Investing.com -- Stocks were mixed on Thursday heading into the final minutes of trading as investors weighed the timing of the Federal Reserve’s eventual tapering of its massive bond buying program.
Minutes of the July Fed meeting released on Wednesday suggested the Fed could begin reducing its bond buying later this year. While this would not come as a surprise to the market, investors nevertheless fret over the effect on stocks, which have been turbo-charged in the last year since the worst of the pandemic.
The S&P energy sector was the worst performer on Thursday as oil prices slumped another 2%. Signs of slowing growth, combined with a surge in new Covid-19 cases linked to the highly contagious delta variant, are making investors nervous about a fresh round of business shutdowns.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its forecast for third quarter economic growth to 5.5% from 8.5%, citing the damage the Delta variant spread would have on the economic recovery. That said, it raised its fourth quarter forecast to 6.5% from 5.5%.
Supply chain disruptions emerging from the pandemic continue to vex businesses, forcing them to raise prices and in some cases cut output 
On Thursday, major automakers such as  Toyota  Motor Corporation ADR (NYSE:TM)and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) said they would have to temporarily cut production or close plants because of a shortage of computer chips and other parts. 
In positive news, unemployment claims fell to a 17-month low last week, further evidence of recovery in the job market.
The Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week could provide investors fresh clues on the central bank's next steps.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow
1. Robinhood drama
Shares of popular mobile brokerage  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) plunged 11$ on Thursday after it warned that trading was slowing down. Robinhood has been a favorite vehicle of retail traders engaged in the so-called meme stock trade. It recently launched its own initial public offering.
On Wednesday it said it expected considerably fewer new funded accounts in the ongoing quarter than in the previous three months, which means lower revenue in the current quarter.
Total revenue soared 131% to $565 million in the second quarter as retail traders from the Reddit gang and everywhere else piled on the platform to trade in cryptocurrencies and equities. Expect the volatility to continue into Friday.
2. Farm equipment sales
Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), a maker of farm and construction equipment, reports results on Friday. Analysts expect third-quarter earnings per share of $4.57 on revenue of $10.3 billion. Listen to what the company says about the supply chain and orders heading into the last few months of the year.
3. Shoe retailer earnings
 Foot Locker  Inc (NYSE:FL) got a bounce earlier this year as consumers took their federal government stimulus checks and went shopping for new athletic shoes. With back-to-school season now in high gear, expect executives to outline their view of same store sales going forward. The company is seen clocking revenue of $2.07 billion in the second quarter and EPS of 97 cents.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>",FTC says Facebook 'bought and buried' rivals in renewed antitrust fight,"By Diane Bartz and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission refreshed its antitrust case against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday, adding more detail on the accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and once again asking a judge to force the social media giant to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.
At 80 pages, the new complaint is significantly longer than the original one and includes additional data intended to support the FTC's contention that Facebook is a monopolist. An expanded portion of the complaint argues that Facebook dominates the U.S. personal social networking market with more than 65% of monthly active users since 2012.
The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to file the amended lawsuit and denied Facebook's request that agency head Lina Khan be recused. Khan participated in filing the new complaint.
The agency also repeated its request that a court order Facebook to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012 for $1 billion, and WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014 for $19 billion.
The FTC accused Facebook of an ""illegal buy or bury scheme to crush competition"" in the headline of the press release on its complaint https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/08/ftc-alleges-facebook-resorted-illegal-buy-or-bury-scheme-crush.
Facebook said it would continue to fight the lawsuit.
""It is unfortunate that despite the court's dismissal of the complaint and conclusion that it lacked the basis for a claim, the FTC has chosen to continue this meritless lawsuit,"" a company spokesman said. ""Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were lawful.""
NOT THE SAME AS TWITTER 
The FTC's high-profile case against Facebook represents one of the most significant challenges the agency has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power.
""Despite causing significant customer dissatisfaction, Facebook has enjoyed enormous profits for an extended period of time suggesting both that it has monopoly power and that its personal social networking rivals are not able to overcome entry barriers and challenge its dominance,"" the amended complaint said.
In an effort to show Facebook's dominance in personal social networking, the FTC's complaint differentiated it from short video app TikTok and sites like Twitter, Reddit and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), which it said are not focused on connecting friends and family.
The amended complaint comes after Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in June that the FTC's original complaint filed in December failed to provide evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in the social-networking market.
Beginning in 2007, Facebook invited apps to its platform to make it more attractive but realized that some could develop into competitors, and slammed the door in 2013 to any app that could become a rival but reversed itself in 2018 under pressure in Europe, the complaint said.
""Having suspended its anticompetitive platform policies in response to anticipated public scrutiny, Facebook is likely to reinstitute such policies if such scrutiny passes,"" the complaint said.
Facebook shares were up 0.2% at $356.09 in afternoon trading.
'A BETTER COMPLAINT'
John Newman, who teaches at the University of Miami School of Law, said the complaint clearly responds to Judge Boasberg's concerns about the first version. ""There aren't huge new bombshells in here.""
A second antitrust expert said he believed the court would have a hard time ordering the sale of Instagram or WhatsApp because they were purchased years ago.
""It is a better complaint because it states with much more specificity that Facebook has dominance in social networking,"" added Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said she was pleased to see the FTC hold Facebook accountable for a ""long history of anticompetitive behavior.""
Alex Harman of consumer rights group Public Citizen said, in a reference to the FTC's new chair, Khan, that the refiling of the case ""should be a message to Facebook and other monopolists that there is a new sheriff in town and the party is over.""

Despite a 19.1% rise in direct earned premiums in its fiscal second quarter (ended June 30), the company failed to generate profits. Its adjusted gross loss came in at $4 million, down from a $16 million gross profit generated in the prior-year quarter. ROOT’s financials are expected to remain under pressure in the near term. Analysts expect its revenues to decline 59.7% year-over-year to $65.90 million in the third quarter (ending September 2021), while its EPS is expected to remain negative until at least 2022. The stock has lost 62.9% in price year-to-date.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value LP poached an analyst from asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s investment stewardship team, which exerts great influence on issues such as climate change and board makeup that often are critical to the hedge fund's campaigns, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Starboard hired Mack Abbot, a vice president at BlackRock who worked for the world's largest asset manager for nearly four years, for its investment team, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The move marks the second departure from BlackRock's investment stewardship team in two months as well as an unusual step in which one of the team's analysts is leaving to join an investment management firm not a bank, which had been a more traditional choice for others who departed previously.
Representatives for Starboard and BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Abbot did not return an email seeking comment.
Starboard, run by CEO Jeffrey Smith, has long been one of the industry's busiest and most powerful activist investors pushing for change at companies ranging from restaurant chain Darden (NYSE:DRI) to internet company Box, often trying the remove the CEO.
BlackRock and index funds Vanguard Group and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) help determine the outcome of many proxy fights because they generally own huge stakes in targeted companies.
With $9 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock recently signaled that it is taking a much tougher stance on climate and sustainability issues.
BlackRock's investment stewardship group employs dozens of people globally including about half a dozen analysts in the United States who vote on hundreds of proposals annually.
BlackRock last month said that Ray Cameron, who had been the head of investment stewardship for the Americas for three years, would be moving to another position within BlackRock's institutional client business.
A number of former analysts and executives, including Cameron's predecessor Zach Oleksiuk who joined investment bank Evercore, now work for banks defending against activists.

Starboard has been among the most successful activists in getting board seats and won six in the first half of 2021, including seats at  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), where it proposed three new independent directors. 
Separately, Douglas Snyder, a former managing director who had been with Starboard for nine years, this month moved to hedge fund Luxor Capital Group as president.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Co, the world's largest money transfer firm, has suspended services in Afghanistan, but is committed to resuming operations once conditions permit, it said following the crisis sweeping the country.
The flow of funds from migrant workers overseas are a key lifeline for many Afghans and have helped the economy of one of the world's poorest nations weather years of violence and instability.
Due to the ongoing situation in Afghanistan, current bank closures, and constraints on its agents' ability to operate, Western Union said it had suspended its services from Aug. 18, 2021, until further notice.
""Western Union understands the urgent need people have to receive funds, and we are committed to resuming operations for our customers in Afghanistan as conditions permit,"" it said in the statement to Reuters.
""We will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will keep all appropriate stakeholders apprised of further developments.""
Remittances to Afghanistan reached $789 million in 2020, around 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the World Bank estimated, down from $829 million in 2019. 
Remittance flows, international grants, subdued imports and resilient exports helped Afghanistan's current account surplus reach 14.2% of GDP in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said in June.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc on Thursday launched a test of a new virtual-reality remote work app where users of the company's Oculus Quest 2 headsets can hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves.
The beta test of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Horizon Workrooms app comes as many companies continue to work from home after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down physical workspaces and as a new variant is sweeping across the globe.
Facebook sees its latest launch as an early step toward building the futuristic ""metaverse"" that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted in recent weeks. 
The world's largest social network has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets, working on AR glasses and wristband technologies and buying a bevy of VR gaming studios, including BigBox VR.
Gaining dominance in this space, which Facebook bets will be the next big computing platform, will allow it to be less reliant in the future on other hardware makers, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company has said.
Facebook's vice president of its Reality Labs group, Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth, said the new Workrooms app gives ""a good sense"" of how the company envisions elements of the metaverse.
""This is kind of one of those foundational steps in that direction,"" Bosworth told reporters during a VR news conference.
The term ""metaverse,"" coined in the 1992 dystopian novel ""Snow Crash,"" is used to describe immersive, shared spaces accessed across different platforms where the physical and digital converge. Zuckerberg has described it as an ""embodied internet.""
It has been referenced in several recent earnings calls by tech CEOs including Zuckerberg,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Satya Nadella, gaming company Roblox Corp's David Baszucki and  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s Shar Dubey, who have talked about how their companies could shape aspects of this futuristic realm. 
In July, Facebook said it was creating a product team to work on the metaverse, which would be part of its AR and VR group Facebook Reality Labs. 
In its first full VR news briefing, the company showed how Workrooms users can design avatar versions of themselves to meet in virtual reality conference rooms and collaborate on shared whiteboards or documents, still interacting with their own physical desk and computer keyboard. The app, free through the Quest 2 headsets which cost about $300, allows up to 16 people together in VR and up to 50 total including video conference participants. Bosworth said Facebook was now using Workrooms regularly for internal meetings. 
The company said it would not use people's work conversations and materials in Workrooms to target ads on Facebook. It also said users must follow its VR community standards and that rule-breaking behavior can be reported to Oculus.

Facebook recently halted sales https:// of its Oculus Quest 2 headsets and recalled the foam face-liners due to reports of skin irritation in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. (https:// The recall notice said it affected about 4 million units in the United States, providing an estimate of Quest 2 headset sales which have not yet been officially announced by the company. Facebook reported non-advertising revenue, which comes from the AR and VR part of the business as well as e-commerce, of $497 million in the second quarter of 2021.

So, we think investors seeking to benefit from the trend could bet on PLBY Group (PLBY) and  Dolphin Entertainment  (NASDAQ:DLPN). These two stocks could be highly rewarding because Wall Street analysts expect them to more than double in price the near term. Read on.This year has seen a surge in investor interest in non-fungible tokens (NFT), with many spending large sums of money on artwork and other digital collectibles. NFTs are a form of digital asset used to demonstrate ownership of a one-of-a-kind virtual object, such as online pictures and videos or even sports trading cards. The phenomenon exploded when digital designer Beeple’s digital collage was sold for a record $69 million by Christie’s in March.
According to blockchain sales tracking company DappRadar, NFT sales spiked 111.5% sequentially in the second quarter. As NFTs grow in popularity, companies exposed to NFTs are witnessing a huge surge in their share prices. And as virtual reality technology progresses, NFT enthusiasts will likely spend more time and money in virtual environments, which is expected to drive the digital collectibles craze in the foreseeable future.
As such, Wall Street analysts expect financially sound NFT stocks PLBY Group Inc. (PLBY) and Dolphin Entertainment Inc. (DLPN) to generate significant momentum in the coming months. So, these two stocks could be solid picks now.

(Reuters) -Estee Lauder Cos Inc forecast fiscal 2022 sales largely above estimates on Thursday, boosted by a rebound in demand for makeup products at its brick-and-mortar stores as people start venturing out following the easing of COVID-19 curbs.
Shares of the cosmetics maker rose 2.5%, as sales in its makeup division climbed for the first time in more than a year, surging 76% in the fourth quarter.
Sales of the M.A.C brand owner's foundations and lipsticks rebounded after a year of pandemic-induced lockdowns, which have now eased with people returning to offices and stepping out for events.
""Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines,"" Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said on an earnings call.
The company, however, maintained a cautious stance at a time when U.S. cities are reintroducing mask mandates due to COVID-19 resurgence worldwide.
""It will be a bit choppy for makeup. We've planned for that, but we do believe that we'll see a progressive improvement in the makeup category throughout the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis told Reuters.
Estee still projected its net sales to increase between 13% and 16% in fiscal 2022, versus Refinitiv IBES estimates of 14% growth. It also forecast adjusted earnings between $7.23 and $7.38 per share, above estimates of $7.14.

Sales in duty-free shops are also expected to benefit from an increase in international travel, while Estee's presence in the recently opened Sephora sections in Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) stores as well as Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) shops inside  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stores would also boost the topline.
Net sales in the reported quarter rose 62% to $3.94 billion, beating market estimates of $3.75 billion. Excluding items, it earned 78 cents per share, above estimates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday proposed $531,545 in civil penalties against 34 airline passengers over unruly behavior - with some facing $9,000 fines for defying mask requirements - pushing its total for the year past $1 million.
The United States has seen a significant jump in reported cases of passengers causing disturbances on airplanes, including ignoring a federal mandate to wear face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous videos of confrontations have drawn attention on social media.
The FAA, which regulates U.S. civil aviation, since Jan. 1 has received 3,889 reports of unruly passengers, including 2,867 reports of people refusing to comply with the mask mandate. In total, the agency has proposed more than $1 million in fines this year for unruly passengers.
The agency has initiated three times as many such enforcement cases in the first seven months of 2021 compared to all of 2020. The FAA said some passengers were hit with $9,000 fines for not wearing masks, while other maskless people faced higher penalties for engaging in additional onboard bad behavior.
The Transportation Security Administration on Tuesday said it would extend existing mask requirements for airports, airplanes, trains and transit hubs through Jan. 18.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson this month asked U.S. airports to assist in the effort to crack down on disruptive air passengers https://www.reuters.com/world/us/faa-urges-airports-assist-unruly-air-passenger-crackdown-2021-08-05. Dickson in March extended indefinitely a ""zero tolerance policy"" on unruly air passengers. Dickson noted that alcohol often contributes to unsafe behavior and urged airports to prevent passengers from taking alcoholic drinks on planes.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) confirmed on Thursday it would extend a ban on main cabin alcohol sales through Jan. 18.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. carriers, said it appreciates ""the FAA's continued support and enforcement of the 'zero tolerance' policy for travelers who do not follow crewmember instructions and who do not abide by federal law.""
Among new FAA fines announced Thursday:
* $45,000 against a JetBlue passenger flying from New York to Florida in May for throwing objects ""including his carry-on luggage at other passengers; refusing to stay seated; lying on the floor in the aisle, refusing to get up, and then grabbing a flight attendant by the ankles and putting his head up her skirt."" The passenger was placed in handcuffs and the flight made an emergency landing in Virginia.

* $42,000 against a JetBlue passenger on a May flight from New York to San Francisco for failing to comply with the face mask mandate and other misbehavior including ""making stabbing gestures towards certain passengers; and snorting what appeared to be cocaine from a plastic bag, which the cabin crew confiscated."" The flight diverted to Minneapolis, where police removed the passenger.
* $30,000 against a Frontier Airlines passenger on a January flight from Atlanta to New York who during deplaning ""attempted to gain entry to the flight deck by physically assaulting two flight attendants, threatening to kill one of them, and demanding them to open the door.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A trio of Democratic U.S. senators has asked the Taiwanese government for more help in addressing a chip shortage that has left numerous American auto production lines at times standing idle.
The letter, dated Aug. 18 and first reported by Reuters, was sent by Michigan Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow and Ohio's Sherrod Brown to Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, praising her ""efforts to address the shortage.""
But the senators added they were ""hopeful you will continue to work with your government and (chip) foundries to do everything possible to mitigate the risk confronting our state economies."" The three emphasized in a statement that additional steps could be taken to increase chip production.
The shortage has spurred production cuts and layoffs and rippled through the economies of states that are heavily dependent on the auto industry.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said Thursday it would slash global production for September by 40% from its previous plan, becoming the latest major automaker to cut output due to the global chip crunch.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry told Reuters it was aware of the letter and had passed on the request to government departments in charge of trade and economics.
Taiwan and the United States ""have been closely coordinating and communicating on supply chain issues"", the ministry added. ""We believe that Taiwan and the United States can jointly establish a safe and reliable supply chain for key industries.""
Taiwan's Economy Ministry said it was not able to immediately comment.
FEWER VEHICLES 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday said it would halt output for a week starting Monday at production lines that build its best-selling F-150 pickup trucks because of the shortage.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) suspended production for a week at three North American truck plants earlier this month because of the same issue.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co earlier this month halted output for two weeks at a major Tennessee plant due to the impact of COVID-19 in Malaysia and chip issues.
An auto trade group has estimated that because of the chip shortage, there could be 1.3 million fewer vehicles made in the United States in 2021, a drop of more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels.
The senators told Hsiao ""what we are hearing at this point is that the risk of shortages clearly has extended into 2022, despite the considerable efforts in Taiwan to augment production.""
Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, said the shortage will gradually tail off for its customers from this quarter, but it expects overall semiconductor capacity tightness to extend possibly into 2022.
TSMC declined to comment on the letter.
""Demand for vehicles - from cars to commercial trucks - is now up, yet the lack of semiconductor chips is preventing this renewed demand from being met,"" the senators wrote. ""The U.S. is now the most impacted region in the world."" 
The senators offered Taiwan help in addressing pandemic-linked issues.

In June, the United States sent Taiwan 2.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, more than three times the initial allocation of shots for the island.
The senators said they backed ""President (Joe) Biden's efforts to make excess vaccines available to Taiwan.""

Some of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s first department stores are expected to open in Ohio and California, the report said, adding that the shops will be about 30,000 square feet in size and offer products from well-known consumer brands.
Amazon declined to comment on the report.
Sales at large department stores, which were shopping havens until the entry of online players especially Amazon, have since taken a beating, even leading to the bankruptcy of once popular retail chains such as Sears, Neiman Marcus, and J.C. Penney.
Amazon, which dominates the online shopping space, had made its biggest bet in the brick-and-mortar format with its acquisition of upscale grocer Whole Foods in 2017.
Amazon also experimented https://www.amazon.com/find-your-store/b/?node=17608448011 with small physical stores for books and groceries in at least 13 U.S. states including California, Colorado, and Washington.
The e-commerce giant has benefited from a surge in online purchases from homebound shoppers as COVID-19 forced millions to stay indoors over the past year. Traditional retailers also saw online sales surge, though total sales fell as they were forced to shut stores, which make up the bulk of their revenue.

Steady vaccine rollouts are now encouraging more Americans to return to brick-and-mortar stores to buy clothes, footwear, and electronics.
Department store chains Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter sales, and also raised their forecasts on full-year revenue and profit on Thursday as buyers came back to stores and spent on perfumes, shoes, and apparel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just three percent of the nation's small businesses would see a tax increase under U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to tax the nation's highest earners to help fund a $3.5 trillion spending bill, a new U.S. Treasury analysis shows.
The Biden administration is expected to tout the findings of the report in a virtual meeting on Thursday with a Pennsylvania small business. Democrats in Washington hope to overcome intra-party squabbles to pass the president's signature spending plans, aimed at climate initiatives and expanding the social safety net.
The White House has sought to harness the political popularity of the nation's some 30 million small businesses and their agitation over the current corporate tax structure, which small businesses view as generous to larger, billion-dollar corporations like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) over Main Street establishments.
Biden's $3.5 trillion spending plan would fund climate initiatives, paid leave, child care, education and health care by, among other things, raising the top marginal individual income tax rate to 39.6 percent.
That rate would affect single individuals with taxable income of more than $452,700 and married couples filing jointly with income over $509,300, according to White House figures. 
The Treasury analysis, which focused exclusively on small businesses filing as S-corporations, partnership and individual income tax returns, found that less than 3% of small business owners fall in the top tax bracket.
Most small businesses are pass-through businesses like limited-liability organizations and S-corporations that do not pay a corporate tax. Instead, the owners report business income and pay the tax on their personal tax returns. 
In 2018, married couples making about $150,000 working at their own small business paid over 20 percent of their income in federal income and self-employment taxes. By contrast, U.S. multinational corporations paid less than 10 percent in corporate income taxes on U.S. profits, the Treasury analysis found. 

The Treasury analysis did not look at how Biden's plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% would impact small business owners who file as C-Corps and are subject to the corporate tax. Only a small percentage of small businesses file as C-Corps.
Deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo will hold a virtual meeting with the president of a Pennsylvania glass company

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>","Chinese regulators summon Evergrande execs, warn on debt risks","SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's central bank said it summoned executives of the country's most indebted property developer, China Evergrande Group, to talks on Thursday and issued a rare warning that the company needs to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability.
The unusual summons comes amid fragile confidence in China's credit markets and concern that any financial crisis at Evergrande could pose a systemic risk as the company struggles to find the cash it needs to pay its lenders.
It also comes days after President Xi Jinping highlighted efforts to forestall major financial risks and as a flurry of regulatory crackdowns roil China's equity markets.
Evergrande had no immediate response, although it has been pursing asset sales, with Reuters reporting https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-evergrande-talks-with-xiaomi-consortium-sell-ev-unit-stake-2021-08-19 on Thursday of efforts to offload part of its electric vehicle business.
""The meeting shows Evergrande poses systemic risks. Its massive debt threatens financial stability,"" said Rocky Fan, economist at Sealand Securities.
""On the other hand, it shows Evergrande has the means to solve its problem, and regulators are pressing it to do more,"" he added.
The move did not appear to flag a bailout of the kind announced hours earlier by another troubled borrower, China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd.
Evergrande must ""actively diffuse debt risk and maintain real estate and financial markets stability,"" said the People's Bank of China and China's banking regulator, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, in a joint statement.
""Evergrande, as a top real estate company, must earnestly implement strategic arrangements made by the central government to ensure the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, and strive to keep operations stable,"" they said.
DEBTS PILE UP
Evergrande has more than 240 billion yuan ($37 billion) of bills and trade payables from contractors to settle over the next 12 months, according to ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
Concern over the developer's financial health intensified in June when it failed to pay some commercial paper on time.
Its bonds carry junk ratings from S&P, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, all of whom recently issued downgrades, and its troubles have sent jitters through China's entire junk-debt market at a time when corporate credit is rallying in the rest of the world.
The regulators' statement said senior Evergrande executives were summoned for talks and urged the company to abide by disclosure rules and clarify market rumours promptly.
Such summons' are unusual, though were recently issued to Ant Financial both before and after its ultimately scuppered stock market listing in November.
At least one bond investor said the move could mean Evergrande is on the verge of a default that would reverberate through the banking system.
""This is what worries regulators the most,"" said the fund manager, who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

The regulators' statement was published after market hours. Evergrande stocks and bonds have been heavily sold for months amid fears it may not be able to meet repayments, with its share price hitting an almost five-year low in Hong Kong on Thursday.

(Reuters) -European shares tumbled to their biggest daily loss in a month on Thursday as a slump in commodity prices dragged down mining stocks, while luxury stocks were hit by a Chinese wealth redistribution push. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 1.6% at a two-week low, with mining stocks sliding 4.2% in their biggest one-day decline since March. [MET/L]
Luxury stocks with a large exposure to China's economy such as LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Richemont dropped between 5.8% and 9.2% on Beijing's plans to target excessive corporate profits and wealth inequalities. 
""The increasing determination on the part of China to pour sand in the wheels of its own recovery story with a crackdown on various sectors, including tech and luxury, also appears to be weighing on sentiment, as well as on demand for raw materials,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Stocks around the globe fell earlier in the day, as minutes published Wednesday from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting gave the impression of a looming cut in its massive, pandemic-era bond-buying programme. [MKTS/GLOB] 
Although the European Central Bank has held steady, rising inflation has prompted some policymakers to say it must begin to rein-in its easy money policies that have been instrumental in lifting the STOXX 600 to record highs.
Focus will turn to the high-profile annual U.S. Jackson Hole conference of central bankers in late August, where Fed Chair Jerome Powell could signal he is ready to start easing monetary support.
ECB President Christine Lagarde will not attend the conference, an ECB spokesperson said this week.
Banking stocks including Asia-focused HSBC, as well as Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) fell about 3% each. 
The travel and leisure index declined 2.5% as a surge in cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus added to concerns of slowing global growth and took the shine off a solid second-quarter corporate earnings season.
With the European earnings season nearly at the halfway mark, profit for STOXX 600 companies is expected to have surged 150% in the second quarter, the best since Refinitiv IBES records began in 2012.
Among individual stocks, Swedish heating technology specialist Nibe Industrier jumped 10.1% after posting a 64% jump in first-half profit.

Swiss building materials supplier Geberit, on the other hand, fell 1.7% as it warned about rising raw materials prices.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",COVID-fuelled semiconductor crunch chips away at carmakers,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) - In grim warnings this week, major carmakers including Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) offered fresh evidence that the auto industry remains firmly in the grip of an ongoing semiconductor chip shortage that shows no sign of abating.
After being forced to close plants last year as the pandemic took hold, carmakers are now facing stiff competition from the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries amid global supply chain disruption.
The latest snarl up comes as COVID-19 cases surge in Asian countries home to auto factories and chip plants such as Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, leading to stricter curbs to prevent the spread of the virus.
Japan's Toyota, thanks to a policy of stockpiling chips that dates back a decade to the 2011 earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster, had largely managed to avoid production cuts.
But the world's largest automaker by sales volumes said on Thursday it will slash global production for September by 40% from its previous plan, affecting 14 plants in Japan and elsewhere, including most of its North American factories.
Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking. 
Germany's Volkswagen also said on Thursday that it couldn't rule out further changes to production.
""We currently expect supply of chips in the third quarter to be very volatile and tight,"" the No.2 volume carmaker behind Toyota told Reuters.
World No. 4 Stellantis joined the chorus, saying it would halt production at a plant in western France next week and cut output at another factory in the eastern part of the country.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co had already said earlier this week that it will temporarily halt building its best-selling, profit-driving F-150 pickup truck at its Kansas City assembly plant, while China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd warned the recent worsening of the chip shortage and resurgence of COVID-19 cases could pose a ""significant threat"" to its sales performance over the next few months.
Although Volkswagen said it expected the situation to improve by the end of the year, some carmakers have warned the chip crisis will drag on into 2022 with earlier industry hopes of a quick resolution long since dashed.
As numerous American auto production lines stand idle, at least part of the time, a trio of Democratic senators asked the Taiwanese government for more help to address the chip shortage, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. 

But even when one kink in the supply chain gets straightened out, others appear, making it difficult to ensure a consistent flow of chips and leaving damage-limitation focused automakers pushing available components to their more profitable models. 
""The situation does remain fluid,"" General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra said on a conference call on August 4, noting the impact of events such as the current COVID-19 spike in Malaysia.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 11:41AM ET</span>","Huawei CFO's U.S. extradition hearings in Canada end, date for ruling coming Oct. 21","By Moira Warburton
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canadian prosecutors said the defense of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou failed on facts and law, as hearings in their bid to extradite her to the United States finished on Wednesday.
The Chinese tech-giant executive will now await the judge's ruling in her case, the date for which will be set on Oct. 21.
Meng Wanzhou, 49, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States, charging her with fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
She has claimed innocence and is fighting the extradition, confined to Vancouver and monitored 24/7 by private security that she pays for as part of her bail agreement.
The defense fails ""on the facts and they fail on the law. You should have no difficulty finding dishonesty sufficient to make ... a case for fraud,"" Canadian government prosecutor Robert Frater told the court.
""No one has received a fairer extradition hearing in this country than Ms. Meng,"" he added.
Her lawyers have argued that her extradition should be stayed because the United States misled Canada when it summarized the evidence against Meng, that former President Donald Trump's comments on her case poisoned any trial she might face, and that no real fraud took place, among other reasons.
Canadian prosecutors have maintained that the United States has a valid case against Meng and emphasized that the bar for extradition is low.

Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in British Columbia's Supreme Court must decide based on whether the evidence would allow Meng's trial to proceed in Canada. 
If Holmes rules in favor of extradition, the final decision will then be made by Canada's justice minister. Both decisions can be appealed by Meng's legal team, which observers of the case have said means it could drag on for years.

Thus, we think under-the-radar restaurant stocks Bloomin’ Brands (BLMN), Denny’s (DENN), Nathan’s Famous (NATH), and Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) could be ideal bets now because they are poised to capitalize on current industry growth. So let's take a closer look at these names.Although a spike in COVID-19 cases has raised concerns about the restaurant industry’s prospects, it is highly unlikely that the sector will witness the same scenario it faced last year. That’s because government agencies this time are striving to curb the rapid spread of the new coronavirus strain by recommending booster shots and imposing new-normal restrictions. Furthermore, according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, the total sales of eating and drinking places for July stood at $72.2 billion, which is 9.1% above February 2020 (pre-pandemic) sales volume.
Because consumer demand has heightened the industry's need for workers, the restaurant industry added a net 253,200 jobs in July and 1.3 million jobs in total in the past seven months. The industry’s growth will likely continue in the coming months on the back of strong discretionary spending and pent-up demand for socializing and out-of-home experiences.
Therefore, we think under-the-radar restaurant stocks Bloomin’ Brands Inc. (BLMN), Denny’s Corporation (DENN), Nathan’s Famous Inc. (NATH), and Potbelly Corporation (PBPB) could be great investment bets now because they are fundamentally well-positioned to cash in on the industry’s growth.

(Reuters) -U.S. department store chains Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) are leaning on a strong back-to-school season to sustain a sales recovery fueled by shoppers splurging on perfumes, shoes and dresses.
Shares of the companies rose on Thursday following the increased annual sales forecasts, with Macy's up 17% on its decision to restart paying dividends paused last year due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Kohl's stock rose 8%.
The back-to-school shopping season, which runs from mid-July through early-September and is the second most important time of the year for department stores, is expected to be a big boost to Macy's following a year when students were more mostly confined to home computer screens.
""As kids go back to school, we're getting people shopping for categories that weren't strong last year - apparel, footwear, backpacks. That is incredibly important for department stores that were hit last year,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. 
Industry estimates expect total back-to-school spending on items to cross $100 billion this year, with stimulus checks and advance child tax credits expected to buoy sales.
Sales surged 59% at Macy's and 31.4% at Kohl's in the second quarter, as social events resumed and offices gradually reopened in the United States following vaccinations. 
""We saw continued strength in dressy apparel, fine jewelry and fragrance as our customers prepared for in-person social events and back to school,"" Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gennette said in a post-earnings call. 
The company had pulled in nearly 5 million new customers in the second quarter, he added.
Eyeing the shift to retail stores, Macy's also announced plans to launch Toys ""R"" Us shop-in-shops in 400 of its outlets from next year. 
Both Macy's and Kohl's said they were expediting supplies faster than planned, in a nod to concerns among shoppers of sparsely stocked store shelves during this year's holiday season. 

Macy's said it expects full-year net sales of $23.55 billion to $23.95 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $21.73 billion to $22.23 billion. 
Kohl's expects full-year net sales to increase in a low-twenties percentage, against a previous estimates of mid-to-high teens percentage rise.

Average adjusted profit across Canada's six biggest banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) - is expected to fall about 5% in the three months through July from the second quarter, but rise about 40% from a year earlier. 
Canadian banks have beaten analysts' estimates in recent quarters, thanks to strong deal flows and asset management fees, and the clawback of some of the capital set aside last year to cover a potential spike in loan losses, even as commercial and credit card lending remained weak and deposits surged.
""With economic activity continuing to normalize with reopenings, we expect to see better loan growth,"" said Sun Life Global Investments Portfolio Manager Chhad Aul. ""Net interest margins will be another key contributor; with that big surge in longer-term yields, we finally (had) a steeper yield curve."" 
This benefits banks by allowing them to borrow at low interest rates and lend at higher ones. 
Analysts at Canaccord Genuity and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) expect pullbacks in capital markets businesses from the prior quarter. 
Data from Canada's biggest exchange operator showing declines in financing indicates more subdued earnings from investment banking, but higher merger and acquisition deal volumes and debt issuances could help mitigate that, said Anthony Visano, portfolio manager at Kingwest & Company.
Top of investors' minds is banks' plans for their excess capital, built up following a March 2020 moratorium on dividend increases and share buybacks, which is expected to be lifted this year.
Even after the regulator raised the capital buffer banks must hold to guard against risks in June, the biggest banks had about C$51 billion ($40.41 billion)of excess capital.
""The biggest thing I would want to know as an investor is... about dividend increases and share buybacks,"" said Chris Blumas, portfolio manager at Raymond James Investment Counsel. ""Any type of guidance on updated payout ratios... any type of colour on what the capital priorities are long term would be helpful."" 
The Canadian banks index has risen 25% this year, compared with a 16% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark. They are trading at about 11 times forward earnings, slightly above their historical average, versus 11.7 times for the biggest U.S. banks. 
The banks could again release some PCLs, Credit Suisse analyst Mike Rizvanovic said in a note on Wednesday, estimating provisions of C$1.3 billion, a fifth of what they set aside a year earlier. Recoveries on performing-loan PCLs will more than offset an expected increase in provisions for impaired loans, he added. 

However, with COVID-19 cases once again inching higher, recoveries may be slow to materialize this quarter, Visano said. 
BMO and Bank of Nova Scotia will kick off earnings reporting on Tuesday, and they will be followed by RBC and National Bank on Wednesday, and CIBC and TD on Thursday.

Investing.com – Kohl's stock (NYSE:KSS) rose nearly 8% Thursday as the retailer revised its guidance and expanded its share repurchase program.
Net sales are now expected to increase in the low-20s percentage range compared to the previous expectation of mid-to-high teens percentage range.
Adjusted earnings per share is now seen between $5.80 and $6.10, compared to the previous expectation of $3.80 to $4.20.
Kohl’s said it will buy back shares worth $500 million to $700 million, higher than the $200 million to $300 million amount it previously planned to buy.
The company kept a tight leash on its operating expenses during the second quarter and as a result, their share, as a percentage of total revenue, fell 290 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage.
Kohl’s cut spending on technology, tightly managed inventories, raised prices and got more bang for its buck from spending on promotions to improve its margins.
The company expanded its portfolio of digital brands that drove an increase in online sales.
Total revenue in the second quarter was 30% higher at $4.44 billion. As sales rose and expenses remained in control, the company returned to profits which came in at $382 million compared to a loss of $39 million on adjusted basis.
Adjusted profit per share on diluted basis was $2.48 and easily surpassed the analysts’ estimate of $1.17."

Moreover, the stock of the San Francisco concern has gained 38.3% over the past three months to close yesterday’s trading session at $191.63 due to investor optimism surrounding the company’s market expansion and strategic developments.

The company expects nights and experiences booked in the current quarter to slow from the second quarter and remain below 2019 levels. 
""As we exit the second quarter and come into the third, we have a combination of fewer bookings for the fall, just given the nature of some of the seasonality and any kind of impact potentially on COVID concerns,"" Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson said on a post-earnings call with investors.
The hugely popular global app, which has fought back strongly since being hit hard early in the pandemic last year, posted a more than four-fold rise in bookings to $13.4 billion in the second quarter.
It expects the third quarter to be its strongest on record as more people check into its vacation rentals after the easing of COVID-19 curbs in most major economies.
Active listings have been roughly stable throughout the health crisis and grew during the quarter, especially in non-urban destinations across Europe and North America, the company said.
""In popular leisure markets you're seeing platforms offer increasingly generous incentives to hosts to secure quality inventory in order to meet demand,"" wrote Dan Thomas, analyst at Third Bridge. 
Hotels and other accommodation providers took a hammering last year as COVID-19 travel restrictions shut down large parts of their business. 

Airbnb drew plaudits, however, for shifting its focus quickly to local and long-term rentals, attracting people looking for accommodations to rent for remote working or which did not require flying.
The company expects to report record third-quarter adjusted income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and margin.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 10:16AM ET</span>",Musk's 'AI Day' confronts tough questions about Tesla's technology,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - At Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s ""Autonomy Day"" event in April 2019, Chief Executive Elon Musk said that by mid-2020 Tesla would have over a million self-driving vehicles where riders ""could go to sleep"" during a trip.
Tesla has not achieved that goal and on Thursday Musk is staging another event, called ""AI Day,"" to promote his electric car company as the place to work for the engineers he needs to make good on his promises for autonomous vehicles.
Musk has walked back some of his claims for Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) system in recent months, saying Tesla cars are ""not fully-self driving yet."" 
U.S. safety regulators earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla's driver assistant system because of accidents where Tesla cars crashed into stationary police cars and fire trucks. Two U.S. senators also called on the Fair Trade Commission to investigate Tesla's claims of ""Full Self-Driving"" and ""Autopilot.""
""Expectations have been significantly reduced from investors ... Tesla has got some harder questions to answer, what's going on with the safety probe? And how they market FSD?"" asked Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures.
""I think the substance of the event is going to be lost with investors because it's just a geek fest.""
Shares of the electric carmaker fell nearly 2% to $675.99 in morning trading on Thursday. 
CONFLICTING VIEWS OF AI
In its invitation, Tesla said participants in the event at 5 p.m. Palo Alto, California, time will ""get an inside-look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet."" Musk said the event will be livestreamed.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it expected Tesla to discuss AI applications for solar/storage software and advanced manufacturing in its factories. 
Musk has expressed complicated and contradictory views of artificial intelligence. He has touted Tesla's AI as industry leading, but also said artificial intelligence could destroy humanity and pose bigger risks than nuclear-armed North Korea. 
During 2017 and 2018, Tesla struggled to increase production of the Model 3 sedan in part because an ambitious factory automation project hit snags.
“Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,” Musk tweeted in 2018. “To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.” 
DOJO
Musk is expected to reveal more about Tesla's ""Dojo"" computing system on Thursday, which he has said would process vast amounts of video data it obtain from Tesla vehicles on the road.
Musk said Dojo will have Tesla's own chips and architecture. 
“AI Day is really a recruiting day for Tesla. It’s not a marketing event for a vehicle,” said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment fund Gerber Kawasaki which owns Tesla shares. 
    Tesla is competing with other technology companies, especially Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for engineers skilled in artificial intelligence systems, Gerber said.

Musk has a history of promoting technology at showy events, then pushing back the launch dates. 
Last September, Musk announced an ambitious plan to produce its own battery cells which would enable Tesla to offer a $25,000 car in three years. But Musk subsequently canceled the longest-range Model S Plaid+, which he had said would use the cells.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell sharply again at the open on Thursday, extending the losses made on Wednesday on fears that the Federal Reserve will start to reduce its monetary stimulus within a matter of weeks. 
Expectations of a 'tapering' of bond purchases were strengthened by another post-pandemic low in weekly initial jobless claims. Initial claims fell to 348,000, a sharper drop than expected and further evidence to suggest progress in the labor market's recovery. The numbers indicated that the surge in Delta-variant Covid-19 cases across the U.S. hasn't yet led to an increase in layoffs, despite signs of weakness in the travel sector in particular.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 164 points, or 0.5%, at 34,797 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6%.
Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock was one of the heaviest fallers in early trading, losing 8.2% after its quarterly results as a public company showed a wider-than-expected loss and also contained a warning of a likely slowdown in revenue growth after a buoyant quarter. 
Department store stocks were in vogue, with Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock rising 12% and Kohls (NYSE:KSS) stock rising 5.8% after quarterly results that testified to pentup demand returning to physical stores. Also supporting sentiment toward the sector was a Wall Street Journal report that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has done more than anyone to destroy the department store business model, is now thinking about establishing something similar to department stores itself. The report appears to bolster the argument for physical presence on Main Street. Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) stock rose 2.1% after the cosmetic group, too, cashed in on the reopening trends of the second quarter.
 Toyota  and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) ADRs both fell after they warned of further disruption to production in the coming weeks as a result of chip shortages and Covid-19 lockdowns at various plants. Toyota (NYSE:TM) ADRs fell 2.9%, while Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) fell 1.6%. Chipmakers outperformed broadly after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) said late on Wednesday it expected to raise prices for its gaming chips due to sustained high demand.
Elsewhere, mining stocks tumbled as Fed fears combined with further signs of Chinese action to reduce pollution from its heavy industry. Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) stock fell 4.8% as copper and gold both came under pressure, while Vale (NYSE:VALE) ADRs fell 5.2% as Beijing imposed stricter curbs on pollution from the steel industry. Steel prices have been weakening for some weeks now amid disruption to the Chinese economy from floods and Covid-19 lockdowns. Iron ore prices fell another 12% in Singapore overnight. 
The weakness in base metals was also reflected in oil prices, which were likewise hit by the prospect of higher dollar and a slower global recovery.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.5% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 3.0%.

(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) on Thursday gave new details of its turnaround strategy to source subcomponents of its chips from external factories, including new specifics of partnerships with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC).
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor firms that still designs and manufactures its own chips. But it lost its lead in making the fastest chips to TSMC, which focuses on manufacturing designs from outside firms, after missteps in its manufacturing operations.
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger earlier this year outlined the company's strategy https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26 to regain its footing in manufacturing by 2025. But in the meantime, Intel is trying to prevent further erosion of its chip market share by rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, who have faster offerings.
Part of Intel's answer involves tapping rivals like TSMC for subcomponents of chips called ""tiles"" and stitching those together in Intel's own factories with packaging technology. Intel on Thursday said its new ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip will use key tiles made with TMSC's ""N5"" and ""N7"" chipmaking technologies, placed on top of an Intel-made base.
The ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip's first major use will be in a supercomputer that Intel is building for the U.S. Department of Energy. 
Raja Koduri, senior vice president of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, conceded it had been years since Intel challenged Nvidia at speeding up artificial intelligence software, a market that has powered much of the chip industry's expansion in recent years. 
Koduri said the ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip is faster than Nvidia's offerings at some of those tasks.
""For a decade, we let them just have free reign,"" Koduri said. ""That ends now.""

Intel earlier this week also gave a new name to its graphics chips that will challenge Nvidia's other major market of video gaming. 
Intel said Thursday its ""Alchemist"" graphics chips will be made by TSMC using the latter's newly named ""N6"" chipmaking technology, an upgraded version of its ""N7"" technology. Reuters reported in January https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intel-graphics-chip-will-tap-new-version-tsmc-7-nanometer-process-sources-2021-01-12 that Intel would use TSMC's upgraded technology.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 09:06AM ET</span>",U.S. cannabis insurers get ready to roll as federal legalization nears,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers are quietly gearing up for a potential ten-fold increase in sales to the booming $17.6 billion-a-year cannabis industry as Congress inches closer to legalizing pot at the federal level.
While 36 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, insurance for growers, testing labs and retailers is being held in check largely by strict federal laws that criminalize pot alongside heroin, methamphetamine and LSD. 
U.S. legal cannabis sales jumped 45% last year and are expected to hit $41 billion in 2026 https://tinyurl.com/3kuecpwv, Colorado-based research firm BDSA said. 
But the industry only wrote about $250 million in policies last year, insurance agents estimated for Reuters, with a handful of carriers offering limited property and liability coverage.
Businesses also need coverage for crops and theft, along with larger payout limits, according to more than a dozen insurers, brokers, agents, lawyers and cannabis business owners interviewed by Reuters.
'OVERWHELMING NEED'
As Congress considers bills that would loosen federal laws, some insurers are trying to fill the gap with new types of coverage. Because insurers are regulated at the state level, they can now offer coverage in states where the drug is legal, and federal decriminalization would expand the market. 
""There is an overwhelming need for the right kinds of insurance,"" said Rocco Petrilli, chairman of the National Cannabis Risk Management Association (NCRMA), a trade group of 3,000 cannabis businesses.
NCRMA in April set up a captive insurer to offer coverage for property, general premises liability and product liability to members. It plans to add workers' compensation and auto coverage in the fourth quarter, Petrilli said. The captive approach provides coverage only to NCRMA members that is tailored to their needs.
CannGen Insurance Services, a national managing general underwriter of cannabis, CBD and hemp risks that works with commercial carriers, plans to introduce Directors & Officers (D&O) and employment practice liability cover soon, through a new division called CannGenPRO, said Charles Pyfrom, chief marketing officer. CannGen distributes via appointed retail and wholesale brokers to provide ""one-stop-shopping.""
Some large insurers, such as Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) Farmers Insurance, Liberty Mutual and AXA SA (PA:AXAF), are offering coverage as more states legalize pot. They often sell via subsidiaries and work with CannGen or others, state licensing records show.
Progressive said its vehicle policies cover liability and physical damage in states that have legalized transport of cannabis, but it does not insure cargos. The other companies declined to comment. 
New policies cannot come soon enough for cannabis business owners, who say coverage is often hard to find and expensive. Cannabis dispensary owners told Reuters, for example, that their premiums are 20% to 30% higher than an ordinary retailer would pay. Some types of vehicle coverage can cost four or five times more, they said. 
D&O insurance, which is crucial for attracting seasoned business leaders and raising capital, is also expensive, said Gavin Kogan, CEO of Grupo Flor, which is a licensed cultivator, distributor and manufacturer with five dispensaries in California. He said he pays $85,000 to $100,000 annually for $1 million of D&O protection, ""and the coverage is super limited.""
A lack of insurance can also create operational challenges and raise costs. Low coverage limits on cargo insurance, for example, can force companies to split shipments up, said Gene Brown, an insurance agent in Carmel, California, who specializes in cannabis coverage. 
""You have big fleets delivering large amounts of cannabis or transporting large amounts of money,"" he said. They need $1 million coverage but ""you can only get $500,000 right now.""
LEGALIZATION PUSH
As more states legalize cannabis, U.S. lawmakers are under growing pressure to follow. Last month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer threw his weight behind the movement, unveiling an ambitious draft bill to legalize cannabis.
In April, the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal. 
Schumer's measure is unlikely to become law in its current form, given Democrats' narrow majority in the Senate and its broad scope, said Ian Stewart, partner and co-chair of the cannabis practice at law firm Wilson Elser. 
Still, analysts and insurance executives say such bills show Congress is slowly heading toward looser cannabis laws.

BDSA expects some form of federal legalization in 2022, and Petrilli, of NCRMA, said that could send insurance sales to cannabis businesses to more than $3 billion over the next five years, if the industry were insured like normal businesses.
""Whoever leads on providing reasonably priced insurance for this industry with the necessary coverage is going to be very, very successful,"" said Kogan.

(Reuters) - U.S. states are racing to meet a deadline to commit to a $26 billion opioid settlement with three drug distributors and the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as some grapple with local resistance and concerns the amount isn't big enough to address the damage done by an epidemic of addiction.
Fourteen state attorneys general unveiled the proposed settlement https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/drug-distributors-jj-reach-landmark-26-bln-opioid-settlement-2021-07-21 with McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and J&J on July 21, kicking off a months-long process for states, counties and cities to sign on.
By Saturday, states must decide whether to join settlements that call for the distributors to pay $21 billion and J&J to pay $5 billion, money meant to help fund treatment and other services. The epidemic of opioid abuse has resulted in nearly 500,000 overdose deaths since 1999, according to the U.S. government.
The settlement's complex formula envisions at least 44 states participating, but ultimately the companies decide whether a ""critical mass"" have joined and whether to finalize the deal.
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead negotiator, last month said he expected ""well north"" of 40 states to join. But several are against it, including Washington and New Mexico and communities in West Virginia holding out in hopes of recouping more.
Michigan, South Carolina and Nevada say they are still evaluating the deal. Ohio, which was slated to take the distributors to trial next month, is nearing a separate, related $808 million deal with them.
In hard-hit New Hampshire, Associate Attorney General James Boffetti said he recently told a judge the state was unlikely to join the deal with J&J, which the state plans to take to trial next year.
""That settlement is small in comparison to the harm that they caused in New Hampshire and other places,"" he said. ""It's just not sufficient.""
The settlement aims to resolve more than 3,000 lawsuits accusing the distributors of ignoring red flags that pain pills were being diverted into communities for illicit uses and that J&J played down the risks of opioid addiction.
The companies deny wrongdoing, saying the drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with others, including doctors and regulators.
The participation of states is tied closely to that of their local governments, who brought the majority of lawsuits.
Ultimately, $10.7 billion is tied to the extent localities participate.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Aug. 5 announced the state would join the distributors' settlement, but in a twist said the state was ""still evaluating"" J&J's piece.
Some local Texas governments have opposed the deal, and a January trial date is set in a lawsuit by the populous city of Dallas, which has sued the distributors, J&J and others for $10.5 billion.
Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the city, said he was in discussions with J&J and was ""hopeful we can find a resolution."" But he said Dallas' case against the distributors would move forward. 

Paul Geller, a lead negotiator for the plaintiffs with Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, called on elected officials to unify for the ""greater good.""
""The only way this deal works, and we've known this from the beginning, is if leaders embrace a level of responsibility that extends beyond local borders,"" Geller said.

The manufacturer will suspend production at all of its 14 Japanese assembly plants for various lengths of time through next month. The impact of these cuts will be harshest in September, with Toyota slashing its production plan by 40%, though risks will carry forward beyond next month.
It’s the latest sign even the best supply-chain planning is proving no match for a pandemic that virtually ground the auto industry to a halt a year ago and has plagued efforts to restore production. Toyota and BMW AG -- two manufacturers least scathed by the semiconductor shortage in the first half -- have now warned of significant blows to their operations in the coming months.
“This isn’t a Toyota-only problem,” said Tetsuo Seshimo, a fund manager at Saison Asset Management Co. “But the fact that this is happening at Toyota means that recent worries about the supply chain in Asia being disrupted by the spread of the coronavirus are materializing. There are a lot of companies manufacturing goods in Asia that could be impacted.”
Toyota said 27 assembly lines in Japan will be impacted, affecting production of models including the RAV4, Corolla, Prius, Camry and Lexus RX. The news -- first reported by the Nikkei -- took the market by surprise, with investors sending Toyota shares down 4.4%, their biggest daily drop since December 2018.
“Especially in Southeast Asia, the spread of Covid and lockdowns are impacting our local suppliers,” Kazunari Kumakura, the chief officer of Toyota’s purchasing group, said Thursday. Going forward, the company will look at ways to further diversify its supply chains to not focus on one region and is attempting to find replacement parts from suppliers in other regions.
Production cuts had been factored into previous forecasts, so Toyota is maintaining its plan to produce 9.3 million vehicles for the fiscal year ending in March. The company maintained its annual operating profit projection earlier this month at 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion) for the fiscal year through March, below analysts’ average projection for 2.95 trillion yen.
Early on in the chip shortage that began late last year, Toyota was lauded for its supply-chain savvy. The company has an intricate system in place to monitor its vast network of suppliers and has an early-warning system for shortages.
That may be no match for a pandemic that’s confounding scientists, governments and public-health officials, sparking fresh lockdowns around the world and wreaking more havoc on a vast array of industries.
BMW recently warned of uncertain months ahead as the global chip shortage worsens. After saying early this year it had ordered enough semiconductors and expected its suppliers to deliver, the luxury-car maker now expects production restrictions in the second half.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) also has flagged worsening supply woes, while  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) dialed back its delivery expectations due to the shortage.
According to research by Susquehanna Financial Group, the amount of time it’s taking for chip-starved companies to get orders filled has stretched to more than 20 weeks, indicating the shortages that have held back automakers and computer manufacturers are getting worse.
“Companies were saying it was a problem for the first half, but it’s astonishing what kind of strong figures they reached,” said Frank Schwope, an autos analyst at NordLB in Hanover. “But now, the chip shortage is coming in dramatically, showing that there must be some serious problems.”

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>",Federal judge throws out U.S. approval of ConocoPhillips Alaska oil project,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday reversed the U.S. government's approval of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)' planned $6 billion Willow oil development in Alaska, citing problems with its environmental analysis, according to court documents.
The ruling is a fresh blow to a massive drilling project that Alaskan officials hoped would help offset oil production declines in the state.
ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss said the company would review the decision and evaluate its options for the project.
In her order, Alaska District Court Judge Sharon Gleason said she was vacating the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's approval of the development in part because the agency failed to include greenhouse gas emissions from foreign oil consumption in its environmental analysis. It also ""failed to adequately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives"" for the project, she wrote. 
Gleason also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not outline specific measures to mitigate the project's impact on polar bears.
The Interior Department, which oversees the Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service, would not comment on the ruling.
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy said the order was a blow to the his state because the project would create thousands of jobs.
""This is a horrible decision,"" he said in a statement. ""We are giving America over to our enemies piece by piece.""
Willow, planned for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, was approved by the Trump administration last year as part of its push to ratchet up fossil fuel development on federal lands. 
The decision was followed promptly by lawsuits from environmental groups, which argued in part that the government had failed to take into account the impact that drilling would have on wildlife.

Those same groups harshly criticized the administration of President Joe Biden for defending the project's approval in court, saying it was at odds with his climate change agenda.
ConocoPhillips said in June that the Willow development could begin producing oil in 2027. Willow holds about 600 million barrels of recoverable oil and could produce up to 180,000 barrels per day.

Investing.com – Robinhood stock (NASDAQ:HOOD) plunged more than 8% in Thursday’s premarket as the company behind the popular trading app warned of people going slow on trading in the ongoing quarter.
The company said many things went in its favor in the last quarter but it now expects considerably fewer new funded accounts in the ongoing quarter than in the previous three months. It thus sees lower revenue in the current quarter.
Total revenue soared 131% to $565 million in the second quarter as retail traders from the Reddit gang and everywhere else piled on the platform to trade in cryptocurrencies and equities.
At $233 million, cryptocurrencies contributed to more than half of the $451-million revenue Robinhood earned from transactions on the platform. More than 60% of Robinhood accounts traded cryptocurrencies in the second quarter, the company said.
A 169% jump in operating expenses dwarfed the jump in revenue. Along with $528 million in costs associated with the change in fair value of convertible notes and warrant liability, they dragged the company into losses which stood at $502 million.

(Reuters) -Britain's largest water company Thames Water has agreed to pay compensation totalling more than 11 million pounds ($15 million) to nearly 14,000 business customers for incorrect billing, the UK's water regulator said on Thursday.
Ofwat launched an investigation into Thames Water, which serves 15 million customers across London and the Thames Valley, after a complaint in March 2019 that raised concerns about the way the company handled data, particularly around market-oriented measures introduced in England in April 2017.
The measures meant 1.2 million businesses, charities and public sector organisations were no longer restricted to buying water services from their regional monopoly, but the regulator found errors in the way Thames Water handled its data at this time.
Ofwat said Thames had transferred inaccurate information about non-household customers into its core IT system ahead of the market opening, which resulted in customers being sent the wrong bills.
""Our investigation uncovered a multitude of errors with the way in which Thames Water handled its data before and after market opening,"" Ofwat Senior Director Emma Kelso said. 
The regulator said the errors had in particular hurt water retailers - via which Thames serves end-user business and other clients - who faced an increase in costs and in some cases even lost customers as a result of being blamed for problems.
Thames Water has proposed a series of undertakings, including strengthening its internal processes and controls over how it handles market data and complaints, Ofwat said.
The regulator added that it was planning to accept the undertakings and compensation package offered by the company, and issue a nominal penalty of one pound.
Thames Water Retail Director Warren Buckley said in an emailed statement the utility welcomed Ofwat's proposed decision and that it had made ""good progress"" to improve its controls and how it manages complaints.

""We also recognise the accuracy of some of the data we introduced into the market when it opened in 2017 could have been better, and we are working hard to rectify these issues as part of our turnaround plan,"" Buckley said.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>","Toyota slashes September output amid chip crunch, COVID resurgence","By Maki Shiraki and Ritsuko Ando
(Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp said it will slash global production for September by 40% from its previous plan, becoming the last major automaker to cut output due to a global chip crunch, but it maintained its annual sales and production targets.
Toyota's success in navigating the chip shortage better than rivals has come down to its larger stockpile of chips under a business continuity plan adopted after the 2011 earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
The world's largest automaker by sales volumes reiterated on Thursday its global production target of 9.3 million vehicles for the year ending in March, as well as its plan to sell 8.7 million cars in the period.
""The 9.3 million global production plan takes into account certain risks,"" executive Kazunari Kumakura told reporters. ""We want to achieve the numbers.""
Toyota said the September cuts included 14 factories in Japan and overseas plants, and that the company would reduce its planned global production that month by around 360,000 vehicles.
Of these, 140,000 will be at Japanese plants, with the rest in the United States, China, Europe and other Asian countries.
Car makers worldwide have been cutting production due to the months-long chip shortage, but a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia - home to auto factories and chip plants - have led to stricter curbs and compounded the crisis.
Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Thursday it may need to cut production further and that it expected the supply of chips in the third quarter to be ""very volatile and tight.""
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said Wednesday it will temporarily shut its Kansas City assembly plant that builds its best-selling F-150 pickup truck due to a semiconductor-related part shortage as a result of rising cases in Malaysia.
Earlier this month, Toyota had flagged an unpredictable business environment due to fresh COVID-19 cases in emerging economies, the semiconductor shortage and soaring material prices.
Toyota shares closed down 4.4% in their biggest daily drop since December 2018, pulling the benchmark Nikkei average to a seven-month low.
The carmaker had already halted assembly lines at some Japanese factories between late July and early August, including its Tahara plant, due to a surge in infections in Vietnam which had constrained the supply of parts, the Nikkei reported earlier.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters this month that Toyota had also suspended production at one assembly line in Guangzhou, China, which it operates with its Chinese joint-venture partner Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd.
In Thailand too, Toyota suspended production last month at three factories due to a pandemic-related parts shortage.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Thursday, continuing the previous session’s selloff after the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting pointed to an early start to the tapering of its monetary stimulus.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 285 points, or 0.8%, S&P 500 Futures traded 35 points, or 0.8%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 90 points, or 0.6%.
The major indices posted hefty losses Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 380 points, or 1.1%, the broad-based S&P 500 falling over 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ending down 0.9%.
The catalyst for these losses, which are set to continue Thursday, was the release of the minutes from the July Fed meeting on Wednesday, which showed the policymakers advanced plans to pull back the pace of their monthly asset purchases before the end of 2021 if the economy continued to improve as expected.
This meeting occurred before August’s bumper nonfarm payrolls release, and has raised expectations that Fed chair Jerome Powell will announce more details of the central bank’s tapering plan at the Jackson Hole symposium at the end of next week.
Ahead of that, the weekly initial jobless claims data are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and are expected to show a gradually improving U.S. labor market. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for August is due at the same time, and is expected to show a small improvement from July.
There are more earnings from the retail sector due Thursday, including quarterly results from department stores Kohls (NYSE:KSS) and Macy’s (NYSE:M) as well as numbers from Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), the parent of  Coach  , Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, and  BJs Wholesale Club Holdings Inc  (NYSE:BJ).
Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) will also be in the spotlight after the trading app reported a net loss of $502 million in its first earnings report as a public company, even as its revenue more than doubled in the second quarter.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will also be in focus after the chip giant beat quarterly estimates, benefiting from booming demand for chips for graphics and artificial intelligence. 
Elsewhere, oil prices fell Thursday, as a surprise increase in U.S. gasoline inventories suggested the spread of the delta coronavirus variant was weighing on fuel demand.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported late Wednesday a draw in crude oil supplies of over 3 million barrels in the week to Aug. 13, but it was the 696,000-barrel build in gasoline supplies, the first increase in more than a month, that had the biggest impact on sentiment.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.6% lower at $62.84 a barrel, falling below $65 for the first time since May, while the Brent contract fell 3.3% to $66.01.

""Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half,"" Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins told analysts, according to Reuters.

Shortage of chips and critical hardware over the last 6-12 months has increased costs for manufacturers as demand has boomed and supply chains have been constrained. While the pandemic has boosted demand for digital devices that house these components, lockdowns have forced factories to stay shut, thus hurting supplies.
Cisco’s revenue of $13.1 billion was higher by 8% year-on-year and topped the analyst estimate of $13.04 billion, thanks to high demand for its teleconferencing systems from people forced to work remotely.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs said on Thursday it will buy Dutch insurer  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Group's asset management arm for around 1.7 billion euros ($1.98 billion) in the biggest acquisition by the U.S. company since David Solomon became chief executive in 2018.
The deal is part of Solomon’s strategy to make the bank’s revenue stream less reliant on earnings from trading and advising on deals. The Wall Street firm wants to bulk up in areas like wealth management and expand its presence in regions outside the United States. 
""This acquisition allows us to accelerate our growth strategy and broaden our asset management platform,"" Solomon said in a statement.
NNIP, or NN Investment Partners, has $335 billion in assets under management, and the acquisition will double the total that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) manages in Europe to more than $600 billion.
Goldman said NNIP's 900 employees will join GS and the Netherlands will become ""a significant location"" in its European business. 
Goldman is the latest major financial firm to bulk up operations in the Netherlands in the wake of Britain's departure from the European Union, though NNIP is based in The Hague, rather than Amsterdam, the country's main financial hub. 
As part of the deal, NN Group, the Netherlands' biggest insurer, has committed to leave its $190 billion portfolio of insurance assets under NNIP management after it joins Goldman.
""The combined investment expertise and scale will enhance the service offering to NN Investment Partners’ clients, including NN Group,"" said NN CEO David Knibbe.
NN said the sale of NNIP will improve its Solvency II ratio by 17 percentage points, from 209% at the end of June, and proceeds would be used for acquisitions or additional returns to shareholders. The ratio is a measure of how much extra money it has to act as a cushion should markets fall. 
""Given the company's already strong capital position which is sufficient to fund its organic growth opportunities, and the lack of obvious M&A targets, the potential for significant excess capital returns in the coming year(s) is apparent,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in a comment on the deal. It said the the price Goldman paid was higher than the 1.5 billion euros it had expected.
Shares in NN Group fell 1.1% to 43.77 by 0844 GMT, but are up 23% in the year to date.
NNIP had also attracted interest from numerous other insurers and asset managers, Reuters reported in June, with Germany's DWS seen as a front-runner.

Second-quarter revenue from sale of gaming chips was a record $3.06 billion, up 85% from a year earlier as consumers bought more devices and spent more time playing online games.

The chipmaker estimates revenue in the ongoing quarter to come in at $6.80 billion, plus or minus 2%.
The company management also expressed confidence in securing regulatory approvals for its proposed $40 billion acquisition of rU.K.-based chip designer ARM, despite reports that it may take until the end of next year to gain clearance from Chinese antitrust authorities, and despite ongoing concern in U.K. political circles about the national security implications.

Investing.com – Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen stocks (DE:VOWG_p) dropped in Thursday trading as the world’s two biggest carmakers revealed continuing bottlenecks due to shortage of chips with the former planning a 40% cut in vehicle output.
Toyota fell 4.4% in Tokyo trading and Volkswagen was lower by 2.4% in Frankfurt on fears that shortages of chips are going to drag for some time yet.
The Japanese manufacturer will cut global production for September by 40% from its previous plan, the Nikkei reported.
Toyota was aiming to make a little under 900,000 vehicles next month, but has cut that to about 500,000, according to the business daily. It will reportedly suspend production lines at domestic factories including its Takaoka plant in Aichi Prefecture. Production in North America, China and Europe may also be scaled back by tens of thousands of units.
In China and Thailand too, Toyota’s production is being disrupted, mainly due to the spread of Covid-19 cases and the measures taken to contain them.
Volkswagen followed Toyota later in the day to warn of chip shortages hurting output.
""We currently expect supply of chips in the third quarter to be very volatile and tight,"" Volkswagen told Reuters. ""We can't rule out further changes to production.""
The shortage of chips has been hurting vehicle manufacturers for almost a year now. Automobile manufacturers have been among the worst affected by a surge in demand from rival sectors for devices like laptops, mobile and printers. 
Automakers bore the brunt of the demand-supply mismatch as supplies of chips got diverted to more urgent and affordable digital devices. That development has come at a time when the auto industry is embedding more and more chips in its cars to manage functions from emissions control to autonomous driving."

LONDON (Reuters) - Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of COVID-19 vaccine maker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), was Britain's highest paid company boss in 2020, a year when the average FTSE 100 leader saw their pay fall by almost a fifth, a report on Thursday showed.
Soriot, whose handling of the pandemic response has drawn criticism despite the company producing its vaccine at cost price, took home 15.45 million pounds ($21.25 million), a report from the High Pay Centre said.
That compares with median pay for CEOs in Britain's flagship stock index of 2.69 million pounds, down from 3.25 million pounds in 2019, the report found, but still 86 times the median earnings for the average UK worker.
Shareholders had demanded bosses share the financial pain as companies across a range of sectors experienced a tough year, with lockdowns in many countries hitting sales.
The proportion of companies paying bonuses dropped to 64% from 89% in 2019, while 77% paid out long-term incentives based on performance over the previous 3-5 years, compared to 82% the previous year.
Of the nine companies which took public money through the British government's furlough scheme, the average CEO pay was 2.2 million pounds.
""CEO pay packages are designed to reflect the experience of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders so in one sense the lower pay levels this year show the system working as intended,"" said High Pay Centre Director Luke Hildyard.
""On the other hand, these are still very generous rewards...at a time when, in general, government support for the economy has probably been more important to the survival and success of the UK's biggest companies than the decisions of their executives.""

Rounding out the top five earners were Experian (OTC:EXPGF)'s Brian Cassin, with 10.3 million pounds; CRH (NYSE:CRH)'s Albert Manifold, with 9.92 million pounds; Reckitt Benckiser's Laxman Narasimhan, with 9.24 million pounds, and Berkeley's Rob Perrins, with 8.03 million pounds, the report said.

The auto industry is facing renewed strains after a recovery in demand stretched supply chains earlier this year, with COVID-19 outbreaks in Asia hitting both chip production and operations at commercial ports.
""We currently expect supply of chips in the third quarter to be very volatile and tight,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the No.2 volume carmaker behind Toyota, said in answer to a request for comment by Reuters. ""We can't rule out further changes to production.""
The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said it expects the situation to improve by the end of the year and aims to make up for production shortfalls in the second half as far as possible.
Rival Toyota will reduce global production for September by 40% from its previous plan, the Nikkei business daily reported earlier, sending its shares 4.4% lower in Tokyo.
Shares in European carmakers and suppliers were also broadly weaker across with BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF),  Renault  (PA:RENA) , Stellantis and Volkswagen all down by more than 2%.

The latest production woes follow news that German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), the top automotive supplier, had been forced to suspend production at one of its plants in Malaysia in June due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Infineon CEO Reinhard Ploss said on Aug. 3 that the automotive industry faced ""acute supply limitations across the entire value chain"" and it would take until well into 2022 for supply and demand to be brought back into balance.

The employee-owned group, which owns the John Lewis department store chain and upmarket supermarket Waitrose, has been hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last October, partnership chairman Sharon White detailed a 1 billion pound ($1.4 billion) recovery plan which included diversifying beyond retail and seeking more partnerships. 
Seeking to take advantage of its status as one of Britain's most well known and trusted brands, John Lewis said it had teamed up with digital wealth manager Nutmeg to offer three ethical investment products - a junior ISA, a general investment account and a stocks and shares ISA. 
It already offers home insurance and retail credit.
The partnership's target is for 40% of its profits to come from outside retail by 2030.

It is also entering the property market. Last month John Lewis said it would build 10,000 rental homes in the next decade with half of them being developed on its existing estate.

AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock fell 1% after the chief executive of the drug maker, Pascal Soriot, was named Britain's highest paid company boss in 2020, despite criticism of his handling of the pandemic response. The company was the only one of the major drugmakers to agree to sell its Covid-19 vaccine at cost price, but poor communications during the drug's development, manufacturing bottlenecks and a slightly lower efficacy than some rival vaccines have caused the company significant reputational damage.

All carmaker stocks had opened weakly after  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), widely seen as the most adept manager of supply chains in the business, said it may have to slash production in September due to chip shortages and Covid-driven plant closures, notably in Thailand.

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A delta-driven drop,"A look at the day ahead from Tommy Wilkes.
After an August in which stock markets have repeatedly hit record highs, the mood music turned decisively more sombre on Thursday, led by a late slump in U.S. stocks which cascaded into already jittery Asian markets.
While European and U.S. markets have roared higher in recent weeks, Asian shares have moved downwards and slumped to their lowest levels this year on worries about the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant and widening regulatory crackdown concerns in China.
There was no obvious catalyst for the selling on Thursday but there were clear signs beyond stocks that investors are growing concerned that the boom in asset prices in 2021 has gotten ahead of itself and the global economy recovery may slow.
Commodities fell again with oil prices down for a sixth straight session and at three-month lows, while growth bellwether copper fell to a two-month trough.
The dollar, the go-to safe haven currency for investors when uncertainty reigns, rose to a 10-month high.
According to minutes from last month's Federal Reserve policy meeting published on Thursday, officials felt their employment benchmark for decreasing support for the economy ""could be reached this year"", adding to investors' view that the tapering of bond-buying is not far off.
Investors will also be watching a Norges bank rate decision closely due at 0800 GMT. The Norwegian central bank may be one of the first globally to raise rates from record lows as the economy rebounds from the pandemic.
Both U.S. and European stock futures were in the red, following the sharp move lower in Asia.
In corporate news, the Nikkei business daily reported that Toyota would slash car production by 40% in September from its previous plan due to the worldwide shortage of semiconductors. That helped send the Japanese stock index to a seven-month low.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:

-Norges Bank policy meeting

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>",Singapore's SC Capital set sights on hard-hit Japanese hotels with $550 million fund,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Singapore's SC Capital Partners aims to raise around $550 million for a new fund targeting hard-hit Japanese hotels, its chairman told Reuters, betting tourism will come back strongly once the coronavirus pandemic subsides.
The asset manager is one of a number of foreign investors, including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), aiming to scoop up Japanese hotels as owners put assets up for sale to generate cash. 
""I believe very strongly that the trend of foreign visitors coming to Japan will recover and gather strength and continue for a very long time,"" Suchad Chiaranussati, chairman and founder of SC Capital Partners, told Reuters in an interview. 
""And among all the Asia Pacific markets, today I am most optimistic on the recovery of tourism in Japan.""
Before the pandemic, Japan had been in the midst of a tourism boom with the annual number of foreign visitors more than doubling in five years to 32 million in 2019. 
That number was only expected to increase with the 2020 Olympics, which helped fuel a hotel construction boom. But those hopes unravelled after the pandemic sent occupancy rates tumbling. After a year's delay, the Olympics finished this month - without spectators or a tourism boost.
SC Capital Partners, which owns almost 90 percent of the company that manages real estate trust Japan Hotel Reit Investment Corp, aims to raise around 60 billion yen in its first yen-denominated fund. 
The asset manager aims to generate annual returns to investors of around 14-16%, Chiaranussati said. 
""In my opinion, the beginning of relaxation of international travel will likely take place early next year,"" he said. 
While SC Capital looks at sectors across Japan's property markets, Chiaranussati said he sees more opportunities in hotels given the impact of COVID-19 on valuations.
PLENTY OF BUYERS
But some property experts say it's not so easy to get hotels at rock-bottom prices.
""There are many potential buyers, so sellers do not have to lower prices, which is why the number of recent deals are limited,"" said Tetsuya Kaneko, managing director at Savills Japan, a property services firm. 
""Only those that had been already struggling before the pandemic could be sold at a discount."" 
While hotel revenues have fallen sharply, in many cases underlying property values haven't. For example, the appraisal value of a Kyoto hotel owned by the Invincible Investment Corp fell around 15% last year, a fraction of the 82% drop the hotel suffered in its average revenue per available room - a key indicator known as RevPAR - during the same period.
Shares in Invincible as well as Japan Hotel Reit Investment have recovered from their lows in March last year, indicating that investors are already factoring in a recovery.
Earlier this year, Blackstone Group bought eight hotels from the Japanese railway operator Kintetsu Group Holdings. 
Seibu Holdings, which also runs railways, has said it plans to sell some hotel assets while continuing to manage them. Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, a railway and department store operator, has said it plans to close seven of its money-losing hotels, including ones in the heart of Tokyo and Osaka.
SC Capital will start investing in hotels as well as hotel management platforms and travel-related companies as soon as the fund is raised by the end of this year, Chiaranussati said.

Potential investors in the fund will be Japanese and overseas institutions, such as insurance groups, pension funds and sovereign wealth money, he said.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>","Policy groups ask Apple to drop plans to inspect iMessages, scan for abuse images","By Joseph Menn
(Reuters) -More than 90 policy and rights groups around the world published an open letter on Thursday urging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to abandon plans for scanning children’s messages for nudity and the phones of adults for images of child sex abuse.
""Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material, we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,"" the groups wrote https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products in the letter, which was first reported by Reuters.
The largest campaign to date over an encryption issue at a single company was organized by the U.S.-based nonprofit Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT).
Some overseas signatories in particular are worried about the impact of the changes in nations with different legal systems, including some already hosting heated fights over encryption and privacy.
""It's so disappointing and upsetting that Apple is doing this, because they have been a staunch ally in defending encryption in the past,"" said Sharon Bradford Franklin, co-director of CDT's Security & Surveillance Project.
An Apple spokesman said the company had addressed privacy and security concerns in a document Friday outlining why the complex architecture of the scanning software should resist attempts to subvert it https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf. 
Those signing included multiple groups in Brazil, where courts have repeatedly blocked Facebook’s WhatsApp for failing to decrypt messages in criminal probes, and the senate has passed a bill that would require traceability of messages, which would require somehow marking their content. A similar law was passed in India this year.
“Our main concern is the consequence of this mechanism, how this could be extended to other situations and other companies,” said Flavio Wagner, president of the independent Brazil chapter of the Internet Society, which signed. “This represents a serious weakening of encryption.”
Other signers were in India, Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Ghana and Tanzania.
Surprised by the earlier outcry following its announcement two weeks ago, Apple has offered a series of explanations https://www.reuters.com/technology/after-criticism-apple-only-seek-abuse-images-flagged-multiple-nations-2021-08-13 and documents to argue that the risks of false detections are low.
Apple said it would refuse demands to expand the image-detection system beyond pictures of children flagged by clearinghouses in multiple jurisdictions, though it has not said it would pull out of a market rather than obeying a court order.
Though most of the objections so far have been over device-scanning, the coalition’s letter also faults a change to iMessage in family accounts, which would try to identify and blur nudity in children’s messages, letting them view it only if parents are notified. 
The signers said the step could endanger children in intolerant homes or those seeking educational material. More broadly, they said the change will break end-to-end encryption for iMessage, which Apple has staunchly defended in other contexts.

""Once this backdoor feature is built in, governments could compel Apple to extend notification to other accounts, and to detect images that are objectionable for reasons other than being sexually explicit,"" the letter says.
Other groups that signed include the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, Privacy International, and the Tor Project.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 10:50PM ET</span>",Explainer: What happens next in Huawei CFO Meng's Canada extradition case?,"By Moira Warburton
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Judicial hearings in Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's extradition case wrapped up on Wednesday and British Columbia Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said she would announce the date of her ruling on Oct. 21.
Meng, 49, was detained in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant charging her with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) about Huawei's business dealings in Iran. China detained two Canadians shortly afterward, sentencing one this month to 11 years in prison for espionage, in a move widely seen as retaliation. Beijing has denied any connection between the arrests and Meng's case. 
Here is an explanation of what can happen next in the process.
WHAT IS THE JUDGE CONSIDERING?
Normally extradition hearings take place in a single day, but Meng's hearings have been spread out over several years.
The first thing Holmes had to decide was whether Meng's case met the double criminality standard, meaning whether her alleged crime would be considered illegal in Canada. Holmes decided in May 2020 that it did, and the case proceeded.
Holmes is now deciding whether the abuses of process alleged by Meng's defense team are enough to stay the extradition. They have been separated into four ""branches"":
1) Former U.S. President Donald Trump's alleged politicization of the case against Meng, which the defense says has ensured she would not receive a fair trial in the United States;
2) Missteps that occurred during Meng's initial arrest by Canadian and American authorities;
3) Allegations that the United States misled Canada in the evidence it provided outlining the case against Meng.
Meng's defense team has argued those should be taken as a pattern of abuse and are enough to stay the extradition. Prosecutors representing the Canadian government have said they are either not enough to halt the extradition or are matters for the U.S. courts.
WHAT VERDICTS CAN JUDGE RENDER AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The bar for extradition is lower than it would be in a trial. As a Canadian judge, Holmes is not qualified to rule on whether the person is guilty or innocent based on another country's laws, so she only has to decide if the evidence against Meng would allow a trial to proceed in Canada.
If Holmes rules in favor of extradition, the case moves to Canada's justice minister for final approval. 
If she rules for a stay in the extradition, the process likely stops there. It is rare for the Canadian government to appeal a court's ruling against extradition.
A stay in the extradition would be politically expedient for the Canadian government, which has been thrown into the middle of a fight between the United States and China because of the case. Meng's release could also spur Beijing to release the two Canadians detained after her arrest.
IF JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF EXTRADITION, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 
Canada's justice minister makes the final decision on whether to surrender the person for extradition. 

Meng can appeal both the judge's decision and ask for a judicial review of the minister's decision. Such an appeal could take years to work its way through the courts and potentially end up at the Supreme Court of Canada. During that time, she would likely push to have her bail conditions reassessed. 
Her bail conditions mean she can leave her residence under supervision but must stay home at night.

Elsewhere in the country,  China Huarong Asset Management  Co. Ltd. (HK:2799) is set to be recapitalized by government-backed investors.
The minutes from the Fed’s July meeting, released on Wednesday, said that most officials agreed that the central bank could slowly begin asset tapering later in 2021 thanks to the progress made in reaching its inflation and employment goals to date.
However, the content of the Fed meeting minutes did not take some investors by surprise.

The pace of re-openings is a concern for investors amid the spread of the COVID-19 Delta strain, she added.
Investors now await the Jackson Hole symposium, which will take place next week, for further clues on the timeline for both asset tapering and interest rate hikes.
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia will hand down its policy decision later in the day.

Samarco filed for bankruptcy protection in April as it struggled to restructure its debt, which it stopped servicing after a dam burst at a mine in 2015, killing 19 people, releasing a giant torrent of sludge and halting production.
Prosecutors consider Samarco's co-owners to be responsible for the disaster and are seeking a restraining order that would oblige them to cover its debt, according to the document.
The prosecutors said both controlling shareholders used Samarco to obtain immediate gains amid an iron-ore price boom, which they say precipitated the dam's collapse.
""They chose to put at risk the lives of people who lived and worked there, as well as the environment, causing tragic consequences and incalculable damages,"" they wrote.
Vale said in a securities filing it was surprised by the prosecutors' request.
""The request attacks the clear letter of the agreements signed between the parties, to which the MPMG (prosecutors from Minas Gerais state) is a signatory, in addition to threatening the ongoing discussions and efforts to renegotiate the reparation measures for damage resulting from the Fundão dam collapse,"" the company said.

BHP said in a statement the bankruptcy protection request was the best solution it found to allow Samarco to recover financially.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes slid on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling over 1%, after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month showed officials felt the employment benchmark for decreasing support for the economy ""could be reached this year.""
Stocks accelerated their declines late in the session, pushing the S&P 500 down about 1.8% from its record closing high after its second straight daily drop. It was the benchmark index's single-day first drop of at least 1% since July 19.
Most S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with energy falling 2.4% and healthcare off 1.5%.
The minutes of the July 27-28 Fed meeting showed different groups worried about inflation and the need to prepare to combat it, with others saying it would take time, and require patience from the Fed, to put Americans back to work.
Investors are looking for signs about when the central bank will rein in its easy money policies, including tapering its bond-buying program, which have been a crucial support as the S&P 500 has roughly doubled from its March 2020 low. 
""The Fed minutes did nothing to dispel the thought that tapering will begin soon,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""We are closer to the end than the middle of tapering, and people don’t know how to react to it.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 382.59 points, or 1.08%, to 34,960.69, the S&P 500 lost 47.81 points, or 1.07%, to 4,400.27 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 130.27 points, or 0.89%, to 14,525.91.
With the market in a period that has seasonally been weak historically, investors have said stocks may be due for a significant drop, with the S&P 500 yet to experience a 5% pullback this year. 
Focus now shifts to the Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week for any read about the central bank's next steps. Many analysts expect the Fed to announce its plan to taper asset purchases as early as the Sept. 21-22 policy meeting. 
A rebound in the U.S. economy, including a stellar second-quarter corporate earnings season along with accommodative monetary policy has underpinned positive sentiment for equities.
""We have gotten a rash of both earnings and economic data over the past several weeks that broadly is pointing to a positive outlook for the fundamental backdrop to the market,"" said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""The one wildcard at this stage is going to be the role Fed stimulus is going to play.""
In company news, shares of Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc jumped 9.6% after the home improvement chain's quarterly report. Lowe's said professional builders and handymen were rushing back to its stores, boosting sales.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.46-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 149 new lows.
About 8.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 9.15 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 09:05PM ET</span>",Robinhood sees retail traders taking a breather in third quarter,"By Sohini Podder, John McCrank and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc expects retail investors to become less active in the third quarter, after frantic trading in crypto currencies helped more than double its revenue, the online brokerage said in its first earnings report as a public company. 
A slowdown in retail trading, which has been one of the standout phenomena of the pandemic-era, comes as the U.S. eased some coronavirus restrictions in recent weeks. One analyst said the resumption of sports and other activities likely took some of the retail interest.
""We aren't talking about people who are investors at all but gamblers and now that we've got sports back? Betting on sports is a lot more fun than betting on the stock market,"" said David Trainer, chief executive officer of investment research firm New Constructs.
The earnings report from Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), owner of the trading app that emerged as the gateway for investors seeking to get in on this year’s mania for so-called meme stocks, offered a glimpse into the trajectory of a trading boom that helped spark breathtaking moves in the shares of companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and helped make retail investors a force to be reckoned with.
Some analysts expressed concern about whether retail investors will continue to trade at a breakneck pace as the economy continues to reopen, or if the Federal Reserve begins to unwind the easy money policies that helped the S&P 500 double from its March 2020 lows. Another potential area of concern may be the hefty chunk of Robinhood's revenue that comes from investors trading often volatile cryptocurrencies. 
Shares of Robinhood, which went public late last month, were recently down 8.73% in aftermarket trading.
""For the three months ended September 30, 2021, we expect seasonal headwinds and lower trading activity across the industry to result in lower revenue and considerably fewer new funded accounts than in the prior quarter,"" the company said.
Robinhood posted net revenue of $565 million for the quarter ended June 30 compared with $244 million a year earlier. That 131% gain is above the mean analyst estimate of $521.8 million, according to Refinitive IBES.
Monthly active users increased 109% to 21.3 million, compared to 10.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, while assets under custody increased 205% to $102 billion, compared with $33 billion a year before. 
Transactions based revenue in the quarter came to $451.2 million, with crypto transactions contributing $233.1 million, options transactions $164.6 million, and equities $52 million. Crypto trading revenue was only $5 million a year ago.
Of the cryptocurrency transaction volume, Robinhood said trading in dogecoin - a meme-inspired cryptocurrency whose price has shot up by around 9,000% in the past year - made up 62%.
Robinhood's platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies. Its simple interface made it popular with investors trading from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to wild rides in shares of companies like GameStop, which skyrocketed by more than 1,600% in January before paring those gains, only to surge again later in the year. 
Retail stock trading levels in the current quarter remain below the peaks seen at the beginning of this year during the GameStop frenzy, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. 
Some analysts believe retail investors will be less eager to take risks in a down market, potentially hurting Robinhood’s bottomline. 
Many of Robinhood’s investors “have not dealt with anything but up-markets but those markets have the realistic possibility to change as the Fed (who caused this launch) is apparently reversing,” wrote Chaim Siegel, analyst at Elazar Advisors.
Robinhood enraged some investors and U.S. lawmakers earlier this year when it restricted trading in some popular stocks following a 10-fold rise in deposit requirements at its clearinghouse. It has been at the center of many regulatory probes.
The bulk of Robinhood's revenue, its transactional revenue, comes from a practice called payment for order flow (PFOF), in which retail brokers send customer orders to wholesale brokers rather than exchanges, for a slightly better execution price, along with payments from the wholesalers in return. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing PFOF over concerns it might incentivize brokers to send customer orders to the places that maximize their own profit, rather than to the places that would get their customers the best execution, and other potential conflicts of interest.
Robinhood said it does not expect PFOF to be banned, but if it is, it can find other ways to generate revenue, possibly by executing client orders internally.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 08:40PM ET</span>","Nvidia forecast beats expectations, but talks on $40 billion Arm deal take longer than expected","By Stephen Nellis and Chavi Mehta
(Reuters) -Nvidia Corp on Wednesday said talks with regulators to clear its $40 billion proposed acquisition of British semiconductor technology firm Arm Ltd are taking longer than expected. 
The disclosure came as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world's biggest maker of graphics chips for gamers and artificial intelligence chips for data centers, forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations on Wednesday as it benefits from a boom in demand.
But investors have focused on whether Nvidia's move to acquire Arm will withstand regulatory scrutiny and close by March of next year as Nvidia promised. Arm has long been a neutral supplier of technology throughout the chip industry, and Nvidia competitors such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc have objected to having Arm land in the hands of a rival.
In a statement, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company is still confident the deal will close.
""Although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns or objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, we are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry,"" she said.
Nvidia shares dropped 2% but later rose as executives predicted higher selling prices for gaming chips on a conference call with analysts.
""Many investors already place a low probability on the deal ultimately being approved. If it is blocked I think it will be met with a collective shrug,"" said Logan Purk, analyst at Edward Jones.
The company estimated current-quarter revenue at $6.80 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts on average had expected $6.53 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Nvidia also beat expectations for second-quarter revenue with a 68% rise to $6.51 billion. Data center and gaming revenue were $2.37 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively, beating analyst estimates of $2.3 billion and $2.94 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The company said second-quarter adjusted profit was $1.04 per share, versus estimates of $1.01 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Nvidia shares initially fell 2% in after-hours trade after release of the results but they later rose 2.8%.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) said on Wednesday that the internet industry should brace for more regulations and uncertainty, but it believed Beijing ultimately wanted to forge a long-term sustainable path for the sector. 
The gaming and social-media giant, which beat forecasts with a 29% jump in second-quarter profit, has been among companies that have borne the brunt of regulatory actions Chinese authorities have unleashed on the tech industry and other sectors.
""There will be short-term uncertainties and there will be a lot of new regulations that will be coming,"" Tencent President Martin Lau told analysts in a call after the company's results, adding that regulators were ""very focused on identifying and rectifying industry behaviours""
He said such regulatory actions should have been expected given how oversight of the industry had been ""loose"" compared to its size and importance. Tencent felt that it was well placed to ""embrace this new environment fully,"" he said. 
""The goal is that the government wants to foster a long-term sustainable path for the industry. The government does recognise its importance on the economic side, on the social side and also the contribution of the industry to global competitiveness,"" he said. 
Executives also emphasized that Tencent was offering its technologies and expertise to companies and public services in an effort to contribute to the economy and society. 
In a separate statement published the same day as its earnings report, Tencent announced it would invest 50 billion yuan ($7.71 billion) to promote ""common prosperity"" in China.
Tencent has been barred from entering into exclusive music rights agreements and saw its $5.3 billion plan to merge  DouYu International Holdings  (NASDAQ:DOYU) Ltd and Huya (NYSE:HUYA) Inc blocked by China's market regulator last month. 
Shares in the world's largest gaming firm by revenue also took a battering after a state media article described online games as ""spiritual opium"" and expressed concern about their impact on children.
As a result, Tencent temporarily lost its crown as Asia's most valuable company to chipmaker TSMC earlier this week. Its shares are down some 8% since the Aug. 3 article.
Tencent has since announced new measures to reduce the time and money children spend on games, starting with its most popular game, ""Honor of Kings."" It said in Wednesday's earnings statement the moves went ""beyond regulatory requirement.""
Players under the age of 16 accounted for only 2.6% of its gross game receipts in China during the second quarter, and Lau said that the company was working with regulators to explore ways in which the total amount of time minors spent on gaming could be capped across all titles in the industry. 
Tencent also expects its online advertising revenue to experience a big hit from China's move to ban for-profit tutoring in core school subjects, as such companies reduce spending. 
Asked about whether the company was seeing any change in preferential tax treatment, Chief Financial Officer John Lo said tax rebates had been reducing over time but that they expected its 2021 effective tax rate to be around the same level as last year, which was 11%. 
Earlier this month, state media said that China should stop giving tax breaks to online video gaming firms.
Net profit for the three months through June came in at 42.6 billion yuan, above a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 34.4 billion yuan, as robust demand for games such as ""Honor of Kings"" and ""PUBG mobile"" offset a decrease in revenues from its battle royale title ""Peacekeeper Elite"". 
Profit was also boosted by an increase in the fair value assessment of some of the companies Tencent has invested in.

Revenue jumped 20% to 138.3 billion yuan with sales from mobile games up 13%.

The life sciences company said there is no legal impediment to the closure in the United States and that the move will ensure the deal does not expire before the regulatory processes conclude.
The U.S. antitrust regulator did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. 
The cash-and-stock deal was announced in September last year by Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) to gain access to Grail's flagship Galleri blood test used to diagnose cancers at early stages when the disease is easier to treat.
The deal will face a trial https:// on Aug. 24 at the FTC, which had in March filed a complaint seeking to block the deal, arguing that Illumina is the sole provider of the DNA sequencing that Grail uses and could prevent others from entering the market. 
EU antitrust regulators in July opened a full-scale investigation after warning that the deal could curb innovation and competition.

The company said on Wednesday it would hold Grail as a separate company during the European Commission's ongoing regulatory review.
""We will abide by any outcome ultimately reached by the courts,"" Charles Dadswell, general counsel of Illumina, said.

Businesses across the globe have been facing an unprecedented semiconductor shortage that has inflated costs of even the cheapest parts, hurting companies like Cisco which use those chips in their routers.
""Looking ahead, we expect the supply challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of our fiscal year and potentially into the second half,"" Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said on a call with analysts.
Shares of the company were down 1.8% in extended trading, after rising about 23% this year. 
The shortage has also held back Cisco from fully cashing in on a rise in demand for chips from telecom companies swiftly upgrading their networks to 5G.
The San Jose, California-based company said it expects first-quarter profit per share between 79 cents and 81 cents, with the midpoint narrowly missing Refinitiv IBES estimates of 81 cents.
However, Cisco edged past fourth-quarter revenue and profit estimates, helped by more people using its videoconferencing platform Webex, virtual private network AnyConnect and cybersecurity products as offices adapt to hybrid work.

CEO Robbins also said the company was monitoring the COVID-19 Delta variant, and had not seen any impact on customer spending yet. 
It expects first-quarter revenue to grow 7.5% to 9.5% year-over-year, while Wall Street expects it to rise about 7.6%.

The third-largest U.S. wireless carrier said personal data, including social security numbers and driver's license information, of more than 40 million former and prospective customers was stolen along with data from 7.8 million existing T-Mobile wireless customers.
Dates of birth, first and last names were also stolen, the telecom services provider said, adding there was no indication their financial details had been compromised. 
""Telecommunications companies have a duty to protect their customers’ information. The FCC is aware of reports of a data breach affecting T-Mobile customers and we are investigating,"" an FCC spokesperson told Reuters.
The company, which had 104.8 million customers as of June, acknowledged the data breach on Sunday after U.S.-based digital media outlet Vice reported that a seller had posted on an underground forum offering private data, including social security numbers from a breach at T-Mobile servers.
T-Mobile also said approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customer names, phone numbers and account PINs were also exposed.
In 2015, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) agreed to pay a $25 million fine to resolve an FCC investigation into consumer privacy violations at AT&T's call centers.
Vice said the seller claimed that 100 million people had their data compromised in the breach. The seller was offering data on 30 million people for 6 bitcoin, or around $270,000.
Reports later suggested that the asking price had slumped and the entire data was being sold for just $200. 
Reuters has not been able to check the veracity of the forum's post.

T-Mobile's data breach is the latest high-profile cyberattack as digital thieves take advantage of security weakened by work-from-home policies due the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Reuters) - HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) said the banking group has initiated legal proceedings against El Salvador for what the company called a breach of the nation's investment treaty with the UK.
""HSBC Latin American Holdings initiated legal proceedings against the Republic of El Salvador for breach of its investment treaty with the United Kingdom, and seeks to recover at least $49.3 million in damages that the bank alleges were wrongly awarded against it by the Supreme Court of El Salvador"", the company said in a statement late on Wednesday.
The arbitration case will be heard by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), HSBC said.
Based in Washington, ICSID is part of the World Bank Group and supports the resolution of international investment disputes between investors and sovereign states.
The dispute arises from a case in El Salvadoran courts in which HSBC sought to recover approximately $2 million in unpaid loans to a local business, the bank said.
Two courts in El Salvador had ruled in HSBC's favour but the country's Supreme Court overturned the lower courts' decisions, the statement added.
The Supreme Court had ordered HSBC to pay the defendant $49.3 million, with HSBC saying the damages award was more than twice the $22.5 million sought by the El Salvadoran business.
Specifically, HSBC claims the Supreme Court decision breached El Salvador's obligations to UK investors under the El Salvador-United Kingdom Bilateral Investment Treaty.
Under that treaty, which has been in force since 2000, El Salvador and the United Kingdom agree to give each other's investors ""fair and equitable treatment,"" and to protect them against ""unreasonable or discriminatory measures"".
HSBC alleged that the Supreme Court's decision amounted to a ""denial of justice"" and that it ""failed to protect the fundamental rights of HSBC as a UK investor in El Salvador"".

The bank group said it earlier sought a settlement with the government of El Salvador in December but received no response.
A representative of the El Salvador government could not immediately be reached for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - A London court on Wednesday approved a 10 billion pound-plus ($14 billion-plus) class action against global payments processor Mastercard (NYSE:MA) that claimants said could entitle 46 million British adults to roughly 300 pounds each if it is successful.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) had been expected to certify Britain's first mass consumer class action, brought by former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks, after the UK Supreme Court overruled objections to it in December.
The decision to finally authorise the five-year case as a collective action establishes a standard for a string of other proposed class actions that have been stalled in its wake.
""Mastercard has thrown everything at trying to prevent this claim going forward, but today its efforts have failed,"" Merricks said in a statement. 
""The tribunal's ruling heralds the start of an era of consumer-focused class actions which will help to hold big business to account in areas that really matter.""
Mastercard said the ""spurious"" claim was being driven by lawyers and backed by organisations ""primarily focused on making money for themselves"".
Merricks alleges Mastercard charged excessive ""interchange"" fees – the fees retailers pay credit card companies when consumers use a card to shop - between May 1992 and June 2008 and that those fees were passed on to consumers as retailers raised prices.
But Merricks failed to expand the scope of the case by adding the estates of the deceased and compound interest to the claim. Mastercard said this reduced the claim's size to around 10 billion pounds. The claimants put it at 15 billion pounds.
""The decision today reduces the value of this spurious claim by more than 35%,"" Mastercard said in a statement. 

""Mastercard is confident that over the coming months a review of key facts will further significantly reduce the size and viability of the claim.""

The Financial Times, citing people familiar with the talks, reported CME offered 0.75 of its own shares for each Cboe share, representing a per-share value of $150.
Cboe declined to comment. CME said the report was false. 
""CME Group denies all rumors that it is in conversations to acquire Cboe Global Markets. The company has not had any discussions with Cboe whatsoever,"" it said.
Shares of Cboe ended 1.3% lower, while CME shares closed down 3.8%.
""There's no sense spreading a rumor if something doesn't go up,"" Cboe investor Thomas Caldwell said of the share prices. 
There is not much product overlap between CME and Cboe, so a takeover might make sense, he added. 
CME is known for its energy, interest rate, agriculture and equity index futures, which investors use to hedge against price moves.
Cboe has proprietary rights to the VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, as well as S&P 500 options, and offers trading across options, equities, foreign exchange and futures.
Options trading has surged in recent months, with asset managers using the derivatives for earning additional alpha and capital efficiency, so there is a lot of interest in that market, said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group.

""It's a game of scale. Exchanges need to get bigger because it's very much of a commoditized function, and whether it's data, or exchange matching, or post trade, it's definitely an industry that benefits from greater scale,"" he said.
Cboe was spun off of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 1973, and then CBOT merged with CME in 2007.

Customers who obtained credit cards secured by deposits between 2016 and 2019 accused TD of reneging on its promise to let them automatically ""graduate"" to unsecured cards if they avoided defaulting on payments for seven months.
U.S. District Judge Renee Bumb said the timing of TD's review process for the upgrades supported letting the case continue.
""Assuming, as the court must, the veracity of plaintiffs’ allegations, defendant engaged in wrongful conduct when it promised plaintiffs that their accounts would be automatically reviewed for graduation after seven months, only to not actually do so for two years,"" the Camden, New Jersey-based judge wrote.
TD said it cannot comment on pending litigation. 
The plaintiffs are seeking damages of at least $5 million (C$6.3 million) from the Canadian bank, claiming that it refused to give them unsecured credit cards even after they had gone between 15 and 37 months without defaulting.
The plaintiffs are seeking to pursue a nationwide class action, as well as smaller class actions for customers in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. TD Bank has U.S. offices in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, a suburb of Philadelphia.
TD shares closed down 0.3% at C$85.65 in Toronto, in line with the broader stock benchmark.

TD in May agreed to pay $41.5 million to settle a separate U.S. class action lawsuit for charging excess insufficient funds fees on customer accounts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The parent company of new low-cost U.S. air carrier Breeze Airways said on Wednesday it had closed a $200 million Series B funding round led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Knighthead Capital Management LLC.
Breeze Aviation Group Inc previously raised more than $100 million and began flights in late May. Breeze is now serving 16 U.S. cities and 39 routes. The company said it would use the funding to expand operations.
Breeze Chief Executive David Neeleman said on Wednesday the carrier has had more than 100,000 passengers since launching operations.
Breeze currently has 13 airplanes and is focusing on flights between smaller U.S. cities that have little or no direct service from larger carriers. Breeze is serving cities like Tampa, Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; New Orleans, Norfolk, Virginia, Louisville, Kentucky; Tulsa, Oklahoma, Hartford, Connecticut, and Akron, Ohio.
Neeleman said in an interview the new funding showed the airline was ""here to stay."" He said the funding would allow the airline to ""be opportunistic about some airplanes that might be available.""
He said the airline had to work to develop the new routes that are not served by other direct flights.
""It's just getting the word out,"" he said, adding Breeze was profitable on many routes on a variable cost basis. ""We're off to a good start.""
Breeze plans to begin taking delivery of 60 new Airbus A220 aircraft starting in October, which will be delivered at a rate of about one per month for the next five years.

It plans to use the A220 aircraft on routes longer than two hours’ flight time. 
It is Neeleman's fifth commercial airline startup, including JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp and Canada's WestJet. He said Breeze is the ""most capitalized startup in U.S. aviation history by far.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday it has charged three former engineers at Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) with trading on nonpublic information around the company's subscriber growth that generated over $3 million in total profit.
The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, charges the streaming service's ex-staffers with violating antifraud provisions and trying to evade detection by using encrypted messaging applications. It also found that the staffers exchanged the information with relatives and friends so as to receive cash kickbacks in advance of several consecutive Netflix quarterly earnings, the SEC said.
The defendants may also pay fines, the SEC said.
In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington filed a criminal information against the defendants, which could lead to time spent in prison.

""We allege that a Netflix employee and his close associates engaged in a long-running, multimillion dollar scheme to profit from valuable, misappropriated company information,"" said Erin Schneider, director of the SEC's San Francisco regional office. ""The charges announced today hold each of the participants accountable for their roles in the scheme.""
""This case reflects our continued use of sophisticated analytical tools to detect, unravel and halt pernicious insider trading schemes that involve multiple tippers, traders, and market events.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street ended the day lower on Wednesday, after meeting minutes showed U.S. Federal Reserve officials split on when to ease back on economic stimulus, while COVID-19's spread weighed on oil for the fifth straight day.
Wall Street hit new lows following the release of the minutes, which detailed the Fed's July 27-28 policy meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 1.07%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.07% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.89%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.58%.
The minutes fleshed out the Fed's thinking on when to taper its monthly bond purchases, and showed that Fed officials expected it is possible they could ease that stimulus this year if the economy continues to improve as expected.
However, the minutes showed officials noted that the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant could temporarily delay the full reopening of the economy and restrain a jobs market that looms large in the Fed's thinking.
""Since the July FOMC meeting, the probability of a September announcement and an October, or November, start date to tapering those purchases has increased considerably, in our view, with the August payroll release coming out in early September likely to be the most important factor to tip the scales,"" said Bob Miller, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s Head of Americas Fundamental Fixed Income.
The ongoing spread of COVID-19 cases continued to weigh down crude, which fell for the fifth straight day on concerns of diminishing travel demand. Brent crude ended down 80 cents, or 1.2%, at $68.23 a barrel. The global benchmark has lost 11% in the last 13 trading days dating to the end of July. U.S. crude futures settled down $1.13, or 1.7%, to $65.46 a barrel.
U.S. Treasury yields also fell after the release of the Fed minutes, with investors eyeing a potential taper by the end of the year. Benchmark 10-year notes fell to 1.2634%, after rising to a session high of 1.300% before the minutes were disclosed.
The dollar rebounded slightly, after the minutes erased earlier gains that had put it at its highest levels since April. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.04% to 93.163. [USD/]
The ongoing spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant and disappointing economic data is driving up concerns that the global economic comeback might be diminished, while turmoil in Afghanistan and a new China crackdown on the technology sector added fuel to the fire.

Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in July, the latest in several economic indicators that have missed expectations.
Safe-haven gold was down slightly with spot gold prices down 0.02% to $1,785.66 an ounce. U.S. gold futures had earlier settled down 0.2% at $1,784.4 per ounce. [GOL/]

Investing.com – The S&P 500 came under selling pressure into the close Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve's minutes from its July meeting signaled that the central bank could begin tapering its monthly bond purchases this year. 
The S&P 500 fell 1.07%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.08%, or 382 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.9%.
""[M]ost participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year,"" the Fed's minutes showed.
The labor market is the heart of the Fed's decision on when to get tapering underway, but the central bank believes there is still ground to cover on jobs. 
""Most participants judged that the Committee's standard of 'substantial further progress' toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met,"" according to the Fed's minutes. ""Most participants remarked that this standard had been achieved with respect to the price-stability goal.""  
With the Federal Reserve now largely expected to begin scaling back its bond purchases by year-end, investors believe the central bank will need to take a proactive approach, taking its foot off the tightening pedal on any sign of worry in the economy to keep stocks grinding higher.
“The Fed will begin to increasingly reduce its monetary policy support [at a time] when many see this summer as peak stimulus,"" Zhiwei Ren, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager, at Penn Mutual Asset Management told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday.  ""This could be an issue for the economy and for the market.""
""One way they [the Fed] can avoid this, is to change course right away, If they see something wrong,"" Ren added. ""This is what the market is [currently] pricing in now [...] the market doesn't think the Fed will get to a  2.5% neutral rate, but rather 1.5% or 1.6% and then stop tightening."" 
Monetary policy aside, a slew of retailers including Lowe's and  Target  reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations, but saw mixed reaction from investors.
Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) jumped 10% as the home improvement retailer lifted its full-year outlook after reporting quarterly results that topped analysts expectations.
Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), meanwhile, also delivered quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines, but its shares fell 3%.
 Krispy Kreme  (NASDAQ:DNUT), which made its return to the stock market last month, fell 7% after the doughnut chain reported mixed quarterly results as earnings fell short, but revenue beat Wall Street expectations.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, shrugged off intraday losses despite weaker oil prices amid data that showed a larger-than-expected decline in weekly U.S. crude inventories, but an unexpected build in gasoline inventories.  
Crude inventories dropped by 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 1.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
In big tech, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was in the spotlight after the e-commerce giant reportedly warned certain third-party sellers that antitrust laws approved in June could limit their ability to sell on Amazon.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT closed below the flatline. 
On the vaccine front, The U.S. government said it plans to make Covid-19 vaccine booster shots widely available starting on Sept. 20 amid concerns over the rising Covid-19 infections.
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)  were in the red. The boosters would be for those who received the Pfizer or Moderna shots, but not yet for those who received Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose vaccine.

1476,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 04:27PM ET</span>",China Huarong Gets State-Led Bailout After Record 2020 Loss,"(Bloomberg) -- Government-backed investors will recapitalize China Huarong Asset Management Co. after the bad-debt manager posted a record $15.9 billion loss, ending months of speculation over whether Beijing would deem the troubled financial giant too big to fail.
The rescue package unveiled on Wednesday, while thin on official details, suggests President Xi Jinping’s government is for now unwilling to allow a default by one of China’s most systemically important state-owned companies. It’s likely to boost short-term confidence in China’s $12 trillion credit market, even as it raises concerns about the longer-term dangers of a financial system where implicit government guarantees have enabled years of reckless borrowing.
State-owned investors including Citic Group, China Insurance Investment Co. and China Life Asset Management Co. will replenish Huarong’s capital, the nation’s biggest bad-loan manager said in an exchange filing Wednesday. Huarong said it has no plan to restructure its debt, reiterating that it’s made preparations for future bond payments.
The statement confirmed a Bloomberg report that Huarong was poised to receive fresh capital as part of an overhaul plan, according to people familiar with the matter, who put the amount being discussed at about 50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion). Control of the company would shift to Citic, the people had said, though details were still being finalized and could change.
The overhaul marks the government’s first major attempt to resolve a crisis at Huarong that has roiled the world’s second-largest credit market since April. The financial giant’s plight has become the biggest test in decades of Chinese authorities’ willingness to support troubled state-owned borrowers amid a record wave of defaults.
“This is clearly a good signal that SOE support is still firmly in place when financial stability is at risk,” said Kamil Amin, a credit strategist at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG), referring to state-owned enterprises. “For financial systemically important issuers, I think the notion of being too big to fail holds more than for property developers, for example.” 
Concerns have been swirling among investors over Huarong’s financial health and the lack of clarity on government support after the company delayed its earnings release. In separate exchange filings on Wednesday, Huarong reported a preliminary 2020 loss of 102.9 billion yuan and said the board will approve the results for last year as well as interim 2021 results on Aug. 28.
Huarong’s dollar bonds rose to multimonth highs after Bloomberg’s report on Wednesday, with the 4.5% perpetual note climbing 4.4 cents on the dollar to 90.5 cents. That’s up from a low of 50 cents in May.
The details of the government’s ultimate decision on Huarong will be scrutinized by investors for its broader implications. The effort to help the company make good on its $242 billion of liabilities -- including about $21 billion of offshore bonds -- would neutralize a potential systemic risk to China’s financial system and make it easier for other state-owned borrowers to tap the credit market.
At the same time, authorities may be wary of providing unconditional support. That would likely undermine Xi’s campaign to curb reckless borrowing, much of which has been enabled by implicit government guarantees. When asked about Huarong last month, a spokesperson for China’s banking regulator said the government addresses problems at risky companies with “market-oriented” solutions.
Some analysts have warned that rescuing troubled companies will only delay China’s reckoning with its record corporate debt pile, making it more painful when a crisis inevitably strikes.
“Overall we think it’s credit positive for investors, particularly those holding bonds with near-term maturities. From a cash-flow perspective, the company will potentially refinance the bank loans it has taken to pay off the bonds maturing this year with proceeds from asset sales,” said Amin of UBS. “Longer term, the company will need to show itself as stable and well-capitalized for investors to regain confidence and consider investing in new issues.”
If the potential strategic investment is implemented, it will replenish Huarong’s capital, consolidate its foundation for sustainable operations, and ensure it meets regulatory requirements, the firm said on Wednesday.
Huarong shares will remain suspended. The stock has tumbled 67% since its 2015 listing. 
Citic Ltd. said in an exchange filing on Wednesday that Citic Group will become a substantial shareholder of Huarong, without giving more details.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says...
“In order to avoid contagion for other Chinese SOEs, the government and Citic could choose to avoid haircuts for Huarong bondholders and ask shareholders to bear losses, as has been done in previous bailouts in China.”
--Dan Wang, credit analyst
Huarong’s fate has been a subject of intense speculation since it missed a deadline to report results at the end of March. That stoked concern the company might be headed for a landmark default, sending its bonds to record lows.
While missed payments at state-owned Chinese companies have become more common in recent years, none of the defaulters have been as systemically important as Huarong. In addition to its close link to China’s central government and complex web of connections to other financial institutions, Huarong is also one of the country’s biggest issuers of offshore bonds that sit in portfolios from Hong Kong to London and New York.
Huarong has so far repaid all its bonds on time and said last month it would redeem a $500 million perpetual note in September, helping to boost market confidence. The company has also reached agreements with state-owned banks to ensure it can meet obligations through at least the end of August, Bloomberg reported in May.
Investors have remained jittery because both Huarong and regulators have stayed quiet about the state of the company’s finances and restructuring plans. Huarong’s dollar bonds due January 2025 trade at about 88 cents on the dollar, implying an unusually high risk of default for an investment-grade issuer.
Whether or not the capital injection plan comes to fruition, Huarong’s balance sheet is poised to shrink over time, people familiar with the matter said. The company is planning to sell nearly all its local units outside of the core distressed-debt business, Bloomberg reported in June.
Huarong, together with China Cinda Asset Management Co., China Great Wall Asset Management Co. and China Orient Asset Management Co., was created to buy bad loans from banks in the aftermath of the late 1990s Asian financial crisis, when decades of government-directed lending to state companies had left China’s biggest lenders on the brink of insolvency.
The bad-debt firms later expanded beyond their original mandate, creating a labyrinth of subsidiaries to engage in other financial businesses and borrow billions from the bond market. Huarong was the most aggressive of the four under former Chairman Lai Xiaomin, who was executed in January for crimes including bribery.
Established in 1979 to help pilot Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms, Citic Group is a ministerial level financial conglomerate directly overseen by China’s State Council. That means it sits above Huarong in the nation’s complex hierarchy of government ministries and state-owned enterprises. Citic Group last year appointed former People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Zhu Hexin as its chairman.
Citic Ltd., the group’s main listed arm, has about HK$9.7 trillion ($1.25 trillion) of assets and holds stakes in firms including China Citic Bank Corp. and Citic Securities Co.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 04:21PM ET</span>","Analysis: Workers at Chile's Escondida mine hit jackpot, raise bar in labor talks elsewhere","By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - An historic benefits package at BHP's sprawling Escondida copper mine has raised the prospect for tough new negotiations and strikes at mines around the country, workers and analysts told Reuters.
Success at the bargaining table was driven by soaring copper prices, which broke records earlier this year and have remained high enough to whet workers' appetite for raises, bonuses and a bigger slice of profits. 
The higher bar comes as fresh labor talks are pending at a raft of mines across the world's top copper producer. That includes Codelco's flagship El Teniente mine, its smaller El Salvador and Ministro Hales mines, BHP's Cerro Colorado,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL)'s El Soldado and KGHM's Sierra Gorda. 
Chile, unlike neighboring Peru, largely maintained its output of the red metal even during the worst of the pandemic, and workers said they are due their fair share after working through difficult, potentially deadly, conditions to keep mines open.
The payoff deal last week at Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, came after a terse standoff that nearly ended in a strike.
Workers will receive benefits equivalent to about $30,000 each, including a bonus equivalent to 1% of dividends paid to shareholders and distributed to all workers in equal parts, the union said after inking the deal. 
Unions had entered talks with high expectations, thanks to the high prices, said Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of Chilean consultancy Plusmining, adding that the resulting record-making benefits amounted to an ""implicit endorsement of these greater demands.""
The benefits in Escondida were significantly higher than the $24,000 doled out in March to union workers at  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO)'s Los Pelambres mine. 
Chile produces nearly 30% of the world's copper, a key metal in construction and electric vehicle manufacturing. 
PANDEMIC SACRIFICE
Three unions that recently walked of the job at Codelco's Andina copper mine near the capital Santiago have made obtaining recognition of their work during the pandemic a key point in talks.
""Today we have to recognize [those sacrifices],"" Manuel Cañas, secretary of one of the striking unions at Andina, told Reuters during a protest outside Codelco's offices in Santiago. 
The world's largest copper miner, the state-run Codelco managed to slightly increase production during 2020 amid the worst of the outbreak.
Cañas acknowledged the smaller Andina might not have the sway of Escondida, but said high prices and hard work during the pandemic should, at minimum, force the company to ""maintain current benefits not only for current workers but for those who may arrive.""
Codelco, which has pinched pennies to underwrite a 10-year, $40 billion plan to revamp its aging mines, has dug in its heels, saying that its final offer to the unions ""constitutes the maximum effort of the company within the framework of its transformation.""
Workers at JX Nippon Mining's Caserones mine, smaller than both Escondida and Andina, also walked off the job last week. The mine operator told Reuters there had been no progress in talks.

Alejandra Wood, executive director of Chile's Center for Copper Studies (CESCO), told Reuters that discussions of hiking royalties on miners to help underwrite social programs, together with a move to rewrite the constitution, have also given miners more leverage.
""The price of copper is high, and there is an idea that profits must be shared,"" she said. ""Market and political conditions are undoubtedly influencing workers' expectations.""

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 04:06PM ET</span>",Richard Sackler says Purdue family did not contribute to opioid epidemic,"By Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) - Former Purdue Pharma President Richard Sackler said on Wednesday that his family’s reign over the OxyContin maker did not contribute to the national opioid epidemic and downplayed his role in a marketing strategy that prosecutors said led to some unsafe opioid prescriptions.
Sackler was the second member of the family to testify over a bankruptcy plan that aims to resolve thousands of claims accusing Purdue of fueling the opioid crisis.
The plan’s underlying settlement includes protections for the Sackler family members that own the company against future opioid-related litigation.
Richard Sackler’s son, David, testified on Tuesday before a New York bankruptcy court that his family has a “moral responsibility” to help curb the opioid epidemic but would walk away from the deal if they do not receive releases shielding them from future opioid-related litigation. 
But when Richard Sackler was asked on Wednesday by an attorney for the state of Washington, which opposes the deal, whether the Sackler family or Purdue bears any responsibility for the crisis, he responded with a firm “no.” 
David and Richard Sackler were both Purdue board directors.
The Sacklers have long denied wrongdoing in connection with the opioid-related lawsuits that led to the bankruptcy. Purdue has pleaded guilty to fraud and kickback charges.
More than 500,000 Americans have died since 1999 from opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Richard Sackler was also questioned on Wednesday about the Evolve to Excellence program, which according to federal prosecutors encouraged Purdue sales representatives to increase marketing to “extreme, high-volume prescribers.” 
He said that while “elements of” Evolve to Excellence were presented to the Purdue board while he sat on it, he did not recall any vote to implement the strategy.

The Fed will base its decision largely on its assessment of the health of the labor market, and it indicated there is still some ground to cover.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Tuesday, as investors weighed up the Federal Reserve's minutes from its July meeting, signalling that the central bank could begin tapering its monthly bond purchases this year. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.8%, or 270 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.45%.
""[M]ost participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year,"" the Fed's minutes showed.
The labor market is the heart of the Fed's decision on when to get tapering underway, but the central bank believes there is still ground to cover on jobs. 
""Most participants judged that the Committee's standard of 'substantial further progress' toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met,"" according to the Fed's minutes. ""Most participants remarked that this standard had been achieved with respect to the price-stability goal.""  
The first mention of a potential timeline has heightened focus on next week's symposium at Jackson Hole, where Fed chairman Jerome Powell is expected to elaborate on the central bank's tapering plans.   
Monetary policy aside, a slew of retailers including Lowe's and  Target  reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations, but saw mixed reaction from investors.
Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) jumped 10% as the home improvement retailer lifted its full-year outlook after reporting quarterly results that topped analysts expectations.
Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), meanwhile, also delivered quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines, but its shares fell 2%.
 Krispy Kreme  (NASDAQ:DNUT), which made its return to the stock market last month, fell 6% after the doughnut chain reported mixed quarterly results as earnings fell short, but revenue beat Wall Street expectations.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, shrugged off intraday losses despite weaker oil prices amid data that showed a larger-than-expected decline in weekly U.S. crude inventories, but an unexpected build in gasoline inventories.  
Crude inventories dropped by 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 1.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
In big tech, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was in the spotlight after the e-commerce giant reportedly warned certain third-party sellers that antitrust laws approved in June could limit their ability to sell on Amazon.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) traded lower, while  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT was above flatline. 
On the vaccine front, The U.S. government said it plans to make Covid-19 vaccine booster shots widely available starting on Sept. 20 amid concerns over the rising Covid-19 infections.
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)  were in the red. The boosters would be for those who received the Pfizer or Moderna shots, but not yet for those who received Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose vaccine.
In other news, ViacomCBS and NBCUniversal-parent Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) teamed up on a new streaming service, “SkyShowtime,” expected to launch in Europe next year. ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) jumped 4%."

In comparison, JAGX operates as a natural-products pharmaceutical company that is engaged in the development and commercialization of gastrointestinal prescription products for humans and n animals worldwide.

Moller-Maersk said on Wednesday it had signed a contract securing green methanol as the world's largest shipping firm gears up to operate its first carbon-neutral ship in 2023.
With about 90% of world trade transported by sea, global shipping accounts for nearly 3% of the world's CO2 emissions. Maersk needs to have a carbon-neutral fleet by 2030 to meet its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
""Yes, it's one vessel, but it's a prototype for a scalable carbon-neutral solution for shipping,"" Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of decarbonisation, told Reuters. 
Maersk said it had signed its first deal with Denmark's REintegrate to produce roughly 10,000 tonnes of carbon neutral e-methanol, which the vessel will need to operate each year.
The company is also working on tackling challenges in securing the supply of fuel, which Christiansen pegged it at 20 million tonnes for the entire fleet. As the name suggests, green methanol is produced by using renewable sources such as biomass and solar energy. 
""Let's stop talking about fossil fuels and instead focus on scaling this prototype because it's actually solving the problem,"" he said, while declining to give a time frame for when such a market would be realistic. 
Future vessels fitted with engines that can run on green methanol will be 10-15% more expensive for the first years, while the cost of the fuel would cost more than twice as much as conventional bunker fuel, Christiansen said. 
""The good news is that because of the amount of oil we consume we can actually start shaping a market just on our demand,"" Christiansen said.

He said while Maersk would carry the costlier vessels on its balance sheets, the additional fuel cost would be shared with its customers. 
""But it's actually not that much more expensive, because even if we double our fuel cost, the impact on a pair of sneakers is less than five cents,"" Christiansen added.

Thus, we think fundamentally weak restaurant stocks  The Cheesecake Factory  (NASDAQ:CAKE), Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY), and FAT Brands (FAT) are best avoided now. Read on.The restaurant industry is expected to be hard hit by the Biden Administration’s increasing “encouragement” of private industry and local governments to mandate proof of COVID-19 vaccination to eat indoors at restaurants, which was triggered by the resurgence of COVID-19 cases. New York City, San Francisco, and California have already mandated proof of immunization to eat indoors. The policy is expected to gain wider traction, creating a host of new challenges for restaurant operators. Many restaurant owners are worried that their businesses might not be able to handle another blow. Furthermore, with the rising cost of food lowering the restaurant chains’ profit margins, lower foot traffic could spell significant losses.
 U.S. consumer sentiment declined to pandemic-era lows recently amid the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. The consumer sentiment index fell 11 points to 70.2 in August, its lowest reading since December 2011. Moreover, the index missed analysts’ 80.1 target by a large margin.
Given this backdrop, we believe fundamentally weak restaurant stocks The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (CAKE), Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY), and FAT Brands Inc. (FAT) are best avoided now.

(Reuters) - GlobalFoundries Inc has filed confidentially with U.S regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) in New York that could value the chipmaker at around $25 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
The move is the clearest sign yet that GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, is not eager to accept a potential tie-up with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), which the Wall Street Journal reported last month was in talks to acquire the U.S. chipmaker. 
GlobalFoundries is working with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG on the IPO preparations, the sources said. 
GlobalFoundries is expected to reveal its IPO filing in October and go public by the end of the year or early next year, depending on how quickly its application is processed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the sources said.
The sources, who requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential, cautioned that the chipmaker's plans were subject to market conditions and that the timing could change. 
Intel has yet to make a formal offer for GlobalFoundries and may not do so, according to the sources. GlobalFoundries is concerned that such a combination would upset some of its key customers that compete with Intel, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, the sources said. It could also face intense antitrust scrutiny from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has become more hostile to transformative mergers, the sources added. 
Mubadala, GlobalFoundries and Intel declined to comment. The banks, the SEC, Advanced Micro Devices and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
GlobalFoundries' IPO filing comes amid a boom in capital markets, with other high-profile names such as  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global and Roblox Corp already taking advantage with public listings this year. 
GlobalFoundries manufactures radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, automotive, and other specialized semiconductors, and has emerged as a major resource for companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices that have outsourced parts of their chip production. It was created when Advanced Micro Devices spun off its manufacturing facilities in 2009 and Mubadala later merged it with Singapore’s Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.
GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield told Reuters in July the chipmaker was planning to go public in 2022. The chipmaker has pledged to boost output to meet robust demand and announced plans to build a second factory near its Malta, New York, headquarters to address the global chip shortage.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",U.S. may reinstate boost in automaker fines for not meeting emissions rules,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Wednesday it may impose higher penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements in recent years, a decision that could cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars or more.
President Donald Trump's administration in its final days in January delayed a 2016 regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements.
Automakers protested that 2016 hike, warning it could boost industry costs by at least $1 billion annually. The hike could cost Chrysler parent Stellantis for instance hundreds of millions of dollars, while boosting the value of credits sold by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Under President Barack Obama, the higher penalties were set to start with the 2019 model year, but the Trump administration - which first tried to suspend the hike - agreed following a court decision to set the effective date as the 2022 model year.
NHTSA said it is giving the public 30 days to comment on whether it should reinstate the 2016 rule that would impose higher penalties effective with the 2019 model year, but said it had not yet reached a final determination.
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, NHTSA issued rules to raise fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards.
A trade group representing major U.S. and foreign automakers said Wednesday it had urged NHTSA not to retroactively apply higher penalties to model years already produced or designed, ""since doing so would produce no environmental or fuel economy benefit.""
A U.S. appeals court in August 2020 overturned the Trump administration’s 2019 decision to suspend the 2016 regulation.
In March, Tesla urged a U.S. appeals court to reinstate the higher fuel economy penalties and said the Biden administration ignored the ongoing impact of the Trump rule on the credit-trading market.
Tesla, whose electric cars produce zero emissions, sells credits to other automakers to reduce their burden of complying with regulations and argued the Trump rule change makes those credits less valuable.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, part of Stellantis NV, paid a total of nearly $150 million for failing to meet 2016 and 2017 requirements.
NHTSA said its analysis showed reinstating the earlier hike could boost penalties for the 2019 model year alone by $178.5 million, a figure that does not include the impact on credit trading.

Stellantis said earlier this month in a securities filing costs related to potential higher CAFE penalties could be about 521 million euros ($609 million).
Earlier this month, NHTSA proposed hiking CAFE requirements by 8% annually for 2024 through 2026, reversing a Trump-era regulation that rolled back higher requirements starting in the 2021 model year.

Read for an explanation.The cannabis revolution is gaining traction as the legalization of recreational and medical cannabis accelerates. So far, 19 states have allowed the cultivation and use of recreational cannabis. However, while most cannabis companies are well-positioned to profit from the expanding domestic and foreign marijuana markets, some appear to have lost momentum due to strong competition in the industry.
Furthermore, the cannabis industry’s prospects appear to be uncertain owing to the Senate’s disagreement over the decriminalization of marijuana at the federal level. The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, floated by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer last month, which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act, does not yet have sufficient supporters in the Senate.
Amid this uncertainty, we think it would be wise to avoid fundamentally weak cannabis stocks Cronos Group Inc. (CRON) and GrowGeneration Corp. (GRWG). These two stocks have declined more than 10% in price over the past week.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 12:21PM ET</span>",U.S. senators urge FTC to probe Tesla over self-driving claims,"By Hyunjoo Jin and David Shepardson
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. senators on Wednesday pressed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to probe Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), saying the company has misled consumers and endangered the public by marketing its driving automation systems as fully self-driving.
""Tesla and (CEO) Mr. (Elon) Musk’s repeated overstatements of their vehicle’s capabilities ... put Tesla drivers – and all of the traveling public – at risk of serious injury or death,"" Senate Democrats Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey said in a letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan. 
""Tesla drivers listen to these claims and believe their vehicles are equipped to drive themselves – with potentially deadly consequences."" 
A spokesman for the FTC on Wednesday confirmed the commission had received the letter but declined further comment.
The letter, which came after the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration opened a probe into Tesla's Autopilot on Monday, added to pressure on Tesla.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla shares were up 4% in early trading Wednesday. 
Autopilot is a standard feature for Tesla cars and enables the vehicles to maintain distance from cars in front. Tesla sells its advanced driver assistant features such as lane changing and automated parking under the name Full Self-Driving (FSD) for $10,000, although the system does not make its vehicles fully autonomous. 
Musk, who has nearly 60 million Twitter followers, uses the term FSD frequently, generally referring to the Tesla package of features, but many consumers take it to mean fully autonomous driving. Musk has touted how safe the technology is and promised that its vehicles would soon drive themselves, only to miss his own deadlines.
NHTSA said in June that since 2016 it has opened 30 investigations into Tesla crashes in which the agency suspects advanced driver assistance systems were in use.

NHTSA in 2018 said in a letter to Tesla the company had made ""misleading statements"" about the safety of its Model 3 and had confused consumers. The agency referred the issue to the FTC to investigate whether Tesla’s statements constituted “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”
Two U.S. consumer advocacy groups in 2018 also urged the FTC to investigate Tesla' naming of Autopilot. The FTC declined to comment Wednesday on NHTSA's referral and has taken no public action on it.

The COVID-19 Delta variant's spread is prompting some firms to rethink their back-to-office plans, but many of Wall Street's biggest banks are sticking to their decision to bring back employees.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank pushed back its U.S. return-to-office date to October from an earlier target of Sept. 7.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
The bank planned to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank has brought back employees in the United States to the office on a rotational basis from July.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
CEO Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
The bank's chief executive officer, James Gorman, said if most employees are not back to work at the bank's Manhattan headquarters in September, he will be ""very disappointed"".
Gorman said his bank's policy will vary by location, noting the firm's 2,000 employees in India will not return to offices this year.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank will only allow vaccinated staff to return to its offices in early September, while encouraging other employees to get inoculated.
UNITED KINGDOM
 Barclays  (LON:BARC)
CEO Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York.
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC)
HSBC has adopted a new hybrid working model, with a 10% reduction in its global real estate footprint since the start of 2020.
HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40%. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns.
Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY)
Britain's biggest domestic bank expects there will be three ways of working - at home, in the office, or a combination of the two - from October.
The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)
StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.
Nine of the bank's markets, including the UK, have been on flexible working contracts for a few months.
NatWest
CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate.
The bank will adopt its new ways of working over the summer, with the majority of staff in England and Wales expected to be back in the office from September, dependent on government and public health advice, a spokesperson said.
GERMANY
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
Deutsche Bank in London had plans to bring more staff back from June 21, assuming the city's lockdown restrictions were loosened, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Germany's largest lender has also told its U.S. investment bankers that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters. The bank earlier said it was following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries.
SWITZERLAND
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)
Credit Suisse in July 2020 launched a global program evaluating various work-from-home options. It has been monitoring and adapting work arrangements since launching work-from-home globally in March 2020, taking into account local guidelines.
UBS
UBS Chairman Axel Weber in May said flexibility would remain part of work arrangements at Switzerland's biggest bank going forward, where roles allow. Return-to-office plans vary from region to region, in accordance with local government guidelines.
CANADA
Bank of Canada
The central bank will allow most of its staff to remotely clock in as much as half of their working hours once public health guidelines allow it to fully reopen offices, a spokesperson said.
The bank expects to bring back many employees after summer, but it does not see conditions returning to normal until 2022, according to a Bloomberg News report. https://bloom.bg/3kL8Dj2
Royal Bank of Canada
The country's largest lender, is exploring a flexible and hybrid work arrangement to bring its employees back to the office, Chief Executive Officer David McKay said.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CIBC plans to begin a phased return to office starting this fall for employees who have been working remotely.
For a small number of staff, the move back could start in September, while for others, returns will be staggered from October into the first quarter of next year, a spokesperson said.

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 12:17PM ET</span>","Defensive, travel stocks keep European shares afloat","By Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi Sanyal
(Reuters) -European stocks held steady on Wednesday as investors favoured utilities and healthcare shares over economically sensitive sectors on rising concerns over a spike in global COVID-19 cases.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index inched up just 0.1%, with automakers and miners the biggest drags. 
Sectors considered more stable during times of economic uncertainty, such as healthcare and utilities rose, while travel and leisure stocks clawed back some losses from earlier this week.
UK shares initially found some relief after data showed British inflation fell to the Bank of England's 2% target last month in an unexpectedly sharp slowdown.
The UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 slipped 0.2% but the FTSE 250 mid-cap index inched up 0.6%. France's CAC 40 fell 0.7%.
""Inflation stepped off the accelerator in July, but this doesn't mean we're set for a gentle ride,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""The underlying pressure on prices, particularly from soaring petrol and second-hand car prices, means it's set to pick up speed again soon, and may well hit 4% by the end of the year.""
A much stronger-than-expected earnings season and improving economic data in Europe pushed the benchmark STOXX 600 to its longest winning streak in over decade last week. However, pandemic-related worries and uncertainty around central bank actions stalled gains.
Minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's July policy meeting are due at 1800 GMT.
""Investors will be watching out for clues over when the Fed could start tapering bond purchases,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. 

Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) rose 2.3% after it lifted its full-year earnings outlook and said beer volumes in key markets China and Russia had risen to ""well above"" pre-pandemic levels.
Swiss medical device maker Alcon (NYSE:ALC) jumped 13.5% after it raised its full-year earnings forecast, while online pharmacy chain Zur Rose fell 5.6% after disappointing first-half results.

(Reuters) - Aurora, the Silicon Valley self-driving startup founded by former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) executives, has released what it says is the industry’s first tool for evaluating whether and when autonomous trucks and cars are safe to deploy on public roads without a human behind the wheel.
“We think this is the only way you can get to a safe, commercializable product,” said co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson of Aurora’s new Safety Case Framework.
Aurora, working with partners PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR) and Volvo Group, aims to put its self-driving system in commercial service in heavy-duty trucks in late 2023.
The release of the safety tool, which provides a methodology and metrics for gauging progress from development to deployment, comes days after the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation of Tesla’s Autopilot driving assistance feature following a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
Urmson said the latest NHTSA investigation of Tesla “had no bearing” on Aurora’s decision to release its framework, which he described as a ""structured approach"" to testing and validating the safety of self-driving systems. It includes four levels of claims connected with the safe development, testing and evaluation of Aurora's self-driving systems, which require supporting evidence.
Urmson has had an ongoing dialogue with the U.S. safety agency dating back to when he ran Google’s self-driving car program, which since has been renamed Waymo.
Aurora also has had related discussions with such professional organizations as the Society of Automotive Engineers and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to “look at different standards and approaches to safety.”

The five-year-old Bay Area company is slated to go public later this year, at a pro-forma market capitalization of $13 billion, after raising more than $2.2 billion.
Aurora's early investors included Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Hyundai, BMW, Shell (LON:RDSa) and SoftBank. Fund managers Fidelity, Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price are backing Aurora’s SPAC-backed reverse merger, which is slated to close in the fourth quarter.

(Reuters) -U.S. shoppers returning to stores ahead of the back-to-school season helped  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) forecast higher same-store sales growth after beating quarterly estimates on Wednesday, even as online demand sharply dropped from pandemic highs.
Traffic rose about 13% in the second quarter, in sharp contrast from a year ago when customers mainly relied on the company's speedy delivery services for their shopping needs.
Along with larger rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s results from a day earlier, Target signaled a return to pre-pandemic behavior among U.S. shoppers as vaccinations and eased restrictions encourage more people to step out. 
""We believe that America still embraces stores and the traffic we are seeing tell us that stores continue to play an important role,"" Target's Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said.
Executives also signaled a ""meaningful"" change in the use of online services, citing a 55% rise in same-day offerings such as in-store pickup and Drive Up while sales on orders shipped directly to home fell.
Digital comparable sales rose 10%, against the 195% jump a year earlier and 50% in the first quarter. Total comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 8.9%.
The retailer projected high single-digit sales growth for the second half of the year, betting on the strong start to the back-to-school season, at a time when supply chain disruptions, higher labor costs and the fast-spreading Delta variant threaten an economic recovery. 
""The main risk for Target (and much of retail right now) is rising input costs and pass through power given the competitive environment. .. Target's productivity initiatives and sales leverage should enable them to show an attractive return,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.

Target's Cornell said the company was not seeing any adjustment in consumer behavior so far due to Delta.
Shares of Target, which announced a new $15 billion share repurchase program, slipped 1%, having gained about 45% this year.

The health insurer joined a slew of companies such as  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) across the healthcare, technology and financial sectors in mandating vaccines or tests for employees working from office.
""It's clear we need to do more to stop the ongoing spread of COVID-19, and unlike many aspects of the pandemic, keeping our worksites as safe as possible is something we can control,"" said Dr. Steve Miller, chief clinical officer of Cigna.

Employees who must work onsite such as medical care providers and pharmacists should be fully vaccinated or receive two negative COVID-19 tests per week starting on Oct. 18, the company said.
Cigna said it plans to reopen offices throughout the fall, but employees who can work from home will continue to have the option to do so.

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",HSBC banker who quit over racism report says efforts to hire more Black leaders failing,"By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are failing to deliver on promises to hire, retain and promote more Black executives as prejudice and a reluctance to change stymie leaders' good intentions, a former HSBC banker who resigned this month over the problems said.
Ian Clarke, a mid-level manager, left HSBC on Aug. 3 citing frustration at the speed and scale of its response to a report he wrote alleging racism inside the bank.
It comes at a time when banks worldwide say they are trying to implement pledges to improve diversity, after the murder of George Floyd in police custody in the United States in May 2020 sparked global protests over racial injustice.
Europe's biggest bank said in July 2020 it aimed to double the number of Black staff in senior roles by 2025, and CEO Noel Quinn told Reuters two weeks ago the lender ""saw no need to restate"" that target.
In his first interview since leaving, Clarke, 36, said he believed the bank was unlikely to achieve that goal under its current direction and that the problem runs throughout the industry.
""I think that the number of Black people within the bank has severely reduced,"" Clarke said.
""In October 2020 when the new strategy was announced numbers that I uncovered suggested that we had just 90 Black leaders in our firm of 226,000, globally...and currently I'd estimate it's around 60 remaining.""
Clarke's 48-page report, based on interviews with around 100 HSBC colleagues, said the bank had fewer than five Black, Indigenous or People of Colour (BIPOC) in senior leadership roles in 63 of its 65 markets, with the United States and Britain the only exceptions.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the number of Black leaders at the bank.
HSBC did not address the specifics of Clarke's assertions, but a spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to improving diversity and inclusion at HSBC, and whilst we are making progress, we know we have more work to do.
""To achieve our commitments, we are strengthening our recruitment processes, partnering with specialist search firms, and enhancing talent development opportunities.""
In HSBC's UK workforce, 2.4% of staff have self-identified as Black, but among senior leaders this falls to 0.9%, as of January 2021. The bank said it did not have updated data.
Most other major investment banks in Britain say they are unable to disclose data on the ethnic diversity of their UK workforces, making it hard to assess the industry's progress on pledges to increase the number of Black employees. 
PACE OF CHANGE
Born to a white mother and Jamaican father in London, Clarke said he was drawn to banking because of the opportunity it offered for people without privilege to succeed, enrolling in HSBC's management training scheme in 2007.
He rose through the ranks, eventually joining the sales team in the lender's Global Liquidity and Cash Management unit in New York.
Clarke wrote a report - on his own initiative - entitled Project Speak Up on the state of diversity within HSBC, sending it to senior managers in June.
""George Floyd was a real awakening for me and it was for many people, and it made me re-evaluate my career in the bank and all of the things that had happened that at the time I dismissed as maybe just overwork or an ego, and now quite clearly joining the dots that was racism,"" he said.
He said that while he had welcomed the bank's initial response to his report, he became disillusioned by the pace of change.
Of the 11 Black and minority people in his sales team, nine have left HSBC in the last three years and none have joined to replace them, he said.
HSBC did not comment on this.

Clarke said he felt HSBC, in common with other banks, had good intentions to address the issues he raised, but struggled from group-think and a lack of understanding among senior white leaders about the experience of prejudice.
""If you're leaving it to people that don't understand these concepts to try and execute a strategy to fix them, I cannot see how that is anything more than performative allyship,"" he said.

This, along with an increased interest in safe-haven metals amid geopolitical tensions caused by the collapse of the Afghan government, makes Wall Street analysts bullish about gold stocks Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW),  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC), and Eldorado Gold (NYSE:EGO).They are each currently trading significantly below their 52-week price highs. And analysts believe these stocks could rally by more than 45%. So, let’s discuss.As the resurgence of COVID-19 cases continues to heighten investors’ concerns that the unabated pandemic will threaten the global economic recovery, the spot gold price retreated slightly this week after hitting its highest level since August 6, 2021, at $1,795.25. But the safe-haven metal continues to hover near the two-week high, with investors awaiting the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting for cues on its tapering plans.
Although a stronger U.S. dollar, given the hawkish outlook for U.S. monetary policy, combined with an improvement in real yield could mean more downside for gold, Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst, Asia Pacific at OANDA, believes “the elephant in the room is this Delta variant.” Therefore, “gold is likely to find more haven buying.” Moreover, the geopolitical tensions related to the collapse of the Afghan government could further boost the yellow metal’s safe-haven appeal.
Amid this environment, Wall Street analysts remain bullish about prominent gold mining stocks Sibanye Stillwater Limited (SBSW), Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC), and Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO). These stocks are currently trading significantly below their 52-week highs. And given the expected increase in demand for safe-haven assets, analysts expect these stocks to rally by more than 45% in the near term.

The global video games market is expected to grow at a 12.9% CAGR over the next seven years.
However, Unity Software Inc. (U) has not been able to capitalize on the industry’s growth. Although the stock has surged 24.9% in price over the past month, the company’s weak financials compared to its peers make it susceptible to a pullback in the near term. In its last reported quarter, U’s net loss increased 442.4% to $148.34 million, and its loss from operations surged 500.5% to $149.18 million, demonstrating weak fundamentals. In addition, the stock has declined 21.3% year-to-date.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet instead on shares of fundamentally sound companies in this space  Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA), Playtika Holding Corp. (PLTK), and Ubisoft Entertainment (UBSFY). These three stocks are better positioned than U to cash in on the growing demand for video games.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>","Big-ticket spenders boost Lowe's sales, shares jump","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -Lowe's Cos Inc said on Wednesday that professional builders and handymen were rushing back to its stores, boosting sales at a time demand from the home improvement chain's core do-it-yourself customers wanes, sending its shares up 11%. 
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States over the last few months has opened the doors for professional contractors to complete maintenance, repair and upgrade jobs that were put on hold by customers due to the pandemic.
As a result, sales of big-ticket items such as building equipment and materials have risen, helping offset a slowdown in paint sales and gardening tools that had surged when people were homebound.
This demand boost from ""pro customers"" helped the retailer report a 21% rise in second-quarter sales in the segment and forecast full-year revenue above Wall Street estimates.
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) predicted sales to professional customers, which can constitute up to a quarter of its business, would remain strong for the rest of the year and was optimistic that DIY demand will not peter out entirely.
""From a DIY perspective, I assume demand will mitigate a little bit, but it's not going to fall off the floor either,"" Chief Financial Officer David Denton said on an analyst call.
Lowe's said it expects fiscal year 2021 total sales of about $92 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $91.58 billion. 
The impact of the Delta variant of the coronavirus on the home improvement space had injected some uncertainty into the forecast Denton said, but added that sales trends so far in August had been strong. 
Lowe's same-store sales fell 1.6% in the second quarter, smaller than the 2.2% drop analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 

Larger rival  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) reported a bigger-than-expected slowdown in U.S. sales on Tuesday. 
The company's net earnings of $4.25 per share, in the second quarter, above estimates of $4.01 per shares

Investing.com – Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) plunged more than 6% Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that the government in its home country, China, may regulate ride-hailing commissions.
The move, considered consumer-friendly, is unlikely to go down well with the company or its drivers.
The government’s plan only exacerbates the problem for the company whose app was ordered to be removed from app stores by Chinese regulators, pending a review of its data handling practices and security framework. Didi, along with several other apps, were told not to onboard new users.
The company had last month warned its revenue would suffer as a result of the Cyberspace Administration of China's order withdrawing 25 more of its apps from local app stores.
The apps targeted in the second round included Didi’s app for drivers offering rides through its platform, an app for corporate users and a financing app.
While the order on regulating ride-hailing commission is specific to the companies, recent orders by the Chinese authorities against its internet giants have unnerved investors. Edtech companies have been advised to go non-profit.
Tuesday, according to state media reports, President Xi Jinping advised China’s wealthiest citizens to work towards “common prosperity” that includes income regulation and redistribution.

Sports-first live television (TV) streaming platform provider fuboTV Inc. (FUBO) had an impressive stock market debut last October, raising $183 million. The stock has gained 31.1% over the past three months on the back of investors’ optimism surrounding positive developments.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower again Wednesday, with cyclical and reopening stocks underperforming amid fear that the delta variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus could yet derail the global economic recovery. 
A sharp drop in housing starts in July, pointing to a further cooling off of the housing market under price and supply chain pressures, also hurt the mood, although building permits recovered after falling in June.
""The signal from the fall in sales is unambiguous,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics Ian Shepherdson. ""Both permits and starts are likely to fall over the next few months. Housing demand has reverted to its pre-Covid level, so construction activity needs to drop further.""
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 147 points, or 0.4% at 35196 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite outperformed, staying roughly unchanged.
Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) stock was the standout performer among blue chips in early trade, rising 7.0% after the retailer raised its forecast for the year on the back of a strong second quarter. While revenue from amateur home improvement items weakened as expected, it was more than offset by increased buying from business customers, notably on big-ticket tools. By contrast,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock fell even though the retailer beat expectations for profit and announced a new buyback program.
Virpax Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRPX) continued its stellar rise, leaping another 85% after the Food and Drug Administration sent it a written response concerning an experimental drug aimed at creating antiviral barriers. The FDA's pre-investigational new drug response ""provides an opportunity for open communication between the Sponsor and the FDA to discuss the IND development plan and to obtain the FDA’s guidance for clinical studies for the new drug candidate,"" according to Anthony Mack, chairman and CEO of Virpax, which listed earlier this year.
Elsewhere, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) ADRs rebounded 3.5% on the back of better-than-expected quarterly earnings, having hit a 15-month low on Tuesday. The stock has still lost 43% from its peak earlier this year under the weight of a regulatory onslaught against its services, which continued on Wednesday as state authorities accused its WeChat messaging service of making illegal data transfers (along with over 40 other apps).
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 1.4% to a new all-time high amid reports that the U.S. will approve 'booster shots' for those already fully vaccinated, paving the way for a long-lasting boost to revenue from its Covid-19 vaccine.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) stock meanwhile, rose 4.7% after the broadcaster said it will roll out a new subscription streaming service, Sky Showtime, in 20 European markets from next year. The project is a joint venture with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) whose stock fell 0.1%.
Attention is likely to switch later in the day to the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, a release that will be scanned for early hints of a tightening of monetary policy that many expect to be flagged more clearly by Chairman Jerome Powell at the Fed's symposium in Jackson Hole next week.

However, other parts of the economy are lagging and haven’t fully made up losses incurred from the pandemic. The most notable example is the labor market. During the pandemic, the US economy shed about 22 million jobs. Since then, we have recovered about 16 million jobs which means the US economy remains short of about 6 million jobs. Of course, the figure is higher if we also account for population growth with an average of 100,000 people entering the labor force.

Each of these stocks has an overall A (Strong Buy) rating in our proprietary rating system. So, let’s examine these names.Yesterday was a rough day for the stock market as the major indexes retreated from their fresh highs. A higher-than-expected decline in retail sales is primarily responsible for the market’s retreat. Furthermore, a decline in consumer sentiment and concerns over the resurgence of COVID-19 contributed to the volatility. However, the major benchmark indexes are still hovering near their all-time highs, making most quality stocks expensive.
According to a FactSet report, most S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter revenues that are higher than the mean revenue estimate, which has offset investors’ concerns significantly and helped the benchmark indexes soar. So, while it’s hard to find quality stocks at reasonable prices, there are several out there that are still trading at affordable prices.
For example, shares of Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (TTSH), Lincoln Educational Services Corporation (LINC), and Huttig Building Products, Inc.

Net revenue grew 43% to $349 million while organic revenue rose 23% to $55 million. The same rose 16% from 2019 on a two-year-stack basis.
International sales drove the organic growth as economies reopened and people indulged. The company established its omni-channel strategy and thus reached more consumers.
The company said its focus on implementing hub-and-spoke model in U.S. and Canada is delivering results. Sales per hub, a metric it is using to using to measure the effectiveness of its model, rose in its two key geographies as well as in international markets.

LONDON (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) will no longer charge customers late fees when they miss payments on buy now, pay later (BNPL) purchases globally, as competition heats up in the fast-growing sector. 
The changes will be effective from October in the United States, the United Kingdom and France, the San Jose, California-based company said on Wednesday. PayPal's BNPL services in Germany and Australia are already free of late fees.
The company, which first started offering BNPL services last year, hopes the changes will help make its products more affordable and attractive for consumers.
""We felt late fees were hindering the customer experience,"" Greg Lisiewski, vice president of Global Pay Later Products at PayPal, said in an interview.
The changes come as more regulators across the world take a closer look at the fast-growing BNPL sector in a bid to ensure consumers do not take on more debt that they can handle.
""Given the massive rise and acceleration through the pandemic of this space, regulators across all geographies are taking notice,"" Lisiewski said. 
""We think that is appropriate, and we do think late fees will be, and have been, part of that discussion, and we think being as customer friendly as possible puts you in a better place with regulators.""
Asked if there was a risk that dropping late fees would encourage more consumers to default on their loans, he said he didn't expect to see that. PayPal doesn't disclose default rates on BNPL purchases.
BNPL services, which allow consumers to split payments for purchases into installments, have boomed globally during the pandemic, as many people have turned to shopping online. 
The sector's explosive growth has led to increased competition. 
Earlier this month  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), the payments firm led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announced it was buying Australian BNPL firm Afterpay Ltd.

BNPL models vary, with some providers earning most profits by collecting fees from merchants at the point of sale, and others charging interest and late fees to consumers. 
PayPal's late fees vary based on country and U.S. state regulations. Since launching the service, the company has processed more than $3.5 billion in total payment volume through BNPL products, PayPal said. More than 7 million consumers have used the products, it said.

Maxx owner receives sales boost as customers return to stores,"(Reuters) -TJX Cos Inc on Wednesday beat market estimates for quarterly net sales, as the easing of COVID-19 curbs prompted Americans to return to brick-and-mortar stores ahead of the reopening of schools.
Off-price retailers including TJX (NYSE:TJX)'s T.J. Maxx and Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL) weathered a tough 2020 when the pandemic accelerated a shift to e-commerce as the sector relies heavily on the treasure-hunt shopping experience it offers.
However, they have rebounded rather swiftly thanks to pent-up demand from U.S. customers who are armed with stimulus checks and child tax credit payments.
""Treasure-hunt shopping experience continued to draw customers into our stores around the world,"" TJX Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said.
Open-only same-store sales at its Marmaxx U.S. division, which includes its U.S. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, soared 18% from pre-pandemic levels two years ago, while its HomeGoods segment kept up its strong run during the health crisis, posting a 36% jump.
Big-box chain  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) also said apparel benefited from an early start to the back-to-school season in the second quarter.
Analysts have said that even apparel sellers that bought a lot of inventory have been left with several empty shelves as students have been splurging on new tops and trousers ahead of their return to brick-and-mortar schools and colleges.
TJX said open-only same-store sales for the start of the third quarter were up mid-teen percentage from the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
The company, however, stopped short of providing a financial forecast, citing uncertainty at a time when COVID-19 Delta variant cases are increasing across its markets.

The company's second-quarter net sales rose 81% to $12.08 billion from a year earlier, above estimates of $11.04 billion. Excluding items, TJX earned 79 cents per share, beating Refinitiv IBES estimates of 57 cents.

Investing.com – Lowe’s stock (NYSE:LOW) traded 4.7% higher in Wednesday’s trade as the retailer raised its previous forecast for 2021 sales by $6 billion to $92 billion.
Total sales for the second quarter were $27.6 billion compared to $27.3 billion in the second quarter of 2020, and comparable sales decreased 1.6%.
Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business decreased 2.2% for the second quarter as people returned to work and demand for the company’s do-it-yourself products softened. This was mitigated by higher sales of pricier items.
Lowe's said August is witnessing strong sales.
The fall wasn’t as bad as analysts thought it would be and that allowed the company to beat estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. EPS of $4.25 was higher than the $3.99 forecast.
The company raised its forecast for operating margin, too, to 12.2% from 12% earlier. It has committed at least $2.8 billion to stock buybacks in the second half of the year.

1533,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 07:32AM ET</span>",Target Slips As Comparable Sales Growth More Than Halves,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Target  stock (NYSE:TGT) traded 2.5% lower in Wednesday’s premarket as same-store sales growth decelerated sharply in the second quarter to reflect a return to more normal times for consumers.
The approval of a new $15 billion share repurchase program didn’t provide noticeable support. The new program will begin when the remaining money from the 2019 program, approximately $1.8 billion, is exhausted.
Second-quarter comparable sales grew 8.9% compared to 24% jump in the same period last year.
Digital comparable sales in the quarter rose 10%, compared to a 195% rise in the same period a year earlier.
Driven by stimulus checks, extremely low interest rates and the fear of running out of supplies in the pandemic, consumers stocked up on just about everything last year. That level of super spending is now fading as the economy reopens. Retail data for July released on Tuesday showed overall sales fell 1.1%, with more spending going on services and experiences rather than goods.
Operating margin fell a little to 9.8% from 10% last time out, as higher merchandise and freight costs weighed. The company was partly able to counter these challenges with lower markdowns and a favorable category mix.
Sales rose 9.4% to $24.82 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.64 was higher than the estimated $3.49.
The retailer has guided for high single-digit growth in comparable sales for the second half of the year. Operating margin rate is seen at 8% or higher."

Livestreaming marketing has seen its popularity surge in the last two years among brands like L’Oreal,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Dyson and online shoppers, and most Chinese e-commerce platforms now offer the option to purchase and sell products via livestreaming.
It became the target of scrutiny last year with some shoppers and brands accusing some livestreamers of misrepresenting products or faking sales numbers, prompting China's cyberspace regulator to announce draft rules in November.
China's Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday published more detailed guidelines and for the first time mentioned a preferred language. Mandarin is the official medium in China but there are also many dialects and ethnic minority languages in the country. 

""It is better to use Mandarin during livestreaming,"" it said in a section about how livestreamers were expected to behave.
The new rules, which are up for public review until Sept. 2, also said livestreamers should dress in a way that is inoffensive to their audience, and carry an image reflecting the characteristics of the products or services they try to sell.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>","China's Geely warns of chip shortage, but keeps annual vehicle sales target","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd retained its annual sales target on Wednesday, betting that new vehicle launches will offset the short-term impact of a global chip shortage and a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic.
The company's upbeat forecast and a strong first-half revenue growth helped send shares of the Hangzhou-based car maker up nearly 4%.
""The recent worsening of chip shortage and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally could pose significant threat to our sales performance over the next few months,"" Geely said.
""(But) the upcoming launch of more new and competitive vehicle models should enable the Group to perform better in the second half,"" the company said, maintaining its full-year sales target of 1.53 million vehicles.
It said total annual vehicle sales under Geely, Lynk & Co, which is a joint venture with Volvo Car, and electric vehicle (EV) brands Zeekr and Geometry would hit 3.65 million units by 2025. More than 30% of them would be electrified vehicles. 
Geely posted a 22% rise in six-month revenue to end-June of 45 billion yuan ($6.94 billion), driven by an improved product mix. 
Its total vehicle sales rose 19% to 630,237 cars, underperforming a 27% growth in China's overall passenger vehicle sales.
More than 90% of Geely's vehicles are sold in China and the company has been pushing to increase exports in recent years, focusing mainly on Southeast Asia and Europe.
But net profit grew just 4% to 2.38 billion yuan due to share-based payments of 641 million yuan.
Its parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which has stakes in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo Cars, created Zeekr to consolidate its resources and better challenge in the highly competitive EV market.

Geely said it would seek external funding for Zeekr and would introduce more electric models in its overall lineup.
The company, which abandoned a merger plan with Volvo Cars earlier this year, said the two firms would combine their powertrain operations and also jointly develop next generation EV architecture and autonomous driving solution. ($1 = 6.4824 Chinese yuan renminbi)

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>","UK regulator asked to sanction Carnival, Just Eat over climate disclosures","By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets regulator has been urged to sanction cruise ship company Carnival (NYSE:CUK) and food delivery company Just Eat Takeaway.com for poor disclosures in a complaint seen by Reuters.
Both companies have breached their legal obligations by failing to adequately tell investors the risk climate change poses to their businesses, legal NGO ClientEarth said.
While the Financial Conduct Authority has yet to sanction a company over its climate disclosures, the latest ClientEarth complaint is the first since the UK finance minister told the FCA in March to ""have regard"" in its work to the government's pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The complaint also follows a stinging report from auditing watchdog the Financial Reporting Council in November that found most company accounts were not factoring in climate risk properly and needed to do better.
Under UK law, a company has an obligation to disclose material risks to their business that could impact its value, so shareholders can make an informed judgement on whether to invest.
By not doing so, Just Eat and Carnival have breached several of the disclosure and listings rules set by the FCA to help markets function well, protect customers and enhance financial market integrity, the NGO said.
In the case of Just Eat, ClientEarth said the company made no reference to climate change in its 2020 financial reporting and had no strategy to reduce its carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement on climate.
It also gave only a limited commentary on environmental impacts and opportunities, including around its food packaging, particularly its use of plastics, and risked misleading investors over the sustainability of its business model.
A spokesperson for Just Eat said it did not recognise the allegations made by ClientEarth and had disclosed all material information to investors in its annual report.
""We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and providing accurate information to our key stakeholders,"" the spokesperson said, citing an ongoing plan to carry out a carbon footprint analysis of the company.
""This is currently in progress and once we have an accurate measurement in relation to the analysis, we will be setting reduction targets and reporting these over the coming months.""
Carnival, meanwhile, also made no reference to climate change in its annual report and only ""vague"" statements in its strategic report, with no concrete analysis of the impact of climate change on its business model, the NGO said.
Carnival did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""Recent global efforts to phase-out fossil fuels and single-use plastics, shifts in consumer behaviour, and abrupt changes to regulatory and business environments all present very real challenges to their financial and operational health,"" ClientEarth lawyer Maria Petzsch said.
""These impacts are material to investors, who expect to be given the full picture.""
In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the environmental law charity said it had asked the FCA to refer both companies for investigation, although the regulator is under no obligation to act.
A previous complaint to the FCA by ClientEarth over the disclosures of insurers Lancashire Holdings, Admiral and Phoenix Group in 2018 was not successful.

The NGO also said it had written to the FRC, which oversees the auditing profession, to ask them to liaise with the FCA over any action as it relates to the companies' respective auditors, Deloitte and PwC.
A spokesperson for Deloitte, PwC and the FCA declined to comment. The FRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely lower Wednesday, continuing the weakness of the previous session with the focus on more earnings from the retail sector and the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded marginally lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices closed sharply lower Tuesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 280 points, or 0.8%, its first down day in five. The broad-based S&P 500 also fell 0.7%, its worst day since July 19, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.9%.
Weighing heavily on the market was the sharp drop in July retail sales, which fell 1.1% compared with a revised 0.7% gain in June. Weaker quarterly results from the home improvement chain  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) didn’t help, although better-than-expected numbers from retailing giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) provided some solace.
Retail earnings week continues on Wednesday, with Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), a rival to Home Depot in the home improvement retail market, forecasting full-year sales above estimates after its same-store sales fell 1.6% in the second quarter, compared with expectations of a 2.2% drop.
Discount retailer  Target  (NYSE:TGT) also raised its forecast for the year, after topping expectations with its second-quarter sales, which like Walmart's were boosted by strong back-to-school spending.
Earnings from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are due after the close, while trading app Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) releases its first earnings report as a public entity.
Also of interest will be the release of minutes from the July Federal Reserve meeting, at 2 PM ET (1600 GMT), with investors looking for clues as to when the central bank will end its pandemic-era emergency programs.
As far as economic data is concerned, the housing market will be in focus, with housing starts and building permit data for July due at 10 AM ET.
Elsewhere, oil prices traded higher Wednesday, attempting to rebound after four days of declines, on news Iran has moved closer to producing weapons-grade uranium, likely derailing any move to lift sanctions on its oil exports.
Investors will keep a wary eye on the latest crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body, reported a draw of just over 1 million barrels for the week ending Aug. 13. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $66.98 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $69.81.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,787.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1723.

Investing.com – Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) stock (HK:0700) closed 0.3% higher in Hong Kong after the Chinese gaming and social media giant presented revenue growth of 20% and profit growth of 13% in the second quarter.
Revenue totaled 138.3 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) in the June quarter, while profit for the period rose to RMB 35.1 billion ($5.4 billion).
The performance came despite a regulatory onslaught in recent weeks that has seen the Chinese authorities strip it of some monopoly rights on music publishing and, this week, issue draft regulations that would severely limit its ability to trap clients within its self-contained Internet ecosystem. 
Earlier on Wednesday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology accused Tencent's WeChat messaging service (along with over 40 other apps) of making illegal data transfers and warned the company to make ""rectifications"".
Revenue from online advertising increased by 23%, reflecting rising demand from categories such as internet services and consumer staples.
Value-added services rose 11% and games revenue jumped 12%, primarily driven by titles like Honor of Kings and Clash of Clans. The gaming operations were criticized by state media as being 'spiritual opium' earlier in the summer, indicating a further source of official displeasure with the company, Tencent has since announced steps to reduce the time and money children spend on games.
Fintech and business services revenue increased by 40% as growth in digital payment transactions carried on, partly also driven by rising digitalization of public services and traditional industries.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) raised its full-year earnings guidance on Wednesday after reporting second-quarter sales above expectations as beer volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels.
The world's third-biggest brewer said beer volumes in key markets China and Russia rose to ""well above"" 2019 levels. 
It registered 2% organic growth in overall beer volumes in the first six months of the year compared with the same period in 2019. 
Sales in Western Europe were driven by hot weather in June, combined with the European soccer championship and the reopening of bars and restaurants after coronavirus lockdowns. 
""Western European markets are reopening, but a reverse trend is going on in Asia, particularly in Vietnam, Laos and Malaysia,"" Chief Executive Cees 't Hart said on a conference call.
He also warned that while Carlsberg has hedged against rising commodity prices until the end of the year, ""significantly higher"" costs would hit the company next year, driven by rising prices for aluminium, barley, paper and oil.
Rival Heineken (OTC:HEINY) also beat expectations for first-half beer sales when it reported earnings this month but warned of rising costs and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian markets.
Carlsberg said it now expects operating profit to grow by between 8% and 11% this year, up from its previous guidance of 5-10% growth.
Shares in Carlsberg have risen 17% since the beginning of the year and were trading 2.5% up at 0754 GMT.
Sales between April and June rose 17% to 18.69 billion Danish crowns ($2.94 billion), compared with a 17.97 billion crown forecast in a company-compiled poll of analysts.

(Reuters) - Cigarette maker Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) (PMI) said on Wednesday shareholders holding 22.61% of Vectura shares had tendered their stock to the tobacco group as part of its deal to buy the asthma drug maker for 1.1 billion pounds ($1.51 billion).
The purchase is part of a public tender offer process and comes days after PMI won the backing of Vectura's board for its 165 pence-per-share takeover offer, following a fierce bidding war against private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG).
PMI, which last week switched its proposal to a takeover offer from a so-called scheme of arrangement to raise its chances, needs the backing of holders of just over 50% of Vectura shares for the deal to go through.
Health groups have raised concerns about the deal, questioning the idea of a tobacco company making money from treating the very illnesses cigarettes cause. 
Smoking continues to be a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.
On Tuesday, 35 health groups, experts and anti-smoking charities, including Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, urged Vectura shareholders in a letter to reject the deal, citing the ""business risks and the moral conflict of the proposed takeover.""
The groups warned that PMI's takeover would put at risk Vectura's ability to access government grants from over 180 countries worldwide, who as part of the UN Tobacco Control Treaty have agreed to reduce the tobacco industry's influence on public health policymaking. 
Vectura could also lose crucial links with academic and public health institutions and the ability to publish research in leading medical journals because of their association with a tobacco giant, the signatories said.
""We believe Vectura's future commercial viability as a company dedicated to improving respiratory health would be seriously jeopardised should the PMI takeover offer proceed,"" they said.

Philip Morris was not immediately available to comment on the letter.
Vectura shareholders have until Sept. 15 to decide whether to tender their shares to PMI, which is seeking to acquire the company as part of its evolution into a ""smoke-free and healthcare and wellness company.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican Senator Marco Rubio urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to block short-form video app TikTok in the United States after China took an ownership stake in a key subsidiary of ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company of TikTok. 
The Biden administration in June withdrew a series of Trump-era executive orders that sought to ban new downloads of WeChat and TikTok.
""Beijing’s aggressiveness makes clear that the regime sees TikTok as an extension of the party-state, and the U.S. needs to treat it that way,"" Rubio said in a statement. 
""We must also establish a framework of standards that must be met before a high-risk, foreign-based app is allowed to operate on American telecommunications networks and devices.""
The Commerce Department is conducting a Biden-ordered review of security concerns posed by those apps and others. It did not respond to a request for comment.
""TikTok is led by an executive team in the US and Singapore,"" TikTok said in a statement to Reuters, adding that ""the China-based subsidiary of ByteDance Ltd. referenced has no ownership of TikTok."" 
TikTok is not available in China. 
Dismissing Rubio’s comments on TikTok as “political manipulation”, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily press briefing that U.S. politicians who are bent on saying anti-China comments with disregard of facts are “destined to be swept into the waste dumps of history”.
Corporate records show that the Chinese government took a stake and a board seat in a ByteDance entity this year - a move that raises questions over how much influence Beijing is planning to wield in a tech sector reeling under an onslaught of regulatory action.
The 1% stake in Beijing ByteDance Technology, which holds some of the licenses for Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, as well as news aggregator Toutiao, was registered on April 30, according to corporate information app Tianyancha.
It is held by WangTouZhongWen (Beijing) Technology, which is owned by three Chinese state entities including a fund backed by the country's main internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), government shareholder data shows.

While there is precedent for the Chinese government to hold shares in tech firms, the news comes amid a surge in antitrust probes and new rules https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/china-issues-draft-rules-banning-unfair-competition-internet-sector-2021-08-17 for the industry, upending a previously laissez-faire approach by authorities. 
A ByteDance representative said Beijing ByteDance Technology ""only relates to some of ByteDance's China-market video and information platforms, and holds some of the licences they require to operate under local law.""

Investing.com – Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) stock (CSE:CARLa) was trading 3% higher in Copenhagen as strong beer sales in the first half as well as those of its non-alcoholic beverages drove it to raise its forecast for the year.
Most of the segments topped the 2019 consumption levels as reopening of economies in Europe brought people back to restaurants and to stadiums for Euro 2020. Hot weather in the continent added to the mix.
Carlsberg’s core beer business delivered 8% volume growth. Sales of its two key international brands – Tuborg and Carlsberg – were higher by 28% and 2% in volume terms.
Alcohol-free brews grew 26% and craft and specialty rose 21%. The company attributed higher growth in the former to increased awareness of health and well-being among consumers during the pandemic.
Total organic volume growth in the first six months of the year came in at 10%.
The Danish company now expects operating profit to grow between 8% and 11% this year, up from its previous guidance of 5%-10% growth.
CEO Cees ’t Hart warned of business still suffering in many markets, particularly in Asia due to the new wave of Covid-19 infection.
Adjusted net profit in the first six months was 3.16 billion Danish kroner ($507million), up 10%. Revenue was also 10% higher at DKK 31.68 billion.

Investing.com - European stocks edged lower Wednesday, with concerns of a Covid-induced global economic slowdown weighing even following strong results from brewing giant Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY).
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%.
Sentiment has been rocked of late by signs that the fresh outbreak of Covid-19 has slowed the global economic recovery.
U.S. July retail sales disappointed on Tuesday, following on from weak Chinese economic data earlier in the week, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand decided to keep interest rates unchanged despite expectations of a hike because of new cases in that country.
That said, losses are small Wednesday, helped by strong results from Carlsberg, which pushed its stock up 2.5%. The Danish brewer, the world’s third largest, raised its full-year earnings guidance on Wednesday after reporting second-quarter sales above expectations, aided by strong results in key markets China and Russia.
Swiss medical device maker Alcon (NYSE:ALC)'s (SIX:ALCC) stock jumped 9.7% after it lifted its full-year earnings forecast.
Also of interest, U.K. consumer prices rose 2.0% year-on-year, sharply slowing from the 2.5% growth seen during the previous month and lessening the pressure on the Bank of England to tighten monetary policy. That said, this dip is likely to be temporary, especially given the sharp rises in household energy bills this year.
The Eurozone's inflation rate for last month is expected later in the session, and is expected to remain at 2.2% on the year.
Also of interest will be the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), with investors looking for clues over the U.S. central bank’s thinking over when it can start reining in its massive bond-buying program.
Elsewhere, oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, attempting to rebound after four days of declines, but the spread of the delta coronavirus variant, particularly in China, and the associated impact on mobility is likely to cap any gains.
Investors will keep a wary eye on the latest crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body, reported a draw of just over 1 million barrels for the week ending Aug. 13. 
The EIA reported earlier this week that U.S. shale oil production is expected to rise to 8.1 million barrels a day in September, the highest since April 2020. It's currently just over 7.9 million barrels a day. 
By 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $66.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.9% to $69.66.

“Cutting duties on EVs even to 25% from the current levels which are as high as 100% wouldn’t pose a threat to domestic players, but would help to drive investment and speed up creation of the ecosystem,” Gurpratap Boparai, the managing director of Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Pvt., said in an email. 
Tesla last month urged India to cut tariffs on EVs, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk later tweeting he’d be “quite likely” to build a factory in the country if the carmaker can first begin selling imported vehicles. While the government has poured cold water on the proposal, other auto executives including Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. CEO Anish Shah and Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s Seon Seob Kim have also backed the move. 
India’s high-tax regime has long been a sticking point for foreign automakers.  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. last year said it won’t expand further in India due to high tariffs, while Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). exited the nation. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). pulled out of the country in 2017. 
“A high tax rate not only impacts local consumption but also hurts the potential to make India a global manufacturing destination,” Boparai said. Relaxing import tariffs on electric cars and major components will help boost local production of EVs, he said, adding that increasing volume is “crucial” for India to become a leading EV manufacturer.  
Separately, Volkswagen is exploring how to introduce EVs across its brands in India and will follow a top-down approach led by its luxury brands like Audi and Porsche, Boparai said. 
India needs to create fast-charging infrastructure and provide incentives to spur the transition to electric cars, he said.
“To do higher volumes, one has to be cost competitive for which localization is necessary,” Boparai said. “However, localization requires high investments, which become feasible only at a certain volume and market size.”

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>","Factbox-From e-commerce to education, China's season of regulatory crackdown","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's months-long regulatory crackdown on an array of private companies has unsettled tech upstarts as well as decades-old firms, ushering in a new, uncertain environment.
Top antitrust regulator the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) issued sweeping draft rules on Tuesday governing online competition as the cabinet updated rules for operators of information infrastructure that experts say target data-rich firms.
Here are sectors facing tougher regulatory measures:
E-COMMERCE
Traditional e-commerce has been one of the biggest targets with a record fine of $2.75 billion in April for  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) over its ""choose one from two"" feature that bars vendors from selling on rival sites.
Smaller companies also faced fines over issues of consumer rights and labour.
In May, rival JD (NASDAQ:JD).com was fined 300,000 yuan ($46,000) over false information on food products.
In late July, the regulator ordered better protection for workers of food delivery firms.
Tuesday's draft laws are widely expected to affect the sector by reining in fake reviews and inflated public metrics, while barring use of data or algorithms to hijack traffic or influence user choice.
GAMING AND SOCIAL MEDIA
Regulators have yet to directly target gaming and social media firms, but fierce criticism from state media over issues from celebrity watching to video game addiction have spurred big share sell-offs, or changes by the companies.
Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp, which runs a Twitter-like service, dropped a ranking feature after the People's Daily newspaper, backed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, criticised celebrity hype by social media this month.
In August, the Economic Information Daily described online gaming as ""spiritual opium"", generating a storm that wiped $60 billion off the market value of industry giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) at one point. 
Tencent later announced curbs on minors' access to its most popular game, ""Honor of Kings"". 
EDUCATION
Publicly listed tutoring firms saw massive sell-offs after regulations last month barred private, for-profit tutoring companies from raising capital overseas among other limits.
Social media giant ByteDance laid off staff in its education unit, Reuters reported, while online tutoring company VIPKid stopped lessons by foreigners.
ONLINE FINANCE
In November, shortly before what would have been a record share sale by Ant Group Co Ltd, draft rules by banking regulators set tighter controls on online lending, where the company was a giant player.
They also set limits on cross-provincial online loans and capped loans to individuals.
A day later, the central bank halted Ant Group's IPO, and in April, the regulator ordered the separation of its payment and personal finance businesses.
RIDE-HAILING
In June, the Cyberspace Administration of China told top ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing to stop accepting new users, days after it listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a measure that knocked about a fifth off its share price.
Analysts and investors say the Didi measures have more to do with big data and overseas listings by Chinese firms than competitive practices. Draft rules ordered data-rich Chinese firms to run a security review before listing overseas.
BITCOIN 
In May, three financial regulators widened curbs on cryptocurrency by barring its use for payment or settlement by banks and online firms, as well as exchanging it for fiat currencies and halting investments by fund managers.
Provincial governments' later curbs on bitcoin mining unleashed a wave of shutdowns, with state-linked tabloid Global Times estimating short-term closures of 90%.
PROPERTY
In July, the housing ministry and seven regulators took aim at the property management sector with a notice that chipped more than a tenth off the CSI 300 Real Estate sub-index.
As the economy emerges from its 2020 coronavirus slump, authorities tightened curbs this year on real estate borrowing to prevent any asset bubble, setting caps for developers and banks. 
WHAT'S NEXT?
Investors are watching healthcare closely after the State Council, or cabinet, urged lower prices of medicines and reforms in June.

Tech firms will also brace for a data security law that mandates risk assessments and reports to authorities, as well as a law to protect personal information that governs storage of user data.

1550,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 02:02AM ET</span>",European Stocks Futures Edge Higher; U.K. Inflation Slows Sharply,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Wednesday, taking their lead from gains in Asia rather than the weak close on Wall Street, ahead of key inflation data and an update from the Federal Reserve.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
Asian markets pushed higher earlier Wednesday, bouncing after recent losses with sentiment boosted by the decision of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest rates unchanged despite expectations of a hike.
Wall Street had closed sharply lower overnight, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 280 points, or 0.8%, after U.S. July retail sales disappointed, raising worries of a slowing economic recovery.
Back in Europe, although confidence has been shaken by signs of slowing global growth, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the political turmoil in Afghanistan, the focus is likely on the release of inflation data for July.
U.K. consumer prices rose 2.0% year-on-year, sharply slowing from the 2.5% growth seen during the previous month and lessening the pressure on the Bank of England to tighten monetary policy.
Eurozone's inflation rate for last month is expected later in the session, and is expected to remain at 2.2% on the year.
Also of interest will be the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), with investors looking for clues over the U.S. central bank’s thinking over when it can start reining in its massive bond-buying program.
In corporate news, the retail sector will again be in focus Wednesday with U.S. giants  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reporting before the start of trading on Wall Street. This follows on from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) offering up their second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, which showed consumers easing up on their purchases of goods as the economy reopened.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged higher Wednesday, attempting to rebound after four days of declines, but the spread of the delta coronavirus variant, particularly in China, and the associated impact on mobility is likely to cap any gains.
Investors will keep a wary eye on the latest crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body, reported a draw of just over 1 million barrels for the week ending Aug. 13. 
The EIA reported earlier this week that U.S. shale oil production is expected to rise to 8.1 million barrels a day in September, the highest since April 2020. It's currently just over 7,9 million barrels a day.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $66.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $69.21.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,793.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1714.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 02:00AM ET</span>","BHP, Woodside investors jittery over $29 billion petroleum merger","By Sonali Paul and Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Shares in BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum fell on Wednesday as investors on both sides raised questions about the value of the Perth-based oil and gas group's proposed $29 billion merger with BHP's petroleum arm.
While a 6% fall in BHP's share price was linked to a decision to end its UK dual listing, where its shares have traditionally traded at a large discount, a fall of up to 4% in Woodside reflected concerns about the expansion, they said.
""Woodside is one of the worst-performing companies within the energy sector globally post-COVID; the company doesn't yet have a strong mandate to enter a deal of such questionable value and this could further drag on Woodside's shares,"" said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments at Van Eck Australia, a shareholder in both companies.
BHP agreed to hive off its petroleum business to Woodside in a nil-premium merger, in return for new Woodside shares which will go to BHP shareholders, who will own 48% of the enlarged group.
The deal will make Woodside a top 10 global independent oil and gas producer, giving it oil assets in the Gulf of Mexico, gas in Trinidad and Tobago and ageing assets in Australia's Bass Strait, while doubling its stake in North West Shelf LNG.
However, it raised concerns about the strategic sense of expanding in oil and taking on ageing gas assets with big decommissioning costs.
Investors said the fall in Woodside shares was also partly due to worries about an overhang of stock as BHP investors who want to get out of fossil fuels would look to dump the shares.
The stock was down 1.2% in afternoon trade, underperforming a 1% rise in local rivals Santos and Oil Search (OTC:OISHY).
Woodside's new chief executive, Meg O'Neill, said while investors were very familiar with BHP's Australian oil and gas assets, they did not appreciate the value of its Gulf of Mexico oil stakes - Mad Dog, Atlantis and Shenzi.
​ ""Those are just first-class top-tier assets that will be very cash accretive to the merged company,"" O'Neill told Reuters.
Analysts and two BHP investors said Woodside got the BHP assets relatively cheaply.
""I'd much rather have just hung on to them and harvested the capital because demonstrably the returns from the growth parts of those projects are much higher than Jansen,"" said a Sydney-based fund manager, referring to the $5.7 billion Jansen potash project BHP approved on Tuesday.
Tribeca Investment Partners CEO Ben Cleary, a BHP shareholder, said what BHP lost with the discount on its petroleum assets would be offset by a higher valuation multiple for no longer holding oil and gas.
""Long term the deal makes sense. I think BHP looks more attractive for a wider audience,"" said Matt Haupt, portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, a BHP shareholder.
Analysts were upbeat about the long term for Woodside, saying the deal would give it more growth options, beyond its $12 billion Scarborough gas project and Pluto LNG expansion, funded by strong cash generation at BHP's debt-free assets.
""It's a logical deal between the parties,"" said Argo Investments portfolio manager Andy Forster. ""I do think ultimately shareholders will vote for it.""
Woodside aims to put the deal to a vote in the second quarter of 2022.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Saul Kavonic said Woodside shareholders may be painted into a corner, noting that, as part of the deal, Woodside gave BHP an option to hand over its stake in the Scarborough project for $1 billion if Woodside makes a final investment decision on the project by Dec. 15.
Woodside would then be the sole owner of Scarborough and have to fund the project by itself, which it cannot afford.

""Shareholders may have little choice but to vote the merger through because otherwise it would pose a serious balance sheet overhang,"" Kavonic said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Private equity firm Permira has mandated Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to run a sale of business services company Tricor Group in a deal that could fetch up to $2 billion, three people with knowledge of the transaction told Reuters.
The sale process is expected to kick off soon after an initial gauge of market interest, said one of the sources. 
Permira is targeting a $2 billion valuation for the asset, although the price tag could range from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, said the people, who declined to be named as the information is confidential.
Hong Kong-headquartered Tricor, Permira and Goldman declined to comment. 
Permira, headquartered in London, in 2016 won a bid to buy Tricor https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-east-asia-m-a-permira-idUSKCN1251AR from Bank of East Asia (OTC:BKEAY) and NWS Holdings Ltd for HK$6.5 billion ($837.9 million). 
Founded in 2000, Tricor's offering includes investor and initial public offering services, human resources and payroll, corporate trust and debt, fund administration and international expansion, according to its website.

The company has 47 offices in 21 countries or territories with over 50,000 clients, the website said.
In July, Tricor signed deals to buy PT ASA Indonesia which provides local payroll, accounting and tax services, and NZGT Holding Company Ltd, which specialises in trust business in New Zealand.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 12:56AM ET</span>","BlackBerry software flaw could impact cars, medical devices - U.S. agencies","(Reuters) - A cybersecurity flaw in a software designed by BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd could put at risk cars and medical equipment that use it and expose highly sensitive systems to attackers, the U.S. drugs regulator and a federal agency said on Tuesday. 
The warning came after the Canadian company disclosed that its QNX Real Time Operating System (QNX RTOS) has a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary code or flood a server with traffic until it crashes or gets paralyzed.
The software is used by automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) in many critical functions including the Advanced Driver Assistance System.
The issue does not impact current or recent versions of the QNX RTOS, but rather versions dating from 2012 and earlier, BlackBerry said, adding that, at this time, no customers have indicated that they have been impacted.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the software is used in a wide range of products and its compromise ""could result in a malicious actor gaining control of highly sensitive systems, increasing risk to the Nation's critical functions"", the CISA said.
The federal agency that comes under the Department of Homeland Security and the company said they were not yet aware of any case of active exploitation of the flaw.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it was not aware of any adverse events even as medical equipment manufacturers assess which systems could be affected.

The company also said it has notified potential customers that have been affected and has made software patches available to resolve the matter.
BlackBerry had initially denied that the vulnerability, dubbed as BadAlloc, impacted its products and later resisted making a public announcement, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with talks between the company and federal cybersecurity officials, including a government employee.

High-profile hedge fund investors such as Michael Burry, made famous by “The Big Short” movie, have disclosed short positions against Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund, while some appear to be trying to spar with her on social media and an anti-Ark ETF is also in works.
Semper Augustus Investments Group LLC’s Chief Investment Officer Chris Bloomstran took to Twitter overnight to make some observations on what he makes of Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and the shorts against it. He explained the nuances of valuations and return ratios to Wood in some of his posts.
The upside is that six of the ETF’s top 10 holdings are making money, while “the bad news is the P/Es are somewhat higher that I’m accustomed to seeing,” Bloomstran wrote in a Twitter thread. “What I concluded is you and your team team must be counting on growth. Lots of it.”
Several hedge funds including Laurion Capital Management LP, GoldenTree Asset Management LLC and Cormorant Asset Management LLC hold short positions in ARKK, according to their most recent 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Wood’s main fund and her firm Ark Investment Management LLC attracted billions of dollars in the past year after her thematic tech-focused bets trounced the market in 2020. But Wood and Ark have struggled to maintain momentum amid concerns about lofty prices and accelerating inflation. 
Her main fund is down about 7% this year after returning 149% in 2020 to rank among the best-performing ETFs in the U.S. and make a star out of Wood. It’s set for its first annual loss since 2016.
Wood has so far only rebutted Burry among her detractors. She said in a Twitter thread on Tuesday that, while Burry made a “great call” in the mortgage market, she believes he doesn’t understand “the fundamentals that are creating explosive growth and investment opportunities in the innovation space.”
While she may have her critics, Wood has been ahead of many peers in paring holdings tied to Chinese technology giants amid the nation’s sweeping crackdown of sectors ranging from education to technology. 
The widening regulatory overhaul underway in the world’s second-biggest economy wiped $1 trillion of market value from China shares listed globally last month. The selloff has prompted some fund managers to question their allocations toward Chinese assets.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 10:31PM ET</span>",Judge questions Fox News bid to shake $2.7 billion Smartmatic election suit,"By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - A New York state judge on Tuesday signaled skepticism toward Fox Corp's bid to dismiss Smartmatic's $2.7 billion lawsuit that accused Fox News hosts and guests of making defamatory claims about the voting technology firm during the network's coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
During an oral argument held virtually, Judge David Cohen made comments sympathetic toward Smartmatic, which in February sued Fox https://www.reuters.com/article/us-smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-corp/smartmatic-sues-fox-news-giuliani-over-election-rigging-claims-idUSKBN2A42JO and two of Donald Trump's former lawyers, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, after the attorneys falsely accused it of rigging votes against the former president. Smartmatic is a London-headquartered company with a U.S. unit based in Florida.
Cohen did not say when he would rule on Fox's motion to dismiss https://www.reuters.com/article/us-smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-corp/fox-news-asks-for-smartmatic-lawsuit-over-election-rigging-claims-to-be-dismissed-idUSKBN2A90D2 the case.
The judge questioned whether there was any basis whatsoever for claims Powell and Giuliani made about Smartmatic during appearances on Fox News and Fox Business, like that the company was banned in Texas.
""How is that not defamatory?,"" the judge asked. ""Did any evidence ever come to light that Smartmatic was banned in Texas?""
Cohen also asked whether former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs ever attempted to ascertain proof of this claim. 
Paul Clement, a lawyer representing Fox Corp, responded that those allegations were made during an interview Dobbs conducted with Giuliani, and that Fox News had a right under the U.S. Constitution's protection for press freedom to report on newsworthy claims made by Trump's lawyers.
The judge noted that experts have rejected the conspiracy theory that the election was hacked, adding that even Fox News host Tucker Carlson had blasted Powell for failing to back the theory with evidence.
Cohen asked whether that should have made Fox News reconsider the accuracy of its reporting. Clement said that Fox was merely reporting on newsworthy claims made by Trump's legal teams, not endorsing the theories.
Smartmatic's technology was used in only one jurisdiction in the Nov. 3 election: Los Angeles County, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden.

Fox News, Giuliani and Powell were separately sued in March for defamation by another voting software company https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/dominion-voting-systems-sues-fox-news-16-bln-over-election-claims-ap-2021-03-26, Dominion Voting Systems. Last week, a judge denied a bid by Powell and Giuliani to dismiss the claims against them in that case. A judge has not yet ruled on a request by Fox to dismiss Dominion's claims against the network.
Trump has made false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. (This story corrects to say Lou Dobbs is a former Fox Business host, not a former Fox News host, in paragraph 6)

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning but took a pause as the continuous spread of COVID-19 globally makes concerns over its impact on the economic recovery hard to shake off.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.35% by 9:45 PM ET (1:45 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.24%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.08%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.21%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.15% while the Shenzhen Component slid 2.33%. The country’s intensified regulatory tightening impacted companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. (HK:9988),  Baidu  Inc. (HK:9888) and JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) and caused another tumble in Chinese equities listed in the U.S.
The debate also continues on whether inflation will be temporary and when central banks will begin asset tapering.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its interest rate at0.25% against the forecast raise to 0.5% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The country entered a lockdown after reporting its first COVID-19 community transmission since February 2020.
Investors now await the latest U.S. Federal Reserve minutes, due later in the day.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted that COVID-19 is “still casting a shadow on economic activity” at a town hall meeting on Tuesday, but did not elaborate further on the subject. However, the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium taking place in the following week could offer more clues about the Fed timetable for asset tapering and interest rate hikes.
On the data front, U.S. retail sales entered contraction territory, falling 1.1% month-on-month and core retail sales falling 0.4% month-on-month in July.
For some investors, the pause was a much-needed one after global shares’ 90% advance from 2020’s lows.
“So much growth is priced in and it’s really a question of being able to deliver on that earnings-per-share and whether these multiples are warranted... the big thing I am worried about is whether we are going to have an environment where we see higher prices but not necessarily the growth that people are expecting,” Quadratic Capital Management founder and chief investment officer Nancy Davis told Bloomberg."

(Reuters) - Australia's Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd shares fell more than 4% on Wednesday in the market's first verdict on a merger with BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s petroleum business that will turn it into a global top 10 oil and gas producer.
The deal, announced after the market closed on Tuesday, involves Woodside doubling its share base to acquire BHP's oil and gas arm in a nil-premium merger to create a roughly A$40 billion ($29 billion) company.
Woodside shareholders will own 52% of the merged group, with BHP shareholders owning 48%.
The merger, expected to be completed in mid-2022, will double Woodside's output and market capitalisation. 
Some analysts praised the deal, saying the share price drop reflected worries about a stock overhang as many BHP shareholders who want out of fossil fuels may dump the shares.
""The price of all this funding headroom is a huge share overhang, which ... could leave the better part of A$10 billion of Woodside's stock to change hands,"" CLSA analysts said in a note which maintained an underperform rating on the stock. 
""However, we emphasise Woodside 2.0 will be more attractive fundamentally, and our recommendation could become significantly more positive once the market digests the new deal and the new shares,"" CLSA said.
Others, however, were more negative. 
Fund manager Van Eck Australia questioned the value of the merger and said it may have difficulty winning approval from Woodside shareholders.
""While the merger offers Woodside increased diversification, it is also forcing the company to take on aging oil fields and remediation issues,"" said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments at fund manager Van Eck Australia. 
The shares partly recovered in morning trade to be down 2.1% in a flat broader market. The stock had already fallen 5% since speculation started swirling in July about a potential merger with BHP petroleum involving a huge issue of shares.
Woodside earlier reported a 17% rise in first-half underlying profit on a rebound from last year's pandemic-hit oil prices, but missed broker forecasts and trimmed its annual production outlook.
Woodside's underlying net profit rose to $354 million for the six months to June 30 from $303 million a year earlier. That was well short of broker forecasts around $413 million on Visible Alpha.
The company trimmed the top end of its annual production outlook to 93 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) from 95 mmboe, implying a drop of at least 7% from last year's record output.

Most of the decline is due to falling output at its ageing, mainstay North West Shelf LNG project. Woodside, the operator, will be doubling its stake to one-third of North West Shelf with the BHP merger.

A string of investment bankers not involved in the debacle jumped ship as a result, concerned about the financial and reputational fallout for the bank.
Shah will join Citigroup as Chairman of Global Technology mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in New York, after spending six years at Credit Suisse as head of Financial Sponsors M&A with a focus on the technology sector, said the memo, the contents of which was confirmed by a Citigroup spokesperson.
Deals which Shah has advised on this year include Atotech's $5.1 billion sale to  MKS Instruments  (NASDAQ:MKSI) Inc. and Blue Yonder's $7.1 billion sale to Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp.
Prior to Credit Suisse, Shah worked at  Greenhill  (NYSE:GHL) & Co Inc, as well as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), where he was Head of Global Technology Investment Banking.
Shah will report to Citi's global co-heads of M&A, Cary Kochman and Mark Shafir, and work closely with Philip Drury, who was named head of technology and communications earlier this year.

Banks have been ramping up hiring in M&A groups to capture more market share in a booming dealmaking environment. In its bid to rebuild the senior team, Credit Suisse hired Citigroup’s Aly Alibhai to lead its global media and entertainment group this month. 
Technology is the leading sector for M&A activities globally, accounting for 22% of total volume year to date, Refinitiv data shows.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 07:05PM ET</span>","Wall Street slumps after weak retail sales, Home Depot results","By Lewis Krauskopf, Devik Jain and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes slid on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 logging its biggest one-day percentage fall in about a month, weighed down by a drop in U.S. retail sales that raised concerns about the economic recovery, as well as by disappointing results from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).
Most of the S&P 500's sectors finished lower, with consumer discretionary the weakest performer, falling 2.3%. 
Home Depot shares fell 4.3% after the company's U.S. same-store sales fell short of estimates for the first time in nearly two years as pandemic-fueled do-it-yourself projects tapered off. Shares of rival Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) dropped 5.8%.
A report showed that U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in July, as supply shortages depressed motor vehicle purchases and the boost to spending from the economy's reopening and stimulus checks faded, suggesting a slowdown in growth early in the third quarter.
“The retail sales drop I think clarified for investors that COVID may well be a big problem going into the fall,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Prior to Tuesday's drops, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had closed at record highs for five straight sessions.
“The (market) backdrop remains really solid,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. ""At this point, when you have some of these negative macro indicators coming in and you have markets that are selling at all-time highs with pretty expensive valuations by any measure, there is just going to be more vulnerability to that kind of bad news.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 282.12 points, or 0.79%, to 35,343.28, the S&P 500 lost 31.63 points, or 0.71%, to 4,448.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 137.58 points, or 0.93%, to 14,656.18.
The S&P 500 healthcare sector was a bright spot, ending up 1.1% on the day.
With the market in a period that has seasonally been weak historically, investors have said stocks may be due for a significant drop, with the S&P 500 yet to experience a 5% pullback this year. On Monday, the S&P 500 closed 100% above its March 2020 low. 
Still, market watchers have said that huge amounts of cash held by investors and companies could protect stocks from severe declines, as buyers are quick to look for opportunities to scoop up cheaper shares. Indeed, the indexes ended well above their session lows on Tuesday as stocks partially recovered late in the day.
In an encouraging sign about the economic rebound, a Federal Reserve report showed production at U.S. factories surged in July.
Investors are looking for signs about when the Fed will rein in its easy money policies, with minutes from the central bank's latest meeting due on Wednesday, and are watching the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and its impact on the economy.
In other company news, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc shares ended little changed after the retailer increased its annual U.S. same-store sales forecast after beating analysts' estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.92-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.51-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 318 new lows.
About 9.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 9.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The Boom Overture is expected to fly 65 passengers from New York to London in just over three-and-one-half hours, Newark to Frankfurt in four hours and, eventually, San Francisco to Tokyo in six hours.
""You know our ultimate goal is high speed flight for everybody,"" said Blake Scholl, chief executive and founder of Boom.

(Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Inc forecast stronger annual revenue after beating second-quarter estimates on Tuesday, betting on its online business, drive-thru and new menu items to soften any hit from the COVID-19 Delta variant. 
The doughnut maker's shares rose 2% in extended trading after its first earnings report since returning as a listed company in July. The company also said it plans to raise prices in September to offset higher labor and commodity costs.
Major U.S. restaurants including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have doubled down on their online businesses to cut wait times for delivery and drive-thru, hoping that the lockdown-driven shift to eating at home more is here to stay. 
With the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant driving a resurgence in cases worldwide, using multiple channels for delivery is key, Krispy Kreme Chief Executive Officer Mike Tattersfield told Reuters in a call. 
""You could be closing down your front door but using your drive-thru or using your e-commerce model or using your 'Delivered Fresh Daily' model in the grocery business."" 
The ""Original Glazed"" doughnut maker forecast annual net revenue between $1.34 billion and $1.38 billion, as much as 23% higher than last year and compared with Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.34 billion. 
Across the sector, the easing of coronavirus curbs, reopening of offices and new menu items have allowed chains like Starbucks, McDonald's and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) Co to serve up strong forecasts.
Krispy Kreme has also added new items including doughnuts dipped in  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY)'s chocolate icing to draw in returning customers. 
It expects to pay a cash dividend of 3.5 cents per share for the quarter ending Oct. 3, the company said.

Net revenue rose 42.6% to $349.2 million in the second quarter ended July 4 versus estimates of $333.4 million. 
Excluding items, it earned 13 cents per share, a cent below expectations.

SILAO, Mexico (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) employee Mari says that for the past decade, she has felt powerless to demand higher pay at the plant in central Mexico that cranks out hundreds of thousands of profitable pickup trucks annually.
But on Tuesday and Wednesday, the plant's nearly 6,500 unionized workers are to vote on what Mari and many coworkers see as a historic opportunity to oust their union, which they say protects the company's interests over their own. 
If workers reject the Miguel Trujillo Lopez union, it would open the door for them to bring in new representation.
The vote marks the first major test of labor rules under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a regional trade deal that replaced NAFTA and aims to foster stronger unions and boost wages in Mexico, in part to reduce incentives for U.S. companies to move jobs south of the border.
GM's plant in Silao, Guanajuato, is a linchpin of its North American truck strategy. It produced over 339,000 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-sized pickups in 2019, more than a third of the company's total of 906,000.
After an initial vote in April at the Silao plant was marred by problems, including spoiled ballots, the United States lodged a complaint https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-asks-mexico-review-gm-plant-labor-allegations-test-new-trade-deal-2021-05-12 under the USMCA's ""rapid response mechanism."" 
Mexico agreed to repeat the vote in the presence of independent observers and other safeguards.
""Now, with the new treaty, I think we can improve our work conditions,"" said Mari, 32, who asked not to disclose her full name for fear of reprisals. 
She takes home about 2,300 pesos ($115.63) a week to support her parents and daughter, and sometimes works side jobs to make ends meet.
The Miguel Trujillo Lopez union that administers the GM Silao contract said it was committed to improving worker rights and ensuring a fair vote.
""We have to look after transparency, certainty and safety so that our workers vote freely,"" said Tereso Medina, head of the union, which is part of one of Mexico's largest labor organizations, the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). 
GM said it would be neutral and respectful of the vote's outcome. 
""We are working with both the U.S. and Mexico in support of the shared goal to protect workers' rights,"" the company told Reuters.
If GM does not comply with USMCA's labor enforcement tools, it could face 25% tariffs on its Silao-made pickups.
Esteban Martinez, a labor ministry official overseeing Mexico's implementation of a sweeping labor reform, said GM since April has been more active in ensuring a fair vote, which is required as part of a national effort to eliminate sweetheart contracts between business-friendly unions and companies.
As well as distributing copies of the union contract and 7,000 educational flyers prepared by the Labor Ministry, GM crafted a schedule to let all employees vote during their work hours, allowed observers into the plant and has aimed to make sure managers do not try to sway workers, Martinez said.
""They are putting their executives under the magnifying glass to make sure the non-union managers do not get involved in the process,"" Martinez said. 
CHANGE IN ATTITUDE 
Other companies are taking a cue from GM and ramping up efforts to ensure fair votes without union or company interference, Martinez said, noting ""a change in attitude.""
U.S. congressman Bill Pascrell, a Democrat and union advocate, said GM's response was encouraging. He also warned other companies that they could also face scrutiny if they did not improve their practices. 
""This case is a barometer for how industry can come to respect the rights of labor,"" he said. 
The Miguel Trujillo Lopez union was accused by some workers, activists and experts of deliberately interfering to halt the April vote after realizing it was headed for defeat https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-union-was-losing-scrapped-gm-worker-vote-report-2021-05-13. 
The union has denied intervening, and the labor ministry has not concluded who was responsible for what it described as ""serious irregularities.""
This time, the union will store and count the ballots once the vote concludes Wednesday night under the watch of observers from the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO) and Mexico's National Electoral Institute (INE).
Both groups, along with federal labor officials, have been posted inside the plant in recent weeks to interview workers and collect complaints as part of a remediation plan agreed by Mexico and the United States. 
Several workers said their presence has helped limit pressure from union representatives to vote to keep the contract, although some are still skeptical that the union can be trusted to organize a ballot in which it has a vested interest. 
Workers from both camps have done grassroots campaigning to push for either a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote, ranging from phone calls, social media posts and workers over the weekend driving through residential neighborhoods bordering Silao with a loudspeaker blaring ""Vote 'no' to the CTM contract, so we can defend our dignity as workers."" 
Two others who spoke to Reuters noted indecision among some colleagues who are unsure of what they could gain by voting ""no"" without another union standing by to negotiate a new deal.

But Juan, a father of three with 11 years on the job, said his decision to vote against the union was clear.
""With what we make here, it's not enough,"" he said.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 06:12PM ET</span>",Japan sees peril in U.S. chip hub to counter China,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is worried that U.S. plans to pour billions of dollars into chip manufacturing to fend off China could finish off what's left of a Japanese semiconductor industry that once dominated the world.
After ""three lost decades"", according to Japan's industry ministry, the country's share of global chip manufacturing has fallen from a half to a tenth as it leaked customers to cheaper rivals and failed to maintain a lead in cutting edge production.
As China and the United States, driven by a trade war and security concerns, ramp up support for the manufacturing of chips that run everything from smartphones to missiles, officials worry Japan will be squeezed out altogether. 
""We can't just continue what we have been doing, we have to do something on a completely different level,"" former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told fellow ruling LDP party members in May at a first party meeting to discuss how the country can be a leading digital economy. 
Illustrating Japan's fear of being left out of a new technology world order, documents distributed by the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry earlier this year showed a thick red dotted line over a bar graph pointing to the possibility of a zero chip industry share by 2030.
A major concern is the future of the country's still world-leading firms that supply chipmakers with items such as silicon wafers, chemical films and production machinery.
Officials fear that by luring Asian chip foundry giants such as Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) to its soil, the United States could tempt these firms to follow.
""It's possible for companies to build in Japan and export, but the closer you can be as a supplier the better, it's easier to exchange information,"" said Kazumi Nishikawa, director of the IT industry at METI. 
While the shift may not come immediately, ""it could happen over the long term,"" he said.
The companies Nishikawa worries about include wafer makers Shin-Etsu Chemical and Sumco (OTC:SUOPY) Corp photoresist supplier JSR Corp and production machinery builders Screen Holdings and Tokyo Electron.
""We are always prepared to respond to policy changes in each country,"" said a spokesperson for JSR, which makes light sensitive photoresist coatings used for engraving chips in Japan, Belgium and the United States.
When asked by Reuters, none of the companies said they currently plan to shift production to the United States.
TECH WAR
To retain them, Japan needs chip foundries that will buy their wafers, machinery and chemicals, and will also ensure stable supplies of semiconductors for the country's car companies and electronic device makers.
TSMC, which is looking to expand overseas amid concern about the potential vulnerability of its Taiwan operations to mainland China's territorial ambitions, has established a research and development centre near Tokyo. It is also reviewing a plan to build a fabrication plant in Japan.
However, its biggest foreign venture by far is a $12 billion plant it is constructing in Arizona in the United States. 
In a bid to keep up in the technology race, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government in June approved a strategy devised by Nishikawa's team at METI to ensure Japan has enough chips to compete in technologies that will drive future economic growth, including artificial intelligence, high-speed 5G connectivity and self driving vehicles.
One initiative is to turn Japan into an Asian data centre hub. Such hubs generate huge demand for semiconductors, which in turn will lure chipmakers to build plants nearby. 
SPENDING SUPPORT
The success of its industrial policy, however, will depend on money.
So far the country has allocated 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) to reinforce technology supply chains to help companies grapple with shortages of chips and other components during the coronavirus pandemic, and to promote a shift to 5G. 
That's only a fraction of spending proposed by other countries. 
""At the current level of support, it's tough for Japan's semiconductor industry, and we want government incentives that are comparable with elsewhere in the world,"" The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) said in an email. 
The U.S. Senate has approved a bill authorizing $190 billion of public money for new technology, including $54 billion on chips, while the European Union plans to spend 135 billion euros ($159 billion) on nurturing its own digital economy. 

To equal this spending, Japan would have to earmark large sums of public money that the greying nation might otherwise spend on health and welfare. METI has yet to say how much it believes it needs.
""Given Japan's financial situation it will be difficult to match"" the United States, the EU and China, former economic revitalization minister, Akira Amari and leader of the LDP group looking to ""make Japan number one again,"" told Reuters.

In the short-term, silver's outlook remains murky, however Taylor Dart explains why the metal should still do well in the long-term.It’s been a volatile month thus far for the precious metals sector, with silver (SLV) taking the brunt of the selling pressure. This is quite disappointing in an inflationary environment when many investors are expecting metals prices to provide a hedge and safe haven. Fortunately, silver has recovered from its lows last Sunday; but it’s still down more than 10% year-to-date and down nearly 21% from its February highs. The good news is that we’ve seen minimal damage to the long-term picture, but that is contingent on the bulls playing defense immediately. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
As shown in the chart above, it’s been a volatile week and a half for silver, with the metal plunging more than 8% in a single trading session last Sunday but managing to find support at the critical $22.00/oz level. The price has since recovered, but the negative development is that prior support at $24.75/oz has been broken, and we now have new resistance at $26.35/oz. The two silver linings are that this correction has been so violent that we’ve seen what looks to be possible capitulation from the bull camp, and the monthly chart remains intact. This is evidenced by the fact that bullish sentiment for silver plunged to 12% bulls last week, with the long-term moving average dipping to 30% bulls, its lowest reading in more than two years. A low sentiment reading on this indicator does not guarantee that the bottom is in. Still, typically, we have seen important bottoms formed in this area with similar levels of despondence. So, with this trade having gone from exuberance at the time of the WSB short squeeze attempt to disgust six months later, it’s time to be open-minded about a potential bottom forming.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>","Ackman says SPAC does not need to be registered, pushes back on lawsuit","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman said on Tuesday his blank-check acquisition company is not an investment firm that needs to register with U.S. regulators, pushing back against a lawsuit that alleges that his Pershing Square Tontine Holdings has improperly invested in securities.
""PSTH has never held investment securities that would require it to be registered under the Act, and does not intend to do so in the future,"" Ackman said in a statement, referring to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, longstanding market regulatory laws.
""We believe this litigation is totally without merit,"" Ackman, who runs hedge fund firm Pershing Square Capital Management, added.
The lawsuit contends that Ackman's special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) - the largest ever formed - has acted like an investment company rather than a SPAC that is exempt from the registration requirement. 
""The SPAC is a natural extension of Pershing Square’s investment fund management business. Pershing Square operates the SPAC like an investment fund and causes it to invest in securities like an investment fund. Today’s lawsuit argues that it should be regulated like an investment fund as well,"" said John Morley, a professor at Yale Law School who is one of a handful of lawyers working on the case.
The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in U.S. federal court in New York by George Assad, an investor in the SPAC, states: ""Investing in securities is basically the only thing that PSTH has ever done."" 
SPACs are meant to merge with private companies and then take them public.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a closer look at potential abuses within blank-check companies as these vehicles have become extremely popular. SPACs launched by Wall Street financiers as well as celebrities have raised more than $100 billion.
Ackman's SPAC initially announced a plan that his SPAC would buy 10% of Universal Music Group at a time when it already was being taken public by Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY). Ackman scrapped the plan in July, saying that his hedge funds would now be making the investment amid growing concerns among regulators that the deal would not meet New York Stock Exchange rules. 
He initially planned for his SPAC to distribute the Universal Music Group shares to its investors after its listing in Amsterdam next month.
The lawsuit will position Ackman against Robert Jackson, a law professor and former SEC Commissioner who will be arguing the case along with Morley. The two have long focused their scholarly research on investor protection and are working on the case together with law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, among others. 

The lawsuit also takes issue with fees which should be clear to outsiders. ""The Defendants have received securities that under any plausible estimate are worth hundreds of millions of dollars — an unreasonable payment for the work performed,"" the suit said.
Ackman said that his SPAC like all others has owned U.S. Treasuries and money market funds.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a five-day winning streak on Tuesday, led by a drop in consumer discretionary stocks following weaker quarterly results from  Home Depot  and worries about the consumer amid data showing retail sales slipped to a two-month low.
The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.8%, or 282 points, the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.9%.
Retail sales dropped 1.1% in July, more than the 0.3% decline expected, paced by a fall in spending on autos, building materials, and nonstore retailers.

Still, the Fed is likely to take a cautious  approach rather than an aggressive approach to reducing its monthly bond purchases.   
""If Powell does commit to a time on tapering at Jackson Hole, he could signal the end of the year or very beginning of next,"" Williams said. ""I think it's going to be very slow, very deliberate, and will be very market driven; if the market has a taper tantrum, I think they'll slow down."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major stock indexes slid and oil posted its fourth straight day of declines as investors grappled with mixed economic data and considered the economic impact of the ongoing spread of the Delta coronavirus variant.
Wall Street closed down sharply on Tuesday, with the most significant declines seen in mega-cap technology-related and consumer discretionary stocks as investors scaled down their risk appetite.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.79%, snapping a five-day winning streak. The S&P 500 lost 0.71% after posting a new record high on Monday, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.77%.
The prospect of diminished travel demand or new pandemic lockdowns weighed on oil, exacerbated by a belief in OPEC and among its allies that the market does not need more supply.
Brent crude ended the session down 48 cents, or 0.7%, at $69.03 per barrel, while U.S. West Intermediate crude (WTI) settled down 70 cents, or 1% lower at $66.59 a barrel.
Markets opened Tuesday morning on a pessimistic note after the Commerce Department reported U.S. retail sales fell 1.1% in July, well below economist expectations. However, that picture was made murkier by separate data that showed output at U.S. factories surged in July.
Those numbers cast new doubt on whether the United States will get a grip on the pandemic to get the world's largest economy back on track, particularly as cases rise globally with the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
""It is possible that rising COVID cases are beginning to dent consumer sentiment, but the fact that restaurant spending increased during the month suggests that such concerns are modest. Retail sales are not adjusted for inflation, and it may be that recent price growth is starting to affect sales volume,"" said Curt Long, chief economist and vice president at the National Association of Federal Credit Unions.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday it remained unclear whether the Delta spread will have a noticeable impact on the economy, adding that many companies have been able to adapt.
Beyond COVID concerns, political turmoil in Afghanistan added to safe-haven demand, boosting the U.S. dollar to its second straight day of gains. The U.S. dollar index rose 0.55% to 93.130.
U.S. Treasury yields were largely unchanged in choppy trading on Tuesday, as investors sorted through a muddy economic picture. Benchmark 10-year note yields were last at 1.258%, little changed on the day, after earlier falling as low as 1.217%. 
Going forward, the U.S. Federal Reserve will give investors fresh fodder to consider on Wednesday when it releases minutes from its July policy-setting meeting. Markets will be looking for indications of how quickly the Fed will move to step back its unprecedented stimulus as it eyes job gains and inflation.

Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Monday the Fed could begin reducing monthly asset purchases in September if it sees one more strong jobs report.
Gold prices eased on Tuesday after several days of gains, with spot gold dropping 0.14% to $1,784.75 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% lower at $1,787.80 per ounce.

Investing.com -- Stocks tumbled on Tuesday after several days of record highs, pushed lower after disappointing retail sales numbers raised concerns the fast-spreading Delta variant of Covid-19 had the potential to reverse consumer behavior.
Retail sales slipped to a two-month low, falling more than expected in July, while weaker quarterly results from the home improvement chain  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) didn’t help.
Consumers spent less on autos, building materials, and nonstore retailers last month after a surge in spending during the prior months spurred by stimulus checks.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - An Indian arbitrator has issued an order asking Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co to pay its factory workers additional wages, despite warnings from the automaker that a higher payout could make its business ""unviable in the long run"".
Nissan and its union have been locked in an industrial arbitration dispute since July after the two sides failed to reach a mutual agreement over several issues including higher wages. A previous wage agreement expired in March 2019.
A tribunal has ordered Renault-Nissan to pay its 3,542 workers an average of over 7,100 rupees ($96) a month in backdated dues as interim relief, according to an Aug. 16 order seen by Reuters.
The payments, higher than the consortium's initial offer of $30 a month but lower than the union's demand of $270, would cost Renault-Nissan about $9.53 million in total. 
The arbitrator will continue to hear over 50 other demands by the workers over the coming days, which if agreed to could together cost the company 93% more per worker, Nissan said.
The petitions filed by the unions and the management - which have been reviewed by Reuters and previously not reported - expose the widespread disagreements between the workers and Renault-Nissan.
Nissan said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday it was committed to offering a competitive package to its workers, and was open to a retrospective payment at its southern India plant, it said.
The ongoing legal tussle exposes the business challenges Nissan faces in the world's fifth-largest car market where, despite investing about $1 billion, it has been elbowed out by competitors and is struggling to woo car buyers.
The ruling comes despite arguments by Renault-Nissan that it is making ""huge losses"" in India and has ""no financial capacity"" to meet the demands. 
Any pressure to pay higher wages ""could potentially make the very sustenance of the unit unviable in the long run"", the carmaker had said in its 147-page filing to the arbitrator in July.
LEGAL HURDLE
The workers had sought a wage increase arguing in their 123-page petition that total wages paid by Renault-Nissan are less than half of what peers in the region such as Hyundai Motor and Ford pay. 
Wages at global automakers in India's Detroit https://tmsnrt.rs/2W0RvMe 
In the Aug. 16 order, the arbitrator ordered Renault-Nissan to pay $134 per month for the 12 months ending March 2020, and $67 rupees a month for the 16 months ending July 2021 in three monthly instalments starting in September. 
""I strongly believe and conclude that there is a case for granting interim relief to the workmen,"" P Jyothimani, the arbitrator, said in his order.
Nissan has been trying to restructure some of its key international markets such as India - where it is yet to decide on a future strategy for its under-utilised factory.
The workers' demands include higher basic pay, an annual increment of 500 rupees, hike in allowances and insurance cover, and appointing an additional member in assembly lines to cover for workers taking restroom breaks.
""The demands made on the worker for sacrifice for the viability of the company is much more than the sacrifice made by the supervisory and managerial personnel and the directors,"" the union said in the filing.

Renault-Nissan, however, said that local competition, migration of management-level talent to other companies, an increase in raw material costs and poor response to some of its car models has hurt business.

The company also argued that its workers' wages cannot be compared to Hyundai and Ford because they had set up factories in the state much earlier, have higher production levels and better plant utilisation.
""The demand of the union was only a desire to have an increment without considering the business reality, market salary range and affordability,"" Renault-Nissan said in its filing.

(UAA) in Baltimore, Md., are two major companies in the athletic apparel space. NKE designs and markets athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories for men, women, and children, and sells its products to retail stores worldwide through its own stores, subsidiaries, and distributors. UAA develops, markets, and distributes branded performance apparel, footwear, and accessories made from synthetic microfibers for men, women, and youth worldwide, and sells its products through its wholesale and direct to consumer channels that include brand and factory house stores and e-commerce websites.
Pandemic-driven heightened health awareness has motivated people to workout at home, join gyms and yoga centers, go cycling, or play sports. This has caused a surge in demand for sports apparel and accessories. While the resurgence of COVID-19 cases is leading to the re-imposition of restrictions, solid progress on the vaccination front led to rising outdoor fitness activities this year. The expected continuation of this trend should keep increasing the demand for fitness apparel. The global sports apparel market is expected to grow at a 4.8% CAGR to $267.58 billion by 2028. So, both NKE and UAA should benefit from the industry tailwinds.

(Reuters) - A member of the Sackler family that owns Purdue Pharma testified on Tuesday that his family bears a “moral responsibility” to help abate the U.S. opioid crisis but said it will not contribute financially to the effort unless it receives broad legal protections.
The OxyContin maker last week kicked off its long-awaited bankruptcy trial https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-trial-begins-with-opponents-eyeing-sackler-shields-2021-08-11 over its plan https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/dgkplrrnypb/126021698131-rep-1407114041.pdf to resolve thousands of claims accusing it and the Sackler family of fueling the U.S. opioid crisis.
Purdue and its Sackler family owners have denied wrongdoing in connection with the lawsuits.
More than 500,000 Americans have died since 1999 from opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
David Sackler, a former Purdue director, made his statement during the virtual trial in a White Plains, New York, bankruptcy court over a $10 billion settlement that aims to resolve the lawsuits over deceptive marketing.
Sackler said Purdue’s products have helped millions of people. But he acknowledged that they had contributed to the opioid crisis and said his family bears “a moral responsibility to help, and that’s what this settlement is designed to do.” 
The deal is supported by a wide range of states, municipalities, hospitals and others, but faces opposition from nine states and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog, the U.S. Trustee.
The settlement includes releases protecting the Sackler family members that own Purdue against future opioid-related litigation in exchange for a $4.5 billion contribution to a trust that would distribute funds to opioid abatement programs. Opponents of the deal say the releases are too broad.
In response to questioning from U.S. Trustee attorney Benjamin Higgins on Tuesday, Sackler said his family would not be willing to contribute money ""in this fashion"" toward opioid abatement if the bankruptcy court rejects the releases.
Sackler also said his family had not considered an amount of money it would pay in exchange for narrower releases.

The trial is expected to last several more days. Sackler is the only member of the family so far to testify.

(Reuters) - North American timber producers are expected to see a dip in current-quarter profit after lumber demand for do-it-yourself home projects decreased following the easing of most restrictions that kept people in their houses. 
Lofty lumber prices, the sustained needs of home builders and industrious homeowners during the pandemic pushed their second-quarter profit to record levels. But the DIY market, which accounts for 20% of lumber sales, is leveling.
Canada's West Fraser Timber Co (NYSE:WFG) Ltd, Canfor (TSX:CFP) Corp and Interfor Corp are projected to report combined earnings of about $803 million in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv estimates, about a third of what they posted in the second quarter. 
However, lumber supply is expected to tick up as saw mill owners take advantage of recent bumper profits to build more mills and add workers, which will help ease a protracted labor shortage.

""Revival in supply and weak demand from renovations and the repair sector will put a lid on prices,"" said Samuel Burman, commodities economist at Capital Economics. 
Burman expects lumber prices to hover around $500 to $600 per thousand board feet for the rest of this year, with supply set to rise around 6% in 2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Lumber futures touched a record high of $1,711 per thousand board feet in May. However, futures contract for lumber with delivery in November traded at just $483 per thousand board feet.

In July, U.S.-based  Weyerhaeuser  (NYSE:WY) Co said it expects third-quarter earnings to be ""significantly"" lower than the second. Canfor, which breezed past market expectations in the second quarter, hinted at future demand challenges in late July. 
""The second quarter was probably the greatest quarter in the history for the lumber producers ... they never made money like they did in the second quarter and they probably won't make money like that again in the near future,"" said Mark Wilde, analyst with BMO Capital Markets.

The windfall from high lumber prices, however, encouraged Canfor and smaller rivals like privately held Tolko and Roseburg Forest Products to open new saw mills. 
""The new supply will weigh on pricing,"" said George Staphos at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (BofA) research, adding that some new equipment and capacity installations could go into 2022 and beyond.

ARENDAL, Norway (Reuters) - Nicolai Tangen broke new ground as the head of Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund on Tuesday by preaching on the virtues of sustainable capitalism in a church.
""Capitalism is undergoing an incredible transformation, at the fastest pace I have seen in my life,"" Tangen told around 170 people gathered at the 19th century neo-Gothic Trinity Church in Arendal, southern Norway. 
""Shareholders have more influence than ever before on how to run companies, annual general meetings see many more debates especially on executive pay, and climate change is discussed with more and more companies,"" said the former hedge fund manager, who became the fund's CEO a year ago. 
The fund pools the state's oil revenues and invests them abroad. It has an ethical mandate and does not invest in firms deemed unethical, such as tobacco producers.
The Church of Norway, which is Lutheran and the majority religion in the country, had invited Tangen to discuss the purpose of the fund at home and abroad.
""Capitalism has survived wars, crises and ideologies such as communism. It will survive but it will have a different face,"" Tangen said, the first time a Norwegian wealth fund CEO has spoken publicly in a place of worship.
Since Tangen took the helm, the fund has pushed for more women to be named to the boards of the companies it invests in and has said it would now be more willing to drop companies that are not deemed ethical or sustainable.

""The fund must help build a more sustainable and more just society, not just for Norway, but for the whole world,"" Olav Fykse Tveit, the presiding bishop of the Bishops' Conference of the Church of Norway, told Reuters.
Still, Tangen said, the fund would stick to its main purpose: ""The number one priority is to make money.""

(Reuters) -Home Depot Inc on Tuesday fell short of U.S. same-store sales estimates for the first time in nearly two years as pandemic-fueled do-it-yourself projects tapered off, sending shares of the retailer down as much as 5.5% 
Home-improvement chains had a blockbuster 2020 as revenue and profit surged from stuck-at-home Americans splurging on paint, tools, and gardening equipment to upgrade their living spaces through DIY projects. A strong housing market and fresh government stimulus floated earlier this year also helped lift consumer demand.
The steady rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, however, prompted more Americans to return to outdoor activities and abandon some pandemic-induced shopping habits. 
U.S. same-store sales at  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) climbed 3.4% in the second quarter - the smallest increase in two years, and missed analysts' estimates of a 4.9% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Underscoring the slowdown was data on Tuesday that showed a bigger-than-expected drop in July retail sales, partly reflecting the rotation of spending from goods to services such as travel and entertainment. 
Home Depot Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told Reuters that sales in the first two weeks of August were comparable with the second quarter, but any potential impact from the fast-spreading Delta coronavirus variant is still uncertain.
""We don't see anything that we would point to and say that's the impact of Delta, not yet,"" he said, as the company did not provide a full-year outlook. 
The slowdown in Home Depot's sales also lowers expectations for smaller rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc, which is even more dependent on DIY consumers than Home Depot, J.P. Morgan analysts said. 

Lowe's will report its quarterly numbers on Wednesday.
Home Depot's quarterly second-quarter net sales rose 8.1% to $41.12 billion. The home-improvement retailer earned $4.53 on a per-share basis, beating estimates of $4.44 per share.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>","The Andersons to pay debt, invest in core units after rail business sale","By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grain handler  The Andersons  (NASDAQ:ANDE) plans to use $550 million from the sale of its rail leasing business to pay down debt and invest in sustainable farming and low carbon initiatives in its core grain and fertilizer units, Chief Executive Pat Bowe told Reuters on Tuesday.
Maumee, Ohio-based Andersons sold its rail leasing business this week to American Industrial Transport Inc. It also aims to sell its railcar repair business within the next year, Bowe said.
The divestments represent a shift in focus at the 74-year-old company, which was looking to expand its rail business as recently as five years ago as grain trading profits slumped.
Grain trading profits have since rebounded as agribusinesses capitalized on supply chain disruptions during the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus pandemic. The Andersons' larger rivals, including Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) and Cargill, have seen earnings surge this year.
""We're committed to the ag side of our business. ... We feel we can make higher returns for our shareholders in those spaces than we were in rail,"" Bowe said in an interview with Reuters.
The company will pay down debt, which swelled with its 2018 acquisition of U.S. grain handler Lansing Trade Group.
""We want to get to our normalized 2.5-times debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We were on our way to achieve that. Now we'll achieve it sooner,"" Bowe said.
The Andersons is also eyeing investments to grow its renewable fuels and specialty food businesses and to capitalize on growing trends such as sustainable farming, agricultural carbon trading and plant-based protein, he said.
""We're not going to buy a beef slaughter facility or a soybean crush plant. ... It's about everything in the middle.""
Initial moves include supplying more agricultural oils to renewable diesel producers, including The Andersons' ethanol venture partner Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), Bowe said.
Other investments will focus on organic fertilizers and plant nutrient products that help crops sequester more carbon in soils, he said.

1588,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 12:31PM ET</span>","Forget Advanced Micro Devices, Buy These 4 Semiconductor Stocks Instead","Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to see declining output in the coming months owing to a lack of company-owned semiconductor fabs. Further, the stock looks overvalued compared to its peers. So, we think it could be wise to instead bet on semiconductor stocks Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), STMicroelectronics (STM), Amkor (NASDAQ:AMKR), and Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD) because of their greater ability to capitalize on the industry’s tailwinds and deliver better returns. Let’s discuss.Since 2014, president and chief executive officer Lisa Su’s leadership has helped popular chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) make a strong comeback, and its stock has gained almost 1500% over the past five years. Product innovations have made AMD a solid rival to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market. AMD chips, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), are run on  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation and Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox gaming consoles.
But because geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China and the reimposition of COVID-19 restrictions could significantly affect TSM’s production, AMD could suffer from its dependence on TSM. In addition, AMD’s overvaluation is expected to turn off investors amid the current market volatility. AMD’s 8.60x forward Price/Sales is 120% higher than the 3.91x industry average. AMD closed yesterday’s session at $107.48, which is 12.3% lower than its 52-week high.
While the global chip shortage puts pressure on semiconductor companies worldwide, strong demand from various industries and increasing government and private investments worldwide should drive growth for some of the leading companies in the space. Consequently, we believe Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM),  Amkor Technology , Inc. (AMKR), and Diodes Incorporated (DIOD) are well-positioned to outperform the broader market in the near term based on their latest developments and solid quarterly financials. So, we think these stocks are better investments than AMD now.

Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on momentum stocks Philip Morris (PM), Nippon Steel (NPSCY), Voestalpine AG (VLPNY), and Aperam (APEMY (OTC:APEMY)). We think they are well-positioned to maintain their momentum. So, let’s evaluate these names more closely.The COVID-19 Delta variant is spreading rapidly in several countries. According to the National Institute of Health director, the United States could soon witness more than 200,000 new COVID cases every day. Furthermore, the Senate’s recent approval of a $3.5 trillion budget plan framework amid rising consumer prices has raised concerns about the plan's potential to exacerbate inflation.
Market volatility is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as COVID-19 continues to ravage the country and prompt new distancing restrictions, fueling skepticism among investors about the economic recovery. In addition, geopolitical tensions caused by the collapse of the Afghan government could contribute to the market volatility. However, investors could dodge much market volatility by investing in stocks that have already gained momentum and have the potential to maintain it irrespective of market movements. Investors’ confidence in momentum stocks is evident in the Invesco DWA Momentum ETF’s (PDP) 9.3% returns over the past three months.
Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Nippon Steel Corporation (NPSCY), Voestalpine AG (VLPNY), and Aperam S.A (APEMY) have gained robust momentum that they are well-positioned to maintain in the coming months. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. airlines carried 66.4 million passengers in June, three times the June 2020 volume but still down 21% from pre-pandemic levels, the U.S. Transportation Department said Tuesday.
The largest 21 U.S. airlines that handle more than 90% of all U.S. traffic carried 9.2 million more passengers in June than the 57.2 million passengers transported in May. The department said June domestic passengers were down 17% while international passengers were down 45%.
The Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday that for the seven days ending Monday airline passengers screened were down 22% over the same period in 2019.
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, says U.S. airlines are operating 17% fewer domestic flights over 2019 levels and 35% fewer international flights. As a result, the group says current average domestic load factors -- 89% -- are identical to prepandemic levels.

The Biden administration has not lifted travel restrictions that bar much of the world from entering the United States, including most non-U.S citizens who have been in China, India, Iran, South Africa, Brazil, the United Kingdom and much of Europe within the last 14 days.

Investing.com – Stocks of airlines companies traded lower Tuesday as the latest data from the U.S. Transportation Department showed that passenger traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta (NYSE:DAL) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) all fell 2.5% to 3%.  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) dipped 0.5% after its CEO said a rash of cancellations from July 30 to August 9 are expected to lead to $80 million to $100 million of lost revenue during the third quarter.
Aviation was among the last sectors to be reopened as the pandemic eased. But just as airlines were welcoming back travelers, the delta variant struck and led to a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections. As a result, many people cancelled their travel plans.
What has made life more difficult for airlines is that passengers are cancelling close to the date of travel which shortens their window for re-sale of those tickets.
According to a Reuters report, U.S. airlines carried 66.4 million passengers in the month, three times the June 2020 volume but still down 21% over pre-pandemic levels.

But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY) invests in various types of agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency residential mortgage assets, and residential mortgage loans. In comparison,  Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc . (NYSE:GPMT) is an internally managed real estate finance company. It originates, invests in, and manages senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments in the United States.
With key interest rates held at near zero, income investors' interest in mortgage REITs has been growing because they distribute most of their profits as dividends. Furthermore, mortgage REITs are expected to be even more in focus because U.S. Treasury yields fell yesterday, following poor consumer sentiment. According to a CNBC report, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2 in its preliminary August reading, its lowest level since 2011. As a result, NLY and GPMT could witness increased investor attention in the near term.
NLY has gained 14.5% over the past year, while GPMT has returned 78.8%. Also, GPMT’s 50.3% gains over the past nine months are significantly higher than NLY’s 11.2% returns. And, in terms of their past six months’ performance, GPMT is the clear winner with 25.1% gains versus NLY’s 0.6% returns.

Investing.com –  Moderna  stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) rose 5% Tuesday as the U.K. regulator approved its Covid-19 shot for being given to children aged 12 to 17.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency also announced a name change of the vaccine to Spikevax from Moderna, similar to the identification followed in Europe. 
On August 12, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration amended the emergency use authorization for Moderna’s mRNA vaccine to allow an additional dose to be given to certain immunocompromised individuals. The shots can be given to individuals 18 years of age and older. The EU and the U.K. are yet to take a call on booster doses for any age group.
The FDA is yet to decide on allowing the first two doses to be given to those younger than 18.
While  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) on Monday submitted to the FDA their application for authorization to their booster dose against Covid, Moderna is likely to do so next month.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>","China steps up tech scrutiny with rules over unfair competition, critical data","By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China moved on Tuesday to tighten control of its technology sector, publishing detailed rules aimed at tackling unfair competition and companies' handling of critical data.
Beijing has been firming its grip on internet platforms in recent months, citing the risk of abusing market power to stifle competition, misuse of consumers' information and violation of consumer rights, in a reversal after years of a more laissez-faire approach.
The country issued hefty fines to companies including e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and social media company Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) as part of a widening crackdown and has vowed to draft new laws around technology innovation and monopolies.
On Tuesday, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) issued a set of draft regulations banning unfair competition and restricting the use of user data. 
New York-listed shares of Alibaba , JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) fell between 2.9% and 3.5% in premarket trading. Tencent-backed online brokerage  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU) slid 7% and was among the most actively traded stocks across U.S. exchanges, while peer UP Fintech Holding slipped 3%.
 Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) shed 3.8% and was set to extend losses for a sixth straight session despite reporting better-than-expected earnings.
""The proposed regulations' specificity evidences a clear set of priorities in setting the 'rules of engagement' for online competition,"" said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina. 
""If promulgated, the regulations will likely increase compliance burdens for transaction platforms, including e-commerce marketplaces and shoppable short video apps.""
NO HIJACKING OF TRAFFIC
Internet operators ""must not implement or assist in the implementation of unfair competition on the Internet, disrupt the order of market competition, affect fair transactions in the market,"" the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) wrote in the draft, which is open to public feedback before a Sept. 15 deadline. 
Specifically, the regulator stated, business operators should not use data or algorithms to hijack traffic or influence users' choices. They may also not use technical means to illegally capture or use other business operators’ data.
Companies would also be barred from fabricating or spreading misleading information to damage the reputation of competitors and need to stop marketing practices like fake reviews and coupons or ""red envelopes"" - cash incentives - used to entice positive ratings.
Soon after the draft tech rules were published, China's cabinet announced it would also implement regulations on protecting critical information infrastructure operators from Sept. 1.

The State Council said operators must conduct security inspections and risk assessments once a year, and should give priority to purchasing ""secure and credible network products and services,"" marking an elaboration on the landmark Cybersecurity Law that passed in 2017.
The Chinese government has also taken ownership stakes in the domestic entities of social media giants ByteDance and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Reuters reported on Tuesday citing corporate filings. Shares of China's Twitter-like Weibo dropped 2.6%.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 index will lose its second largest company by market capitalisation if shareholders back plans by global resource giant BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) to end its dual listing structure and make Australia its primary stock market.
BHP has previously come under pressure from some shareholders, notably activist investor Elliott Advisors, to simplify its structure, but had said any gains would be less than the cost of change.
Now the discount of London-listed stocks is at its deepest in more than three decades, BHP, which on Tuesday reported its best annual profit in nearly a decade, said it planned to get rid of its London listing.
Shareholders are expected to vote on the unification at meetings in the first half of 2022.
If the plan gets board and shareholder approval, the London Stock Exchange will lose a major player. BHP has 128 billion pounds ($176.22 billion) in market cap, second only to AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) with around 131 billion pounds, Refinitiv data shows. 
BHP is the biggest company by market capitalisation on the Australian stock exchange.
The value of British stocks versus global peers has been depressed by the combined impact of Britain's departure from the European Union, a weak pound and a lack of tech stocks, which have been the big beneficiaries of the disruption caused by the pandemic.
London-listed shares are trading at 12.6 times forward earnings, that compares to 17.3 times for the Australian benchmark. 
Following news of the plan to end the London listing, BHP's London shares rose 6% by 1352 GMT, outperforming the wider market. 
Jamie Maddock, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said BHP's departure is bad news for UK-focused investors as country index trackers would be forced to sell their shares. The move would also reduce significantly London's exposure to the mining sector.
David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital in London said the London stock market would still be attractive and noted it has attracted a surge of initial public offerings this year. 
""The London Stock Exchange’s deep liquidity pool will ensure it remains popular for listings"", he said.

Last year, consumer brands company Unilever (NYSE:UL), which like BHP had a dual-listing, merged its Dutch and British corporate entities and Unilever NV's Amsterdam-listed shares ceased trading.

Because Wall Street remains bullish, we think fundamentally sound DJIA stocks Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Amgen (AMGN) could soar in price. Let’s discuss.Despite the growing anxiety over the surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide and the geopolitical tensions related to the collapse of the Afghan government, the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a new record close on August 16. Buoyed by a solid set of corporate earnings results, the blue-chip index also closed at a record high last week.
Declining demand for crude oil and lagging economic recovery in China have raised investor concerns about the potentially dampening effect on business activities and global growth. However, some Wall Street analysts remain optimistic because the U.S. stock market indices have recovered quickly from the pandemic-induced recession. According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), “We remain bullish on stocks (particularly cyclicals/value) thanks to a strong earnings season, signs of receding risk from the Delta variant, and normalization of bond-equity correlation.”
Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) and  Amgen Inc . (NASDAQ:AMGN) are two fundamentally stable Dow Jones stocks with considerable growth potential. Given the positive market sentiment, growing market share, and solid business models, we think these two stocks should soar.

Because discretionary consumer spending remains strong, Wall Street analysts predict restaurant stocks The ONE Group Hospitality (NASDAQ:STKS), Del Taco Restaurants (NASDAQ:TACO), and Carrols Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:TAST) will gain more than 50% in price in the near term. So, let’s discuss these names.COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States have risen significantly over the past few weeks as even hesitant people have now begun rushing to receive their vaccines amid the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. Daily average doses administered rose 31% in the last week of July to 390,000 per day. Furthermore, the CDC issued recommendations to approve vaccine booster shots for vulnerable people on August 13.
With approximately 70% of the U.S. adult population at least partly inoculated to date, the restaurant industry is expected to remain operational despite the surging COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, strong consumer discretionary spending and pent-up demand should allow restaurants to maintain their current operational levels.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts expect the prices of popular restaurant stocks The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. (STKS), Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (TACO), and Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (TAST) to rally by more than 50%.

Investing.com –  Spirit Airlines  stock (NYSE:SAVE) recovered its premarket losses and traded 1.4% higher Tuesday as traders gave more weight to the CEO’s statement that the recent disruption to its regular operations isn’t systemic and was a one-off driven by several adversarial factors coming together.
Between July 30 and August 9, the ultra-low-cost carrier had to cancel as many as 2,826 flights due to a series of overlapping challenges. These primarily included adverse weather and airport staffing shortages.
The company incurred additional expenses to accommodate the passengers whose travel plans were affected. In cases, it had to purchase tickets on other airlines and cover hotel and other travel-related costs. Additional labor expenses, including overtime, also contributed to the problems.
To tackle the challenges, the airline has cancelled several flights in the ongoing quarter. It is also facing cancellations by guests, many of whom are doing so close to the date of their travel, making life more difficult for the airline.
Canceled bookings by customers, along with the company’s own tactical cancellations, are expected to drive an additional $80 million to $100 million of lost revenue during the third quarter.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, is branching out into selling renewable energy to households, starting with home market Sweden in September. 
Ingka Group, the owner of most IKEA stores worldwide, said households would be able to buy affordable renewable electricity from solar and wind parks, and track their usage through an app.
Ingka's partner Svea Solar, which produces solar panels for IKEA, will buy the electricity on the Nordic power exchange Nord Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) and resell it without surcharge. Households will pay a fixed monthly fee plus a variable rate.
IKEA, which also sells solar panels for households in 11 markets, said those buyers would be able to track their own production in the app and sell back surplus electricity.
Jonas Carlehed, head of sustainability at IKEA Sweden, told Reuters he hoped to roll out the new renewable energy offer as well as IKEA's solar panel offering to all markets. 
""We want to make electricity from sustainable sources more accessible and affordable for all,"" the company said in a statement. 
""IKEA wants to build the biggest renewable energy movement together with co-workers, customers and partners around the world, to help tackle climate change together.""
Ingka said the plan was to offer electricity from solar and wind parks five years old or less, as a way to encourage the building of more parks. 
More broadly IKEA aims to be ""climate positive"" - reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than is eitted by the entire IKEA value chain, from raw material production to customers' disposal of their furniture - by 2030.

Carlehed said in an interview he saw the renewable energy offer to customers as contributing to reaching that target as well as being a potential new revenue stream. 
""It will contribute indirectly (to the target). The link is that our customers' use of our products account for around 20% of IKEA's total climate footprint - from appliances, lighting and electronics such as speakers and so on.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are failing to deliver on promises to hire, retain and promote more Black executives as prejudice and a reluctance to change stymie leaders' good intentions, a former HSBC banker who resigned this month over the problems said.
Ian Clarke, a mid-level manager, left HSBC on Aug. 3 citing frustration at the speed and scale of its response to a report he wrote alleging racism inside the bank.
It comes at a time when banks worldwide say they are trying to implement pledges to improve diversity, after the murder of George Floyd in police custody in the United States in May 2020 sparked global protests over racial injustice.
Europe's biggest bank said in July 2020 it aimed to double the number of Black staff in senior roles by 2025, and CEO Noel Quinn told Reuters two weeks ago the lender ""saw no need to restate"" that target.
In his first interview since leaving, Clarke, 36, said he believed the bank was unlikely to achieve that goal under its current direction and that the problem runs throughout the industry.
""I think that the number of Black people within the bank has severely reduced,"" Clarke said.
""In October 2020 when the new strategy was announced numbers that I uncovered suggested that we had just 90 Black leaders in our firm of 226,000, globally...and currently I'd estimate it's around 60 remaining.""
Clarke's 48-page report, based on interviews with around 100 HSBC colleagues, said the bank had fewer than five Black, Indigenous or People of Colour (BIPOC) in senior leadership roles in 63 of its 65 markets, with the United States and Britain the only exceptions.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the number of Black leaders at the bank.
HSBC did not address the specifics of Clarke's assertions, but a spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to improving diversity and inclusion at HSBC, and whilst we are making progress, we know we have more work to do.
""To achieve our commitments, we are strengthening our recruitment processes, partnering with specialist search firms, and enhancing talent development opportunities.""
In HSBC's UK workforce, 2.4% of staff have self-identified as Black, but among senior leaders this falls to 0.9%, as of January 2021. The bank said it did not have updated data.
Most other major investment banks in Britain say they are unable to disclose data on the ethnic diversity of their UK workforces, making it hard to assess the industry's progress on pledges to increase the number of Black employees. 
PACE OF CHANGE
Born to a white mother and Jamaican father in London, Clarke said he was drawn to banking because of the opportunity it offered for people without privilege to succeed, enrolling in HSBC's management training scheme in 2007.
He rose through the ranks, eventually joining the sales team in the lender's Global Liquidity and Cash Management unit in New York.
Clarke wrote a report - on his own initiative - entitled Project Speak Up on the state of diversity within HSBC, sending it to senior managers in June.
""George Floyd was a real awakening for me and it was for many people, and it made me re-evaluate my career in the bank and all of the things that had happened that at the time I dismissed as maybe just overwork or an ego, and now quite clearly joining the dots that was racism,"" he said.
He said that while he had welcomed the bank's initial response to his report, he became disillusioned by the pace of change.
Of the 11 Black and minority people in his sales team, nine have left HSBC in the last three years and none have joined to replace them, he said.
HSBC did not comment on this.

Clarke said he felt HSBC, in common with other banks, had good intentions to address the issues he raised, but struggled from group-think and a lack of understanding among senior white leaders about the experience of prejudice.
""If you're leaving it to people that don't understand these concepts to try and execute a strategy to fix them, I cannot see how that is anything more than performative allyship,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened markedly lower on Tuesday after a weak report for July retail sales cast fresh doubt on the momentum of an economy under increasing pressure from the latest wave of the pandemic. 
Retail sales fell 1.1% in July, while core retail sales fell 0.4%, both figures undershooting expectations. The damage to sentiment was only partly offset by industrial production rising slightly more than expected in the month. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 271 points or 0.8% at 35,354 points, retreating from the all-time high close it posted on Monday. The S&P 500 followed suit, falling 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite underperformed with a 0.8% drop, amid fresh falls in some big Chinese Internet stocks after Beijing regulators unveiled tough new draft rules aimed at restricting their market power.
""The resurgence in Covid and anxiety over inflation’s impact on spending power has certainly hurt sentiment, but the re-opening, a rebalancing of priorities from goods to services and rising household incomes still means broader spending can continue to grow,"" said ING chief international economist James Knightley in a note to clients. He noted that the number was ""not a disaster"", given that the actual decline in sales was concentrated in autos, and that most of the rest was accounted for by spending shifting into services, outside the scope of the report. 
Knightley noted that retail sales account for only 40% to 45% of total consumer spending and are still 17% above pre-pandemic levels. 
That was small comfort to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock, both of which fell after quarterly updates that showed a sharp slowdown in sales growth at the retailers.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock continued to give up ground after national traffic safety regulators launched an investigation into its Autopilot software on Monday. The stock fell 2.1%, also hurt by news that the hedge fund of Michael Burry, made famous by 'The Big Short"" had shorted both it and the ARK Innovation ETF run by tech investor Cathie Wood. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock also fell 2.5% after Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa)'s 13F revealed it had cut its stake in the company. The sharp drop in July auto sales didn't help, also pulling Ford(NYSE:F) stock down 2.5%.
There was fresh pressure on some big-name Chinese ADRs after China's State Administration for Market Regulation published a draft of new laws aimed at limiting the ability of the big platform companies to create closed-circuit ecosystems on the web. It's the latest evidence of a broad government clampdown to curb the market power of such companies.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs fell 3.3%, while Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) fell 3.1% and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs fell 3.9%. Sentiment toward Chinese ADRs in general remained hurt by comments on Monday from Securities and Exchanges Commission head Gary Gensler, who called for a ban on groups listing in the U.S. through the ADRs of shell companies. 
Elsewhere, Roblox stock fell 5.1% after the social gaming company's billings missed expectations, but  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 2.5% and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 0.4%  after reports suggesting that the Biden administration will likely back 'booster shots' for those already vaccinated against Covid-19.  Early results from a study presented on Monday by BioNTech and its partner  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) indicate that a booster shot substantially strengthens the immune system against the disease."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -BHP Group reported its best annual profit in nearly a decade on soaring iron ore prices, as the world's biggest listed miner announced an exit from its $13 billion petroleum business in a portfolio shake-up that will see it leave London's FTSE100 index.
On a day of sweeping changes, BHP said it was going ahead with its Jansen potash project in Canada and, in a blow to the London Stock Exchange, unveiled plans to do away with its dual-listed share structure. That will make Sydney its main listing.
""(Share) unification will simplify BHP's structure, make it easier for the company to make equity-based acquisitions, and make it easier for other corporate restructurings, including the Petroleum/Woodside merger,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note. 
The group plans to sell its petroleum assets to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd, creating a new, bigger petroleum company to better navigate the energy transition and give shareholders greater choice in how they manage their fossil fuels exposure, Chief Executive Mike Henry said.
The deal will give BHP shareholders a 48% stake in the new company.
""We (will also) create a better ability to allocate capital within BHP towards investments longer term ... in future facing commodities and support for more returns to shareholders,"" Henry said.
BHP's London-listed shares surged nearly 10% after its results.
The miner's Australia-listed shares have climbed more than a fifth this year as it posted record iron ore output and earned more than double per tonne for the steel-making ingredient.
After unifying its shares, BHP will retain a secondary listing in London, where stocks have traditionally traded at a deep discount to Australian stocks. 
Iron ore prices have hit record highs supported by Beijing's infrastructure push, although a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China and its vow to lower emissions by curbing steel output is expected to be a drag on the commodity.
BHP's underlying profit for fiscal 2021 rose to $17.08 billion, but slightly missed a consensus of $17.46 billion compiled by Vuma.
The miner will pay $2 per share as a final dividend, totalling $10.1 billion, bringing the total payout for the year to $3.01 a share, or $15.2 billion.
BHP said it was going ahead with its Jansen potash project, which is expected to cost $5.7 billion in the first phase, offering the company a route to growth in new ""future-facing commodities"".
The miner took a $1.3 billion charge for existing infrastructure spending on its potash asset, which analysts said could make it more attractive to any potential partner. 
""Giving the go ahead to Jansen is not enough, they should do much more,"" said a top 20 investor who declined to be named. ""They should create a partnership with  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd and even take it over.""
The Canadian potash major is seen as an ideal partner to dilute BHP's risk and development costs. BHP says it is open to but not in need of a partner, while Nutrien has said that any tie-up with BHP is not its focus.
Jansen is expected to produce 4.35 million tonnes of potash per year from 2027. Potash is a key element in plant nutrition that also makes crops more drought resistant.
On a call following the results, CEO Henry said BHP remains committed to its high quality steel-making coal business which it expects to grow with infrastructure needs supporting the energy transition, even as the company looks to exit thermal coal.

BHP took an impairment charge of $1.70 billion in fiscal 2021 related to rehabilitation and mine planning at its thermal coal assets for which a sales process is still underway.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 09:23AM ET</span>",Walmart raises forecast as people return to stores; online sales slow,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Richa Naidu
(Reuters) -Walmart Inc increased its annual U.S. same-store sales forecast after beating analysts' estimates on Tuesday, as shoppers coming out of lockdown bought more clothes, travel gear and back-to-school merchandise.
As store sales rose, however, the pace of Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s online growth slowed dramatically to 6% from 37% in the first quarter.
Still, Walmart is on track to reach $75 billion in global ecommerce sales by the end of the year - the retailer reported its biggest ever online sales growth of 97% last year as people used its quick delivery services to order essentials at the height of the pandemic.
""Even as ecommerce growth slowed as we layered on top of tremendous growth last year ... The good news for us is that we can serve them (shoppers) either way,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said. 
The results kick off a big week of earnings from major U.S retailers - including  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Macy's (NYSE:M) - which are all expected to have benefited from people tentatively leaving their homes this summer. Investors are concerned, however, that their newfound freedom could be cut short with a resurgence in COVID-19 cases due to the more contagious Delta variant of the virus. 
Sales at Walmart's U.S. stores open at least a year rose 5.2%, excluding fuel, in the second quarter ended July 31. Analysts had estimated a growth of 3.69%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The world's biggest retailer has also been given a boost by stimulus checks handed out during the pandemic, and most recently from the Biden Administration's advance child tax credits.
Walmart said it now expects fiscal 2022 U.S. same-store sales to be up 5% to 6%, compared with the low single-digit growth it had previously forecast. It also expects current quarter sales to be well above estimates. The outlook accounts for continued strength in the U.S. economy and no significant additional government stimulus for the rest of the year. 
Increasing third-quarter guidance shows that Walmart will continue to run on all cylinders, leaning heavily on its stores, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said. 
Walmart's U.S. gross margin improved 20 basis points, as fewer discounts and a doubling of U.S. ad sales helped offset higher supply chain costs.

Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.78, handily beating analysts' expectations of $1.57 per share. Total revenue rose 2.4% to $141.05 billion, ahead of expectations of $137.17 billion.
Shares of Walmart were up marginally, adding to the nearly 5% gains seen so far this year.

NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Just as American steakhouses are recovering from the first wave of COVID shutdowns, the Delta variant threatens to diminish the appetite for a sector seen as a barometer for full U.S. economic recovery.
While many top steak restaurants found new customers by reinventing themselves during the crisis, the comeback of the $5 billion U.S. premium steakhouse sector - known for leather booths, white tablecloths and $60 ribeyes - depends on expense-account-wielding executives resuming fancy business events and affluent tourists flocking to Broadway theaters and other attractions.
But travel and group events are again at risk as Delta infections and deaths mount. Several companies pushed back target dates for employees to return to offices. Some big in-person events, including the New York auto show, were canceled. 
High-end steakhouses are especially vulnerable to the spread of the virus because their traditions - such as lengthy, indoor, three-course dinners - may scare off apprehensive customers. At the same time, the price of beef is soaring, with wholesale prices 40% higher on average in July than a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That threatens steakhouses' profit margins. Several chains say they are better prepared amid the pandemic this year since adding outdoor dining and home delivery, should the latest surge or new government restrictions scare some diners away again. 
Some also are expanding their bars - higher-margin liquor sales can help offset pressure from pricier beef. Ruth's Chris Steak House parent company Ruth's Hospitality (NASDAQ:RUTH) Group Inc said in an Aug. 6 earnings call that it ""recently"" locked in about 10% of its beef purchases to help fend off higher costs.
Data from reservation provider OpenTable showed the number of seated diners at steakhouses more than doubled by midyear compared with January, as vaccination rates rose and before the Delta variant became a huge area of concern. 
But sales at the ""premium"" steakhouses peaked in early July https://www.datawrapper.de/_/Sm1iE before falling slightly in the first week of August, according to consultant Malcolm Knapp, who tracks steakhouse data.
""We won't get the lift we had expected before the magnitude of the Delta variant came through,"" said Knapp.
TOO SOON TO TELL 
At Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday, maitre d' of 26 years Tom Hobby, 66, checked guests' lunch reservations on a clipboard as waiters in long white aprons sailed past carrying bread baskets, sole with lemon wedges and sizzling plates of steak to al fresco diners at sidewalk tables. 
The iconic steakhouse only added outdoor seating and home delivery because of COVID, he said. When its bar finally reopened after the city allowed full capacity seating in mid-May, ""the whole vibe changed,"" Hobby said. ""It wasn't just about food. It felt like an event.""
At Fleming's, owned by Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN) Inc, takeout and delivery orders were rare before the pandemic. But when many of its dining rooms were shut a year ago, carryout soared to 47% of sales. Now, it's at about 8% as customers return to restaurants, Chief Executive Officer David Deno said in a July 30 interview.
Ruth's Chris permanently closed some of its restaurants that weren't compatible with delivery and takeout - a business that went from roughly zero pre-pandemic to as much as 7%. Ruth's Chris Chief Executive Officer Cheryl Henry said the chain has lured new customers. ""We started to see younger, more affluent guests trying Ruth's for the first time through our takeout and delivery program,"" she said in the earnings call.
Henry said ""it's a little soon to tell"" if holiday bookings, which in recent years have kicked into high gear in September, would be impacted by Delta. 
Chicago's Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse restaurants - which are among the nation's highest-grossing independent restaurants - and other chains like Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse started delivering premium steaks and other meats to customers during the first wave of coronavirus - and continue to do so. 
The Gibsons boxes, which sell for as much as $268, boosted revenue at a time when health restrictions limited diners to delivery and carry-out.
But the industry now is closely watching trends in private room bookings - where bills easily run $150 to $250 per person, boosted by expensive wine and whiskey.
On a recent afternoon at Fleming's steakhouse in Edgewater, New Jersey, with airy views of the New York skyline across the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River, Cynthia and Bill Rosen were exploring the dining room as a venue for their son's planned October wedding. The restaurant charges $55 to $125 per person depending on the menu they select.

Fleming's saw private dining drop to zero from 17% of sales pre-pandemic, but it has come back to 7% currently, Deno said. 
Keith Beitler, chief operating officer at Landry's Inc , whose high-end steakhouse brands include Del Frisco's Double Eagle and Morton's, was cautiously optimistic as the Delta variant loomed. ""If things don't get any worse, we expect this December to be pretty much normal,"" Beitler said.

Investing.com – Stocks of Chinese Internet and tech companies drifted lower in Tuesday’s premarket as the country’s antitrust regulator proposed sweeping changes to curb behavior it thinks harms competition.
ADRs of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) traded 3.5% lower each. Didi ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) fell 2.7% and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) 4%. Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) fell 2.6%.
The new rules, proposed by State Administration for Market Regulation, seek to prevent unfair competition among Internet companies. If approved by the government, they could come into force this year.
The amendments propose strict penalties for submitting false data to mislead customers. Companies will no longer be able to get away with manipulating user feedback or product specifications.
The regulator also wants to ban ""choosing one from two,"" in which companies tie up suppliers in exclusive agreements to prevent them from selling on rival platforms.
Regulators in China have been increasing scrutiny of their tech and education companies, worried they wield too much power in the marketplace that hurts competition and results in higher prices for consumers.
They are also worried about their handling of data of millions of Chinese citizens using their platforms. The draft also bans using customer data to anticipate or influence users' behavior.

Investing.com – Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock fell 1.2% in Tuesday’s premarket as the retailer’s second quarter earnings indicated a slowdown in growth after an exceptional, pandemic-distorted year..
The drop came despite the big-box retailer raising its guidance for the year after a quarter that was better than consensus forecasts expected.
Total revenue was up 2.4% at $141 billion, affected by disposals. It had grown 5.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Analysts estimated it to be $136.63 billion.
Sales at U.S. stores that have been open for at least a year rose 5.2%, coming well below the 9.3% growth in the June quarter of 2020, but still enough for management to raise its full-year forecast. However, Walmart's e-commerce sales slowed sharply, rising only 6% compared to 97% growth last time. International sales came in at $23 billion, down 15% from a year ago. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 was higher than the estimated $1.56.
The company said it now expects U.S. same-store sales to be up 5% to 6% in the ongoing financial year, compared with the 'low single-digit growth' it had previously forecast.
Consolidated net revenue is seen growing 6%-7% as opposed to “low-to-mid single-digits” previously.
Walmart has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of stimulus checks, its vast bouquet of products and stores drawing people looking to get the best bang for their buck in the pandemic.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>","Tencent Music takes copyright rules in stride, earnings beat estimates","By Eva Mathews and Sophie Yu
(Reuters) -  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) said on Monday China's copyright rules were unlikely to have a big impact on its online subscriptions, and its chief executive believes regulators want to promote healthy development of the music industry.
Tencent Music's second-quarter profit beat Wall Street expectations on Monday, as its advertising business rebounded and more people subscribed to its music streaming platform.
Paid subscribers for the company's online music service grew 41% to 66.2 million, a record high, boosted by investments in long-form audio and a refreshed music library expanded by licensing deals with Universal Music Group,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music and other labels.
Shares in Tencent Music rose 3.1% in extended trading after its earnings release, paring back losses that saw it fall 9% earlier on Monday. 
The shares have lost half their market value this year due to Beijing's crackdown on its tech giants and a ruling that barred the company's parent, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, from exclusive music copyright agreements.
Tencent Music's CEO Liang Zhu told analysts that they believed Chinese regulators ultimately were keen to promote the healthy development of the music industry and the firm fully accepted the government's policies. 
The company expects the decision on copyright agreements to have some impact on its operations, it said in its report without specifying a figure, but Liang said they did not think it would have a big impact on its online subscriptions. 
Frank Zhao, a Beijing-based independent music industry analyst, said Tencent Music made most of its income from social entertainment such as online Karaoke and livestreaming businesses.
""Tencent Music is now focusing on content creation and user experience improvement,"" Zhao said. ""They are on the right road as the fight over copyright is over.""
Tencent Music's social entertainment services business, which includes karaoke platforms where users can live stream concerts, posted a 7.4% rise in revenue to 5.06 billion yuan in the quarter and accounted for most of its revenue.
Total revenue rose by 15.5% to 8.01 billion yuan ($1.24 billion), but missed a Refinitiv IBES estimate of 8.13 billion yuan. 

The company earned 0.66 yuan per American depository share on an adjusted basis, more than estimates of 0.62 yuan.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, retreating from record levels ahead of the release of key retail sales data and quarterly earrings from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD). 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 195 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 50 points, or 0.3%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and broad-based S&P 500 closed at new all-time highs Monday, posting their fifth straight positive session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, however, declined 0.2%.
However, sentiment has turned negative as investors digest the political disorder in Afghanistan, rising global Covid cases and slowing economic growth in China.
Back in the U.S., the release of the July retail sales report is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). This is expected to show a drop in sales of 0.2% on a month-on-month basis after a 0.6% rise in June. 
A number of states are setting new records for Covid cases, likely hitting consumer spending, while some have cut off extra federal pandemic unemployment assistance. 
Also due are industrial production data for July at 9:15 AM ET.
Elsewhere, attention will be on the quarterly earnings reports from Walmart and Home Depot, with these retail giants having tough comparisons with last year.
Home Depot missed estimates for U.S. quarterly same-store sales, as the pandemic-driven surge in demand for do-it-yourself home-improvement products waned, but Walmart raised its annual U.S. same-store sales forecast after beating estimates, buoyed by customers splurging on back-to-school products.
The U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks will also be in focus after the country’s regulators issued a new draft of rules designed to stop unfair competition on the Internet. This resulted in the stocks of the likes of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com trading sharply lower Tuesday.
Elsewhere, oil prices slipped Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s sharp losses on Covid-related fears for global demand.
The Energy Information Administration also noted Monday, in its monthly report, that U.S. shale oil output is expected to rise to 8.1 million barrels per day in September, the highest since May 2020. This puts the weekly crude inventory data by the American Petroleum Institute, due later Tuesday, firmly into focus.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $66.52 a barrel, after dropping 1.7% Monday, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $69.09, after falling 1.5% during the previous session.

Investing.com –  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock traded 4% lower in Tuesday’s premarket as customer transactions and U.S. same-store sales dropped in the second quarter, in an indication that the pandemic-induced craze for home improvement may be cooling.
The company had record earnings in 2020 as its stores remained open in the pandemic and people looked to adapt their surroundings to a working-from-home environment, or freshen them up for selling into an increasingly hot housing market. Recent data have suggested that consumers are now redirecting spending away from such areas to sectors such as entertainment and hospitality.
The company reported a 5.8% drop to 481.7 million in customer transactions in the quarter ended August 1 compared to the second quarter of 2020.
U.S. same-store sales rose a mere 3.4%, compared to the 25% jump in the second quarter of 2020.
Average ticket size at Home Depot grew and so did sales per square foot.
Second-quarter net sales rose 8.1% year-on-year to $41.11 billion, topping the estimate of $40.48 billion. Net earnings were higher by 11% at $4.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share came in at $4.53 and surpassed analysts’ estimates of $4.42.

1626,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",FTSE 100 to Lose Second-Biggest Name as BHP Goes Home,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K.’s blue-chip FTSE 100 Index will lose its second-biggest stock by market value and the world’s biggest mining company, after BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) announced plans to simplify its listing structure.
BHP will move to a primary listing in Australia after collapsing a dual arrangement that dates back to the company’s creation 20 years ago when Australia’s BHP Ltd. merged with rival Billiton. The change, one of several announced Tuesday that also included a plan to exit the oil and gas business, means BHP can be more nimble in pursuing deals, Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry told reporters.
However, the deletion from the FTSE 100 will also prompt asset managers and exchange-traded funds which track the benchmark to sell their holdings in BHP. And the loss will be a blow to the index -- the London Stock Exchange is seeking to attract new listings as the U.K. maps its future outside the European Union. It still includes several of the world’s other huge mining companies though, including No. 2 Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group, another dual-listed stock.
“Clearly it’s a big blow losing such a heavyweight,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said in an email. “But it will help balance the FTSE 100 a bit more with less leaning on basic resources. Bit less mining, bit more room for up and coming tech is surely not a terrible thing,” he said, adding that ultimately BHP is an Australian company at heart and should be listed there.
While BHP is the second-largest company in the FTSE 100 behind AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, it only ranks 10th by weighting because of the dual listing, representing 2.6% of the index. The proposal -- which is subject to approvals including by the company’s board -- would leave BHP with secondary listings in London, Johannesburg and New York. Shareholders of the London-listed vehicle will get shares of the Sydney-listed entity on a one-for-one basis.
The miner has been reviewing its listing structure for years after Elliott Management Corp. pushed BHP to reorganize as a single company. Elliott -- which also advocated for the company to get out of oil and gas -- argued that removing the dual listing would eliminate a discount between its shares in London and Sydney, reduce costs and bolster transparency
Under the current arrangement, BHP has two headquarters and two main stock market listings, but is run as a single entity under the same management and board. The company announced the change to its structure as part of its annual earnings results Tuesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>","Australia's Woodside snares BHP oil, gas business in $28 billion merger","By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -BHP Group has agreed to sell its petroleum business to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum in a merger to create a top 10 independent oil and gas producer worth A$38.5 billion ($28 billion) with growth assets in Australia and the Americas.
BHP's exit from petroleum, which made up just 5% of its annual earnings, speeds up its exit from fossil fuels amid pressure from environmentally conscious investors. BHP CEO Mike Henry, however, said the company remained committed to metallurgical coal used in steel making.
BHP shareholders will be paid in Woodside stock, giving BHP investors a 48% stake in the merged group.
That effectively values BHP's petroleum arm at about A$18.5 billion ($13 billion) on Tuesday's close, roughly in the middle of analysts' valuations between $10 billion and $17 billion.
For Woodside, the deal is transformational, doubling its output, expanding its footprint in liquefied natural gas, removing the main obstacle to its $12 billion Scarborough gas project and giving it near-term growth options in the Gulf of Mexico.
BHP's assets, including its ageing assets in Australia's Bass Strait where its petroleum business originated, generate cash that will help Woodside fund the Scarborough project as well as developments in the Gulf of Mexico.
""Merging Woodside with BHP's oil and gas business delivers a stronger balance sheet, increased cash flow and enduring financial strength to fund planned developments in the near term and new energy sources into the future,"" Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill said in a statement.
""We will have more optionality in where we invest and can prioritise the highest return opportunities,"" she told analysts.
The merger ratio involved no premium for BHP's assets, she said.
The deal was announced at the same time as Woodside appointed O'Neill as chief executive, following a stint as acting CEO. Some analysts had speculated BHP's petroleum chief Geraldine Slattery, would get the job.
""The proposed transaction de-risks and supports Scarborough FID (final investment decision) later this year and enables more flexible capital allocation,"" O'Neill said.
The companies said the merger would generate annual savings of more than $400 million from 2023, the year after the deal is expected to close.
Woodside plans to put the share issue to a vote in the second quarter of 2022.
A big Woodside investor, Allan Gray Australia, has raised concerns about a deal, especially if it involved a massive share issue. 
""It's very unlikely that shareholders would jump at that idea. We certainly wouldn't,"" Allan Gray Australia Chief Investment Officer Simon Mawhinney told Reuters last week.
O'Neill played down concerns that many BHP investors who don't want fossil fuels or an Australian stock might dump the Woodside shares, saying there is already overlap among investors in the company and it would consider secondary listings in London and New York to help keep ""high value"" investors on board. Analysts raised concern about the near-term decommissioning liabilities Woodside will be inheriting with BHP's stake in the Bass Strait oil and gas fields. Analysts have estimated those costs at least $2 billion, but O'Neill would not put a figure on it.

""We feel good about how we've valued the decommissioning obligation in setting the merger ratio,"" she said.

1629,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>","BHP ADRs Fall on Plan to End Dual Listing, Woodside Deal Structure","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – BHP ADR (NYSE:BHP) traded more than 4% lower in Tuesday’s premarket on disappointment over the company’s decision to end its dual-listing and the contours of its deal with Woodside (OTC:WOPEY).
The miner will de-list from London and unify under its Australian parent. Holders of BHP’s stock listed in London will get stocks of the Australian entity on a 1:1 basis. That may limit the access that U.S. institutional investors have to the stock. 
BHP shareholders will also get Woodside shares in a $15.4 billion deal that will see the miner’s petroleum assets merge with Woodside. The expanded Woodside will be owned 52% by existing shareholders and 48% by BHP shareholders.
The shares were down Monday too as traders felt the Woodside deal won’t provide a clean break from fossil fuels, something many investors and ESG funds focused on environmental issues have been questioning the company about. Thus, some of the shareholders may be forced to sell their equity immediately due to their investment mandates.
BHP also announced its second-quarter earnings Tuesday and the numbers reflected an otherwise robust operation.
The company made a net profit of $11.3 billion in the year through June as revenue rose 42% to $60.81 billion. Firmer iron ore and copper prices and a booming demand drove the profits.
The BHP Board also announced a record final dividend of $2 per share, bringing returns to shareholder to more than $15 billion for the full year.
The company said it will go ahead with its $5.7 billion investment in a potash project in Saskatchewan, Canada. The plant is expected to produce 4.35 million ton of potash every year from 2027."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The Chinese government took a stake and a board seat in a key ByteDance entity this year - a move that raises questions over how much influence Beijing is planning to wield in a tech sector reeling under an onslaught of regulatory action.
The 1% stake in Beijing ByteDance Technology, which holds some of the licences for Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, as well news aggregator Toutiao, was registered on April 30, according to corporate information app Tianyancha.
It is held by WangTouZhongWen (Beijing) Technology which is owned by three Chinese state entities including a fund backed by the country's main internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), government shareholder data shows.
The holding does not represent a stake in TikTok nor its parent company ByteDance, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, said a person familiar with matter who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to identified.
While there is precedent for the Chinese government to hold shares in tech firms, news of the stake - first reported by online magazine The Information - comes amid a surge in antitrust probes and new rules https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/china-issues-draft-rules-banning-unfair-competition-internet-sector-2021-08-17 for the industry, upending a previously laissez-faire approach by authorities. 
""I think this all arises out of a concern within the Chinese government that private technology companies were gaining too much data and too much power, and so should be construed as a move by the Chinese government to rein them in and take control,"" said Paul Haswell, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.
""This practice is likely to continue, with the government taking greater stakes and exerting more control, essentially turning many of these tech companies into SOE (state enterprise)-lite type entities,"" he said, adding that the government's actions could make it difficult for Chinese firms to do business overseas.
The CAC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment about the purpose of the government's holding.
A ByteDance representative said Beijing ByteDance Technology ""only relates to some of ByteDance's China-market video and information platforms, and holds some of the licenses they require to operate under local law."" 
WEIBO AND OTHERS
The central Chinese government similarly holds a 1% stake in a key unit of Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) called Beijing Weimeng Technology, according to Chinese government data and filings made to the U.S. securities regulator.
Weibo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the SEC filing, it said its unit received the investment from in April 2020 and that the investment vehicle which is called WangTouTongDa (Beijing) Technology had the right to appoint a director to Weiming's three-member board. 
WangTouTongDa is owned by the China Internet Investment Fund (CIIF), which was established by CAC and the country's finance ministry in 2016.
CIIF has an assets under management target of 100 billion yuan ($15.4 billion), according to its official website. 

It has invested in online content platforms Kuaishou Technology and popular podcast firm Ximalaya, artificial intelligence startups SenseTime and CloudWalk, as well as China's Uber (NYSE:UBER) for trucks, Full Truck Alliance.

U.S.-headquartered Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is making electric Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, is hiring external relation managers in several Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to the post.
The job advertisement did not go into details of external relation positions, but separate posts showed the managers will handle government relations as well.
Reuters reported in May, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tesla was boosting its engagement with mainland regulators and beefing up its government relations team.
The company is hiring lawyers who specialise in construction, anti-monopoly and data privacy protection areas, while also looking for public relations managers.
In April, Tesla was targeted by state media and regulators after a customer, angry over the handling of her complaint about malfunctioning brakes, climbed on top of a Tesla car in protest at the Shanghai auto show. Videos of the incident went viral.
Last month, the automaker sold 32,968 China-made vehicles in July, including 24,347 for export, industry data showed.

Yuan Guohua, a official in the area where Tesla's factory is located, said on Tuesday that the factory is expected to product 450,000 vehicles this year, including 66,100 units for export, China's state Xinhua news agency reported.
Yuan also said 90% of Tesla's China supply chain will be localised, according to Xinhua report. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Yuan's comments.

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",Incoming BT Chairman Crozier's record of corporate leadership,"(Reuters) - Adam Crozier will become BT Chairman later this year, the telecoms group said Tuesday, tapping a seasoned executive known for leading turnarounds at a variety of public and private businesses. 
Here's a look at the 57-year-old executive's career:
** CHAIRMAN, ASOS (LON:ASOS), 2018-2021
Crozier joined the online fashion retailer in late 2018. Under him, the group bought fashion brands Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT from the administrators of the collapsed Arcadia Group. Asos shares have fallen 23% so far during his tenure, which included the coronavirus pandemic.
** CHIEF EXECUTIVE,  ITV  (LON:ITV), 2010-2017
Crozier restored the British broadcaster's fortunes during his seven years in charge by reducing its reliance on advertising, and expanding its production business through a flurry of deals to add independent production companies. ITV's revenue from sources other than advertising more than doubled under Crozier's tenure.
** CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ROYAL MAIL, 2003-2010
Crozier launched a transformation programme focused on cost-cuts in the face of fierce opposition from unions, and brought in new machinery and equipment to modernize the debt-ridden company. 
** CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ENGLISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION, 2000-2002
Crozier, then 35, took the role with little prior experience in the business of the sport. He is known for modernising the governing body of English football and hiring the national team's first foreign manager in Sven-Goran Eriksson. He also clashed with leading officials over how the game should be run.

** SAATCHI & SAATCHI, 1988-1999 
Crozier began his stint as an executive at advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi in 1988, before becoming its youngest board member and joint chief executive in the 1990s after its founders resigned.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 04:47AM ET</span>",EV startups hunt for low-cost roads to mass production,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
BICESTER, England (Reuters) - Electric car and van startups racing to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc all want to avoid Elon Musk's journey through ""manufacturing hell.""
But electric vehicle firms such as UK van company Arrival SA and Fisker Inc are taking very different roads to overcome the challenges of profitable mass production that almost broke Tesla.
A few have found investors willing to hand over billions to fund their journey. Rivian has raised around $10.5 billion from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and others as it ramps up production to build electric vans, pickups and SUVs.
Startups lacking Rivian's wads of cash need cheaper paths to mass production or risk failing in the EV arms race - a danger Musk highlighted repeatedly on Tesla's July 26 earnings call.
""The thing that's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production,"" Musk said.
During 2017 and 2018, Tesla struggled to ramp up volume production of the Model 3 sedan, with the then loss-making automaker burning through cash as it contended with an over-reliance on automation, battery issues and other bottlenecks. It even built a new line in just two weeks in a huge tent outside its Fremont, California, factory to meet its production targets. 
The traditional approach taken by many automakers over the years has been to spend above $2 billion on a factory big enough to build 240,000 vehicles or more annually. 
Arrival has opted instead to build electric van and bus ""microfactories"" - small plants costing $50 million that are light on expensive equipment. Arrival does not need paint shops - which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars - because its vans are made of lightweight coloured plastic composite. 
Arrival plans microfactories close to major customers around the world, cutting shipping costs and hiring local workers.
""You have to raise so much money to do this the traditional way that it keeps startups from coming forward with new ideas,"" said North American head Mike Abelson - a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) executive. 
Arrival raised about $660 million from its March public offering and is building two U.S. plants: one in North Carolina making vans for  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), its largest customer to date, plus another in South Carolina that will make buses. In addition, it is building a factory in Spain. Abelson said Arrival will announce more plants later this year. 
'MICROFACTORY 1.0'
Arrival's first microfactory in Bicester, England, will serve as the blueprint for other plants. The lack of a paint shop is just one of the ways in which the company will steer clear of big-ticket items that traditionally have defined automotive production. 
The startup's engineers have built moulds for plastic body panels costing thousands of dollars versus the millions of dollars needed for a traditional metal die. Arrival's engineers have also designed their own moulding machines.
Abelson said Arrival needs around 70 robots per microfactory and the startup is buying only commonly used, generic robots from long-time auto industry suppliers Kuka AG and Italy's Comau - eschewing expensive made-to-order robots. Comau is owned by automaker Stellantis NV. 
Robots are programmed to do double or triple duty. In a large traditional car plant, if you need to apply adhesive at different points during assembly you add more adhesive stations along the line to churn out a vehicle per minute. 
But in Arrival's microfactory there will be one adhesive station and autonomous wheeled robots, designed in-house, will carry a chassis back and forth throughout the assembly process. 
Going small means that Arrival can commit to 10,000 vans annually per plant rather than 100,000, Abelson says. Each microfactory will create around 250 jobs, nowhere near the many thousands created by a large auto plant in the past.
""That means if a plant doesn't work out, it's not a disaster for a local economy,"" Abelson said. ""A major car plant closing is a big hole to fill.""
'WORK OUR WAY BACKWARDS'
Electric vehicle maker Canoo Inc has adopted a similar strategy to Arrival's. But CEO Tony Aquila said Canoo will build a ""mega-microfactory"" to serve as a hub for smaller future factories.
Electric Last Mile Solutions plans to launch a small electric van in the United States later this year and at first will reassemble prefinished vehicles made in China at a former GM plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, adding new seatbelts and other safety features to meet U.S. regulations.
CEO James Taylor said this will initially save hundreds of millions of dollars on stamping dies and body shop welding equipment. As revenue grows it will incorporate more American parts over time.
""We'll work our way backwards, adding more and more local content as we go,"" Taylor said.
Other startups are outsourcing manufacturing to cut costs.
Tel Aviv-based REE Automotive Holding Inc is leaning in to agreements with American Axle (NYSE:AXL) and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp to help build its electric platforms for delivery vehicles and people movers at scale. 
""The biggest challenge for new players like us is at the end of the day you need to manufacture at automotive grade and automotive scale,"" said REE Automotive CEO Daniel Barel. ""With us, everything already comes at automotive scale because it's American Axle or Mitsubishi.""
REE and Fisker also have both teamed up with Canadian auto supplier  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc to build their EVs, while Fisker has a similar agreement with Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Co Ltd. 

Contract manufacturing deals reduce upfront costs, in return for Magna or Foxconn taking a cut of revenue and potential profits. Henrik Fisker, chief executive of the EV startup that bears his name, said the alliances should also help secure equipment and parts at a time when supply chains are snarled.
""Foxconn and Magna, they will get all the equipment they need,"" said Fisker. ""They have the capital. They have the reputation. We are not here to set up our own factory in the desert.""

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 04:43AM ET</span>",Pandora jewellery sales top pre-pandemic levels as U.S. shoppers splash out,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish jewellery maker Pandora (OTC:PANDY) said on Tuesday that a strong performance in the United States spurred rapid sales growth in the second quarter but sales in China fell.
Pandora, which aims to strengthen its brand in the world's two biggest economies, said its total comparable sales in April-June jumped 7% compared to the same quarter of 2019 before the pandemic.
In the United States quarterly sales more than doubled from a year earlier and were up 63% compared to 2019 as massive government stimulus and vaccinations against COVID-19 fuelled spending on goods and services. 
Pandora said it saw indications that it was gaining more market share in the United States, its biggest market, but cautioned that the high growth would come down in the second half of the year.
""We have dampened the expectations on the U.S. growth versus the first half and then we have raised expectations in Europe when the stores reopen and we are seeing that play out,"" Chief Executive Alexander Lacik told Reuters in an interview. 
Pandora's shares, which have gained around 25% this year, fell around 1% in early trade.
""The questions arise for how long growth in the U.S. operation can offset continued weakness elsewhere, and can Pandora stabilize its European operations to coincide with slower U.S. growth?"" Handelsbanken said in a research note. 
Sales in China, the world's largest jewellery market, fell 13% in the second quarter compared to 2019. 
""It will take time so this is not a quick fix. The first attempt to try to turn this around is going to happen later this year,"" Lacik said, adding that Pandora would announce further details on its brand repositioning in China at its capital markets day in September. 

Pandora earlier this month raised its full-year sales and profit margin forecasts as fewer stores would have to close due to COVID-19 than initially assumed.
On Tuesday, Pandora also announced a new share buyback programme, the latest European company to repurchase stock in the wake of a strong earnings season.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Tuesday, weighed by losses in Asia on fresh Chinese regulatory fears, but BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) soared after confirming the spin-off of its crude assets.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
BHP (LON:BHPB) stock soared over 8% after the world’s biggest listed miner confirmed it will sell its petroleum assets to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum after it posted its best annual profit in nearly a decade. The spin-off, which ends BHP's relationship with fossil fuels, improves its profile with investors focused on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors, while also jettisoning one of its least profitable operations.
Staying in the sector, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) stock fell 0.9% after the mining giant acquired a stake in U.K. battery maker Britishvolt, a company which plans to produce batteries for electric vehicles.
European markets received a weak handover from Asia, with the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropping 1.7% after Chinese regulators issued a set of draft regulations for the internet sector on Tuesday, the latest move in a crackdown on the country's powerful tech companies.
The directives seek to ban unfair competition while restricting the use of user data, and resulted in a number of the important Hong Kong-listed internet stocks falling sharply.
This follows Chinese economic data on Monday pointing to a slowdown in growth at the region’s main economic driver due to floods and rising cases of the highly-transmissible delta Covid variant and the measures taken to contain it, while the turmoil in Afghanistan is also denting investors' confidence. 
Turning to economic data, the U.K. employment situation picked up in July as the country reopened fully from the Covid-induced lockdowns. The claimant count dropped 7,800, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in June.
The second reading of the second-quarter GDP release for the Eurozone is due later in the session, and should confirm the strong growth of 13.7% of the preliminary estimate.
Over in the U.S., the retail sector is likely to be in focus Tuesday with U.S. giants  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) set to release their second-quarter earnings before the market opens, while the July retail sales figure is expected to show a slowdown in consumer spending.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Tuesday, struggling to find support after Monday’s sharp losses on Covid-related fears for global demand.
The Energy Information Administration also noted Monday, in its monthly report, that U.S. shale oil output is expected to rise to 8.1 million barrels per day in September, the highest since May 2020. This puts the weekly crude inventory data by the American Petroleum Institute, due later Tuesday, firmly into focus.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $66.73 a barrel, after dropping 1.7% Monday, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $69.19, after falling 1.5% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,795.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1769.

LONDON (Reuters) -BT named Adam Crozier as its next chairman on Tuesday, tapping one of the most experienced corporate operators in Britain to oversee the group through a key transformational period in its 175-year history. 
Crozier, who previously brought new strategies to broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV),  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) and the Football Association, will become chairman designate on Nov. 1 and chairman proper a month later, when Jan du Plessis retires. 
He joins as the company embarks on a major infrastructure programme, racing to take fast broadband fibre to 25 million premises by the end of 2026, and as it weighs partnering with investors on part of the build, and in its sports TV division. 
He will also have to manage the new relationship with Patrick Drahi, a Franco-Israeli telecoms entrepreneur who stunned investors in June when he announced that he controlled 12.1% of BT, making him the biggest shareholder. 
Crozier will work alongside BT CEO Philip Jansen, dubbed by observers as a ""man in a hurry"", who having received millions of pounds in his previous job running Worldpay, is battling to shake up and modernise the former telecoms monopoly.
BT was forced earlier this year to deny that Jansen had threatened to resign unless du Plessis quit, following a media report that the CEO was frustrated with the pace of change. 
A person familiar with the matter said the two had discussed whether they were the best combination to deliver such widescale change but that their relationship had always remained amicable. 
Iain Conn, BT's senior independent director, said Crozier had been the board's unanimous choice to take over.
""He has significant experience in leading public company boards, developing teams and managing stakeholders and brings a strong transformational and operational track record in large-scale executive roles,"" he said. 
Crozier will step down as chairman of online fashion retail ASOS (LON:ASOS) on Nov. 29, and as a non-executive director of Sony Corp (T:6758). at the end of the year. 

""BT is a hugely important company, with a critical role to play in building the digital networks and services to support the UK's future,"" Crozier said.
BT's shares, up 64% in a year on favourable regulatory rulings and the Drahi stake, slipped 1% in early trade.

HONG KONG/SEOUL (Reuters) - Investment banks in South Korea have pocketed record fees from equity underwriting this year thanks to a boom in initial public offerings (IPOs), data showed - and bankers are betting a buzzing deal pipeline means a continued near-term surge.
The total fee pool for 2021 equity capital market (ECM) deals in South Korea is now equivalent to $315.5 million, according to Refinitiv data. Of that, $236 million has been earned from the record number of Seoul listings in 2021.
Fees earned so far this year have already surpassed the full 2020 total and the amount is more than double that earned in 2019, the data showed. The previous fee record, year to date, was $178.6m in 2006.
Some $17.25 billion has been raised via IPOs this year, already four times the amount for all of 2020, with Krafton's $3.7 billion https://www.reuters.com/technology/skoreas-krafton-maker-hit-game-pubg-tumbles-debut-2021-08-10 IPO the largest this year followed by KakaoBank's $2.29 billion https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/kakao-bank-becomes-skoreas-biggest-lender-by-market-value-stellar-debut-2021-08-06 deal.
That's before the mouthwatering prospect for investment banks of what's expected to be South Korea's largest ever IPO later this year - LG Energy Solution, part of the LG conglomerate, is due to raise between $10 billion and $12 billion.
""The greatest amount of money that has flowed into the stock market, especially into the IPO market, is from retail investors,"" said Joseph Kwon, director of ECM at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), reckoning the amount of money currently deposited in brokerage accounts is estimated to be about 70 trillion won ($59.50 billion) - enough to continue to underpin the market.
The windfall is a welcome relief for both domestic and Wall Street bankers. Seoul is a market that pays fees of about 1% of the IPO proceeds, compared with about 2% in New York and Hong Kong and more than 4% for floats in China's Nasdaq-style STAR Market.
Enthused by the surging deals volume and fee pool, Seoul's Daishin Securities had hired about 10 bankers this year to take its total workforce to 38, and is looking to add more in the near future, said Youseok Nah, managing director of Daishin's IPO Group.
Daishin jumped from 10th among local banks last year on the country's ECM fee league table to rank sixth currently, the Refinitiv data showed.
""South Korea has never seen so much direct investment in IPO stocks by retail investors, especially those in their 20s-30s, until last year, when the stock market rebounded from the COVID-19 shock in early 2020 drew people's attention,"" Nah said.
'ELEVATED ACTIVITY'
The booming IPO activity has also boosted prospects for the foreign investment banks. Under local regulations, they have to partner with a domestic bank in order to manage IPOs in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
""You will see the activity level elevated compared to where it has been historically and a continuation of the Korean capital markets being more active,"" said Gregor Feige, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) co-head of Asia, excluding Japan, ECM.
Big listings like HYBE Co Ltd, the manager of global boy band phenomenon BTS, and e-commerce giant Coupang Inc in the United States have sharpened global investor focus on Korea, Feige said.
Global banks with their overseas networks are typically better placed to tap large foreign investors for equity issuance.
As a result, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lead the ECM fee league table in South Korea for the first time in three years after local banks dominated those spots since 2018, the Refinitiv data showed.

""What we are seeing is unique. The broadest set of companies ever are coming to the market after having prepared and waited throughout the initial phases of the COVID pandemic,"" said David Chung, Goldman's head of Korea investment banking.

U.S. July retail sales data later on Tuesday could take on added significance after last week's University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment slumped to its lowest in a decade.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast retail sales fell 0.2% after rising 0.6% in June. Any signs that consumer spending faltered by a larger degree given a resurgent Delta variant could prompt yet another market rethink on the taper timeline.
Indeed, a week ago (before Friday's sentiment survey) markets were confident that the Federal Reserve could discuss dialling back emergency stimulus as early as September given an improving jobs market.
Fed chief Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak. His words will be scrutinised closely for any more insights on Fed thinking.
Until then turmoil in Afghanistan and concern about rising COVID-19 cases look set to weigh on market sentiment globally. Asian shares declined, European stock market futures are flat to lower, while Wall Street is tipped to open lower later on.
Japan is set to extend its state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions to Sept. 12 as COVID cases spike.
The Kiwi dollar meanwhile slid more than 1% after New Zealand reported a new case of COVID-19, the first since February and a sudden risk to what has been one of the world's strongest economic recoveries.
That appears to be giving investors second thoughts over whether New Zealand's central bank will raise rates, as widely anticipated, when it meets Wednesday. The Aussie dollar is weaker too.
In Britain, data showed the number of employees on company payrolls rose by 182,000 in July from June, moving closer to pre-pandemic levels as the economy recovers from its coronavirus lockdowns.
And on the earnings front, Switzerland's biggest life insurer Swiss Life boosted first-half profit from operations by 13% to 889 million Swiss francs ($973.6 million).
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:
- Australia's central bank ready to act if lockdowns threaten economy - minutes.
- Euro zone flash unemployment data.
- U.S. July industrial production, business inventories.
- U.S. earnings:  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), La-z-y Boy
- European earnings: Fortum, Pandora (OTC:PANDY)
- Just Eat Takeaway.com reports a better-than-expected first-half operating loss of 190 million euros ($224 million).

- Germany to sell 6 bln euros of two-year bonds; UK to sells 2 bln pounds of 25-year bonds.

1641,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 02:07AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Chinese Regulatory Fears Weigh,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Tuesday, weighed by losses in Asia amid Covid, geopolitical concerns and fresh Chinese regulatory fears.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
European markets received a weak handover from Asia, with the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropping 1.8% after Chinese regulators issued a set of draft regulations for the internet sector on Tuesday, the latest move in a crackdown on the country's powerful tech companies.
The directives seek to ban unfair competition while restricting the use of user data, and resulted in a number of the important Hong Kong-listed internet stocks falling sharply.
This follows Chinese economic data on Monday pointing to a slowdown in growth at the region’s main economic driver due to rising cases of the highly-transmissible delta Covid variant and the measures taken to contain it, while the turmoil in Afghanistan is also denting investors' confidence. 
Back in Europe, the U.K. employment situation picked up in July as the country reopened fully from the Covid-induced lockdowns. The claimant count dropped 7,800, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in June.
The second reading of the second-quarter GDP release for the Eurozone is due later in the session, and should confirm the strong growth of 13.7% of the preliminary estimate.
In the corporate sector, the retail sector is likely to be in focus Tuesday with U.S. giants  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) set to release their second-quarter earnings before the market opens.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Tuesday, struggling to find support after Monday’s sharp losses on Covid-related fears for global demand.
The Energy Information Administration also noted Monday, in its monthly report, that U.S. shale oil output is expected to rise to 8.1 million barrels per day in September, the highest since May 2020. This puts the weekly crude inventory data by the American Petroleum Institute, due later Tuesday, firmly into focus.
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $66.94 a barrel, after dropping 1.7% Monday, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $69.38, after falling 1.5% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,793.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1767.

(Reuters) - Most Asian bonds faced foreign outflows in July, deterred by a rapid spread of the Delta coronavirus variant that raised concerns over the region's recovery.
Foreigners sold a combined net total $2.06 billion in Indonesia, Malaysian, Thai and Indian bonds, data from regulatory authorities and bond market associations showed.
""Global investors are likely cautious around upcoming Fed taper and the prospects of weaker Asian currencies. Current wave of virus resurgences across Asia and the resultant downside risks to regional growth are also weighing on investor sentiments,"" said Duncan Tan, a strategist at DBS Bank.
 
(Graphic: Foreign flows into Asian bonds https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znpneedyrvl/Foreign%20flows%20into%20Asian%20bonds.jpg)
 
On the other hand, they bought a net $8.07 billion worth of South Korean bonds last month, the data showed.
Tan said South Korean bonds tend to see stronger inflows during times of investor caution.
""Because, holding Korean Treasury Bonds on an FX-hedged basis tends to be a good hedge for weaker regional growth and global market volatility.""
The fast spread of the Delta variant in the region hit economic activity last month, with Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia reporting a contraction in manufacturing activity.
Malaysia faced foreign outflows worth $862 million, compared with outflows of $120 million in June.

Indonesia and Thailand saw net selling of $794 million and $302 million respectively.
Indian bonds also booked cross-border outflows for a seventh straight month, amounting a net $105 million.

""Asia's resurgent virus situation, especially among ASEAN economies, has prompted us to downgrade our 2021 growth and FX outlooks for the region,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asian research at ANZ.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Billionaire Kraft's paper mill causes pollution crisis in South Carolina,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - A South Carolina paper mill, whose foul smell has triggered more than 30,000 complaints, has become one of the dirtiest polluters in the United States since being acquired by an investment group led by Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots football team.
The complaints over large releases of hydrogen sulfide, a gas that smells like rotten eggs and causes headaches and even death in concentrated doses, from the New-Indy paper mill in Catawba, South Carolina, have resulted in federal and state orders to reduce its emissions. Three federal civil lawsuits have been filed against the company, alleging the odor is harming families.
However, no regulatory action has been taken against the mill for releasing soot, or small particulates, at levels exceeding mills run by larger rivals and by the country’s largest oil refineries. 
New-Indy’s most recent stack test in 2020 revealed small particle pollution that maxed out at nearly 300 pounds an hour. That hourly rate is up to 50 times higher than other large U.S. paper mills, according to a Reuters examination of disclosures with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
By comparison,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Corp’s Baton Rouge oil refinery averaged 138 pounds an hour during its latest available stack test, highest among U.S. refiners, according to industry test results.
Particulate matter is among the most harmful pollutants. Made up of particles 50 times smaller than a grain of sand, it can bond with other toxins, infiltrate the bloodstream, and damage the heart, lungs and nervous system.
New-Indy, in a statement, blamed the paper mill's elevated pollution levels during the 2020 test on problems with the feed of bark fuel into a boiler. The mill's performance was within federal limits, regulators said.
""New-Indy Catawba is committed to operating its facility in a safe and responsible manner,"" according to the statement. 
A joint venture between Schwarz Partners LP and Kraft Group Inc bought the South Carolina operation for about $300 million in 2019 from Montreal-based Resolute Forest (NYSE:RFP) Products Inc.
Kraft is best known as the owner of the National Football League’s Patriots, winner of six Super Bowl titles. His fortune, from paper mills, real estate and entertainment, is estimated at $6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
'PRISONERS IN OUR OWN SMELLY HOME' 
Meanwhile, late last year, the plant converted to making cardboard instead of bleached paper products. After the conversion, a build up of fiber waste in collection basins likely caused elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide at the plant, according to a New-Indy corrective action plan filed with regulators.
Since March, a hotline set up by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) has fielded more than 30,000 complaints about the smell.
“I haven’t seen anything like this in 20 years,” said Amy Armstrong, executive director of the South Carolina Environmental Law Project (SCELP), of the hydrogen sulfide releases.
In May, the EPA issued an emergency order for the New-Indy plant to reduce hydrogen sulfide emissions and to install air pollution monitors around the plant. 
As one resident put it, “We are prisoners in our own smelly home,” according to the narrative in the EPA’s emergency order.
During an April site visit by the EPA, inspectors recorded hydrogen sulfide levels as high as 15,900 parts per billion. Breathing problems, headaches and nausea can occur from prolonged exposures between 2,000 and 5,000 parts per billion, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
COMPARATIVELY HIGH SOOT LEVELS 
New-Indy's largest boiler, which uses wet bark and old tires to provide power for milling operations, produced particulate matter at an average rate of 157 pounds per hour, with peak production at 282 pounds per hour, according to 2020 results filed with the EPA.
During a stack test in 2016, when the plant was run by  Resolute Forest Products , particulate matter production at the same boiler averaged 100 pounds per hour, or 36% less than the average rate in 2020, stack test results show.
Paper mills run by  Domtar  (NYSE:UFS) Corp, International Paper Inc and WestRock (NYSE:WRK) Co showed much lower levels of small particulate matter production, according to stack tests reviewed by Reuters. 

International Paper's mill in Ticonderoga, New York, for example, produced only 13 pounds per hour of small particle pollution, according to a stack test this year.
""We're absolutely disturbed by New-Indy's comparatively high levels of particulate matter,"" SCELP staff attorney Michael Martinez said.

Earnings at the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela have been under pressure since it lost access to Venezuelan oil due to U.S. sanctions. Citgo is also battling possible seizure by creditors seeking to collect on unpaid debts incurred by PDVSA and Venezuela.
The eighth-largest U.S. refiner posted a $3 million profit, its first since the third quarter of 2019, for the three months ended June 30 as exports rose and the utilization rate at its plant in Lemont, Illinois hit 97%. It suffered a $5 million net loss in the second quarter a year ago. 
""Given the multiple challenges we have faced during 2020 and the first half of 2021, this return to profitability is particularly satisfying,"" Citgo Chief Executive Carlos Jordá said in a statement. Citgo fell deep into the red last year as the COVID-19 pandemic slashed demand for motor fuel. 
In May, it reduced production at its 418,000 barrel per day (bpd) Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery, the largest of its three facilities, after the Colonial fuel pipeline was taken out of commission for a week following a cyberattack. 
Total refinery throughput was 732,000 bpd, from 575,000 bpd a year earlier. Exports rose to 130,000 bpd, from 87,000 bpd a year earlier. However, its Corpus Christi, Texas plant ran at a weak 78% utilization rate, hurt by operational and third-party outages. 

A planned overhaul at Corpus Christi will be pushed back to the first quarter of next year, helping reduce expenses and lift production this year. 
""Citgo is well-positioned to benefit from a strengthening economy and demand for our products as we move into the second half of 2021,"" said Jorda.

The module replacements, which could start as early as later this month, come after GM recalled its 2017-2019 model year Bolt battery-powered cars for the second time in less than a year. Two fire incidents were reported after the initial recall, including one in a Bolt that had updated software.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said in a statement issued on Monday it would replace recalled vehicles' lithium ion battery modules with new modules, rather than replacing entire battery packs. ""The battery pack case, wiring and the other pack components are not defective and do not need replacing,"" it said.
GM said earlier the high-voltage batteries being recalled were produced at South Korean manufacturer LG Chem Ltd's Ochang facility in Korea. The automaker said on July 23 it and LG had identified the presence of two rare manufacturing defects in the same battery cell as the root cause of battery fires in certain Bolt EVs.
A spokesperson for LG Energy Solutions (LGES), a wholly owned LG Chem battery subsidiary, said LGES ""will actively cooperate to ensure that the recall measures are carried out smoothly.""
In late July, GM said its second-quarter results included $800 million in costs associated with the recall of Bolt EVs.
The automaker also asked owners to charge their vehicle after each use and avoid depleting the battery below approximately 70 miles of remaining range, where possible, to reduce the risk of a fire.

GM said it was still recommending customers park vehicles outside immediately after charging and not leave them charging overnight. It said customers should also seek out the software update issued as part of the initial recall.
The automaker plans to use a different-generation battery when it launches electric Hummer and Cadillac vehicles over the next year.

The Asia-focused insurer's value of new business (VONB), which measures expected profit from new premiums and is a gauge for future growth, rose by 22% to $1.81 billion in the January-to-June period.
VONB jumped 15% in AIA's largest market of mainland China, helping the company increase its interim dividend by 8.6% to 38.00 Hong Kong cents per share.

The Jay-Z-backed company also said Clorox (NYSE:CLX) Co executive Troy Datcher would replace Steve Allan as its chief executive officer, without giving a reason for the change.
Formed earlier this year with the merger of a blank-check firm and three Californian cannabis companies, TPCO sells edibles, vape concentrates and other pot-related products.
The cannabis industry has seen a boom in sales during the pandemic as people turned to marijuana for relaxation and entertainment, while hopes of U.S. federal legalization of weed have also benefited the sector.
TPCO has tried to capitalize on the demand surge by expanding its wholesale distribution network, which now spans more than 450 dispensaries in California. 
It also announced the purchase of a consumer delivery hub in Sacramento on Monday for an undisclosed sum, a move that is expected to help extend its reach to about 70% of California's population.
Net sales for the quarter were $54.2 million, more than a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $50.7 million, thanks to strong growth in the company's direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses.
TPCO said it expected to shift focus to more higher-margin product categories, with a goal of driving stronger direct-to-consumer sales.

Its strong results were mirrored by multi-state cannabis operator Ayr Wellness Inc, which raised its annual outlook after posting a more than threefold rise in second-quarter revenue.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 06:55PM ET</span>",U.S. opens probe into Tesla’s Autopilot over emergency vehicle crashes,"By David Shepardson and Hyunjoo Jin
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety regulators on Monday opened a formal safety probe into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's driver assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had identified 11 crashes since January 2018 in which Teslas ""have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes."" 
The probe will take in 765,000 U.S. vehicles with Autopilot built since 2014. Tesla shares closed down 4.3% on the news.
NHTSA, which closed an earlier investigation into Autopilot in 2017 without taking any action, has come under fire for failing to ensure the safety of the system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods.
After the new probe, the auto safety agency could opt to take no action, or it could demand a recall, which might effectively impose limits on how, when and where Autopilot operates.
Any restrictions could narrow the competitive gap between Tesla's system and similar advanced driver assistance systems offered by established automakers.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chief Executive Elon Musk has repeatedly defended Autopilot and in April tweeted that ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""
NHTSA said it had reports of 17 injuries and one death in the 11 crashes, including the December 2019 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.
The 11 crashes included four this year and it had opened a preliminary evaluation of Autopilot in the 2014-2021 Tesla Models Y, X, S, and 3. The crashes involved vehicles ""all confirmed to have been engaged in either Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control,"" it said.
Before NHTSA could demand a recall, it must first upgrade an investigation into an engineering analysis. The two-step investigative process often takes a year or more.
AFTER DARK
NHTSA said most of the 11 crashes took place after dark and crash scenes included measures like emergency vehicle lights, flares or road cones.
Its investigation will assess technologies ""used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver's engagement"" with driving when using Autopilot operation.
Musk tweeted last month that Tesla's advanced camera-only driver assistance system, known as ""Tesla Vision,"" will soon ""capture turn signals, hazards, ambulance/police lights & even hand gestures.""
Autopilot was operating in at least three fatal Tesla U.S. crashes since 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has said.
The NTSB has criticized Tesla's lack of system safeguards for Autopilot and NHTSA's failure to ensure the safety of Autopilot.
NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy on Monday praised the new probe. She said the board has urged the agency to develop standards for drive monitoring systems and require automakers to ""incorporate system safeguards that limit the use of automated vehicle control systems to those conditions for which they were designed.""
In February 2020, Tesla's director of autonomous driving technology, Andrej Karpathy, identified a challenge for its Autopilot system: how to recognize when a parked police car's emergency flashing lights are turned on.
""This is an example of a new task we would like to know about,"" Karpathy said at a conference.
KEY CONCERNS 
Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, said the parked emergency crashes ""really seem to illustrate in vivid and even tragic fashion some of the key concerns with Tesla's system.""
NHTSA, he said, ""has been far too deferential and timid, particularly with respect to Tesla.""
Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey, who have previously questioned the Autopilot system, urged a thorough and transparent probe that would lead to improvements in the safety of Tesla's automated driving and driver assistance technology and ""prevent future crashes.""
NHTSA said Monday it has sent teams to review 31 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths since 2016 where it suspected advanced driver assistance systems use. It ruled out Autopilot in three of the crashes.

It noted that ""no commercially available motor vehicles today are capable of driving themselves"" and said drivers must use them correctly and responsibly.
NHTSA has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since January 2017. President Joe Biden has yet to nominate anyone for the post.

But healthcare gained 1.1%, the best-performing S&P 500 sector. Utilities and consumer staples -- also generally regarded as defensive sectors -- further bolstered market gains.
The S&P 500 and the Dow both posted record high closes for their fifth straight sessions, even after the major indexes were initially well in the red.
""There is just huge amounts of liquidity, massive amounts of cash out there, both on corporate balance sheets and in private investors’ pockets, and because of that every tiny dip that there is, people look for bargains and they buy and they keep it buoyant,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 110.02 points, or 0.31%, to 35,625.4, the S&P 500 gained 11.71 points, or 0.26%, to 4,479.71 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.14 points, or 0.2%, to 14,793.76.
A rebound in the U.S. economy including a stellar second-quarter corporate earnings season along with accommodative monetary policy has underpinned positive sentiment for equities. The S&P 500 has gained 100% since its March 2020 low.
“The overall environment remains supportive of risk assets, so there is a gravitational pull upward for stocks,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.
Investors are looking for signs about when the Federal Reserve will rein in its easy money policies, with minutes from the central bank's latest meeting due on Wednesday. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the impact on the economy are keeping markets on edge, with investors watching earnings reports from major retailers due later in the week.
Investors were also digesting news from Afghanistan, where thousands of civilians desperate to flee the country thronged Kabul airport after the Taliban seized the capital.
In company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell 4.3% after U.S. auto safety regulators said they had opened a formal safety probe into the company's driver assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving emergency vehicles.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 68 new 52-week highs and one new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 259 new lows.
About 8.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 9.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin sued the U.S government over NASA's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to Elon Musk's SpaceX.
Blue Origin said its lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims on Friday is ""an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA’s Human Landing System.""
It added it believes ""the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America.""
Last month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) sided with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration over its decision to pick a single lunar lander provider, rejecting Blue Origin's protest.
Blue Origin's lawsuit remains under seal. NASA must file a response to the challenge by Oct. 12.
""NASA officials are currently reviewing details of the case,"" the agency said in a statement. ""With our partners, we will go to the Moon and stay to enable science investigations, develop new technology, and create high paying jobs for the greater good and in preparation to send astronauts to Mars.""
The agency added, ""as soon as possible, the agency will provide an update on the way forward for returning to the Moon as quickly and as safely as possible under Artemis.""
Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics have argued that NASA was required to make multiple awards. The GAO said it ""denied the protest arguments that NASA acted improperly in making a single award to SpaceX.""
Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s founder, billionaire Bezos, said earlier it remained convinced there were ""fundamental issues"" with NASA's decision and that GAO was not able to address them ""due to their limited jurisdiction.""
Blue Origin said it will continue to advocate for two immediate providers as it believes that to be the right solution.
SpaceX, which is headed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's CEO, Musk, did not immediately comment on Monday.
NASA had sought proposals for a spacecraft that would carry astronauts to the lunar surface under its Artemis program to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972.
In April, NASA awarded SpaceX a contract to build such a spacecraft as early as 2024.

Blue Origin had contended NASA gave SpaceX an unfair advantage by letting it revise its pricing.
Bezos has offered to cover up to $2 billion in NASA costs if the U.S. space agency awarded Blue Origin a lunar landing contract.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said on Monday it trimmed or eliminated its stakes in several pharmaceutical companies, and reported a small new stake in a Merck & Co spinoff, Organon & Co.
In the second quarter, Berkshire said it exited a $180 million stake in Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) and reduced investments in Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co and Merck.
It also shed a $411 million stake in paint maker Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE:AXTA) Ltd, a Berkshire holding since 2015.
The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed holdings as of June 30.
Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks in 2021, including in the second quarter when it sold $1.1 billion more stocks than it bought.
That suggests Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler remain wary of valuations as stock prices regularly set new highs.
The Standard & Poor's has doubled from its March 2020 trough early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Berkshire has instead bought back about $14.3 billion of its own stock between January and late July though its share price also set records, and now sits just 2% below its May 7 peak.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate ended June with $144.1 billion of cash and equivalents. Berkshire also owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.
Organon specializes in contraception and other women's health products, and has dozens of brands in other fields.
Berkshire reported a $46.9 million Organon stake as of June 30.
Its largest investments on that date were $124.3 billion in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and $42.6 billion in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).

In Monday's filing, Berkshire also reported lowered stakes in  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), media company Liberty Global Plc (NASDAQ:LBTYA), insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB).
It reported increased stakes in supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, home furnishings chain RH (NYSE:RH) and Marsh rival Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc, which under regulatory pressure called off a $30 billion merger with Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) Plc last month.

Therefore, Wall Street analysts predict energy stocks Suncor (SU), Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV),  PDC Energy  (NASDAQ:PDCE), and Matador Resources (NYSE:MTDR) will rally more than 50% in price in the near term. Let’s discuss.Oil prices have been declining from their recent multi-year highs as rising COVID-19 cases threaten global oil demand. However, solid progress on the vaccination front and what seems like a resilient global economic recovery should prevent oil prices from falling significantly. Many analysts expect robust demand growth to continue through the end of the year, which should allow oil prices to remain stable in the coming months. Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC expect the world’s thirst for oil to return to pre-pandemic highs in the second half of next year.
As the U.S. economic recovery continues with the recent approval by the Senate of a large infrastructure spending bill, provisions for the development of the energy sector should facilitate the industry’s long-term growth despite short-term headwinds.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts predict energy stocks  Suncor Energy Inc.  (NYSE:SU), Ovintiv Inc. (OVV), PDC Energy, Inc. (PDCE), and Matador Resources Company (MTDR) will rally by more than 50% in the coming months.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 05:21PM ET</span>",Investors scratch out stock gains while weighing covid concerns,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Investors managed to shrug off new concerns about China's economy, the coronavirus Delta variant and turmoil in Afghanistan to largely drive stocks higher while also boosting some more defensive investments.
Wall Street rebounded after early losses on Monday to see two of its three major indices close higher, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the only index to end the day lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 110.02 points, or 0.31%, the S&P 500 gained 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.2%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 1.24 points, or 0.17%.
The ability to shake off new concerns about the viability of a global economic comeback and chaotic images out of Afghanistan underscored the appeal of U.S. stocks, according to analysts.
""I would have expected much more downside given a difficult weekend of geopolitical headlines in the Middle East and since the good news of earnings season is now behind us,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer for The Bahnsen Group. ""The 'there is no alternative' trade is very resilient right now, which is benefiting U.S. stocks, as there simply aren't attractive alternatives for stock investors outside of the U.S."" 
At the same time, safe-haven investments such as gold, the dollar and U.S. Treasuries saw increased investor demand amid appetite for lower-risk avenues with so much uncertainty globally. 
""We still remain positive on the outlook and think rates trend higher and cyclical sectors have another leg of outperformance, but admittedly there are downside risks given the Delta variant,"" said Stephanie Roth, senior markets economist with J.P. Morgan Private Bank. 
The dollar ticked up against a basket of six major currencies, rising 0.1% to 92.623 after dropping to a one-week low on Friday.
In more risk-off moves, U.S. Treasury yields slipped as demand for safe-haven U.S. bonds ticked up. Benchmark 10-year yields fell four basis points to 1.256%, after getting as low as 1.223%. The yield curve between two- and 10-year notes flattened two basis points to 105 basis points.
Gold also got a boost from safe-haven sentiment. Spot gold ticked up 0.5% to $1,787 per ounce. U.S. gold futures were up 0.6% at $1,789. [GOL/]
Muted investor appetite kicked off the week after figures on July retail sales, industrial production and urban investment in China all missed forecasts, a trend that is only likely to get worse given the recent tightening in coronavirus restrictions there. [L1N2PN03I]
Further adding to dour investor sentiment was the sudden collapse of the Afghan government and what it may mean for political stability in the region.
Oil prices settled lower, shrinking steep earlier losses after sources told Reuters that OPEC and its allies believe the markets do not need more oil than they plan to release in the coming months.

Brent crude settled down $1.08, or 1.5%, at $69.51 a barrel after falling to $68.14. U.S. oil fell by $1.15, or 1.7%, to $67.29 after reaching lows of $65.73. [O/R]
Another major focus for investors this week will be Wednesday's release of minutes from the July policy meeting at the Federal Reserve. Markets will be looking for signals the Fed is preparing to begin easing back on its monthly bond purchases. Recent strong jobs data from the United States is boosting expectations that the Fed could step back the stimulus sooner.

Gensler said in a video message that there is a lot that American investors don’t know about some Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. stock exchanges. His remarks come just weeks after the regulator halted initial public offerings of Chinese companies until they boost disclosures.
“That means disclosing the political and regulatory risk that the government of China could, as they’ve done a number of times recently, significantly change the rules in the middle of the game,” Gensler said in the video.
Gensler said that he’s asked SEC staff to take “a pause for now” in green-lighting IPOs of shell companies that Chinese firms use to list shares in the U.S. and wants investors to have more information. He also repeated his warning that U.S. officials must be allowed to inspect Chinese firms’ financial audits.
His comments come amid a crackdown in China on private industry, including moves by Beijing to ban a swath of private-education firms from making profits. The actions have triggered a dramatic selloff in shares as investors reassess how far the government will go in tightening its grip on the economy.

Investing.com -- Stocks ticked mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off concerning news about economic weakness in China and the possibility of slowing global growth. 
Disappointing data from China weighed on oil prices, which slumped and dragged down the entire energy sector. In China, industrial production was significantly weaker than expected. 
Even in the U.S., however, there were signs of slowing growth as headlines blared the continued ongoing threat of a spreading Covid outbreak linked to the contagious Delta variant. The August Empire State index fell to 18.3 from 43 in July. Analysts had forecast a reading of 28.5.
 Sonos Inc  (NASDAQ:SONO) shares jumped after a judge ruled that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google had infringed on some of the company's patents. An important ban could be imposed for some of Google's Pixel smartphones and Nest audio speakers.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, fell after the U.S. government launched an investigation into the safety of the electric automaker's driver assistance system after multiple crashes during the last three years.
It’s retail earnings week. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Walmart earnings
Big retailers will have some tough comparisons to last year, when the pandemic forced people to hunker down at home and order stuff online for delivery or curbside pickup. One of the biggest beneficiaries of that trend was Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), which reports its earnings on Tuesday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect it to post revenue of $136.63 billion and earnings per share of $1.56.
2.  Home Depot  earnings
The pandemic also inspired a wave of home improvement projects as bored do-it-yourselfers took the opportunity to add that deck or refurnish their vacation home. That trend is ongoing, and the housing boom is also boosting home improvement retailers. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is expected to report second-quarter earnings per share of $4.42 on revenue of $40.48 billion.
3. Retail sales for July
In the spring, households were flooded with stimulus checks that spurred spending, but that likely cooled more recently, especially as a number of states have cut off extra federal pandemic unemployment assistance. Retail sales are likely to have fallen 0.2% in July on a month-on-month basis after a 0.6% rise in June. The data are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, to a new record intraday high of 4,475.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, or 56 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.26%.
Energy fell more than 1%, dragging the broader the market lower, as oil prices slumped on demand concerns after softer economic data from China triggered concerns about the global recovery.
""In the short term, concerns about the spread of the Delta variant in China, and the effects this will have on oil demand, are continuing to weigh on prices,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. ""These concerns were additionally fuelled by data published overnight in China: industrial production turned out to be significantly softer than anticipated.""
In another sign of slowing growth, The August Empire State index fell to 18.3 from 43.0 in July, missing economists' estimates of 28.5.
Treasury yields slipped on global growth concerns, pushing banking stocks sharply lower. Declining interest rates are the enemy of banks as it reduces their net interest margin.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) slipped less than 1%. 
But yields aren't expected to fall for a prolonged period because of a robust labor market, and the expected tightening of Federal Reserve monetary policy. 
""We are not losing confidence in our view that US Treasury yields and the US dollar are headed higher. Labor market strength and a powerful wealth effect should prevent the same loss of confidence in other household measures that was seen in the University of Michigan survey,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note, adding that the ""Fed taper [is] on tap.""
Industrials were above flatline, however, as defense companies including Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), and Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) climbed.   
Technology stocks, often a benefactor of falling yields, gained slightly as megacap tech was mostly higher. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the green, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was flat.
Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO), meanwhile, jumped 7% after a winning a judge ruled that Alphabet's Google had infringed on some of the company's patents. An important ban could be imposed for some of Google's Pixel smartphones and Nest audio speakers.
In earnings news, oat milk producer Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) reported quarterly results that fell short of the Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company also announced plans to boost oat base production, citing increased demand. Its share price was fell about 3%.

Furthermore, with several federal policies now approved to tackle the domestic semiconductor shortage, semiconductor manufacturers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM),  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)—all three of which have a focus on 5G—are expected to witness solid growth. So, let’s pore over these names.The commercial deployment of 5G has begun. Leading telecom giants are expanding their network infrastructure to deliver next-generation connectivity to remote parts of the country. Furthermore, substantial government funding is expected to be provided to ensure 5G availability across the United States. For example, the Senate-approved Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to provide $65 billion to fund universal broadband accessibility goals.
However, the global semiconductor shortage is a major headwind that is currently hamstringing the 5G rollout. Regarding this, Evercore analyst James Ratcliffe said, “Overall, you’re looking at some time in the end of ‘21 to end of ‘23 to get two-thirds of the country’s population covered with a 5G service.”
The federal government has already provided $52 billion in funding to the domestic semiconductor industry through the CHIPS for America Act. Given this backdrop, we believe semiconductor companies Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI), and Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO), which facilitate 5G network infrastructure, should grow substantially in the coming months.

Read on.While the Federal Reserve expects the increase in inflation to be transitory and is likely to continue maintaining low-interest rates, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases with the rapid spread of the Delta variant, rising geopolitical tensions related to the Afghan government’s collapse, and concerns over the global economic recovery will likely keep the stock market highly volatile in the near term. While the long-term impact of geopolitical tensions on the U.S. stock market is still uncertain, the major benchmark indexes sagged this morning.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to secure some income by betting on fundamentally sound dividend-paying stocks, particularly with Treasury Yields declining.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big Wall Street banks have started enforcing stricter mask and vaccine requirements for staff, sometimes communicating them behind the scenes, in an effort to combat coronavirus infections in their offices while avoiding a fierce national debate about individual rights, sources at the banks and consultants who work with them told Reuters.
Specifics differ, but many big banks have tightened up policies or pushed back return-to-office dates from just a month ago. https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-street-sticks-with-back-office-plans-delta-variant-sparks-fears-2021-08-05
Now,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have the toughest rules at their New York headquarters, where staff entering must be vaccinated.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) have not mandated vaccines https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-employers-get-religion-with-vaccine-mandates-2021-08-12 the same way, but both require unvaccinated workers to wear masks and get tested at least weekly.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) will only allow vaccinated staff to return to its offices in early September, while encouraging other employees to get inoculated.
The widespread availability of coronavirus vaccines in the United States caused infections to drop dramatically from January to June, but driven largely by the Delta variant, the current 7-day moving average of daily new cases is up 35 percent, according to Reuters tracking data. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co pushed back its return to office start date to October because of an increased risk from the Delta variant.
Behind the scenes, executive committees have been debating policies and how to express them for weeks. Although sources inside the banks say the majority of Wall Street's workforce has been vaccinated, there remains a vocal group of employees who do not want to get shots for health or religious reasons, as well as some who feel that any mandate infringes on their personal rights.
""It's, like, on a wing and a prayer that people are saying they are going to require this,"" said a senior executive at one of the large banks who requested anonymity to discuss high-level internal discussions.
Sending mandates through company-wide memos can stir outrage not only from employees who oppose them, but from politicians and right-wing groups that sometimes use big banks as political targets, the executive said. When new requirements have been reported in the press, some of the banks have experienced backlash, leading them to communicate changes more quietly, sources said.
Citigroup announced its vaccination mandate through a LinkedIn post. Morgan Stanley has stopped sending coronavirus policy updates through email and instead has managers communicate directives to staff in small groups or individually.
Morgan Stanley's policies vary by region.
There is also some risk of employees suing banks, either because they got sick at the office due to a coronavirus outbreak, or because they oppose mask and vaccination requirements, sources said.
Outside the financial sector there have been some attempts to sue, but judges have been siding with employers, said Jacqueline Voronov, a labor and employment attorney at Hall Booth Smith.
""The courtroom doors are always open,"" she said. ""Can you bring a claim? Yes. Will it be successful? Most likely, no.""
The banks are walking a fine line as they try to encourage staff to get vaccinated and return to offices, while avoiding backlash from them, as well as legal, political and headline risk, said Adam Galinsky, a Columbia Business School professor who specializes in leadership, decision-making and ethics.
Companies generally need employees to be engaged with their responsibilities, rather than worried about getting sick or caught up in fierce social debates.

As a result, it makes sense that the banks are quietly urging staff to get vaccinated and enforcing tougher mask and testing policies for now, but, eventually, Galinsky expects them to move toward hard line mandates for all staff.
""They are trying to find that right pathway,"" he said.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>","U.S. court revives nearly 6,000 lawsuits over 3M surgical warming device","By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday revived nearly 6,000 lawsuits alleging that a widely used device produced by 3M Co to keep surgical patients warm caused them to develop infections.
The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Minnesota judge overseeing the litigation over 3M's Bair Hugger device had wrongly excluded testimony from medical experts supporting the plaintiffs' claims.
""Thousands of individuals who were injured by this defective and dangerous device will now have their day in court,"" said Michael Sacchet, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
""We are confident in our case and will continue to vigorously defend ourselves,"" 3M said in a statement. ""We are exploring all next steps and options to challenge the opinion.""
Bair Hugger consists of a central unit, hose and blanket, and is used to decrease bleeding, improve recovery times and decrease the risk of infections for patients during operations.
The plaintiffs claimed that the device was defective because it transferred antibiotic-resistant bacteria into open surgical wounds, either by disrupting airflow in the operating room or through contamination of the device itself.
U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen in Minneapolis had found in 2019 that the allegations lacked scientific support, leading her to toss all of the lawsuits.
But the 8th Circuit said that while there were ""weaknesses"" in the opinions of the plaintiffs' experts, they were not ""so fundamentally unsupported that they had to be excluded.""

A jury had in 2018 cleared 3M of liability in the first Bair Hugger trial, involving a South Carolina man who said the device caused an infection after his 2010 hip replacement surgery.
In its most recent quarterly report, 3M had not set aside money for Bair Hugger litigation, saying ""any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time.""

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>","Detroit sticks with trucks, SUVs despite lofty 2030 goals for EVs","By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - The future may belong to electric cars, but for U.S. automakers, trucks will rule for years to come.
Automakers in North America plan to build more big pickups and sport utility vehicles than electric vehicles well into the late 2020s, chasing sales trends that run counter to the Biden administration's goal of boosting EVs to half the market by 2030, according to internal production forecasts viewed by Reuters.
The popularity of Detroit's big trucks is a challenge both to the industry and efforts by lawmakers and regulators to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other exhaust gas pollutants from combustion engines. 
Unflagging demand among American consumers for full-size trucks and SUVs, among the industry's most profitable vehicles, will largely fund a combined $100 billion in investment commitments for new North American EV and battery plants by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV . Factories that build Detroit's trucks employ thousands of union workers - a key constituency for President Joe Biden.
At the same time, Detroit’s combustion-powered large pickup trucks and SUVs generate on average more than twice the CO2 over their lifetimes as the typical electric vehicle, according to a Reuters analysis of data https://tmsnrt.rs/2X6EL6O generated by Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET modeling tool - the same model used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
(GRAPHIC-Lifetime CO2 emissions by vehicle type Lifetime CO2 emissions by vehicle type: https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-CLIMATECHANGE/TRUCKS/egvbkndeqpq/chart.png) 
The three automakers in a joint statement https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0805-electric.html on Aug. 5 described as a ""shared aspiration"" Biden’s target of pushing EVs to 40-50% of production by 2030. That goal would mean boosting annual North American output of electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to 7 million vehicles or more.
The entire industry, however, is planning as of now to build just 2.6 million battery electric vehicles (BEV) and another 585,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) in 2028, according to AutoForecast Solutions (AFS), which compiles production estimates that are widely used across the industry. 
(GRAPHIC-Auto plants will build more trucks than EVs for years: https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-CLIMATECHANGE/TRUCKS/dwvkrgwnypm/chart.png) 
If automakers stick to those plans, EVs would https://tmsnrt.rs/2XaeLaF account for just 15% of total North American production in 2028, with plug-in hybrids representing another 3.4%. 
In that case, automakers would have to more than double EV and PHEV production within two years between 2028 and 2030 in order to hit Biden’s low-end target of 40%.
AutoForecast's outlook is consistent with the U.S. government's own predictions.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Aug. 5 that it expects electric and hybrid vehicles to account for 8% of U.S. car and light truck sales by 2026, a shade under AutoForecast's projection of 10-11%. 
Researcher IHS Markit on Aug. 9 estimated automakers would need at least 18% of their total sales to derive from EVs in 2026 - a figure in line with AutoForecast's estimate - in order to have a realistic chance of meeting the proposed 2030 targets.
""Far more demand for electric vehicles will be needed in order to hit the 2030 goal of 40-50%,"" said Sam Fiorani, head of AFS global vehicle forecasting. But ""many buyers will come up with excuses not to make the switch"" to EVs from vehicles with combustion engines.
POSSIBLE EV SHORTFALL 
A shortfall in EV demand, while pickup and SUV sales remain robust, could hamper a broader effort to combat climate change.
""We're going to have to find some way to make those predictions fall short,"" said Mary Nichols, former chair of the California Air Resources Board and a longtime clean-air advocate.
""It's not just about the companies, (which) are doing their best to design and build electric vehicles that people want and make sure there are batteries that get greater range and that there will be charging available. That part is moving pretty fast (but) it's going to have to go faster,"" said Nichols, a board member of Veloz, a California-based industry-government coalition advocating greater electric vehicle use.
Automakers have been careful to frame their electric vehicle sales goals as dependent on consumer demand and government subsidies.
""We’ve said for months that Ford expects battery-electric vehicles to be at least 40% of our global volume by 2030. That’s not an aspiration - it’s what we’re anticipating,"" a Ford spokesperson told Reuters. ""We believe we’ll be well-positioned for BEVs to account for 40% to 50% of our U.S. sales by then."" 
GM reiterated what it termed its ""aspiration"" to eliminate tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles by 2035, as well as its aspiration to push EVs to 40-50% of its sales volume by 2030.
Stellantis said it does not comment on speculation about future products.
The present-day reality for all U.S. automakers - other than electric-vehicle leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc - is that trucks and SUVs are in high demand, with consumers willing to pay premium prices for them. Electric vehicles from established automakers are still niche models. 

The industry this year expects to build 3.3 million full-size pickups and SUVs in North America, according to the latest AFS forecast. Virtually all of them will be powered by gasoline or diesel engines. In 2028, that number is expected to climb to 3.75 million - and only a fraction of those will be offered with electric motors and battery packs.
With production this year hampered by a global shortage of semiconductors https://www.reuters.com/article/chips-shortage-explainer-int/explainer-why-is-there-a-global-chip-shortage-and-why-should-you-care-idUSKBN2BN30J, GM, Ford and Stellantis cannot keep sufficient supplies of these vehicles in stock at dealers, many of whom are commanding a premium above the manufacturers' suggested list prices for the hottest models.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -London-based  Pearson  PLC (LON:PSON) will pay $1 million to settle charges it misled investors about a 2018 cyber intrusion involving the theft of millions of student records, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Monday.
The educational-publishing firm did not admit nor deny the regulator's charges, the SEC said, but in 2019 the firm disclosed in its annual report that the data breach may have included birth dates and email addresses, when, in fact, it knew that such records were stolen.
Pearson also said at the time that it had ""strict protections"" in place, but failed to patch the critical vulnerability for six months after it was notified, the SEC found.
""Pearson opted not to disclose this breach to investors until it was contacted by the media, and even then Pearson understated the nature and scope of the incident, and overstated the company's data protections,"" said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC enforcement division's cyber unit.
""As public companies face the growing threat of cyber intrusions, they must provide accurate information to investors about material cyber incidents.""
Pearson spokesman Tom Steiner said the company's data breach involved a web-based software tool that was retired in July 2019, and that the firm ""continues to enhance its cyber security efforts to minimise the risk of cyberattacks in an ever-changing threat landscape.""
It has also agreed to cease and desist from committing violations of cyber-related disclosure provisions in addition to paying the civil penalty, the SEC said.

The top U.S. markets watchdog has brought a handful of other cybersecurity disclosure cases, including its nearly $500,000 fine in 2019 of real estate title insurance company First American and a $35 million settlement in 2018 to resolve allegations that Yahoo didn’t tell investors about a data breach.
It also warned companies in a 2018 report on corporations that were victims of cyber fraud that publicly-traded companies must adopt robust internal controls to detect cyber threats.

By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) -PharmaCann, one of the 10 original cannabis licensees in New York, has confidentially filed for an initial public offering that could value it at well over $1 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The planned IPO would help PharmaCann raise funds before New York state begins recreational weed sales, expected sometime next year. The IPO could take place this fall, one of the sources said.
PharmaCann, which operates in five other U.S. states, is likely to seek to dual-list its shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange and for over-the-counter trading in the United States, one of the sources said.
PharmaCann has tapped Canadian investment bank Canaccord Genuity for the offering. Canaccord is expected to be the lead underwriter, while more banks are likely to be hired, the sources said. Canaccord did not offer an immediate comment.
A PharmaCann spokesperson declined to comment.
Sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.
New York in March became the 16th U.S. state to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, kickstarting a race from companies to secure a position in a market expected to be among the world's biggest.
Canadian rival Cronos Group Inc took a 10.5% stake in PharmaCann for $110.4 million in June. That deal valued PharmaCann at $1.1 billion, and the IPO would likely be a higher valuation, the sources said.
PharmaCann, which currently operates four medical cannabis retail stores and a cultivation facility in New York, submitted paperwork for its IPO to U.S. and Canadian regulators during the past 30 to 45 days, two of the sources said.
PharmaCann rival AWH Holdings Inc listed in May, and the shares have climbed 38% since, giving it a market value of $1.9 billion
Despite growing state-level legalization of marijuana, it remains federally illegal and companies like PharmaCann, which grow or sell the plant, are prohibited from listing on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.
Some 18 U.S. states have now legalized recreational use of weed, while 36 allow medical use. U.S. legal cannabis sales could reach $45 billion in 2025, according to analysts at JMP Securities.

PharmaCann has received multiple takeover offers in the last few months, including from blank-check firms, the sources added. Despite the confidential filing, PharmaCann could still decide to scrap the IPO and stay private or take a different route to go public, the sources said.
PharmaCann had agreed to be taken over by New York rival MedMen Enterprises (OTC:MMNFF) Inc in 2018 for around $700 million, but that deal fell apart the following year.

Investing.com – Oatly ADR (NASDAQ:OTLY) rose 1.7% Monday as the company forecast a jump in revenue while it undertakes capacity expansion.
The Swedish maker of dairy alternatives said it expects annual revenue to rise to at least $690 million, above estimates of $681.4 million, according to Reuters.
The company commissioned new capacities and expanded at the existing facilities to tap the booming demand for vegan milk alternatives.
The company said it will boost capacity at its Utah manufacturing facility by 50%, according to Reuters. Its Singapore plant started production early last month and the company said its Maanshan plant in China is on track for launch in the second half.
Oatly said it is benefiting from its exclusive U.S. oat milk supply agreement with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The coffee brewer accounted for 27% of its sales in the second quarter.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>",India's overseas listing rules delayed due to tax concerns-sources,"By Aftab Ahmed, Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India will take around six months to announce rules allowing companies to list overseas, taking longer than some expected as the finance ministry irons out issues related to taxation, two government officials and four industry sources told Reuters.
The delay is likely to dampen hopes of investors like Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed and many Indian startups who last month urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi https://reut.rs/3AISors to swiftly announce rules governing foreign listings that were given the go-ahead almost a year ago.
Two senior government officials said the rules will only be announced with the February federal budget as there was no decision yet on how the government should tax big investors and retail traders when they trade Indian companies listed abroad.
A key concern is to ensure that big venture capital and foreign investors pay an equal long-term capital gains tax - roughly around 10% - even if they exit an Indian company listed on foreign bourses like Nasdaq, said the six sources familiar with these private discussions. 
Three industry sources said that to convince the Indian government, some investors, merchant bankers and startups have suggested that an investor's exit from an Indian company that may list abroad can be taxed as per Indian laws, if that investor has a significant shareholding of 10-20%.
A senior government official said: ""We haven’t reached a final decision yet or decided the structure ... We would want to get the tax if any investor exits, does not matter where it is planning to list.""
India's finance ministry, which is working on the new rules, did not respond to a request for comment.
Another concern the government was trying to address was whether it can garner tax from foreign retail investors trading in an Indian stock listed abroad, but it has decided to exempt such transactions, said the two government officials.
The rules though will clarify that Indian nationals making profits on such trades abroad will be liable to face taxation as per local laws, they added.
CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT 
The debate comes as local firms see improved prospects that they can achieve big valuations with domestic listings following the stellar debut https://www.reuters.com/technology/ant-backed-zomato-jumps-53-above-offer-price-india-market-debut-2021-07-23 on Indian bourses of Ant Group-backed Indian food delivery firm Zomato which valued the firm at $13 billion. 
But many investors and startups want the option of a foreign listing as they say companies get better access to capital and higher valuations. Some 22 investors and top Indian startups urged Modi in a July letter to expedite the overseas listing rules, calling it an ""unfinished reform agenda"".
""Further delay in rules will hurt the startup ecosystem as many companies are at the verge of deciding their foreign listing plans,"" said one venture-capital industry source.
Overseas listing is a controversial subject in India. 
Its opponents include Swadeshi Jagran Manch -- the economic wing of the ideological parent of Modi's ruling party -- which fears such listings will mean less Indian regulatory oversight of domestic firms and could hit the growth ambitions of capital markets in India.

""Indian investors also will not get (the) same access to these companies if they only list abroad,"" the group's co-convener Ashwani Mahajan told Reuters.
The London Stock Exchange told Reuters last year https://www.reuters.com/article/india-stocks-lse-listing-idINKBN26U1BZ it had been in talks with several Indian tech firms on overseas listings.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",Bayer takes legal battle over Roundup cancer claims to U.S. Supreme Court,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Bayer, trying to contain billions of dollars in legal costs, filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an appeals court verdict that upheld damages to a customer blaming his cancer on the German group's glyphosate-based weedkillers.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) last week lost a third appeal against verdicts that sided with users of glyphosate-based Roundup, awarding them tens of millions of dollars each, leaving the drugs and pesticides group to pin hopes for relief on the United States' top court.
Bayer on Monday asked the Supreme Court to review one such verdict by the federal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found in favour of California resident and Roundup user Edwin Hardeman, it said in a statement.
The maker of aspirin, Yasmin birth-control pills and stroke prevention drug Xarelto has repeatedly argued that the cancer claims over Roundup go against sound science and product clearance from the federal environmental regulator.
“The Ninth Circuit’s errors mean that a company can be severely punished for marketing a product without a cancer warning when the near-universal scientific and regulatory consensus is that the product does not cause cancer, and the responsible federal agency has forbidden such a warning,"" the company said.
Roundup-related lawsuits have dogged the company since it acquired the brand as part of its $63 billion purchase of agricultural seeds and pesticides maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
Bayer struck a settlement deal in principle with plaintiffs last year but failed to win court approval for a separate agreement on how to handle future cases, as it intended to keep the product on the market.
Last month, it took an additional litigation provision of $4.5 billion to cover any unfavourable ruling by the Supreme Court. That came on top of $11.6 billion it previously set aside for settlements and litigation over the matter.

Among other measures to contain the legal onslaught, Bayer plans to replace glyphosate in weedkillers for the U.S. residential market with other active ingredients. 
It will, however, continue to sell the herbicide to farmers, who rely on it heavily, and whose role in the litigation has been described as negligible by Bayer.

Read on.While the launch of the iPhone 12 series was delayed last year due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch iPhone 13 by the end of September. In addition to a super-fast 5G modem, the model is expected to have a better display and a significantly improved camera. And according to a Bloomberg report, AAPL is boosting its production by 20% to 90 million units, anticipating high demand.
Forty-four percent of iPhone owners are expected to buy the new iPhone, according to a survey by SellCell. iPhone sales accounted for 48.6% of AAPL’s net sales in the third quarter (ended June 26, 2021). Also, the sales from its iPhone segment increased 49.8% year-over-year to $39.57 billion in the third quarter. While AAPL is expected to benefit significantly from the forthcoming iPhone 13, some quality iPhone suppliers will also likely benefit.

Its shares soared to hit their 52-week price high of $9.79 on January 27, 2021, driven by the meme frenzy. However, the Finland-based company’s fundamentals are also strong. It generated EUR 77 million ($90.81 million) in free cash flow (FCF) in the second quarter, representing its fifth consecutive quarter of positive FCF.
The stock has gained 56.5% year-to-date and 28.8% over the past three months to close Friday’s trading session at $6.12.

Investing.com – Seagate stock (NASDAQ:STX) stock rose 1% Monday following an upgrade by UBS (NYSE:UBS), which sees the stock at $105, an upside of 15% from its current level of $91.31.
Analyst Timothy Arcuri now rates the stock a buy from neutral earlier.
Seagate is a data storage company. The analyst said that the hard drive sector is now at a structural inflection point as it is giving rise to more stable supply-demand dynamics along with expanding cross-cycle margins. Seagate stands to gain from the changes taking place in data storage requirements of customers, according to him.
Arcuri said the massive growth in data storage requirements has led customers to strike longer-term supply-pricing relationships while recent storage-driven blockchains have brought down channel inventory.
He expects new technologies like HAMR to keep alternatives like NAND away for many years to come. If Seagate can stick to strong discipline on the operating expenditure side, it will be able to sustain margins well above prior peak levels, Arcuri said.

(Reuters) -Oatly Group AB ADR (NASDAQ:OTLY) Group on Monday forecast at least a 64% surge in its annual revenue as the newly public Swedish company benefits from rising demand for vegan milk alternatives at restaurants and coffee chains such as  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX).
U.S.-listed shares of the company rose 6.5%, trading about $1 above its May initial public offering price of $17 as it also floated plans to ramp up production to meet ""100%"" of oatmilk demand by fall.
Founded in 1990, Oatly has ridden a wave of interest in plant-based food in recent years, led by millennials and Gen Z consumers, who are more than willing to spend on sustainable products that are also healthy.
Like plant-based food company Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc, Oatly said sales of its dairy-alternative products at restaurants rose in the second quarter, recovering from last year's pandemic-driven fall as consumers started to dine out again.
Oatly, whose backers included celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Jay Z, said it was especially benefiting from its exclusive U.S. oatmilk supply agreement with Starbucks Corp, with the coffee chain accounting for 27% of sales in the second quarter.
The Malmö, Sweden-based maker of dairy alternatives said it expects annual revenue to rise to at least $690 million, above estimates of $681.4 million.
""I don't think anybody expected this magnitude of success at Starbucks. But it's really important for us,"" Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson said on an analyst call.

To catch up with the demand, Oatly spent heavily to ramp up production capacity and on Monday floated plans to boost capacity at a its Utah manufacturing facility by 50%.
Oatly's expansion as well as higher shipping expenses led to its second-quarter losses widening to $59.1 million from $4.8 million a year earlier. Excluding items, Oatly lost 9 cents per share, compared with estimates of a loss of 10 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

(Reuters) - U.S. big box retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are expected to see higher sales when they report quarterly results this week as parents buy clothes and backpacks for kids heading back to classrooms after COVID restrictions.
Industry estimates expect total back-to-school spending to cross $100 billion and rise 6.4% from a year ago when schools, colleges and office meetings were largely confined to computer screens. 
""Consumers are flush with cash, savings rates have been elevated throughout the pandemic, and there is meaningful pent-up demand for back to school products ranging from school supplies to sneakers to laptops,"" said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics.
Stimulus checks and advance child tax credits from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration are also touted to bump up sales in what analysts characterize as one of the best of back-to-school seasons in retail even as the Delta variant threatens to dampen economic recovery.
And while industry-wide supply chain disruptions, increased costs and labor shortages in the United States are likely to weigh on margins this quarter, analysts add that market share gains made by Target and Walmart during the pandemic is expected to offset some of those pressures. 
""I don't think any retailer in their most optimistic moment would have thought that the back-to-school season would have been this strong,"" said Howard Meitiner, managing director at consulting firm Carl Marks Advisors.
Walmart is in a particularly strong position because it has made huge investments in its online business, but is also ready for the people who want to go back into stores, he added. 
The world's biggest retailer saw traffic growth for the first time in 2021, with July visits jumping 2.9% compared to the same time in 2019, while visits at Target stores increased 15.9% for that period, according to data firm Placer.ai.
According to Refinitiv IBES data, the retailer is expected to post a 3.39% rise in U.S. same-stores sales and adjusted profit of $1.57 per share when it reports second-quarter on Tuesday, while analysts consensus for Target's quarterly comparable sales and profit is estimated to be nearly 8% and $3.49 per share, respectively.

Some consultants see strong back-to-school sales as a good omen for the all-important holiday shopping season.
""Everyone - from Walmart to Target - is really trying to use the back-to-school season as a conduit to get people into stores,"" said Stacy DeBroff, founder of marketing data firm Influence Central, which works with retailers such as JCPenney, Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and Skechers.

Investing.com – Chipotle Mexican stock (NYSE:CMG) fell 1.5% Monday following a downgrade by Raymond James even as the brokerage said it remains very bullish on the burrito chain's near-term fundamentals.
Analyst Brian Vaccaro downgraded the stock’s rating to outperform from strong buy due to valuation concerns. The analyst did raise the target to $2,025 from $1,800 but pointed out that the new price is still only a 7.5% upside from the Friday close.
Chipotle shares are trading over 40% higher year-to-date including a 37% up-move in the last 6 weeks.
According to the otherwise bullish commentary of the analyst, Chipotle’s recent menu price increases have been accepted by consumers with little resistance. He said the price hikes provide store margin visibility and cover the dollar impact of wage hikes the company announced in June.
In-restaurant sales are recovering and digital sales are retaining their bounce, as per the analyst.

1697,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",3 Buy-Rated Nasdaq 100 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio,"The Nasdaq 100 is hovering near its record high levels thanks to investor optimism around strong corporate earnings and a lower-than-expected rise in core inflation. Because the index’s performance is expected to remain strong this year, despite fears surrounding the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, we think three prominent members of the index, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), should generate exceptional returns. Let’s discuss.Last week, the Nasdaq 100 recorded modest gains and is currently hovering near its all-time high, fueled by a softer-than-expected inflation report and robust second-quarter corporate earnings results. Furthermore, with the weekly jobless claims declining for a third straight week, and the growing notion that recent price increases are transitory, investors are brimming with optimism.
While this suggests that the financial markets are no longer concerned with inflation, rising COVID-19 cases in various parts of the world due to the spread of the Delta variant could keep the stock market volatile for now. However, Chief Investment Officer Xian Chan of HSBC noted that the broad success of vaccination programs should continue driving the economic recovery in the second half of the year.
Given this backdrop, investors remain bullish about prominent Nasdaq 100 stocks that have recently helped the index climb to an all-time high. Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN), and Workday, Inc. (WDAY) are three such stocks. They have gained substantially over the past few months and are well-positioned to maintain the momentum in the near term.

This is great news for tech stocks, but many have seen their shares rise to sky-high prices. That's why investors should consider under the radar tech companies such as Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO),  Teradata  Corporation (NYSE:TDC), and  Yelp  Inc. (NYSE:YELP).Over the past month, tech stocks have been rising and outperforming the S&P 500. Part of the reason is due to fears over the Delta variant of COVID-19. There has been a significant rise in the number of COVID cases in the U.S., with most of these cases confirmed as the Delta variant. Even as the economic rebound remains intact, the rising cases are cause for concern.
When cases rise, people are less likely to go out, which means investors go back to the technology stocks that performed so well in 2020. While I don’t see a repeat of the lockdowns, I can’t argue with the logic that many technology companies stand to benefit as cases increase. But many tech stocks have already had their prices run high.
That’s why investors should consider more under-the-radar technology companies whose offerings should not only benefit from rising cases but in the long run as well. These are companies with solid business models, robust growth potential, and whose stocks aren’t trading are high multiples. Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (SIMO), Teradata Corporation (TDC), and Yelp Inc. (YELP) are great examples, which is why I am highlighting them below.

1699,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",Should You Scoop Up Shares of Micron Technology on the Dip?,"The share price of leading innovative memory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology’s (MU) has tumbled after the release of a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report predicting a cyclical downturn ahead for memory chips. But given the robust demand for MU’s industry-leading high-performance products and solid financials, is now an opportune time to buy the stock? Let’s discuss.World leader in innovative memory solutions Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), in Boise, Idaho, provides memory and storage technologies, such as DRAM, NAND, NOR, and 3D XPoint memory, under the Micron and Crucial brand names. MU’s share price has dipped 13.5% over the past five days due to Morgan Stanley’s (MS) release of its industry report titled, “Memory - Winter Is Coming"", which stated that the high price environment for memory suppliers would likely begin to reverse next year.
While the report suggested that the strong demand that has contributed to a semiconductor chip shortage globally has begun to slow, we believe MU’s industry-leading 1α DRAM and 176-layer NAND should continue to see long-term demand across data centers and edge devices. Also, MU’s record market and product revenues and significant sequential earnings improvement in the last reported quarter have raised investors’ hopes for the stock.
Closing yesterday’s session at $70.92, MU is trading 26.9% below its 52-week high of $96.96.
