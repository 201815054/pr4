4,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 04:37PM ET</span>","Boeing halts 737 MAX deliveries due to electrical issues, shares fall","By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -Boeing Co on Wednesday confirmed a halt on 737 MAX deliveries after electrical problems re-grounded part of the fleet, and voiced concerns over a surging pandemic in India and U.S.-China political tensions. 
Reuters reported on April 16 that Boeing (NYSE:BA) stopped delivering its cash cow single-aisle 737 MAX after the electrical grounding problem - months after the plane returned to service following a lengthy safety ban. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a new airworthiness directive Wednesday requiring a fix before the jets resume flight. The FAA said last week the issue impacts 109 airline planes worldwide but Boeing did not immediately say how many additional undelivered planes must be fixed.
Boeing's shares fell 2.4% after the U.S. planemaker reported its sixth straight quarterly loss and a charge on its high-profile Air Force One presidential jet program.
The barrage of technical and financial challenges clouded optimism over a resurgent U.S. domestic travel market fueled by vaccinations and pent up demand.
""We view 2021 as a critical inflection point for our industry,"" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts on a conference call. 
Boeing has paused 737 MAX deliveries to address the electrical issues, and expects to ""catch up on deliveries over the balance of the year,"" Calhoun added. 
But Calhoun said he could not predict when the 737 MAX's electrical grounding issue would be resolved, and doubled down on fears of a long-off recovery of international travel, citing the pandemic's impact and tensions between Washington and Beijing. 
He also said he expects China to lift its grounding order on the 737 MAX in the second half of 2021.
Boeing has delivered more than 85 737 MAX jetliners since it was cleared by most regulators to re-enter service late last year following two fatal crashes, lifting revenue and cash flow, it said. 
Boeing said it still expects to deliver half the 400 MAX jets in inventory by end-2021, with a return to positive cash flow in 2022.
But the new electrical grounding problem found on some models of the jet earlier this month has cast a shadow on Boeing's freshly re-affirmed plans to increase 737 MAX production to 31 planes per month by early 2022. Airlines have pulled dozens of 737 MAX jets from service, awaiting repairs.
Calhoun, asked about concerns over Boeing's falling market share in the narrow-body market against European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), said: ""I want to split that market.""
Highlighting Boeing's risk in one of the most important battlegrounds for the next generation of jetliners, U.S. major Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) placed a firm order for 25 A321neo aircraft last week. 
Calhoun's remarks come after Boeing extended its required retirement age of 65 to 70 to allow Calhoun, 64, to stay in the top job.
Calhoun plans to stay in the role until he is 70, insiders say. His decision surprised many in the industry who saw him as a shorter-term crisis manager and triggered the upcoming exit of Boeing's well-regarded CFO and heir-apparent for the job, Greg Smith, 54.
Boeing also reaffirmed a sharply-reduced production rate of five 787 jetliners per month after consolidating production at its South Carolina factory. 
It is facing reduced demand due to the pandemic's impact on longer-haul travel, and a growing price tag for 787 retrofits due to production defects embedded in dozens of the advanced carbon-composite jetliners.
It still expects to deliver the first 777X mini-jumbo in late 2023 despite certification and design challenges, with a combined output of the new 777X and its 777 legacy model of two a month.
The U.S. planemaker reported a core operating loss of $353 million in the first quarter, its sixth-straight quarterly loss, compared with a loss of $1.70 billion a year earlier.
Boeing recorded a $318-million pre-tax charge related to Air Force One presidential aircraft due to a spat with a supplier. 

In July 2018, Boeing received a $3.9-billion contract to build two 747-8 aircraft for use as Air Force One, due to be delivered by December 2024.
In the quarter, Boeing completed a hot-fire engine test on NASA's forthcoming SLS rocket and started production on the U.S. Air Force's new trainer jet.

These companies typically take some time to deliver returns and, hence, are deemed risky investment bets for the short term. Three such recent investments by Woods are in Beam Therapeutics (BEAM),  Niu Technologies  (NASDAQ:NIU) and Workhorse Group (WKHS). Let’s evaluate these names.Cathie Wood owns and operates Ark Investment Services LLC, which is the world’s largest actively traded ETF. She has made her name by betting on companies that seem highly risky and speculative and are generally viewed in a negative light by other institutional and retail investors. Wood’s most profitable bet so far has been her long position in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) since 2019, covering a period when the stock was heavily shorted.
Wood believes the disruptive electric vehicle (EV) industry has plenty of remaining upside because many countries have only just begun phasing out fossil fuel-powered vehicles in favor of EVs. Two of Wood’s recent investments in this space are in Niu Technologies (NIU) and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS).
Wood also has substantial exposure to the biotechnology industry based on her optimism about the prospects of gene sequencing, which has the potential to revolutionize the global healthcare industry. With the biotech industry’s research and innovation increasingly demonstrating the sector's ability to cure critical ailments such as cancer, Wood launched Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) to invest in budding companies, such as Beam Therapeutics, Inc.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped into the red Wednesday after hitting record intraday highs as the Federal Reserve left rates steady and signaled ongoing support for the recovery. 
The S&P 500 closed 0.05% lower after hitting a intraday record of 4,201.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.48%, or 164 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%.
The Fed left its benchmark rate unchanged, and said that while the pace of recovery has improved, there was still a long way to go until the economy achieves its inflation and labor market objectives. 
""Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement,"" the Fed said in a statement.
The unchanged central bank decision pressured bond yields, helping tech cut some of its losses following mixed corporate earnings.    
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported first-quarter results that topped analysts and announced a $50 billion share buyback, sending its shares 3% higher.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended down nearly 3% even as the tech giant reported better-than-expected results, underpinned by strength in its cloud business. The results were well-received on Wall Street, with several analysts lifting their price targets on the stock.
""We maintain our outperform and are raising our price target to $310 vs. $300 reflecting the cloud strength seen this quarter,"" Wedbush said in a note.

 Spotify Technology  (NYSE:SPOT) slumped about 11% despite reporting quarterly results above consensus estimates and guiding for a smaller than expected loss for the second quarter.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were boosted by a rise in oil prices after data showing a smaller-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude inventories cooled investor worries that rising global infections will soften demand.
Crude oil inventories edged higher by 90,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a build of 659,000 barrels.
 Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA), down nearly 3%, was a drag on the Dow as the aircraft maker's narrower-than-expected loss didn’t offset concerns that aviation demand will continue to be challenged as the pandemic impact continued.

Powell says he believes inflation would be transitory as the economy reopens.
Tech companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google’s Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) have reported strong earnings, and that trend is expected to continue with the next batch of big tech reports due out starting after today’s close.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Two more FAANGs report
Two FAANG giants Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) report after the closing bell tonight. Apple is expected to report earnings per share of 98 cents on revenue of $76.7 billion. Facebook is expected to report EPS of $2.33 a share on revenue of $23.6 billion. 
2. Amazon on deck
Tomorrow, e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up. It is expected to report earnings of $9.49 per share on revenue of $104.5 billion. Tech companies have reported earnings beats in recent days, with Google parent Alphabet unveiling a monster earnings beat on Tuesday.
3. Economic output
In addition to the weekly data on jobless claims, Thursday brings us the first quarter GDP number, which analysts tracked by Investing.com see coming in at 6.1%, up from 4.3% in the fourth quarter. The number is released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

Backed as a measure to improve public safety by the Senate this month, the registry would require companies to pay for collection of their clients' biometric data, which would then be stored and managed by the telecoms regulator.
Telecoms sector groups argue it would cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars to implement. Rights groups say it poses a human rights violation and could lead to wrongful convictions if people's identities are stolen.
Mexico's data protection body plans to challenge the registry before the Supreme Court. Judges have also suspended its implementation, according to local media.
But Lopez Obrador said telecoms providers were impeding a law designed to protect people.
""These telephone companies ... have a lot of power, in addition to acting with great hypocrisy, because they already request that data to contract a telephone service,"" he told reporters at a regular news conference.
""Now as they also have lots of money to buy or rent media, they're running a campaign against us,"" he added, singling out Telmex, a unit of  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), the company controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. 
Supporters of the measure say it will help crack down on criminals who use unregistered pre-paid phones for kidnapping and extortion calls. The registry's information would be available by request from law enforcement officials.

While over 150 countries around the world maintain cellphone user registries, only about 8% of those also require biometrics, according to global telecoms industry lobby GSMA.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>","Analysis: For Google, plenty of cash with nowhere to go","By Paresh Dave, Subrat Patnaik and Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - In announcing a $50-billion share buyback on Tuesday, Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc confirmed a paradoxical dynamic: its core advertising business is so profitable, and so dominant, that it has few options for usefully deploying its cash.
Alphabet reported record earnings on Tuesday, leaving its cash pile at about $135 billion, up $18 billion over the last year.
A surge in internet usage during the pandemic helped propel the Google search and YouTube advertising businesses that account for most of it revenue and profit.
But antitrust investigators in the United States and elsewhere allege that Google gained dominance in online ads using anti-competitive practices, and lawsuits are piling up. That could leave Google wary of spending its money on big acquisitions that are related to its existing businesses, as they would likely be blocked on antitrust grounds.
""Fears of an increased regulatory clampdown on the company might have seen Alphabet tread more carefully when deciding what to do with their cash pile,"" said Samuel Indyk, analyst at uk.Investing.com.
Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat on Tuesday did not rule out making deals, though.
""Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments,"" she told analysts.
Betting on unrelated businesses, while easier from a regulatory standpoint, would be unlikely to yield anything close to the returns enjoyed by Google. And spending on internal projects has limits too: Alphabet has sunk tens of billions into the its ""other bets,"" including autonomous vehicle company Waymo and blue-sky projects such as failed internet service Loon, but few are close to being viable businesses.
Like many fast-growing tech companies, Alphabet has never paid a dividend, preferring instead to return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Alphabet bought back $31 billion in shares in 2020, 69% more than the year before, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Brent Thill. 
The 2020 buyback amounted to 73% of its free cash flow, up from 59% in 2019, he said.
Unlike dividends, which can lock a company into long-term fixed payouts to shareholders that are difficult to reduce, buybacks also give Alphabet the flexibility to adjust the flow of cash returned to investors at any time if it needs the money for other purposes.
Some analysts say Alphabet shares are priced low relative to peers. Alphabet shares trade at about eight times sales over the last year, while shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) are at 10 times and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 12 times.
Taking some shares off the market and stoking prices through the buyback, one of the largest ever on Wall Street and almost twice the company's previous highest authorization, could help close the gap with rivals.
""This (buyback) is a sign their stock is undervalued and a tougher regulatory environment for M&A,"" Thill said. Alphabet shares rose as much as 6.1% to touch a record high of $2,431.38 on Wednesday.
Company leadership would benefit from higher shares under their new compensation plans. Five senior executives including Porat over the last year received stock awards that will vest, if at all, based on how Alphabet shares perform relative to the S&P 100 in the coming years.
Alphabet is far from the only company with plenty of cash and antitrust and other challenges hampering its potential use. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc have more than $300 billion combined.
Share buybacks have been rising, both in the amount of repurchases and the number of companies doing them, though activity remains below pre-pandemic levels.
About one-third of S&P 500 companies have issued quarterly results as of Tuesday, reporting $52 billion in buybacks in the first quarter, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. Those companies reported $42.8 billion in buybacks in the fourth quarter.

The calculation on buybacks versus dividends could change with U.S. President Joe Biden's new tax proposals, which aim to boost the levy on capital gains from stock investments but leave taxes on dividends and interest unchanged.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>","United Auto Workers presses GM, Ford on unionizing battery plants","By David Shepardson and Joseph White
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble told Reuters the union is in talks with General Motors (NYSE:GM) about representing workers at joint venture battery plants, and voiced opposition to proposals for Washington to impose a firm deadline to end use of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles.
Gamble said the UAW has raised concerns with GM and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co about joint venture and potential electric vehicle operations set up by the automakers and supplier partners that so far are not represented by the union. GM is building two U.S. battery production plants with South Korean battery partner LG Chem. Ford is considering investments in battery manufacturing.
""We've got to make sure that work stays at a livable wage and those workers can organize,"" Gamble said in an interview. ""We're having some discussions developing with General Motors.""
General Motors said in a statement that its Ultium EV battery facilities ""are part of a joint venture and are a separate company – Ultium Cells LLC. The workforces at those locations will determine whether or not the facility is represented by a union.""
The automaker also said that top management ""meets with the UAW regularly"" and that ""those discussions are private -- we don’t comment on those conversations in the media."" 
The UAW, with nearly 1 million active and retired members, is a key player in the debate in Washington and U.S. state capitals over regulating gasoline-powered vehicles as President Joe Biden shapes his administration's policies on climate change.
Many UAW autoworkers earn their livings building Detroit-brand, petroleum-burning pickup trucks and SUVs or assembling engines and other components for those vehicles in Midwestern states such as Michigan. 
Gamble compared the technological challenge presented by electric vehicles to the disruption caused by the oil price shocks of the 1970s, and government policies to demand rapid fuel efficiency improvements in response. The struggles of Detroit automakers to comply opened the door to Japanese and later European automakers to establish a parallel, non-union auto industry in the United States. 
California and 11 other mostly coastal and Democratic-leaning states have called on Biden to set a deadline of 2035 to phase out sales of new CO2-emitting, internal combustion vehicles. Biden has not agreed to endorse a deadline.
""We don't like these hard deadlines you're hearing. We don't think a lot of them are fully achievable,"" Gamble said. ""We should not put all our eggs in one basket.""
""When autoworkers hear about zero emission by a certain date they get very uncomfortable because they feel it's a challenge to their very employment,"" Gamble said. ""We see a blending"" of electric vehicles and internal combustion engines ""for some years to come.""
He said the United States should ""ease into this full 100% EVs at the appropriate time, when everything is in place.""
He praised Biden and the White House for extensive engagement with the union. ""He understands the challenges our members face,"" Gamble said. 
Pointing to the administration's upcoming decision to revise fuel efficiency requirements, Gamble said Biden should adopt a ""fair standard that doesn't put a lot of burden on the auto companies"" or cost jobs.
Biden wants $174 billion to boost the EV market, including $100 billion for consumer rebates. Gamble also expressed concern about that plan, fearing much of the money could go to subsidize EVs built abroad.
""We don't have a lot of American EVs on the road right now to choose from,"" Gamble said, saying any new rebate program should ensure it ""increases American manufacturing.""
Gamble wants the administration to make sure workers at plants producing electric vehicles, batteries and components can unionize. U.S. workers at the No. 1 electric vehicle manufacturer, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are not represented by a union.
The United States needs to do more to ensure a lot of component work tied to EVs are manufactured domestically and that workers get good wages, he said. 
""We don't need another service sector in this country,"" Gamble said. ""That's what I am fearful of. If these jobs are low wage minimal benefit jobs its not going to benefit the economy."" 
Gamble said he personally does not plan to buy an electric vehicle -- and is skeptical that many Americans will buy EVs. 

""I have no interest at all in an electric vehicle,"" he said. ""I am just dyed-in-the-wool, 'Give me my V-8 and my pickup truck.'""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 gave up some gains after hitting record intraday highs Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve left rates steady and signaled ongoing support for the recovery. 
The S&P 500 was up 0.1%, after hitting a intraday record of 4,201.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.41%, or 137 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%.
The Fed left its benchmark rate unchanged, and said that while the the pace of recovery has improved, there was still a long way to go until the economy achieves its inflation and labor market objectives. 
""Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement,"" the Fed said in a statement.
The unchanged central bank decision pressured bond yields, helping tech cut some of its losses following mixed corporate earnings.    
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported first-quarter results that topped analysts and announced a $50 billion share buyback, sending its shares more than 3% higher.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 2% even as the tech giant reported better-than-expected results, underpinned by strength in its cloud business. The results were well-received on Wall Street, with several analysts lifting their price targets on the stock.
""We maintain our outperform and are raising our price target to $310 vs. $300 reflecting the cloud strength seen this quarter,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Chip stocks fell 1% as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gave up its intraday gains despite posting blowout first-quarter results.
 Spotify Technology  (NYSE:SPOT) slumped about 11% despite reporting quarterly results above consensus estimates and guiding for a smaller than expected loss for the second quarter.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were boosted by a rise in oil prices after data showing a smaller-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude inventories cooled investor worries that rising global infections will soften demand.
Crude oil inventories edged higher by 90,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a build of 659,000 barrels.
 Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA), down 3%, was a drag on the Dow as the aircraft maker's narrower-than-expected loss didn’t offset concerns that aviation demand will continue to be challenged as the pandemic impact continued.
In other news, President Biden is expected to pitch his $1.8 trillion ""American Families Plan"" to Congress later today. Biden plans to fund the package, which will include funding for additional expenditures on childcare and education, by nearly doubling the capital gains tax for Americans making over $1 million per year."

""EV customers will soon be able to easily see real-time information from nearly 60,000 charging plugs...find stations along a route and initiate and pay for charging,"" GM said in a statement.
The automaker also introduced ""Ultium Charge 360"", a platform which integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other services to simplify the charging experience for its electric-vehicle owners. 
GM's next generation of Ultium batteries will be used in its new EVs including the Hummer EV and the Cadillac Lyriq.
Wall Street has been increasingly focusing on GM's strategy to roll out electric vehicles, as it slowly aims to catch up with EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
The automaker previously announced a $27 billion investment in EV and autonomous vehicles (AV) through 2025 and the launch of 30 new EVs by 2025-end.

GM's longer-range target also includes halting sales of light-duty gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.

These names are currently trading at affordable prices, so let’s take a closer look at them. Read on.Most tech stocks soared last year as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic increased the world's dependence on technology products and services. However, as the economy began recovering this year with fiscal and monetary policy support and a fast-paced mass vaccination program, investors rotated away from expensive tech stocks to quality cyclical stocks, driving a tech sell-off earlier this year. However, because recent corporate earnings have so far indicated solid performance by tech companies, and the demand for advanced technology is expected to continue increasing, investors are again focusing on quality tech stocks. This is evidenced by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite’s solid performance over the past month.
Investors’ renewed interest in tech stocks is also evident in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 7.9% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 5.4% gains. And because the remote working and shopping trend is likely here to stay even after the pandemic subsides, several tech stocks that provide related software and technologies are expected to generate steady returns in the coming months.

They are currently trading below $15 but hold immense upside potential based on the expected growth in their financials.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 12:25PM ET</span>","Analysis: U.S. companies are worried about inflation, equity investors less so","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A growing chorus of U.S. companies are raising concerns about the rising costs of everything from labor to components, yet stock investors appear unfazed by the prospects of higher inflation as the economy bounces back from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Amid the economic rebound, companies ranging from Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) Company Inc to toymaker  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) to appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR) have told investors that they expect the impact of higher costs on their businesses to be significant in the months ahead. 
Overall, the number of companies which have mentioned inflation on their recent earnings calls is up compared with the year before for the first time since 2018, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). 
At that time, investors were concerned https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-beigebook/tariff-effects-broaden-across-u-s-wage-growth-higher-fed-idUSKBN1O42HP about the impact of the Trump Administration's trade tariffs with China, though consumer prices ultimately rose less than they did in the year before, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
""Short-term, I think it will be a struggle for many companies as they deal with the reopening,"" said Saira Malik, chief investment officer for Nuveen's global equity division. ""As demand comes back faster than they expected its leading to logistical and supply chain issues. But it's more of a fear than reality when it comes to being a long term issue."" 
Equity investors do not appear overly nervous about the prospects of higher inflation ahead - with expectations it will be transitory rather than persistent and that companies will have the ability to pass price rises on. 
Moderate inflation could benefit a broad range of equity sectors while only dampening valuations for high-growth stocks with low current earnings, according to AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). Bond investors, meanwhile, would likely be more negatively affected by any persistent pickup in inflation that eats away at returns.
Overall, the broad S&P 500 is up nearly 11.5% year-to-date. Consumer prices rose 0.6% in March, the largest one-month rise in eight and a half years, while over the last 12 months, inflation is up 2.6%, the largest increase gain since August, 2018.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-expectations-analysis/analysis-fed-hopes-for-inflation-psych-out-stable-expectations-as-prices-rise-idUSKBN2BE16B that he expects that inflation will exceed the central bank's 2% target for several quarters before falling as the labor market and supply chains readjust to the economic recovery. 
So far, the jump in inflation over the last six months does not appear to be hurting company margins. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report a total profit margin of 12.03% during the first quarter, the highest of any first quarter since at least 2006, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
""As long as the higher input costs are moderate and not excessive for a long period of time, it’s not a bad thing. Coming off where we were last year it shows a healthier economy and normalizing demand,"" said Frank Rybinski, chief macro strategist at Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management. 
""You are starting to see considerable beats. You get that early-cycle operating leverage really kicking in.""
David Tesher, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings' head of North America Credit Research, wrote in a report that cost pressures look set to shrink near-term profit margins in many sectors. Still, profit erosion would only be moderate, hitting a relatively small percentage of companies. 
Some investors are less sanguine about the impact of inflation on assets overall. 
""This is part of the danger of policy that has been allowed to go significantly off course. It forces businesses to make rash decisions based upon the short-term imbalances created by poor policy"" on the part of the Federal Reserve, said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading. 
Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive and chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, told Bloomberg Tuesday that it is not clear inflation pressures will be as short-term as the Fed expects. 
“I’m not sure why they think they know that it’s transitory,“ he said, according to Bloomberg. “How do they know that when there’s plenty of money printing that’s been going on and we’ve seen commodity prices going up really massively.”
Yet factors ranging from aging demographics to the continued productivity gains through technology should keep long-term inflation and wages in check even if the run above trends for the next several months, said Jim Paulsen, Chief Investment Strategist at the Leuthold Group.

""Current economic strategies are certainly unprecedented, but so is weakness in the U.S. labor force,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Aon is set to gain conditional EU antitrust approval for its $30 billion bid for Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), people familiar with the matter said, clearing a key hurdle to becoming the world's No. 1 insurance broker.
The sector's biggest-ever deal comes as insurers struggle with rising claims and new challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. London-headquartered Aon (NYSE:AON), which clinched the deal a year ago to create the world's largest insurance broker ahead of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC), offered concessions to the European Commission earlier this month. Following feedback from rivals and customers last week, the EU competition enforcer has asked for some tweaks but is unlikely to ask for more concessions, the people said. Aon could have faced a charge sheet called a statement of objections which sets out EU concerns if market feedback had been negative and if it had then refused to offer more concessions. This is not the case now, the people said.
Aon's shares reversed losses and gained as much as 1.2% after the Reuters story while Willis also trimmed losses and rose 2.9%. The concessions package includes selling a swathe of Willis assets, including its reinsurance arm and its German retirement benefits and consulting business, people with direct knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.
The concessions also include selling Willis' insurance broking activities in France, including French unit Gras Savoye, as well as in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. 

Willis' entire property and casualty business portfolio servicing large multinationals in those four countries and other European assets to service these clients, as well as its financial and professional lines, will also be sold.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by July 27, and Aon declined to comment.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",CP shareholders say bidding war for Kansas City Southern unnecessary,"By Maiya Keidan and Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - As Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU)'s share price rises above  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway's offer on prospects of a bidding war, CP shareholders and analysts say the company should stick to its initial proposal, noting Canadian National Railway's rival offer may struggle to secure regulatory approval.
CN Railway, Canada's biggest railroad, last week made an unsolicited $30 billion offer for KCS, trumping CP's agreed $25 billion bid. Since then, KCS shares have traded about 10% over CP's offer, reflecting the market's optimism that CP may have to bump up its bid.
CP has, so far, declined to raise its offer and investors say it should stay put given the regulatory hurdles facing CN's proposal.
""I think they've played their hand well by not responding with an increased offer,"" said one Canadian fund manager who is invested in both CP and CN. 
CP has ""a much better likelihood"" of getting regulatory approval, the fund manager said, pointing to the overlap in tracks CN has with KCS.
CN, with a market value $76 billion runs rail networks parallel to KCS for about 100 kilometres (62 miles) in Louisiana, while CP, with a market capitalisation of $50 billion, has no overlapping rail networks. CN was ""confident"" in its ability to achieve all necessary regulatory approval, the company told analysts on Monday.
PRIZED ASSET
Canada's two largest railroads are vying for the prized U.S. railroad asset, with the combination set to create the first direct network connecting Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
It would be first major North American railroad M&A in more than 20 years and is expected to benefit from the new trade pact between the three countries that came into force last July.
For the U.S. freight rail regulator, the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the size of the combined group is also likely a factor when considering whether the proposed tie-up is in the public interest, said investors.
Last week, STB said that a waiver of rules governing mergers pre-2001 that was granted to KCS would be applicable to a merger of the company and CP. KCS had been granted the waiver that applies less strict rules based on its small size.
Meanwhile, CN has applied to the regulator to proceed under STB's existing merger rules. 
The combination of CP and KCS would make it the smallest Class 1 railway even post-merger while the combination with CN would result in the third-largest North American Class 1, CIBC analysts said in a note.
""It does feel like as much as anything that CN is just trying to up the price that CP will have to pay,"" said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, which owns shares in CP.
Meanwhile, shippers who are likely to have a sway over the deal outcome are pulling roughly even with CP and CN in their stated level of support.
Still, the regulatory risk could be too high for CN to overcome.

""CP upping their bid right now would really be bidding against themselves if the other deal is not that likely to be approved,"" Taylor said.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",USTR Tai says any metals tariff deal with EU must address global excess capacity,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said she is working hard to resolve a dispute with the European Union over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and EU retaliation, but any solution will need to address the problem of global excess production capacity for the metals, largely in China. 
Tai, speaking to a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee, said the ""Section 232"" tariffs imposed by former president Donald Trump have had a positive impact on U.S. steel production but have had costs in terms of retaliatory tariffs.
""Solutions that we come to with our trading partners, I believe in my core, really have to address the larger issue around the overcapacity in the market,"" Tai said.
At a budget hearing where Tai provided a broad range of updates on Biden administration trade plans, including a review of China trade policy, Tai said she is mindful of the EU's planned doubling of the EU's retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) motorcycles and power boats on June 1.
But she gave no indication that the Biden administration is ready to remove the national security tariffs that were intended to strengthen U.S. steel and aluminum production to spare those targeted industries targeted by the EU.
Several times she deflected questions about the tariffs to discuss the need for both the United States and the European Union to join forces to address Chinese excess capacity. 
""What I am hoping is that they see that problem, and they see it to be as serious a challenge to their ability to produce and compete in steelmaking as we see it, and working together we will be able to resolve these sets of tariffs so that we can join forces on the bigger picture.""
Tai also said that her agency was conducting a top-to-bottom review of China trade policy, including all ""Section 301"" tariffs imposed on some $370 billions of imports from China and exclusions granted on some products.
She said she would work to hold Beijing to the commitments made under Trump's ""Phase 1"" trade deal with China, including pledges to buy more U.S. seafood and other products and commitments to make intellectual property and agricultural regulatory changes and open up its financial sector.

But no high-level meeting with senior Chinese officials has yet been scheduled, she said, despite the agreement's call for semi-annual minister-level consultations.
Tai said that senior officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada would convene in coming weeks under the provisions of the new North American trade agreement to discuss issues. She said she is ""not afraid"" to use the enforcement provisions in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was launched last year.

LONDON (Reuters) -A proposed multi-billion pound British class action against Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which alleges the internet giant secretly tracked millions of iPhone users, is not viable and should not be allowed to proceed, the Supreme Court was told on Wednesday.
Antony White, a lawyer for Google, told the first day of a two-day hearing that any maiden, U.S.-style data protection lawsuit could only seek redress under English laws if a data breach led to claimants suffering damage.
""It is not my case that loss of personal data may not have serious consequences, but it may not always do so in a way that attracts compensation,"" he said, adding that any uniform award would also fail to take into account differing phone usage.
Richard Lloyd, former director of consumer rights group Which?, is leading the landmark claim that seeks to extend Britain's fledgling class action regime and could set the scene for vast, similar data protection claims against tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), TikTok and YouTube.
The case, brought on behalf of more than five million Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone users, hinges on what damages can be recovered by consumers for data breaches and whether class actions can be used to claim them.
Lloyd, who says he wants to hold the world's biggest companies to account, has estimated that people who used iPhones between 2011 and 2012 could be owned redress of more than 3 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) if any future trial succeeds.
He alleges that Google illegally took iPhone users' personal data by tracking internet browsing histories and used this to sell a lucrative, targeted advertising service. 
""Google makes billions of pounds in revenue from advertising based on our personal data every year,"" he said in a statement. ""It is only right that they should be held to account for profiting from the misuse of that personal data."" 
Experts say the case is ""hugely significant"" and urge businesses to be fair and transparent when harvesting and using troves of personal data for commercial gain.
""If the judgment goes in favour of the claimants, we will see the floodgates open to a tsunami of representative data class actions in the UK,"" said Julian Copeman, a partner at Herbert Smith Freehills. 
Critics of ""opt out"" class actions, which automatically bind a defined group into a lawsuit unless individuals opt out, say they can lead to claims without merit and lush profits for litigators and their funders.
Proponents say they allow easier access to justice, especially when individual claims are too small to pursue individually, and that alternative ""opt in"" lawsuits, where every claimant signs up, are costly and time-consuming.
The Confederation of British Industry, a trade body, says such cases could be ""highly detrimental"", noting the risk of ruinous damages awards could prompt settlements regardless of the merits of a case.

""It's a ground-breaking case that could result in a bank-breaking financial hit,"" said Rafi Azim-Khan, head of data privacy at law firm Pillsbury.

(Reuters) -Thirteen U.S. oil refineries released the cancer-causing chemical benzene in concentrations that exceeded federal limits last year, three more than in 2019, according to government data published by the green group Environmental Integrity Project on Wednesday.
The study is based on the second full year of data reported by U.S. refineries since the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring continuous monitoring of air pollutants around plants to protect nearby communities, many of which are disproportionately poor, Black and Hispanic.
""If the Biden EPA wants to act on its environmental justice promises, these neighborhoods near refineries are a great place to start,"" Benjamin Kunstman, staff engineer at the Environmental Integrity Project, told Reuters.
According to the report, benzene levels consistently exceeded the EPA standard of nine micrograms per cubic meter of air at the fencelines of eight of the 13 refineries that EIP identified. The EPA requires facilities that exceed that threshold to take corrective action, the report said.
The group also found that one of the refineries exceeding the limits was the former Philadelphia Energy Solutions facility in Philadelphia, which was shuttered in 2019 but continued to pump out the chemical while its tanks were being emptied. 
Last year the EPA said ""it is important to note that benzene concentration levels monitored at the perimeter of a refinery do not reflect benzene levels in the community."" 
The agency added that its limits are stringent ""in order to provide ample opportunity for early action."" 
The highest emitter of benzene in 2020 was Delek's Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery, which averaged more than 31 micrograms per cubit meter last year - more than three times the EPA's action level, according to EIP.
“Delek is focused on serving as a good steward of the environment and supportive member of the communities in which we operate,"" said a Delek spokesperson. 
The spokesperson said Delek implemented a number of effective changes in September 2020 and anticipates the rolling 12-month average will fall below nine micrograms per cubic meter by this summer. 
Four other refineries on the list were in Louisiana - PBF Chalmette, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Lake Charles, Phillips 66 Alliance, and Shell (LON:RDSa) Norco. In Texas, Total Port Arthur, Marathon Galveston Bay, and Citgo Corpus Christi East exceeded the federal level. 
The other refineries were Shell Chemical Mobile in Alabama, HollyFrontier Lovington and HollyFrontier Artesia in New Mexico, and Marathon Catlettsburg in Kentucky.
Marathon spokesperson Jamal Kheiry said the higher emissions were due to one of two one-time events last year, adding that its community-based monitors report benzene levels ""well below"" the federal benzene action levels for the corresponding periods.
""At both our Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay refineries, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce benzene emissions, Kheiry said. 
Citgo said that due to the nature of its business ""excess emissions can occasionally occur"" and that the root cause of the emission that exceeded federal levels was determined to be due to an offsite incident not involving the company.

""If this offsite incident had not occurred, the East Plant Refinery would currently be below the action limit,"" adding that the company is committed to safe and environmentally sound operations. 
The other refiners did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.

But the company reported solid financials in its last-reported quarter and is also seeing increasing demand for its chips. Because the stock is expected to rebound in the near- to mid-term, we think it could be wise to buy the stock at its current price level. Let’s discuss.Founded in 1987 and is based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (TSM) was the world’s first semiconductor foundry. Its share price has declined 13.4% amid a broader tech sell-off since hitting its all-time high of $142.20 on February 16.
However, it has gained 126.6% over the past year to close yesterday’s trading session at $121.27. This can be attributed primarily to increasing demand for its integrated circuits (ICs) and semiconductor products.
Established tech companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) rely on TSM for their semiconductor supplies.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Wednesday ahead of appearances from both President Joe Biden and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Biden is set to lay out plans for a big increase in social spending, notably with regard to childcare, and preschool and community college education. The spending is set to be funded, at least in part, through higher taxes on capital gains – something that has weighed occasionally on stock prices since Biden’s election victory last November.
Biden's appearance is likely to upstage Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who isn't expected to say anything dramatically new when he gives his press conference after the Fed's latest policy meeting. Argualy the most interesting aspect of the press conference will be Powell's interpretation of the blistering rally in commodities in recent days and weeks, which many analysts - but not (yet) the Fed - see as a prelude to higher inflation. 
""No one expects bond buying to end now, but there may be hints at it ending later this year,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note to clients.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 125 points, or 0.4%, at 33,831 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was also up 0.2%, lifted by a sharp rise in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock in response to blowout earnings reported late on Tuesday.
Alphabet stock rose 6.0% to a new all-time high after reporting a surge in advertising revenue during a winter quarter in which lockdowns once again glued customers to screens, leaving them to use YouTube, Maps and Google’s search more than ever.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also reported strong numbers after the bell on Tuesday, due largely to its Xbox gaming segment and Azure, its Cloud hosting business, but its stock fell 2.9%, on disappointment that they didn’t match even more ambitious expectations.
Behind the platform companies' strength, however, there were visible pockets of weakness in some other growth stocks that have been big winners from the pandemic.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock tumbled over 10% after it reported earnings that showed subscriber growth slowing. The company is coming into more direct competition with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which recently launched a podcast subscription service. Pinterest  (NYSE:PINS) stock also fell 11% after its first-quarter numbers showed monthly average user numbers growing more slowly.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 2.7% after its quarterly update showed orders nearly stagnant and revenue down on the year, despite the resumption of 737 MAX deliveries after they were cleared by regulators to fly again.

(Reuters) -Plans for GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) to split in two are ""well underway"" it said on Wednesday after exceeding first-quarter earnings forecasts as an easing of COVID-19 curbs meant more clinic visits for critical treatments such as HIV and routine shots.
GSK has fallen behind in the coronavirus vaccines race and its broader strategy has been under the microscope after a report that U.S. activist investor Elliott built up a significant stake.
The British drugmaker said it would provide details on June 23 on its plan to separate next year into an over-the-counter products business and another for prescription medicines and vaccines.
Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said she was focused on GSK's broader transformation and delivering shareholder value.
The separation was spearheaded by Walmsley, a former head of GSK's consumer business, to simplify operations. 
Walmsley took the top job in 2017 despite some investor pressure to name an outsider as CEO and such calls may grow with Elliott's arrival on the register.
""With major structural change on the cards at GSK, with or without Elliott’s alternative vision, it looks set to be a year of forced evolution at GSK,"" Steve Clayton, manager of  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV)'s Select UK Income Shares fund, said in a note.
GSK said that turnover for the three months to March fell 15% to 7.42 billion pounds ($10.28 billion) at constant currency rates, while adjusted earnings stood at 22.9 pence per share, down by a third.
Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of 21.9 pence per share and sales of 7.83 billion pounds, a company-compiled consensus https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/investors/analyst-consensus/analyst-consensus of 17 analysts showed.
Walmsley launched GSK's split, which involves merging its over-the-counter products business into a venture with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and separating this from its prescription medicines and vaccines units, last year. 
Investments to prepare for the division have hurt earnings, but GSK hopes the streamlined operations resulting from it will pay off in the long term.
Walmsley said that while GSK's consumer health business had great prospects and a ""fantastic"" leadership team, she would seek to remain in control of the bigger picture. 

""I’m very focused on leading GSK through that successful separation and beyond,"" Walmsley told a results briefing, adding that she saw her role as CEO as setting the strategy, hiring top people and allocating capital, while leaving the medical science to the experts.
""I've clearly laid out from day one ... and included in that has been the best possible R&D leadership in the world,"" Walmsley said in response to suggestions that her lack of scientific background meant she would be better suited to lead the consumer business once GSK completes its planned split.

Humana has been betting on the strength of its main business of selling government-backed Medicare Advantage health plans, which cater to people older than 65 or with disabilities, to buoy profits amid challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
In February, the company said it expected a positive impact of $1.32 billion to $2.04 billion in its Medicare Advantage health plans in 2021 from depressed use of non-COVID healthcare services.
The health insurer on Wednesday reiterated its 2021 adjusted earnings target and growth expectation in its individual Medicare Advantage for the year. 
Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said, ""the results were strong and the posture on guidance is likely related to early-year conservatism.""
The company, seeking to strengthen its patient care business, is set to acquire the 60% stake it did not own in home health and hospice provider Kindred at Home for $5.7 billion.
Sales from the company's retail unit rose 11% to $18.65 billion in the first quarter ended March, as it added more members to its individual Medicare Advantage plans as well as Medicaid health plans for low-income Americans due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. 
Its consolidated benefit ratio, the percentage of premiums spent on claims, worsened to 85.9% from 85.1% a year earlier. This was in-line with the average analyst estimate of 85.98%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $7.67 per share in the first quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.06 per share.

(Reuters) -Dana Inc raised its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday after beating first-quarter estimates as it rides on strong sales in the light-truck and commercial vehicle market, which has been steadily recovering from pandemic-driven challenges.
Shares of the axle and driveshaft maker were up 2.2% at $28.30 before the bell.
A global shortage of semiconductor chips has led automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to cut production. However, consumer demand remains strong driven by low interest rates, stimulus checks and a preference for private vehicles over public transport.
""Dana realized higher sales... as a result of continued strength in the light-truck market, as well as growth in both the commercial-vehicle and off-highway markets,"" said Chief Executive Officer James Kamsickas.
He, however, warned that despite a recovery in end-markets from last year's downturn, higher costs due to supply-chain disruptions and shipping constraints continue to challenge the industry.
Dana's sales in the light vehicle segment rose 22.6% to $991 million, while its sales in commercial vehicles rose 5.7% to $352 million.
The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $2.10 and $2.60 per share, compared to a prior forecast of between $1.90 and $2.40 per share.
""As markets continue to recover from the challenges of the global pandemic, strong first-quarter sales provide the conviction to increase our full-year guidance,"" said Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Collins.
Net income attributable to Dana rose 22.4% to $71 million, or 48 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31.
Excluding items, the company earned 66 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 47 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
Net sales rose 17.5% to $2.26 billion, beating estimates of $2.02 billion.

Shares rose in pre-market trading to a 14-month high.
The company's Gulfstream business jet deliveries rose to 28 units from 23 a year earlier, but fell from 40 in the prior quarter, amid increased coronavirus inoculations and easing travel restrictions. 
While General Dynamics' aerospace segment saw a slump during the global health crisis last year as its supply chain struggled, the company's bottom-line was buoyed by its robust defense unit. In 2020, 69% of its consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government.
In the quarter, sales across all four of its business segments were up compared with the same period last year. 
Sales in the company's aerospace unit rose to $1.89 billion for the first quarter from $1.69 billion a year earlier, while overall revenue rose to $9.39 billion from $8.75 billion. 
Marine Systems revenue was up 10.6% compared with a year ago, after a $1.9 billion award from the U.S. Navy for the construction of a tenth Virginia-class submarine.

Warmer weather and fresh government stimulus checks have led to consumers spending more at restaurants, many of which are struggling to hire new workers fast enough to keep up with the jump in sales.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 07:55AM ET</span>",DIY deals: How private equity firms buy assets from themselves,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - What's a fair price when you are selling something to yourself? On Wall Street, that's not a trick question.
A growing number of private equity firms are establishing new funds to buy portfolio companies from funds they already control. With the buyer and seller each an entity controlled by the same private equity firm, scrutiny is growing over how they price such deals.
""Transactions must be done at fair value and this must be sufficiently mitigated to make sure everybody feels good about the deal being done,"" said Brian Rodde, managing partner at Makena Capital, a private equity investor.
In a traditional private equity transaction, investors will give a private equity fund money to invest in a portfolio of companies with the expectation that they will get their money back, plus profit, once those companies have been sold to outside buyers, usually in a 5-7 year timeframe.
The coronavirus pandemic initially disrupted private equity funds' ability to exit companies and return funds to investors because would-be buyers were wary of deals. Raising new funds to buy the firms allowed private equity funds to hang on to good companies, keep charging investors lucrative management fees and give cash back to those investors who didn't want to wait for their return.
The value of transactions involving buyout firms acquiring companies from themselves reached a record $21.8 billion in 2020, accounting for 87% of all deals in the secondary market initiated by private equity firms, according to fund placement agent Campbell Lutyens. That is up from $17 billion in 2019, when they accounted for 68% of all deals in the secondary market for private equity fund stakes.
A new record may be hit this year, as deal volume in the first quarter reached $15 billion, up from $7 billion from a year ago, according to a  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) estimate.
Industry executives say these deals are becoming more popular because as market fears around the pandemic recede and record levels of mergers and acquisitions ensue, some fund investors want to cash out to avail of new opportunities. 
The risk for investors looking to exit is that they may be forfeiting the opportunity for extra profit by selling too early or at too low a price, while those buying may be overpaying for assets that may not deliver on promised returns.
Existing investors can, however, stick with the asset if they believe there is more value to be had in the future.
""Investors generally have the option to roll their exposure if they believe there is more upside on a go-forward basis,"" Orcun Unlu, Citigroup's global head of private funds, said.
Private equity funds have an incentive to hold on to good companies because increased competition for new acquisitions has driven up valuations, meaning it is expensive for them to go hunting anew. It is also risky; there is no guarantee that the next company they buy will be as successful as the one they own now. 
""There was an expected duration for an exit for some of these (fund managers) on certain transactions and that got pushed out,"" said Chris Perriello, co-head of secondary fund investments at AlpInvest Partners, a division of buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc.
""For the most part, they have been companies that have done very well and there's some sort of value creation story.""
FINDING A FAIR PRICE
To acquire a company already owned by investors in one of its funds, a private equity firm raises a so-called continuation fund, which may include some of the original investors from the old fund as well as new investors.
The investors are the ultimate owners of the portfolio companies, paying private equity firms fees for managing the assets and their performance.
Buyout firms Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Corp, Hellman & Friedman LLC and Clearlake Capital are among recent users of so-called continuation funds that are raised to buy portfolio companies from funds they manage, sources told Reuters.
Ares, Hellman & Friedman and Clearlake Capital declined to comment. 
The continuation fund can invest in a number of portfolio companies but funds focused on single assets have seen the biggest growth in recent years, accounting for $14 billion in assets at the end of last year, compared to zero in 2017, according to data from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
With such deals growing in popularity, investors are seeking greater detail on how valuations are reached.
They do this by setting up independent committees to vet whether private equity firms have any entrenched conflicts of interest and the profitability of any proposed deal.
To further reassure investors that the price agreed reflects fair market value, private equity funds often run auctions, inviting secondary fund firms, which specialize in investing in second-hand private equity assets, to submit bids.
For example, when buyout firm Energy Capital Partners raised a $1.2 billion continuation fund this year to buy a 50% stake in U.S. renewable power and storage developer Terra-Gen from one of its older funds, it agreed on a price following a bid for the stake from Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc's secondary funds division.
The price matched the amount Energy Capital Partners raised when it sold 50% of the company months earlier to investment firm First Sentier Investors.
Blackstone ended up as a major investor in the continuation fund, which attracted 20% of the investors in the original buyout fund holding the Terra-Gen stake, Energy Capital Partners founder Doug Kimmelman said in an interview. [L1N2LT2TH]
But the auction process does not assuage all investor concerns. Participants could end up investing alongside the private equity fund or in their continuation funds. Potential acquirers of the entire company, who have more of a reason to compete on price, are not always invited.
This can make some investors wary of the process, said David Layton, chief executive officer of Partners Group Holding AG, a private equity firm with a big secondary fund division that invests in continuation fund deals.

""There can be misalignment of interest between parties and I think this has to be navigated very carefully,"" Layton said.

76,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Mixed; Tech Earnings and Fed Meeting in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, as investors digest earnings from mega-cap tech companies ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and a key speech from President Joe Biden.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 15 points, or 0.1%.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released impressive first-quarter earnings after the close Tuesday, sending its stock up over 5% premarket, as the recovering economy and growing use of online services combined to accelerate its advertising and cloud businesses. It also announced a $50 billion share buyback.
By contrast, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock traded around 2% lower even after the software giant offered up its largest revenue growth since 2018, with investors seeking even more to justify the company’s sky-high valuation.
Earnings from Big Tech, which have been behind a lot of the hefty gains that the major stock indices have registered in the last year, continue Wednesday, with both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) due to release numbers after the close.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Ford (NYSE:F), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) are among the other major corporate earnings scheduled for Wednesday.
Aside from earnings, it’s Fed decision day. 
The U.S. central bank is not expected to change its ultra-easy monetary policies, with the decision due at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT). A lot of the focus will be comments from Chairman Jerome Powell, who has been consistent of late in indicating that policymakers won't be withdrawing support anytime soon. 
Also of interest will be a speech by President Joe Biden before a joint session of Congress, where he is expected to call on U.S. policymakers to pass a $1.8 trillion package aimed toward children and families and the tax increases needed to pay for it.
Oil prices traded marginally higher Wednesday, helped by OPEC+, a group of top producers, deciding to move forward with a gradual output increase as planned, indicating confidence in the growing recovery of global oil demand despite the Covid-19 crisis in India, the world's third-largest importer. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $63.17 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $66.08.
These gains occurred even after the American Petroleum Institute detailed that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by over 4.3 million barrels last week. Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later Wednesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,765.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2069.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",EU demands immediate access to UK-made vaccines in AstraZeneca legal battle,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -European Union lawyers on Wednesday demanded AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) immediately deliver COVID-19 vaccines from its factories in Britain, in a move that risks reigniting a spat with London over scarce vaccine supplies. 
The call came in the opening hearing of the European Commission's legal case in Brussels against the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker over supply delays. 
AstraZeneca has missed delivery targets to both Britain and the EU, delaying the bloc's immunisation campaign in particular, and stoking tensions between London and Brussels. 
The bloc accuses the company of failing to meet its contractual obligations, whereas AstraZeneca says it is complying with the agreement, which it considers not fully binding.
""We demand deliveries by the end of June and we also demand with immediate effect the use of all plants listed in the contract,"" EU lawyer Rafael Jafferali told the judge in a hearing room packed with journalists.
""The contract listed a series of plants that had to be used by AstraZeneca and that still today, in breach of the contract, AstraZeneca is not using,"" the lawyer said. 
AstraZeneca lawyer Hakim Boularbah retorted: ""There is no obligation to use the factories.""
The contract lists four vaccine-making plants, with two of them Britain. Whereas AstraZeneca has delivered doses to the EU from sites in Belgium and the Netherlands, it has not shipped to EU countries any dose produced in UK plants run by Oxford Biomedica and Cobra Biologics.
The contract also says that a Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) factory in the United States which manufactures AstraZeneca jabs ""may serve as a back-up supply site"".
EU officials have told Reuters that AstraZeneca justifies the lack of supplies from Britain by citing clauses in its UK contracts that prevent exports of the vaccine it developed with Oxford University. 
The UK government has denied export curbs and is seeking extra doses from a factory in the Netherlands run by AstraZeneca's sub-contractor Halix. The EU is now blocking exports from that plant. 
The U.S. government has told Brussels it will not export doses to Europe until its vaccine rollout is completed.
UNDER-DELIVERING
With the pandemic still raging across the continent, the AstraZeneca vaccine was seen as a central part of Europe's immunisation campaign and a way to send coronavirus shots to poorer countries because of its simple storage requirements.
But cuts and delays in deliveries have disrupted the inoculation campaign in the EU, which trails behind Britain, the United States and Israel on vaccinations.
By the end of March, AstraZeneca had delivered only a quarter of what it had committed to the EU. The company has said it plans to ship a total of 100 million doses to the bloc by the end of June, instead of 300 million foreseen in the contract.
Under Britain's 100-million-dose contract, AstraZeneca was supposed to have delivered 30 million by September 2020, but it had only supplied about five million by the end of last year. One million doses came from EU factories, officials have said. 
AstraZeneca has blamed production problems for the delays.
In court, the first session ended in just over an hour and the parties agreed to hold two hearings on May 26. The EU lawyers asked for a decision before the end of June to make sure missing doses could be delivered in a timely fashion.
An EU official told Reuters earlier this week the EU could settle for 130 million doses by the end of June.

If no other hearing is necessary, a decision could be made in the weeks following the May 26 hearings.
""AstraZeneca deeply regrets the decision of the European Commission to start this legal action,"" company lawyer Hakim Boularbah told journalists after the hearing. ""We hope to resolve this dispute as soon as possible.""

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was not penalised because it alerted the cartel to the European Commission.
The EU competition watchdog said the cartel operated in the European secondary trading market related to supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency (SSA) bonds denominated in U.S. dollars.
BAML's fine was fined 12.6 million euros, Credit Suisse 11.9 million and Credit Suisse 3.9 million euros.
The Commission said traders at the four banks colluded on trading strategies, exchanged sensitive pricing information and coordinated on prices over five years.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",TD Bank trial in $4.5 billion Stanford Ponzi scheme lawsuit ends,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - The three-month trial of a lawsuit against Toronto-Dominion Bank, in which the liquidators of the collapsed Antigua bank of former Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford are seeking $4.5 billion in damages is expected to end on Wednesday.
A written judgment from the court is expected in a few months.
In closing arguments at the Ontario Superior Court this week, lawyers for the court-appointed joint liquidators of Stanford International Bank (SIB) alleged negligence and ""knowing assistance"" by TD in providing a correspondent banking account that Stanford used to perpetuate fraud.
TD's lawyers said the bank did not know about the fraud, and that damages should be limited to the estimated $5 million in profit from its relationship with SIB.
Stanford is serving a 110-year prison term in the United States after being convicted in 2012 of running a $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme.
Correspondent banking is the business of providing services to offshore financial institutions. The joint liquidators are Grant Thornton in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.
The plaintiffs alleged that TD was aware of possible risks of providing the services and that the bank was ""willfully blind, reckless and, at a bare minimum, negligent.""
They argued that even after reports of Stanford's conduct came to light, TD did not terminate the services.
TD said media reports about Stanford were not easily accessible and that a U.S. government warning about criminal activity in Antigua's financial sector mentioned by the plaintiffs did not explicitly mention Stanford. 
TD estimated reasonably possible losses from legal and regulatory actions including the Stanford litigation of as much as C$1.4 billion ($1.13 billion) as of Jan. 31. 
Provisions related to legal action will be taken when a loss becomes probable and an amount can be reliably estimated, it said in its 2020 annual report.
The joint liquidators are also seeking $510 million from Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA, after a Swiss court ordered the bank to surrender $150 million deposited by Stanford.

Mediaset and its second-biggest investor Vivendi have been at loggerheads since 2016, when the French media group walked away from a pay-TV deal and then built a 29% stake in Mediaset which the Milanese group considers illegitimate.
The two groups are working to reach an accord, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, after MF daily reported a compromise deal to end the legal war was only ""a step away.""
The paper, without citing sources, said the French group would have five years to sell its Mediaset stake as part of the deal.
Mediaset and Vivendi declined to comment.
Following a string of court rulings in its favour, Vivendi has regained full voting rights for its stake, and its backing is now essential for Mediaset to push through a revamped overseas expansion plan it unveiled on Monday.
Vivendi has succeeded in the past in blocking in court a similar project, which entails moving Mediaset's legal base to the Netherlands. 
In a bid to mend relations, the broadcaster controlled by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Monday it would drop a loyalty share scheme that would strengthen the Berlusconi family's grip on the group.
On Wednesday, broker Kepler Cheuvreux and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) both raised their target price on Mediaset and traders said the prospect of a deal was driving shares higher.

At 0840 GMT, the shares were up 5.9% against a 0.3% drop in Italy's all-share index.

83,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>",Just don't mention the 'T' word,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares cosied up close to record highs and the dollar and global bond yields nudged up on Wednesday, as traders waited to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve utters the dreaded 'T' word later - tapering of its mass stimulus programme.
The broad expectation is that it won't want to unsettle markets for now, and with a packed day of corporate earnings, economic data and U.S. President Joe Biden's first address before a joint Congress session, there was plenty to navigate.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares was sidestepping towards its best month of the year so far as Europe's bourses struggled to hang on to some modest early gains (EU) and S&P 500 futures went flat. (N)
In the FX markets, the dollar was on course for its first unbroken two-day run of gains of the month - April is currently set to be its worst month since last July. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, whose swift rise earlier in the year caught markets off guard, touched their highest in nearly two weeks at 1.647%.
""The thing that we are going to watch most closely is if the Fed says anything along the lines of tapering of asset purchases,"" said Jim Caron, a senior portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""As long that doesn't get mentioned, we are all good,"" he said, explaining that with the coronavirus pandemic still worsening in many parts of the world, investors would view any mention of tapering as a premature step.
Most Fed watchers expect the bank's Chairman Jerome Powell to repeat the bank's recent message that its low interest rates and support programmes will remain in place for a long time yet.
U.S. President Joe Biden will also address Congress and is likely to underscore his administration's plans for mass infrastructure and stimulus spending.
These developments would normally be positive for stocks, but analysts say so much economic optimism is already priced into the equity market that it is difficult to budge stocks further from current levels.
Otherwise, Europe's traders were waiting to hear from ECB President Christine Lagarde and a number of other top policymakers. Economic data releases include Germany’s GfK consumer confidence reading for May and France’s consumer confidence reading for April. 
APPLE EYED
U.S. earnings later include tech and internet giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), as well as Boeing (NYSE:BA), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Ford. (N) The preliminary March reading for U.S wholesale inventories is also due.
There had been mixed bag of earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), 3M, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Tuesday. 
In the FX markets, the dollar index rose 0.2% at 91.047, bouncing from Monday's low of 90.679, its weakest level since March 3. 
The greenback edged up slightly against the yen and the British pound, but trading is expected to be subdued until Powell speaks after the Fed meeting.
As well as the rise in Treasury yields helping the dollar higher, break-even rates on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, a measure of expected annual inflation for the coming decade, rose to 2.41%, the highest since 2013.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was knocked lower after disappointing data on consumer prices and in the cryptocurrency market there was excitement as the European Investment Bank said it would sell a two-year digital bond worth 100 million euros ($120.80 million) on the ethereum blockchain network.
Rival cryptocurrency Bitcoin edged lower to $55,618.
In commodities, Brent crude futures fell a touch to $66.40 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 0.03% to $62.92 per barrel due to worries about energy demand.
Benchmark copper edged back from a decade high of $9,965 a tonne hit on Tuesday due to some concerns about a possible softening of demand in China, the world's top consumer of the metal.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.3%, with travel and leisure stocks easing from all-time highs, and miners retreating after a recent rally.
The region's banking sector was up 0.3% and insurers rose 0.6%. 
Deutsche Bank jumped 6.5% to the top of STOXX 600, as strength at its investment bank helped the German bank post a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit.
Topping London's FTSE 100, Lloyds Banking (NYSE:LYG) Group rose 3.3% after reporting a better-than-expected profit.
Sweden's SEB and Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) inched lower after their quarterly results.
""At a market level, Europe has performed strongly year-to-date and it's clear that there has been an anticipation that the recovery will be quite sharp and strong,"" said Tom Dorner, investment director for European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""You're still seeing a rotation in the market in favour of the more cyclical names like banks and autos.""
Investors, however, stayed away from making big bets ahead of the U.S. central bank's policy announcement due at 1800 GMT. Policymakers are widely expected to reaffirm their stance to keep monetary policy loose until enough economic progress has been made.
Earnings at European companies in the first quarter of 2021 are expected to surge 71.3% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data, up from last week's forecast of a 61.2% jump.
The world's biggest advertising company WPP (LON:WPP) rose 2.9% on returning to underlying growth in the first quarter, as clients launched new products and brands. 
German food delivery company Delivery Hero jumped 5.9%, as it expects revenues to more than double in 2021.

Among decliners, Lysol maker Reckitt Benckiser Group fell 1.4%, even as the company backed its full-year outlook.
British supermarket chain Sainsbury's dropped 2.5%, after it reported a 39% fall in annual underlying profit.

MADRID (Reuters) -Santander beat first-quarter forecasts, signalling that the worst of the coronavirus crisis may be over by not adding to provisions for the pandemic and by booking record earnings in the United States.
The euro zone's second-biggest lender by market value reported a net profit of 1.608 billion euros ($1.94 billion) versus 331 million a year earlier.
That beat the 1.38 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Reuters, but was still short of the 1.84 billion recorded in the same quarter in 2019, before the pandemic.
Spain's largest bank's results mirrored solid figures from HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC).
""Business activity (is set) to increase as vaccination progresses at different speeds,"" Santander (MC:SAN) Chief Executive Jose Antonio Alvarez told a call with analysts.
Santander's loan loss provisions for the quarter were 1.99 billion euros. The bank did not add provisions for pandemic-related losses. In the same quarter last year, provisions were 3.91 billion, almost half of which related to the pandemic.
At end of March, the bank's cost of risk, which measures the premium of managing credit risks and acts as an indicator for potential losses in the future, fell to 108 basis points from 128 points in the quarter.
Shares in Santander were down 0.7% by 0759 GMT after rising 5% on Tuesday ahead of its earnings, while Spain's leading blue-chip index was down 0.17%.
Brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said the results were solid and said the United States and Britain were the main stars. It said the huge fiscal stimulus was helping the United States, where revenues were up 8% year on year.
Santander's underlying profit from the United States jumped to 616 million euros from 60 million, making it the highest contributor among all markets.
Santander said that in Britain, where net profit rose to 294 million euros from 52 million, it would replace its current Chief Executive Nathan Bostock. He will remain in post until a successor is appointed.
A strong performance at Santander's Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB), with a 64% rise in underlying profit, also helped.
Excluding net restructuring charges of 530 million euros, mainly in Britain and Portugal, the bank increased underlying profit by about 50% compared to the previous quarter, buoyed by faster growing emerging economies such as Brazil.
Santander's diversification overseas, especially in Latin America, has helped it to cope with tough conditions for banks in Europe since the financial crisis.
In Spain, where net profit climbed to 243 million euros from 90 million, the bank said Antonio Simoes, the bank's regional chief for Europe, would replace Rami Aboukhair as country head for Spain.
Overall, net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, fell 6.3% against the same quarter last year to 7.956 billion euros, in line with analyst's estimates.

The bank finished March with a fully loaded capital ratio (CET-1), the strictest measure of solvency, of 11.89% under new accounting standards, unchanged from the previous quarter, and within its 11-12% target.

WPP (LON:WPP)'s shares rose 4% as the group reported its first quarterly rise in underlying net sales since the third quarter of 2019, and its biggest rise in the key figure since 2016. Trading was helped by a sales jump of 18% in Greater China. 
""There's been a lot of innovation in the last year and consumers have found ways to spend money,"" Read told Reuters. ""Those parts of the economy that have innovated are seeing growth. 
""There is a lot of strategic corporate activity as companies figure out how to prosper in a post COVID world,"" he added. 
The recovery at the owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies comes after Read sought to better combine the group's digital and data capabilities with its creative agencies, a new approach that had been demanded by clients. 
Since the start of the pandemic it has also won work by helping companies build e-commerce and digital offerings to reach consumers when traditional commerce routes had to close. 

Analysts at Citi said the growth rate put WPP ahead of peers. ""The most encouraging thing about this, though, is not the magnitude of the beat but the broad-based nature of it,"" they said. 
The British company, which had said it expected to return to growth in the second quarter, also won $1.3 billion of new work from companies such as Absolut and  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM), helping it to reiterate its full-year outlook.

LONDON (Reuters) -The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) reported a 3.9% rise in income in the first quarter and said savings from integrating its $27 billion acquisition of data and analytics company Refinitiv were on target.
About 40 million pounds ($55.5 million) of savings in combined operating costs from the Refinitiv takeover had been realised and new products launched, the group said.
It said it remained confident of achieving 25% of the announced 350 million pounds savings target by the end of 2021, in line with previous guidance.
The group completed its $27 billion takeover of Refinitiv in January, turning the 300-year-old exchange into a financial market data giant overnight, although still number two behind leader Bloomberg LP.
In March, it spooked markets by saying integrating Refinitiv would cost a higher-than-expected $1 billion, sending LSE shares tumbling. They have fallen about 20% since March 4, although the stock climbed more than 2% on the day on Wednesday.
In a further setback, Refinitiv's data terminals suffered a blackout lasting several hours this month.
The group said it would hold investor events to give a ""deeper insight"" into the newly enlarged business, with the first on July 2 giving an overview of data and analytics.
RBC analysts said the ""robust"" first quarter figures pointed to a strong start in the delivery of cost synergies. Total income of 1.68 billion pounds and gross profit of 1.5 billion pounds were both in line with market expectations, it said.
The group said its divestment of Borsa Italiana was progressing and expected to be completed in the second quarter.
The LSE had said it would sell the Milan Exchange in order to win approval for its Refinitiv takeover from European Union competition regulators. Euronext is buying the Italian bourse.
The LSE holds its annual meeting online at 1100 GMT on Wednesday. Advisory group ISS is recommending shareholders vote against Chief Executive David Schwimmer's 25% pay rise because of the higher-than-expected costs of integrating Refinitiv.

 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) the parent company of Reuters News, holds a 15% stake in the LSE following the Refinitiv deal.

At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4%.
A number of blue-chip European companies released quarterly earnings Wednesday, with the results being generally positive.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock soared over 6% after the German banking institution posted its best quarterly profit since the first quarter of 2014, as strength at the investment bank helped offset the headwinds of an ongoing restructuring program and the coronavirus pandemic.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) stock climbed 4% and the U.K. bank also reported a strong quarterly result, with profit after tax of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.9 billion), supported by the release of expected credit loss provisions, given the improved economic outlook.
Santander (MC:SAN) stock fell 0.2%, suffering from profit taking after earlier climbing to a 52-week high, after the Spanish bank said its net profit in the first quarter jumped almost five times as it didn't book Covid-19 related provisions like a year ago and its U.S. unit posted a solid performance.
Away from the banking sector, Dassault Systemes (PA:DAST) stock rose 0.6% to an all-time high, after the French software company posted a rise in both operating profit and revenue in the first quarter.  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) stock climbed 1.5% after the French drugmaker posted stronger-than-expected first quarter results, helped by sales of its star eczema treatment.

That demand has helped Sony (NYSE:SONY) continue its shift from consumer electronics to entertainment content and digital subscription services, though analysts say it may wane as more people in key markets such as the United States get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.
For the business year started April 1, Sony forecast profit to fall to 930 billion yen ($8.53 billion), missing the 976.4 billion yen average of 19 analyst estimates, Refinitiv data showed.
Sony benefited from strong demand for its new PlayStation 5 games console last business year, which launched in core markets in November and quickly sold out. It wants to use the console to encourage online game downloads and attract subscribers.
To beef up entertainment content, Sony is pursuing acquisitions and distribution deals. In December, Sony agreed to buy AT&T Inc (N:T) animation business Crunchyroll, giving it 3 million new subscribers across 200 countries.
This month, Sony said it had reached a deal with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co to offer ""Spider-Man"" movies and other films on Disney's streaming service after they are shown on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s service, which had already agreed a streaming deal.

In the three months through March, Sony posted profit of 66.5 billion yen - almost double the same period a year earlier. That result compared with a 76.1 billion yen average of five analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) confirmed its 2021 targets after it posted stronger-than-expected first quarter results as sales of its star eczema treatment as well as flu and polio vaccines helped offset a dip in cough and cold treatments dented by lockdowns.
The French drugmaker, which stunned investors last year with a delay to its COVID-19 vaccine candidate it is developing with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), said on Wednesday it expected results next months from a phase II study evaluating the shot.
Sanofi has since tried to appease critics with deals to fill and pack millions of doses of vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson and Johnson and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
It is also teaming up with U.S. company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) to bring a second COVID-19 vaccine of its own to the market that it hopes will be ready next year.
Sanofi's first-quarter net income was up 14.7% at 2.017 billion euros ($2.43 billion) at constant exchange rates. Revenue rose 2.4% to 8.6 billion euros.
While sales of speciality care, which include revenue of Dupixent, and vaccines, supported by vivid demand for influenza and polio shots, grew by 15.3% and 5.3%, respectively, revenue of the consumer healthcare unit fell by 7.3% as a result of lower sales of cough and cold season products.
Vaccination combined with mask wearing, social distancing and more frequent handwashing imposed by the coronavirus crisis appear to have led to a drop in influenza contaminations in Europe this season.
Sanofi said last year's first quarter was a high base for comparison as people had stocked up in that period because of the pandemic. Cough, cold and flu medications fell by close to 60% in the first three months of 2021.
Novartis on Tuesday said a weak flu season had hit its generic cough medicines business, leading the Swiss drugmaker to post a first-quarter profit below analyst expectations.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp said on Wednesday it would retire treasury shares worth 16.3% of its outstanding stock after the group's largest-ever buyback swelled its holdings.
The cancellation will leave the investment conglomerate holding as treasury stock 0.6% of total shares issued.
The move is ""probably not a signal either way on future buybacks,"" said analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Research, adding it is in line with industry practice. 
SoftBank has spent more than 2.2 trillion yen ($20 billion) on buybacks since March last year, largely completing its buyback programme.
It launched the programme after a series of missteps forced the group to sell down assets to support its share price.
SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund is widely expected to post its largest-ever quarterly profit on May 12 with the listing of portfolio company Coupang Inc driving gains.
The cancellation of treasury shares will boost the ownership of its top shareholder, founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son, who holds a 25% stake. 
The largest-ever gap between the value of SoftBank's assets and its share price last March led to debate over taking the group private before buybacks drove a recovery in the stock price.
SoftBank's shares are trading 7% down from two-decade highs hit last month.

Puma said sales came in at 1.549 billion euros ($1.87 billion), while net profit jumped to 109 million euros, both above average analyst estimates.
In March, Western brands including Puma and rivals  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) faced online attacks in China over statements regarding their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang after reports of the use of forced labour by Uighur Muslims.
Puma said on Wednesday that sales in the Asia/Pacific region jumped 29% in the first quarter, led by Greater China. However, it did note that ""recent political tensions in key markets"" are leading to increased uncertainty in the industry.
Puma has previously said it has no direct or indirect business relationship with any manufacturer in Xinjiang.
Western governments and rights groups have accused authorities in the farwestern region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps. Beijing denies the accusations.
Puma noted that about 30% of stores selling its products in Europe and Latin America were still closed due to COVID-19, while it saw new restrictions in places such as India, Canada and Turkey so the pandemic will continue to curb its business throughout 2021.
It expects to achieve full-year sales growth in the mid-teens and significantly better profitability compared with last year, although it noted it faces uncertainty due to container shortages and port congestion, especially in North America.
Nike last month reported quarterly sales that missed estimates due to shipping issues and the pandemic-related slump at brick-and-mortar stores, forecasting ""low-to-mid-teens"" full-year revenue growth.

U.S. container-freight traffic has slowed significantly in recent months due to COVID-19 outbreaks among dockworkers and safety restrictions while a near week-long blockage in the Suez Canal has added to ongoing disruptions to global trade.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Analysis: Can the Rhine's white gold power Germany's green e-car race?,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - With an eye on rapidly rising demand from Germany's electric vehicle industry, power and mining companies alike are striving to bring to the surface lithium trapped in underground springs of boiling hot water thousands of metres below the Rhine river.
Straddling an area 300 kilometres (186.41 miles) long and up to 40 kilometres wide, the Upper-Rhine Valley in the Black Forest area of southwestern Germany holds enough lithium for more than 400 million electric cars, geologolists have estimated, making it one of the world's biggest deposits.
It could reduce the reliance of the German car industry, also located in southwestern Germany, on imported lithium and early-stage talks are under way with the auto manufacturers.
But sceptics question the economics and are also troubled by possible local opposition, which can be more vociferous in densely-populated Europe than in remote Australia or the deserts of South America that have been the source of lithium supplies to date.
Undeterred, German-Australian start-up Vulcan Energy Resources says it can deliver carbon-neutral lithium, based on extraction using geothermal energy harnessed by up to five power stations it plans to construct.
German utility EnBW already has geothermal power stations and is exploring whether lithium can be a profitable by-product.
""The lithium deposit we're talking about here is gigantic and its properties are ideal for our goal of producing high-quality lithium on a large industrial scale in Germany,"" Vulcan Energy Resources co-founder Horst Kreuter told Reuters.
The company plans to invest 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion), of which it has so far raised about 75 million euros, to build geothermal power stations and facilities to extract the lithium.
It says it could be extracting 15,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year at two sites by 2024 and then, in a second phase from 2025 onwards, it targets an output of 40,000 tonnes per year at up to three additional sites.
Kreuter says he is already in talks with cathode and battery manufacturers, as well as the car industry.
He has powerful backing from Hancock Prospecting, led by Executive Chairman Gina Rinehart, one of Australia's leading investors.
In an emailed statement, Hancock Prospecting said it was focusing on lithium projects with ""the potential to produce a high-quality product at a competitive cost"" and was supporting Vulcan in its development of a pilot plant.
WHITE GOLD
As an ingredient for the batteries needed for a low carbon economy, lithium is often referred to as white gold.
But its economics have a chequered history. Projects have often fallen behind schedule and its price has been volatile, depending on supply bottlenecks and gluts.
Prices have soared this year as demand from the electric vehicle sector has begun to outstrip supply.
Kreuter predicts lithium can sustain a price at least on a par with current levels.
""We calculate internally with a market price of $13,000 per tonne of lithium hydroxide by 2025,"" Kreuter said, adding that extraction costs in Germany would be ""well below"" that level, without being more specific.
The European Union is counting on electric vehicles to help it meet its climate goals. Last year, it added lithium to its critical raw materials list and set out a plan to guarantee supplies to support a green recovery.
The European Commission, the EU executive, has estimated Europe would need up to 18 times more lithium by 2030 compared with now and 60 times more by 2050.
So far, the bulk of lithium has been imported from the area of South America known as the lithium triangle, where it is produced by evaporation from salars, or salt flats.
Australian hard rock lithium relies on energy-intensive processes to extract it, in addition to the carbon cost of shipping it around the world.
In Europe, Portugal is the biggest lithium producer, but its miners sell almost exclusively to the ceramics industry and are just gearing up to produce the higher grade lithium needed for batteries.
GEOTHERMAL
Because of the link in Germany between lithium production and geothermal energy, its advocates say it is guaranteed to be a green solution, although even geothermal energy has detractors.
Geothermal drilling in 2007 caused underground layers of gypsum to swell to the extent houses were lifted and damaged in Staufen, a picturesque village in the Black Forest.
Thomas Koelbel, geothermal energy expert at utility EnBW, which plans to extract lithium at an existing plant in the town of Bruchsal, also in the Black Forest area, said the company had done all it can to prevent any local opposition.
""We have shown with our plant in Bruchsal that there is no extra noise burdening neighbours. There are no emissions at all,"" he said.
EnBW estimates that 900 tonnes of lithium could be obtained per year at the Bruchsal site. It expects to produce lithium for test purposes from a prototype around the end of the year and make a final decision about the project's feasibility by 2024.
CAR INDUSTRY SHOWS EARLY INTEREST
Some investors are reticent because of doubts about how quickly commercial scale extraction of lithium from thermal waters can be developed in Europe.
""If you look at Vulcan's project development plan, it might be argued to be rather novel. Even investments in conventional lithium projects over the last few years haven't had an easy run,"" analyst Reg Spencer of Canaccord Genuity in Sydney said.
But the prospect of offsetting the cost of lithium production from geothermal energy sales could make for ""very low cost lithium production,"" he said.
The car industry is also interested, but not relying on it.
A spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz AG, part of the  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), said the company was in early talks and would reassess the situation as soon as Vulcan had analysed the first exploration material and could deliver reliable forecasts on delivery volumes.
A BMW spokeswoman said the company was monitoring developments on the global lithium market and did not rule out buying German lithium if quality, delivery volumes, social and environmental standards were appropriate.
All parties acknowledge it will take time for substantial volumes to be delivered.
Michael Schmidt from the German Mineral Resources Agency (DERA) said that if expectations for production in three-to-four years are fulfilled, it would be just in time to help ease supply bottlenecks expected around the middle of the decade.
He estimates that up to 2024, domestic lithium demand will rise to 9,000 tonnes per year in a slow e-mobility roll-out scenario and to 32,000 tonnes per year in a fast scenario.
Germany imported roughly 5,300 tonnes last year.
""Each tonne of lithium that Germany doesn't have to import from abroad is better for its industry,"" Schmidt said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally higher Wednesday, with investors waiting for news from the Federal Reserve on a busy day for corporate earnings. 
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%. 
A number of blue-chip European companies released quarterly earnings Wednesday, and the banking sector is likely to be in the spotlight.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) posted its best quarterly profit since the first quarter of 2014, as strength at the investment bank helped offset the headwinds of an ongoing restructuring program and the coronavirus pandemic.
Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) said its net profit in the first quarter jumped almost five times as it didn't book Covid-19 related provisions like a year ago and its U.S. unit posted a solid performance.
U.K. Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) also reported a strong quarterly result, with profit after tax of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.9 billion), supported by the release of expected credit loss provisions, given the improved economic outlook.
Additionally, Dassault Systemes (PA:DAST) posted a rise in both operating profit and revenue in the first quarter, while the French software maker tweaked its full-year outlook.
Earnings from the likes of Covestro (DE:1COV), Delivery Hero (DE:DHER), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) are also due, among others.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve wraps up its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, but is not expected to make any changes to its ultra-easy monetary policies despite a steady run of good economic news in recent months.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after the decision is announced, and he is expected to reaffirm that easy monetary policy will remain in place for a prolonged period and dismiss any suggestions of tapering bond purchases.
On the data front in Europe, Germany’s GfK survey of consumer sentiment disappointed, falling to -8.8 in May from -6.1 the previous month, reflecting the new nationwide regime of restrictions to contain the pandemic.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday as traders digested the competing influences of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, deciding to proceed with plans to move forward with a gradual output increase and a rise in U.S. crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $63.21 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $66.14.
An OPEC+ committee agreed late Tuesday to increase crude production as previously planned from May, amid growing confidence that there will be a strong demand rebound this year, even as coronavirus cases rise in countries such as India. 
However, this positive news has to be balanced against the American Petroleum Institute stating that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by over 4.3 million barrels last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,768.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2077.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) swung to better-than-expected net profit in the first quarter of 2021 as strength at the investment bank helped offset the headwinds of an ongoing restructuring programme and the coronavirus pandemic.
Deutsche painted a rosier look for 2021, saying it now expects revenues to be ""essentially flat"", compared with a previous estimate of ""marginally lower"".
The German lender said on Wednesday that its first-quarter net profit attributable to shareholders was 908 million euros ($1.10 billion), which compares with a year-earlier loss of 43 million euros. Analysts had expected a profit of almost 600 million euros.
It was the strongest quarter for Deutsche since the first quarter of 2014, as revenue at its fixed-income trading business and origination and advisory services surged, trends that have also lifted profits of competing banks. 
(GRAPHIC: Deutsche Bank quarterly results - https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBANK-RESULTS/rlgvdzzmwvo/chart.png) 
The figures are good news for Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who embarked on a radical restructuring two years ago that involved shedding 18,000 staff in an effort to return the bank to profitability.
""These results give us confidence that we'll reach our 2022 targets,"" Sewing said in a statement.
The investment bank's resilience showed last year, helping Deutsche eke out a small profit for 2020 - its first after five years of losses. 
Questions have remained about the sustainability of its investment banking boom, but analysts expect Deutsche to deliver another profit in 2021, a consensus forecast of their estimates shows.
Deutsche's key fixed-income and currency sales and trading business, with revenue up 34% at nearly 2.5 billion euros, marked its best quarter since 2015.
That growth is better than some U.S. investment banks. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported a 31% rise in such trading in the first quarter, while those at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) were up 15%. 
Origination and advisory services revenue at Deutsche, up 40%, showed its best quarter since 2017.
However, low interest rates and a slowdown in global trade pressured revenue at Deutsche's other divisions, such as those for corporate and retail clients, though asset management revenue rose 23%.

The Lee family's handling of the hefty inheritance tax bill - one of the largest-ever in Korea and globally - has been closely watched as it could have resulted in the dilution of the family's controlling stake in Samsung. 
There was also significant public interest amid calls for Lee's $1.76 billion art collection to stay in South Korea, and reports the family planned to make a large donation to make reparations for Lee's conviction on tax evasion and embezzlement charges over a decade ago. 
The family said they planned to pay the tax bill over a period of five years in six instalments, starting this month.
""It is our civic duty and responsibility to pay all taxes,"" it said in a statement released by Samsung.
Shares in Samsung C&T shares dropped as much as 5.5%, however, as the statement provided no detail on how Lee's shares would be distributed, if any shares would be sold, nor specifics on how the family planned to fund the payments. 
""There was general investor disappointment as no details about how the stakes will be divided were revealed,"" said Lee Sang-hun, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities. 
Investors will instead need to wait for regulatory filings to discover changes in shareholdings by Lee's son and Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee or other family members.
The family had been discussing using shares in affiliated companies as collateral for personal loans to pay part of the tax bill to avoid the sale of their Samsung holdings, Reuters reported last week, citing sources. 
Analysts have said the family is likely to use loans and dividends from both their own and Lee's shares to pay the tax.
Lee's shareholdings included a 4.18% stake in Samsung Electronics, 0.08% of Samsung Electronics preferred shares, 20.76% of Samsung Life Insurance, 2.88% of Samsung C&T, and a 0.01% stake in Samsung SDS.
Samsung C&T is the de facto holding company of Samsung conglomerate, of which Jay Y. Lee is the largest shareholder with 17.33% stake. 
The heir is currently halfway through a 30-month jail sentence for bribery and other offences. The presidential Blue House on Tuesday dismissed calls from some business lobby groups to grant him a pardon. 
HEALTHCARE AND ART
As anticipated, the family announced it will donate 1 trillion won to improve public healthcare, including 500 billion won to build South Korea's first specialist hospital for infectious diseases.
Much of Lee's extensive personal art collection, including masterpieces by Picasso, Monet and Chagall, will be donated to organizations including the National Museum of Korea and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, the family said in its statement. 
Remaining works by Giacometti, Rothko and others will be managed by the family and Leeum Samsung Museum of Art, Yonhap news agency reported. 

Former culture ministers and art groups had earlier called for a new law to allow the family to donate the art in lieu of some of the tax bill.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Wednesday morning, but already-high valuations ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision put a cap on gains.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.34% by 10:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT) as the country reported a 5.2% increase in retail sales year-on-year in March, higher than both the 4.7% increase in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February's 1.5% contraction.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.82%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.46% after consumer price index (CPI) data released earlier in the day missed forecasts. The CPI rose 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 1.1% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2021.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.24%. An immigration bill that some argue could prevent Hong Kong residents and others from entering or leaving the city, is up for a second reading in the Legislative Council and could be passed later in the day.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.07% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.29%.
Bonds fell as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed back above 1.6% ahead of the Fed handing down its April policy decision later in the day.
Some investors were optimistic that the central bank would take a more positive tone, even as they expect no major changes to policy itself.
""We expect the Fed's tone on the economy to be more positive than at the March meeting, reflecting the ongoing pickup in the data, but we don't expect any substantive new signal yet on tapering,"" TD Securities analysts said in a note.
""While we do not expect much price action due to the Fed decision, Biden's remarks could continue to suggest more incoming supply, bear steepening the Treasury yield curve,” the note added.
However, investors will look for any hints that the Fed will pull back on asset purchases as the economic outlook continues to improve, as they remain concerned that any withdrawal of support could trigger volatility in global rates and risk assets.
“This is a Fed which is oriented toward the market, they’ve boxed themselves in, in the sense that they’ve given the market a lot of reason to depend on them... if Fed Chairman Jerome Powell changes tack you’re going to have a massive market correction,” Sri-Kumar Global Strategies Inc. president Komal Sri-Kumar told Bloomberg.
U.S. President Joe Biden will also give an address in front of a joint session of Congress later in the day, his first as president. Investors will be monitoring the address for further clues on infrastructure and stimulus spending.
Also on the data front, the U.S. will release its GDP for the first quarter of 2021 on Friday."

Tai and Novavax Executive Vice President John Trizzino also discussed a proposal before the World Trade Organization to waive certain intellectual property rights in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the USTR statement said.
""Ambassador Tai sought Mr. Trizzino's views on steps Novavax is taking to quickly increase equitable production and distribution of vaccines in the United States and around the world,"" the statement said.
Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine is not currently authorized for use in the United States.
WTO members are due to discuss a proposal by India and South Africa to waive certain provisions of the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights on April 30, but the United States and a few other big countries have blocked such a move.
Democratic lawmakers, civil society groups, and 60 former heads of state and 100 Nobel Prize winners have urged President Joe Biden to back the waiver.
Shares of Novavax surged 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after Biden said the United States was planning to share COVID-19 vaccines with countries in need of aid.
The company is expected to report data from its ongoing large, late-stage study in the United States and Mexico during the second quarter of this year.
Tai held virtual meetings on Monday with vaccine makers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
Novavax Chief Executive Stanley Erck met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday and said he was in talks with SK bioscience, the vaccine arm of SK Chemicals, to extend production and tech transfer agreements until 2022.

SK bioscience plans to start producing the Novavax COVID-19 vaccines as soon as the approval comes and manufacture 40 million doses to supply South Korea.

While many SaaS stocks saw huge gains in 2020, this year we need to be more selective. Which is why David Cohne is recommending Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as the top SaaS stocks for May.Twenty years ago, very few companies employed a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. But now, that’s changed, as it’s become widespread in the software industry. SaaS is a type of licensing model where access to software is provided on a subscription basis. The software is located on an external server. Customers access it through a web browser instead of on their computers’ hard drives.
The SaaS business model, for the most part, has become synonymous with the rise of the cloud, as software is accessed through the cloud. Software hosted on the cloud not only provides a time-saving option for companies to update their software but is also less expensive for customers. Previously, consumers would have to buy multiple software products at once, which could get quite costly. The SaaS model, on the other hand, makes it much more cost-effective, especially at the front end.
For a SaaS company, the subscription model provides a steady stream of revenue instead of convincing its customers to upgrade to new products. With so many SaaS companies to pick from, it can be difficult for investors to narrow their choices. That’s why I’ve narrowed down my list to SaaS stocks with solid growth catalysts and Buy ratings in our POWR Ratings service, which is why I am highlighting Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM),  Microsoft Corp .

The electric car maker's quarterly revenue made it barely past estimates, relying mostly on sales of environmental credits sold to other automakers and the liquidation of 10% of its $1.5 billion bitcoin investment. (Graphic of Tesla profits) https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pp7vEo
“Tesla's performance was OK but it wasn't a Elon Musk slam dunk...I don’t think people are into Tesla because of bitcoin,"" said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity Patriarch Organization, which has an underweight stance on Tesla. 
""Investors are rejecting the stock short term,"" he said, saying Tesla's performance has fallen short of catching up its ""astronomical valuation."" 
Musk, the company's CEO, did earn options payouts worth $11 billion based on targets reached by the company. 
Shares of the automaker closed down 4.5% at $704.74, down more than 20% from its intraday high reached in January. They had surged more than 700% last year, making Tesla the world's most valuable automaker.
Tesla posted record deliveries in the first quarter despite a global chip shortage that has slammed auto sector rivals. But analysts said a prolonged shortage of chips and batteries could threaten to dampen its growth prospect. 
""A global shortage of computer chips is expected to limit production from all manufacturers in the immediate future, and Tesla won't be exempt,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""Given the ongoing importance of its production ramp up, it may even be more heavily impacted.""
Regarding supply chain instability, Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on Monday, ""We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult, and it's an evolving situation.""
Roth Capital Partners said it holds a neutral rating on Tesla, saying that Tesla's large premium ""seems to rest on the specious assumption that the hundreds of EVs slated for launch by '25 will all be flops."" 
""Tesla does not operate in a vacuum,"" it said in a report.

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, its top boss said on Tuesday, as a surge in online shopping helped the world's biggest payment processor beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and counter sluggish travel spending.
Payment companies are seeing an uptick in volumes from the coronavirus-induced slump as massive government stimulus and speedy vaccine rollouts fuel an economic recovery, unleashing pent-up demand for both goods and services.
""Visa has weathered the COVID storm and is emerging from the pandemic even stronger,"" Chief Executive Officer Alfred Kelly Jr told analysts on a call.
Visa's total payment volumes rose 11% on a constant dollar basis from a year earlier, its biggest jump since the start of the pandemic.
It saw a return to positive growth for credit and card present transactions, while debit and ecommerce also grew, Kelly Jr said.
U.S. debit cards volumes soared 31% to $806 billion.
""If you leave out the travel part of the business, the rest of the business is beginning to look as if the pandemic never happened,"" Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu told Reuters.
Restrictions and a resurgence of infections in several parts of the world have hit travel plans, sending cross-border volumes at Visa down 11%. That was still better than the past two quarters. 
Prabhu said the recovery continued despite closed borders, with travel to and from the United States and Latin America providing the biggest boost. 
India's second wave was affecting Visa's business in the country ""without a doubt"", he told Reuters.
""It's probably going to affect travel in and out of India. Whether it will have a broader impact on our business ... it's too early to tell.""

Visa reported net income of $1.38 per Class A share for the second quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.27 per share.

(Reuters) -Starbucks Corp missed quarterly sales estimates on Tuesday, sending shares down 2%, even though the coffee chain raised its annual forecast for revenue and profit on the expectation that more customers will return as they get vaccinated.
Global comparable sales were hurt by weakness at its international business, where the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to restrict travel and shut cafes. 
Still, the company raised its 2021 revenue forecast to between $28.5 billion and $29.3 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3.
Analysts have forecast revenue of $28.61 billion and earnings of $2.85 per share.
U.S. sales returned to pre-pandemic levels, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said during a call with analysts.
""When you look at the progress we're making on vaccinations, certainly in the U.S., that's a proxy for what's going to happen around the world,"" he said. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), like other restaurant chains, has struggled for over a year as consumers worked from home and made their coffee and breakfast themselves. Recent lockdowns in parts of Asia and Europe have slowed the recovery.
The Seattle-based company said sales in its biggest growth market, China, nearly doubled from the same period a year ago when its stores in the country remained shut due to the health crisis. 
The surge, however, was not enough for its markets abroad to beat Wall Street expectations. They rose 35% in the company's international markets, but missed expectation of 48.25% growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the Americas, comparable sales rose 9%, powered by a recovery in the United States, thanks to vaccinated consumers returning to stores or ordering their daily cup of coffee online. 
The company grew its active Rewards loyalty program members to 22.9 million, an 18% increase year over year.
""I believe we have an opportunity to double that number,"" Johnson said. ""I'm not going to give a time frame, it might take a couple of years.""
Revenue rose 11% to $6.67 billion for the second quarter ended March 28, falling short of the estimate of $6.82 billion. 

Most analysts believe Starbucks will benefit from reopening as people crave social interactions at cafes and other gathering spots.
""It is still going to be a while before people are both able to and comfortable with doing this again,"" said Euromonitor International consultant Matthew Barry.

(Reuters) -U.S. biotech  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) on Tuesday said its first-quarter sales and profit fell due to a 7% drop in its net drug prices and the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued to limit patient interactions with healthcare providers.
Amgen shares were down 3.4% at $246.50 after hours.
The company's quarterly adjusted earnings per share fell 12% from a year earlier to $3.70, short of the $4.04 forecast by Wall Street analysts, as calculated by Refinitiv.
Revenue for the quarter fell 4% to $5.9 billion - also below analyst estimates of $6.26 billion. Net profit fell 8% to $2.83 per share. 
""They are typically weakest in the first quarter due to seasonality in patient volumes and then bounce in Q2 on a recovery in buying patterns and patient volumes,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in an email.
For the full year, Amgen said it still expects adjusted earnings of $16.00 to $17.00 per share on revenue of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, but lowered its net EPS forecast to a range of $9.11 to $10.71 from a previous $12.12 to $13.17. The company said it now expects a 2021 net tax rate of 14% to 15.5% - up from a previous estimate of 11% to 12.5%. Its adjusted tax rate is now forecast at 13.5% to 14.5%, compared with the previous 13% to 14%. 
""We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well,"" Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway said on a conference call with investors.
Company officials said Amgen continues to expect 2021 net selling prices for its drugs to fall by a rate in the mid-single digits due to increased competition, including cheaper generics and biosimilars.
First-quarter sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel fell 20% to $924 billion, shy of analysts' estimate of $1.1 billion.

Sales of newer migraine drug Aimovig fell 7% from a year earlier to $66 million for the quarter, well short of the $95.7 million projected by analysts. But sales of cholesterol fighter Repatha rose 25% to $286 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $251 million.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February granted priority review status to sotorasib, Amgen's experimental lung cancer drug. The company on Tuesday said it is studying different doses of the drug and expects to have data from combination studies in the second half of this year.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Republicans say 'not so fast' on restoring FTC power to claw back ill-gotten gains,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans at a hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives to discuss restoring the Federal Trade Commission's ability to claw back ill-gotten gains from companies deemed deceptive voiced doubts about quickly passing a bill unless it put some limitations on the agency.
Representative Gus Bilirakis said at a hearing before a panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the FTC had a history of ""overreach,"" without elaborating, and urged that ""guard rails"" be put into the legislation.
Representatives Neal Dunn and Greg Pence also urged ""guard rails"" be added to the bill but did not say what they were although there was discussion at the hearing regarding a statute of limitations for wrongdoing.
The bill can pass the House of Representatives without Republican support but will need some Republicans in the Senate, which requires 60 votes to end debate and move to a vote. 
The hearing was called in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last week that made it more difficult for the FTC to win back lost funds by ruling that the agency was misusing a measure meant to stop bad behavior, not recover money.
Representative Tony Cardenas, along with other Democrats, have introduced a bill to restore that ability.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also opposed the bill as it stands.
Acting FTC Chair Rebecca Slaughter argued in the hearing that the agency had 24 federal court cases based on the 13(b) authority that was the subject of the Supreme Court ruling. The cases could return $2.4 billion to affected consumers, she said.

Among the active cases are an FTC fight with Nerium International, an alleged pyramid scheme later known as Neora, and Lending Club, which advertised ""no hidden fees"" and then allegedly charged hidden fees. It also includes four antitrust cases, including one in which jailed ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli is accused of breaking antitrust law to push up the price of a life-saving drug, the FTC said.

And because this precious metal is expected to continue rallying with increasing demand driven by rising industrial activities amid the current, economic recovery period, we think Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares ETF (PALL) and Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (SPPP) will gain substantially in the near term. Let’s evaluate these names more closely.The increasing demand for rare earth metal palladium in automotive and industrial use amid supply constraints pushed palladium to its all-time price high of $2909.30 per ounce on April 26. A decreasing gold-palladium ratio over the past few weeks signifies that palladium is trading better than gold.
Prices of palladium have risen by more than 23% since Russia's Nornickel, the world’s largest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel, partly suspended operations at two of its mines on February 24. Also, the rising interest in and policy support for the production of fuel-efficient and low emission cars is expected to drive demand for palladium even more in the future.
Given this backdrop, we think Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares ETF (PALL) and Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (SPPP) are well positioned to deliver solid returns.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 04:55PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. watchdog mulls guidance to curb SPAC projections, liability shield - sources","By Anirban Sen, Chris Prentice and Joshua Franklin
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is considering new guidance to rein in growth projections made by listed blank-check companies, and clarify when they qualify for certain legal protections, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The previously unreported measures being weighed by staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would escalate its crackdown on the deal frenzy in special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which it worries is putting investors at risk.
The SPAC market had already started to lose steam after the SEC earlier this month suggested warrants issued by SPACs should be accounted for as liabilities instead of equity instruments, and the potential new guidance could compound that slowdown.
Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years, SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company and take it public, allowing targets to sidestep the more onerous regulatory checks of an initial public offering.
A record $100 billion has already been raised by U.S. SPACs - also known as blank-check companies - so far this year, while the value of SPAC mergers and acquisitions hit a record $263 billion, according to data from Dealogic. 
In the past year, the likes of sports betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc, electric truck maker Nikola Corp and Playboy owner PLBY Group have gone public through SPAC mergers. 
The boom has drawn scrutiny from the SEC which has issued a number of warnings over SPAC marketing and investor communications.
Among the concerns it has flagged are SPAC earnings growth projections. SPAC sponsors say the projections are important for investors, especially when targets are unprofitable startups, but investor advocates say they are frequently wildly optimistic or misleading.
In addition, the SEC is considering guidance aimed at clarifying when a key liability protection for such forward-looking statements applies to SPACs, the three sources said. 
SAFE HARBOR
The legal safe harbor created by the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act protects listed companies from shareholder litigation provided forward-looking statements are made in good faith, identified as such and couched in cautionary language.
While the safe harbor does not apply to IPOs, SPAC sponsors have generally operated on the basis that it does apply to SPAC deals, and have leaned on it heavily to issue growth projections.
But some attorneys say the SEC's rules on the safe harbor are ambiguous, and the SEC's acting director of corporation finance, John Coates, earlier this month cast doubt on whether it applies to SPAC deals. 
He said SPAC targets ""have no more of a track record"" than private companies doing IPOs, raising questions about the potential liability of sponsors and other parties involved in the transactions.
The SEC guidance would aim to clarify the conditions upon which the safe harbor applies, the sources said. Those changes would likely prompt more due diligence and caution on the part of SPAC dealmakers wary of incurring liability, the people said.
The SEC has not substantively amended the definition of “blank-check company” since the passage of the 1995 law, the agency has said.
The changes are being discussed by staff in the SEC's corporation finance division but it was unclear if the agency's leadership would back them, said one of the sources. 
The sources declined to be identified because the discussions are private. 
NEUTRAL STANCE 
While Coates has said there are ""significant"" issues with some SPAC deals, he has also emphasized he is neither pro- nor anti-SPAC. 
In addition to the recent accounting guidance and warnings over projections, marketing and investor communications, the SEC has opened an inquiry into how Wall Street banks are managing the deal risks and is probing electric vehicle-makers that went public via SPACs.
The SPAC boom has been fueled in part by easy monetary conditions as central banks have pumped cash into pandemic-hit economies, while the SPAC structure provides startups with an easier path to go public. 
But the SEC scrutiny may be starting to tamp down the market. SPACs raised roughly $17 billion during the first 20 days of January, but that fell to $2.5 billion during the corresponding period in April, according to Dealogic. 
RBC Capital Markets co-heads of SPAC coverage, Amir Emami and Michael Ventura, said valuations had been stretched during the SPAC boom and that, as with other frothy markets in the past, the sector was due a ""reset.""

""And then when there's a reset, it's a hard reset. So we're going through that reset right now,"" said Ventura.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (TGT), and  Best Buy  (BBY) are cases in point. They are continuing to make improvements to their e-commerce platforms and their stocks are benefiting from this. Read on.The COVID-19 pandemic delivered a severe blow to most retail companies that were focused on solely providing goods and services through their physical retail stores. The fast effects of the public health crisis left many retailers scrambling to effectively serve customers through e-commerce platforms. Digital and Omni channel retailers have shifted more easily, but retailers that prioritized physical stores and face-to-face engagement over Omni channel strategies have struggled to respond to the crisis. However, the shift to online platforms has been driving solid growth in the e-commerce market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.9% from 2020 to hit $16,215.6 billion by 2027.
Furthermore, as the technology continues to improve and companies employ artificial intelligence (AI) enabled technologies on their platforms or increase the use of AR/VR to attract more consumers, the industry is expected to thrive in the coming quarters. Investors interest in this space is in-part evident in the Amplify Online Retail ETF’s (IBUY) 145.9% returns over the past year, compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 47.6% gains over this period.

However, with a gradual economic recovery and an improving international supply chain, the industry has witnessed a quick rebound. But an established player in the sector, Castor Maritime (CTRM), is still reeling from the pandemic’s effects. So, we think investors looking to benefit from the industry’s recovery should instead bet on Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NPNYY),  Costamare Inc . (NYSE:CMRE), and Danaos Corporation (NYSE:DAC) because they are fundamentally stronger.Even though the COVID-19 pandemic demand in the shipping industry last year, rising freight rates and improved transport activities have brought considerable improvement this year. With the resumption of global import and export activities, the shipping industry should see a substantial increase in demand. The industry is enjoying favorable investor sentiment too, as evidenced by Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF’s (BDRY) 255.5% returns over the past year compared to SPDR S&P 500’s (SPY) 14.8% gains. Also, the Global Cargo Shipping Market is expected to grow at a 3.1% CAGR over the next four years to hit $14.20 billion in 2025.
While several companies in the industry have regained substantial momentum, Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM) has lagged behind. Shares of CTRM have declined 18.9% over the past year. Also, in its last reported quarter, the company has reported a $1.75 million net loss and a $0.03 per share loss.
Conversely, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NPNYY), Costamare Inc. (CMRE), and Danaos Corporation (DAC) are fundamentally sound stocks in the sector. These stocks are well positioned to capitalize on the industry’s rebound, and we think it could be wise to invest in them now.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>","Longer runway, daunting challenges ahead for Boeing CEO","By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's newly prolonged CEO Dave Calhoun will unveil the U.S. planemaker's results on Wednesday juggling a barrage of technical and financial challenges under the shadow of mounting political tensions between the United States and China.
Analysts will be pressing Calhoun for updates on the effective re-grounding of part of the 737 MAX fleet over electrical grounding flaws, just as the U.S. travel market is finally rebounding from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The grounding issue is expected to drag on longer than Boeing initially indicated, people familiar with the matter say.
Boeing is also facing certification challenges on its forthcoming 777X mini-jumbo, and forensic inspections and painstaking repairs to fix defects embedded in dozens of its advanced carbon-composite 787, which halted deliveries from October until last month.
One of Boeing's biggest suppliers, engine maker  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), said on Tuesday aviation remained ""challenged"" and beset by volatility, driving its stock down as much as 4.8%.
""Boeing has traded on expectations for vaccine distribution and air traffic recovery, both of which are coming through,"" Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr wrote in a note earlier this month. ""But there's risk of further 787 disruption if international traffic recovery lags, and the pace of the 737 ramp is unclear.""
On the plus side, it completed a hot-fire engine test on NASA's forthcoming SLS rocket and started production on the U.S. Air Force's new trainer jet. 
Boeing declined to comment ahead of results, which will be reported before the market opens on Wednesday. 
Boeing is expected to report a smaller first-quarter adjusted loss of $1.16 per share, compared with $1.70 per share a year earlier, helped by an improvement in aircraft deliveries as airline customers add flight capacity, anticipating a rebound in summer travel.
Optimism in a resurgent U.S. domestic travel market is offset by growing concerns over COVID variants in India and elsewhere, clouding the general industry's recovery.
Boeing's flagship single-aisle 737 MAX, the workhorse of the short-haul travel leading the recovery, remains grounded in the rebounding China market, too. 
Boeing, which sold a quarter of the planes it built annually to China buyers before the 737 MAX grounding, also faces uncertainty over simmering geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have continued under U.S. President Joe Biden.
Last week, Boeing said it extended its required retirement age of 65 to 70 to allow Calhoun, 64, to stay in the top job.
Calhoun aims to stay in the role until he is 70, insiders say. His decision surprised many in the industry who saw him as a shorter-term crisis manager, and it also triggered the upcoming exit of Boeing's well-regarded CFO and heir-apparent for the job, Greg Smith, 54.
As it navigates these challenges and others, Boeing has slowed down its study of a potential new plane to counter the threat of Airbus' A321, which is snapping up orders in a lucrative slice of the travel market. 

Highlighting Boeing's concerns over market share in one of the most important battlegrounds for the next generation of jetliners, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) placed a firm order for 25 A321neo aircraft last week.

Cyclical stocks, however, were higher after the confidence level rose to 121.7 in April from 109.0 in March, well above economists' consensus of 113.0.
Industrials did well, with  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) rallying after reporting strong earnings thanks to small business. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), shockingly, fell despite the electric automaker delivering better-than-expected results.  
Tech stars are reporting earnings this week, with Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) due after markets close.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up on Wednesday, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports Thursday.
We also have the Federal Reserve coming up, and Chair Jerome Powell's comments.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Happy Fednesday
It's Fed decision day. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to stay the course even as the U.S. economy continues to rebound from the pandemic doldrums. Chair Jerome Powell has been indicating that policymakers won't be withdrawing support anytime soon. The decision and statement hit at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT), followed by Powell's press conference.
2. How do you like them apples?
Apple reports Wednesday, so we'll get a sense of just how much consumers and investors like it. Consensus calls for a profit of 99 cents on $77.3 billion in sales. Watch for comments on the chip shortage and how well its iPhones are selling in the all-important China market.
3. Speaking of likes
Facebook is also reporting after the close. Its ad machine is likely to keep humming along, driving revenue of $23.7 billion and an adjusted earning per share of $2.61. But for how long? Listen in on the call for talk of Apple's new data protection system and how it will affect that ad machine going forward.

135,By StockNews,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 03:30PM ET</span>",3 Popular Stocks Analysts Think Will Rally by More Than 45%,"Some industries that emerged as “pandemic winners” experienced selloffs earlier this year as investors shifted to cyclical stocks to capitalize on an economic recovery. However, irrespective of the longevity of pandemic-driven trends, Wall Street analysts expect the following three companies from three different industries to witness solid upside over the next 12 months: Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), and QuantumScape (QS). Let’s look closer as to why.Remote lifestyles and an increasing reliance on technology products and services helped many companies generate solid growth last year. And their stocks' skyrocketing rally has in some instances made them overvalued. When the economy started recovering this year, investors opted to drop these stocks in favor of quality bargains that are well positioned to gain with the economic recovery.
While the sector rotation led to a sell-off of overvalued pandemic winners, many of those companies still hold immense growth potential. That’s because many of the pandemic-driven trends, particularly remote working and shopping, are expected to continue in the post pandemic world. This, along with the increased scope of these businesses in a post-pandemic world and current easy monetary policy, is boosting analysts’ confidence in the upside some of these stocks can still deliver.
Wall Street analysts expect Baidu, Inc. (BIDU), Peloton Interactive, Inc. (PTON), and QuantumScape Corporation (QS) to rally by more than 45% in the near-term. This, coupled with their strong fundamentals, makes them worth adding to one’s watchlist.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 03:21PM ET</span>","Citing 'stunning progress' on coronavirus, Biden celebrates easing of mask rules","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Fully vaccinated people can safely engage in outdoor activities like walking and hiking without wearing masks but should continue to use face-coverings in public spaces where they are required, U.S. health regulators and President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, while urging those who have not to get the shot.
The updated health advice comes as more than half of all adults in the United States have now received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Biden said the new advice was a result of steps the country had taken to fight the coronavirus. 
""We’ve made stunning progress because of all of you,"" Biden said, adding that COVID-19 cases are ""down dramatically."" Deaths among senior citizens have dropped by 80% as vaccinations have increased, he said.
""If you're vaccinated, you can do more things, more safely, both outdoors as well as indoors,"" Biden said, while adding that masks should still be worn in big crowds and at stadium events.
Wearing face masks has been considered by experts one of the most effective ways of controlling virus transmission. With most COVID-19 transmission occurring indoors, and vaccinations on the rise, the use of masks outdoors has been under public debate for weeks in the United States as Americans look to enjoy the benefits of being fully vaccinated. 
The CDC called the new guidelines a ""first step"" in helping fully vaccinated Americans resume activities they had stopped because of the pandemic. 
New COVID-19 cases dropped 16% in the last week as the United States surpassed 140 million people having received at least one shot of authorized vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose vaccine. 
Just over 29% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, the CDC reported, and 43% have had one dose of the two-shot vaccines. 
Last week's figures were the biggest percentage drop in weekly new cases since February, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county data.
The White House is trying to overcome vaccine hesitancy, and Biden offered the new mask guidelines as another reason to get the jab on Tuesday. 
""So, for those who haven't gotten their vaccination, especially if you're younger or thinking you don't need it, this is another great reason to go get vaccinated,"" Biden said.
SMALL OUTDOOR GATHERINGS
The CDC said fully-vaccinated Americans can safely dine outdoors with friends from multiple households at restaurants and attend small outdoor gatherings with a mixture of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
CDC continues to recommend masking for crowded outdoor events such as parades and sporting events and indoor visits to the hair salon, shopping malls, movie theaters and houses of worship.
The agency classified activities as ""red,"" ""yellow"" and ""green"" based on level of safety for unvaccinated people. 
It said unvaccinated people can also walk and run unmasked with household members outdoors safely and attend small outdoor gatherings with fully vaccinated family and friends. 

Data on whether vaccinated people can spread infection to those who did not receive their shots is limited and the CDC warned that people should evaluate risk to friends and family before going out without masks. 
This is an update to the CDC's guidance, which in March said people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can meet without masks indoors in small groups with others who also have been inoculated.

(Reuters) - Tepid results from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and 3M weighed on Wall Street on Tuesday as investors focused on an approaching wave of earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other corporate heavyweights.
Electric-car maker Tesla Inc dropped 3% after its quarterly results late on Monday fell short of some investors' expectations, with its revenue beat largely supported by sales of environmental credits and selling bitcoin, rather than vehicle sales. 
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc slipped ahead of their quarterly reports after the bell. Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), slated to report later this week, were mixed. 
Shares of 3M Co fell 2.7% after the conglomerate said supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the February winter storm were pushing up its costs.
First-quarter overall earnings per share for S&P 500 companies are expected to jump 35% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended at record levels on Monday, and have mainly been supported by ebbing inflation worries, improving economic data, swift vaccine distribution and unprecedented monetary and fiscal measures. 
""We are in that spot where the economy is recovering, there is stimulus money to be spent and people have increased their desire and propensity to consume. For the remainder of the year, you're going to see some fairly optimistic thoughts,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
Investors will monitor the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting for cues on the central bank's thinking on inflation, bond buying and risks to the financial system posed by soaring asset prices. The Fed is not expected to change its policy guidance at the end of the meeting on Wednesday.
In the latest upbeat economic data, U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 14-month high in April as more services businesses reopened on increased vaccinations and additional fiscal stimulus.
In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.01% at 33,979.71 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.02% to 4,186.61.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped -0.31% to 14,094.32.
Also expected to report after the bell on Tuesday were companies including Visa (NYSE:V), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). 
 United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) jumped 11% after it topped estimates for quarterly revenue.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) fell 2.2% after it disappointed investors who were expecting the industrial conglomerate to upgrade its 2021 outlook.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 17 new lows.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to charge iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) this week with blocking rivals on its App Store following a complaint by music streaming service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The move, the first EU antitrust charge against Apple, could lead to a fine as much as 10% of Apple's global revenue and changes in its lucrative business model.
Reuters was the first to report about the imminent EU antitrust charge in March.
Sweden's Spotify took its grievance to the European Commission in 2019, saying Apple unfairly restricts rivals to its own music steaming service Apple Music.
It also complained about the 30% fee levied on app developers to use Apple's in-app purchase system (IAP).
The EU competition enforcer, which has four Apple investigations including the Spotify complaint, declined to comment.

Apple referred to its March 2019 blog following the Spotify complaint, which said its App Store helped its rival to benefit from hundreds of millions of app downloads to become Europe's largest music streaming service.

Given this background, we think Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI),  CarGurus  (NASDAQ:CARG), and America’s Car-Mart (CRMT) should witness solid sales growth in the coming quarters. So, these three stocks are good bets now. Let’s discuss.Amid a global microchip shortage, it is getting tougher for electric vehicle (EV) companies to manufacture new cars in sufficient numbers to meet growing market demand. The demand is particularly high because people still prefer to commute while maintaining the social distance compelled by the COVID-19 health crisis. This, along with an unwillingness (and perhaps inability) by consumers to spend large amounts of money on new vehicles with the global economy still weak from the effects of the pandemic, is driving increased demand for used cars. Also, several used-car companies are now integrating advanced technologies in their platforms, making it much easier for customers to buy used cars online.
The Manheim Index, which is recognized as the premier indicator of pricing trends in the used vehicle market, hit a 191.4 value in mid-April, which represents a 52.2% year-over-year increase. And, according to Mordor Intelligence, the used car market is expected to increase at a CAGR of more than 10% over the next five years.
So, it could be beneficial now for investors to bet on used car companies Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (GPI), CarGurus, Inc. (CARG), and America’s Car-Mart, Inc. (CRMT) to capitalize on the thriving used-car market.

(Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co's executive pay plan for 2020 received backing from only about 57% of investor votes on Tuesday, a narrow win for the company and the latest evidence of the tougher scrutiny that shareholders are putting on CEO compensation this year.
CEO and President Charles Scharf was paid $20.4 million in 2020, down from $34.3 million in 2019, when he was first named to lead the bank, according to the company's proxy statement filed in March. On an annualized basis his total direct compensation in 2020 fell about 12% from $23 million the prior year, according to a January filing.
The board cited the drop in  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s financial results for 2020, which were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, as one of the reasons for the lower compensation.
But the adjustments were not enough to satisfy investors, who generally cast 90% or more of their advisory votes in favor of corporate compensation. Levels below 80% usually result in revamped pay structures, consultants say.
Influential proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that investors vote against Wells Fargo's pay. 
ISS cited concerns including relatively high salaries for top executives, the pay discretion given to its compensation committee, and a decline in the use of performance-based stock awards.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said via e-mail that its directors ""will take into consideration the feedback that we have heard through this process, and we will continue our engagement and dialogue with our shareholders going forward.""
The bank gave the figure of 57% support for its pay during its annual meeting held Tuesday, which was webcast. The spokeswoman said the figure included votes cast for and against the pay, and abstentions. 
Pending a final tally, the vote would be among the lowest for a major U.S. bank in the decade since pay votes were required, according to a separate review by ISS.

The vote was only the latest rebuke from investors against a major U.S. company during this year's proxy season. Just on Monday, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) won backing for its executive pay from only 57% of votes cast. 
As of April 15, about 5% of Russell 3000 companies had failed to win a majority of support for their executive pay, about four times the frequency of last year, according to pay consultant Semler Brossy.

Are these gains just a bounce or the start of a new uptrend? Taylor Dart explains why the bull market may be resuming for the metal.While the major market averages continue to make new highs, the precious metals market has seen a sluggish start to the year. Fortunately, the metals have started off Q2 much better, but silver (SLV) is still underperforming the S&P-500 by more than 1000 basis points year-to-date. The good news is that the recent outperformance has led to many investors giving up on the trade, with sentiment mostly reset from its massive spike in February. This has put the conditions in place for a strong move higher if silver can get past resistance, and one of the best ways to play the sector is junior silver producer GoGold Resources (GLGDF).
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
As shown in the above chart, sentiment for silver has shifted dramatically from early February, with sentiment readings falling from 90% bulls to 30% bulls. As we can see, this has led to a significant improvement in silver’s long-term moving average for sentiment, given that this moving average has plunged from a reading of 79% bulls to 45% bulls. While this reading is not yet on a buy signal and would require further weakness to drop into the buy zone, it is a massive improvement, especially considering that silver made a new multi-year high last week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group representing auto suppliers will tell U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday it opposes setting a firm date to end the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and expects those vehicles will be sold for at least another 20 years.
The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), which represents more than 1,000 vehicle suppliers, will tell a Senate Commerce subcommittee on transportation that the Biden administration should continue to set regulatory requirements that ensure suppliers keep working to improve internal combustion engines.
Ann Wilson, MEMA's senior vice president of government affairs, will tell the panel that new gasoline-powered vehicles ""will likely be on the road for an additional 20 years.""
Climate change concerns ""will not be met unless the propulsion system containing the internal combustion engine continues to improve its efficiency,"" she added.
Wilson warned that a ""fully electric vehicle fleet will require significantly fewer supplier jobs, with some experts arguing that the supplier industry could lose up to 30% of its traditional workforce.""
""Engines, transmissions, aftertreatment systems, and other parts will simply not be manufactured for battery electric and fuel cell vehicles,"" she said.
The governors of a dozen U.S. states including California, New York, Massachusetts and North Carolina, and many U.S. lawmakers have called on President Joe Biden to back ending sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035.
Biden's infrastructure plan seeks $174 billion in spending and tax credits to electric vehicles and charging networks but does not call for phasing out gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.
California said in September it planned to end sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035. Biden's campaign said last fall he did not support California's phase-out plan.
Last week, White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said the administration had not set any specific EV adoption targets.

""We're not making any demands right now because this is about basically using the market to generate the kind of reductions we need,"" McCarthy said.

""We now see the market is going to develop very quickly and we will have sufficient scale to justify greater levels of integration,"" Ford's chief product platforms and operations officer, Hau Thai-Tang, said during a conference call. The supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the more recent shortages of semiconductors have ""heightened the importance of controlling the supply chain,"" Thai-Tang said. 
Ford expects to continue working with battery makers, including South Korea's SK Innovation Co, a supplier for Ford's electric F-150 pickup and other models, Thai-Tang said. But the company wants ""flexibility and optionality to eventually vertically integrate."" Ford plans to invest $185 million in battery development and prototype manufacturing operations in an operation with 150 employees to be called Ford Ion Park, it said. The 200,000-square-foot center will open late next year.

Its share price has climbed 43.2% year-to-date on investors’ optimism over the EV industry's prospects.
However, IDEX’s stock price had retreated 26.2% over the past three months because of the company’s decision to report its expected sales for its Mobile Energy Global (MEG) segment quarterly rather than monthly.
Even though the company has made strategic acquisitions to enhance and strengthen its portfolio, it remains unprofitable. IDEX’s Malaysia-based E-bike subsidiary Treeletrik recently inked a multi-year deal to serve the ASEAN region. Despite this positive development, the company’s unimpressive financials don’t justify its high valuation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit accusing  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG of causing huge losses by defrauding investors in a complex product for betting on stock market swings that lost 96% of its value in a single day.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said investors could try to prove Credit Suisse intended to collapse the market for its VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Notes (""XIV Notes"") through just 15 minutes of its own trading of futures contracts.
Set Capital LLC and other investors in the proposed class action claimed they lost $1.8 billion, while the Swiss bank reaped at least $475 million in profit at their expense.
The 3-0 decision adds to problems facing Credit Suisse, which recently lost $4.7 billion when the hedge fund Archegos Capital Management collapsed, and has been sued over its ties to Archegos and another client, the failed supply chain financier Greensill Capital.
XIV notes imploded on Feb. 5, 2018, when the Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 4.1% and unexpected market turbulence punished investors betting on low volatility.
Circuit Judge John Walker said investors could pursue claims that Credit Suisse manipulated the market for the notes while downplaying the risks in offering documents.
""The complaint plausibly alleges both motive and opportunity to commit a manipulative act, as well as strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness,"" he wrote.
Credit Suisse spokeswoman Candice Sun declined to comment.
Michael Eisenkraft, the investors' lawyer, said: ""We look forward to prosecuting these claims vigorously.""
The price of XIV notes plunged as low as $4.22 from $108.37 during the collapse. Credit Suisse later redeemed them at $5.99 each.
When dismissing the case in September 2019, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan adopted a magistrate judge's findings that Credit Suisse had simply taken advantage of market conditions, and was not trying to defraud investors.
The appeals court returned the case to Torres. 

The case is Set Capital LLC et al v Credit Suisse Group AG et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-3466.

Investing.com -- DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) rose 6% after announcing new pricing and getting a buy rating as Needham initiated coverage.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) also got a buy, but was little changed. 
U.S. local restaurants will have a choice of three different delivery commission price points, starting with a 15% option. DoorDash is also lowering pickup commission costs to 6% and making storefront, a commission-free online ordering product, free. 
""There is a massive, increasingly digital opportunity for small restaurants, and we believe that when we work together, we can help them capture more of that market in a post-pandemic world––in-store, online, through a third-party partner, or any combination of these three,"" said Chief Operating Officer Christopher Payne in a statement. ""Today, we are changing how we do business to provide more choices, and better choices, for restaurants. 
Meanwhile, Needham sees DoorDash continuing to lead in its industry.
“We expect DASH to leverage its leadership position in restaurant delivery, likely solidified by the pandemic, to become one of the leading, horizontal, on-demand, last-mile fulfillment providers in North America,"" Bernie McTernan wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""Survey results suggest delivery adoption gains during the pandemic should be sticky.""
The analyst expects DoorDash will be able to deliver all goods consumers need within an hour, have an expiration date, and/or are produced by a local vendor.  
Uber should benefit from recent acquisitions and expansion into grocery and alcohol. 
Delivery, of course, has become an integral and frankly non-negotiable part of our lives thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic that forced us to lock down and stay home for what seems like forever. Demand for the convenience of ordering dinner with a click and having it delivered to your door is expected to last beyond the pandemic.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",Chesapeake CEO Lawler to step down months after bankruptcy exit,"By Liz Hampton and Shariq Khan
(Reuters) -Chesapeake Energy Corp said on Tuesday that Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler would leave this week, months after the company emerged from a contentious bankruptcy reorganization.
Board Chairman Mike Wichterich will serve as interim CEO, the Oklahoma-based company said, while it completes a search for a new top executive. 
Wichterich said the hunt for a new CEO will ""likely take several months,"" according to a memo to employees obtained by Reuters. Wichterich plans to meet with employees this week to offer his outlook for the direction of the company, the memo also said. 
Shares were up less than 1% in morning trading at $47.26.
Lawler was unavailable to comment and a Chesapeake spokesman declined to comment on the reasons for the departure.
Once the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, Chesapeake filed for court protection last June, reeling from overspending on assets and a sudden decline in demand and oil prices spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It emerged from bankruptcy in February after fending off a challenge to the plan by unsecured creditors. The approved reorganization saw Chesapeake shed about $7.7 billion in debt. 
""We are extremely optimistic about this new chapter and believe the Company has all the ingredients for success,"" the memo said. 
Lawler took the reins at Chesapeake in 2013 after the company's wildcatter founder Aubrey McClendon stepped down amid investigations into possible antitrust violations. McClendon died in a car accident in 2016.
In an interview with Reuters in February, Lawler had said the company was unable to invest enough in operations to turn a profit while simultaneously paying down $9 billion in debt, and that ""led us to make decisions that weren't always the best.""
While Wichterich handles the additional role of interim CEO, Matt Gallagher will be lead independent director, the company said. Gallagher was chief executive of shale oil producer  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE) until its acquisition by rival  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) this year.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>","How the EU and AstraZeneca ended up in court, and what next","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has launched legal proceedings against Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) for not respecting its contract for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, and for not having a ""reliable"" plan to ensure timely deliveries.
A first hearing in the case will be held at the Brussels Court of First Instance from 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Wednesday. 
The proceedings will be public and conducted under an emergency procedure, which means they could be concluded in a matter of weeks, the European Union's executive Commission said.
HOW DID IT COME TO THIS?
The EU's decision to sue AstraZeneca came after the company repeatedly cut supplies to the 27-nation bloc, contributing to major delays in Europe's vaccine rollout, which has lagged those in Britain and the United States. 
Under the contract, which was drawn up under Belgian law, the company committed to making its ""best reasonable efforts"" to deliver 300 million vaccine doses from December 2020 to June 2021, including 180 million in the current second quarter.
However, the company said in a statement on March 12 that it would aim to deliver only one-third of that 300 million total, of which about 70 million would be in the second quarter.
A week later, Brussels sent a legal letter to AstraZeneca, in the first step of potential court proceedings.
WHAT DOES ASTRAZENECA SAY?
AstraZeneca says the EU's legal action is without merit, argues that it complied with the contract, and has pledged to defend itself robustly in court.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE EU? 
EU officials say the aim of the lawsuit is to compel AstraZeneca to deliver more vaccines than the number it has said it would aim to deliver. 
The EU wants as many as possible of the promised 300 million doses, but would settle for 130 million by the end of June, an EU source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
Brussels will also want AstraZeneca to explain to the court how it spent more than 224 million euros ($270 million) granted by the EU last September to buy vaccine ingredients, and for which the bloc said the company did not provide sufficient documents confirming the purchases.
If successful in court, the EU would send a warning to other vaccine suppliers. Pharmaceutical Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has warned the EU it may not deliver the 55 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine that it contracted to supply in the second quarter.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS FOR THE EU?
Some member states were initially reluctant to sue AstraZeneca on the grounds that it would take too long and, rather than speed up deliveries, only exacerbate tensions with a company they are still counting on for their vaccine campaigns.
If the EU loses its case in the Brussels court, it would be a public relations blow on top of criticism over its handling of vaccine purchase agreements and rollout of shots.
HOW FAR IS THE EU STILL RELYING ON ASTRAZENECA?
The AstraZeneca shot developed by Oxford University was supposed to be the main one in the EU vaccination campaign for the first half of this year.
However, the EU has now distanced itself from the company due to the supply problems and concerns over the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. 
The bloc has forgone another 100 million AstraZeneca shots that it had an option to buy under the contract signed last August, and is now relying mostly on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to inoculate at least 70% of EU adults by the end of July.

Still, while the AstraZeneca shot has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots, the EU drug regulator has recommended its use to contain the spread of COVID-19.

China has already imposed a sweeping restructuring on Ant Group, the fintech conglomerate whose record $37 billion IPO was derailed by regulators in November, underscoring Beijing's determination to rein in its internet giants.

(Reuters) -Hasbro Inc said on Tuesday it would raise prices of toys and games to counter higher raw material costs as the company sees surging demand for its Nerf blasters and board games from families spending more time at home.
Shares of the Monopoly maker, which late on Monday announced the sale of Entertainment One Music to Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc for $385 million, rose 1% in morning trading.
The toymaker, like most U.S. manufacturers, has had to contend with rising resin, packaging and metal prices, as well as soaring transportation costs due to high demand and supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Rival  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) last week had flagged expectations for a ""significant impact"" to margins from higher resin prices and ocean freight charges.
""Freight and input cost increases have become more pronounced over the past several months, and we have plans in place to help mitigate those costs, including price increases for the second half of the year,"" Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) Chief Financial Officer Deborah Thomas said.
Demand for toys has remained robust more than one year into the pandemic, with the company reporting a 14% rise in first-quarter sales in its consumer products unit. 
Excluding certain items, Hasbro earned $1 per share, above analysts' average estimate of 65 cents, according to a Refinitiv IBES estimate.
A drop in advertising around films and TV shows due to the pandemic-forced production delays and theater closures also aided in the profit beat. 

However, net revenue rose just 1% to $1.11 billion in the quarter, missing analysts' estimates of $1.17 billion, as the delays and closures hurt the company's entertainment production revenue. 
Hasbro, like Mattel, said it saw ""substantial"" opportunity in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for some of its collectible brands, looking to tap into the explosive growth in popularity of the digital asset.

That demand is likely to increase even more as people get vaccinated and hit the road this summer. What does this gasoline demand mean for a company like  Valero Energy  Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and its stock price? Read more to find out.
Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is a leading US refining company. Higher oil and oil product prices have led to more attractive refining margins. Since reaching a low of $31 per share in March 2020 and a higher low of $35.44 in late October 2020, the shares more than doubled at the recent high and were trading above the $70 level at the end of last week.
An attractive dividend and the prospects for rising gasoline demand could push VLO shares a lot high over the coming weeks and months as the US heads into the peak driving season. The gasoline market has made a substantial comeback from the pandemic-stricken period in 2020, and that trend is likely to continue. Higher gasoline demand in the post-pandemic period is bullish for Valero shares, which are back in the buy zone.

Investing.com – Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) reached a 52-week high Tuesday after the company milked strong Chinese demand and rising farm commodity prices in the March quarter to beat earnings expectations.  
The company’s stock has jumped more than 20% since the end of January, and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) gave the stock a buy last week citing “a renewed agriculture cycle that is expected to last a few years and potentially much longer.” Shares rose 2.9% on Tuesday.
Agriculture commodities like corn and wheat have been trading at multi-year highs, thanks to booming demand for processed food and all things that make life easier.
Starches and sweeteners, including ethanol production from the company’s wet mills, achieved significantly higher results, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex.
Demand for flavors produced by the company grew, too.
ADM announced earnings per share of $1.39 on revenue of $18.89 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.04 on revenue of $16.25 billion.
Net earnings were $689 million, up by more than half from $391 million in the March quarter of 2020.
“We expect significant year-over-year growth in earnings across all three of our businesses in 2021, and continued sustainable growth in the years to come,” Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano said in a filing.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed in narrow ranges on Tuesday, as the market digested a host of corporate reports that pointed broadly to an ongoing economic recovery - albeit one that has been generally priced in already. 
The market was kept subdued by the onset of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, where no change in interest rates or bond purchases is expected, but which will nonetheless have more concrete signs of recovery to digest than the last meeting did. The Conference Board said earlier its consumer confidence index rose by more than expected to its highest in over a year in April. Whether such data points will be enough to formally move the Fed's guidance is a moot point. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96 points, or 0.3%, at 33,885 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%. 
Prominent among the early movers was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which fell 2.5% after publishing record earnings after the close on Monday. The unenthusiastic reaction was down to the fact that the electric carmaker again relied on sales of regulatory emissions credits and Bitcoin holdings from its corporate treasury to generate its earnings. Operating losses widened as average selling costs fell, reflecting the higher share in the sales mix of its lower-margin Model 3 product. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts nonetheless reportedly raised their price target for the stock to $860 in response.
On a heavy day for earnings,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) stood out with an 11% gain after another set of results that profited from the pandemic's electrifying effect on e-commerce and the associated demand for delivery. 
Shares in commodities trader Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) also rose 3.3% after the company rode a vigorous rally in agricultural products to quarterly earnings that were some 30% above forecasts. ADM reported as soybeans, wheat and corn futures all hit their highest in at least eight years, thanks to difficult growing conditions in the U.S., Brazil and Russia that threaten to weigh on this year's crops.
Away from the earnings newsbeat, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 5.7% as the short-term pressure on its stock from a large capital raising faded, while LYFT  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock rose 2.9% after the ride-hailing company agreeing to sell its self-driving unit Level 5 to Toyota for $550 million. The sale will trim $100 million a year from its operating costs, bringing profitability a little bit closer for the loss-making company.
Elsewhere, DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock rose another 1% after the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed house prices rising at their fastest in over 25 years in March, at an annual rate of over 12%.  "

(Reuters) -U.S. aerospace manufacturer Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp on Tuesday lifted the lower end of its full-year sales forecast on strong performance of its defense unit and a recovery in commercial air travel.
Neil Mitchill, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s newly appointed chief financial officer, said in an interview that ""increasing confidence and a commercial aero recovery that we began to see take hold at the end of the first quarter"" led to the company's view for 2021.
While demand for Raytheon's aviation technologies and service for aircraft manufacturers slumped during the global health crisis, its robust defense unit that contributes more than half of overall sales continued to lift its bottomline.
During the quarter, the company had a notable $1.4 billion in classified bookings for work at Raytheon's Intelligence and Space unit, which Mitchill said was ""clearly an indication that the operations tempo is increasing from where we saw it exiting 2020."" 
The company now expects between $63.9 billion and $65.4 billion in full-year sales, compared with its previous forecast of $63.4 billion to $65.4 billion.
For the quarter, Raytheon had earnings per share of $0.90 versus Wall Street analyst's consensus estimate of $0.88. Revenue rose to $15.25 billion from $11.36 billion but missed Wall Street's estimate of $15.36 billion.
Net income attributable to common shareowners was $753 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from a loss of $83 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.
Raytheon increased its 2021 share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to at least $2 billion. 
The company, which had about 195,000 employees when it merged with United Technologies last April, has laid off nearly 20,000 full-time and contract employees in its commercial aerospace business, which makes aircraft engines and spare parts. Raytheon said savings from the merger increased by $300 million to $1.3 billion.

On a call with Wall Street analysts, management said Raytheon was cooperating with Department of Justice investigations into contract pricing in the 2011-2013 timeframe. Management said the investigations were not expected to have a material impact. 
Raytheon ended the first quarter with a backlog of $147.4 billion.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Cashing blank checks- why the bold favor SPACs,"(Adds dropped word 'data' in 12th paragraph)
By Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dimitri Kazarinoff started his first ever earnings call as XL Fleet Corp chief executive last month with a u-turn.
When the maker of electrified powertrains for vans and pickup trucks agreed a $1 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in September, it made a financial forecast rarely seen in an initial public offering (IPO).
XL Fleet predicted that its revenue would more than triple in 2021 to $75.3 million.
However, on XL Fleet's March 31 earnings call Kazarinoff said that the COVID-19 pandemic and a microchip shortage had weighed on fleet orders and its ability to fulfill them, which would mean it missing the revenue forecast. 
Amid a broader SPAC selloff, XL Fleet's shares are now down more than 50% since the completion of its merger with the SPAC, Pivotal Investment Corporation II, in December. 
XL Fleet told Reuters that it had not foreseen the supply chain challenges when it gave its forecast last September, and that the ""fluid"" situation prevented it from issuing formal 2021 guidance once it became a publicly listed company.
It declined to comment on the share price fall.
Confident financial projections are common in SPAC deals and have been a decisive factor in attracting firms regarded as more risky, often loss-making and years away from even having any sales, over IPOs as a route to going public, industry insiders said and a Reuters review of data compiled by Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, confirms.
This is because IPOs are excluded from U.S. securities regulations which shield companies against investor lawsuits for making financial estimates they do not meet.
SPACs are given this protection, so lawsuits against companies going public have to clear a higher hurdle of showing malfeasance or negligence in the making of the projections.
Companies have taken advantage, opting for SPACs even though the lucrative stock compensation of SPAC managers leaves their existing shareholders with less equity, making them almost three times as costly than IPOs, investors and investment bankers say.
Three out of four firms that went public between 2020 and early 2021 through a SPAC merger were unprofitable, compared to 61% through an IPO, data compiled by IPO expert Ritter shows. 
""Some companies cannot sell their story based on valuation multiples all the way out to 2025 or 2027, it would bring their valuation down,"" Vik Mittal, a portfolio manager at Glazer Capital and one of the biggest U.S. SPAC investors, said. 
SPAC CADETS
The wild projections of some SPAC deals have turned them into darlings of amateur traders, who scour social media platforms such as Reddit for ""meme"" stocks to pile on.
But these stock rallies are usually fleeting; companies that went public through SPACs from January 2019 to June 2020 have negative mean returns of 12.3% six months after their merger, and negative 34.9% returns after one year, research led by Professor Michael Klausner at Stanford University shows.
Their 12-month return is 47.1% lower than the IPO index, Klausner's data shows. 
""Some of the companies that go public through SPACs are early and pre-revenue. They probably wouldn't have been able to go public through an IPO, which doesn't provide safe harbor for projections that are shared with investors,"" said Anna Pinedo, a capital markets partner at law firm Mayer Brown.
Regulators have started to notice. 
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official said this month that the ability of companies to freely publish performance projections during their SPAC deals was ""overstated at best"".
An SEC spokesman declined to comment on whether the financial regulator was considering changes to the safe harbor provision in its rules that allows companies that go public through SPACs to make projections.
Nevertheless, several successful companies, including sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc and potato-chip maker Utz Brands Inc, have gone public through SPACs, and have seen their shares continue to rise many months after their deal.
Some pick a SPAC because the frothy market for blank-check acquisition firms, which have raised more already this year than the entirety of 2020, can give them a higher valuation. 
And companies get this valuation in advance, removing one of the big uncertainties of the IPO process.             
""SPACs are preferred by early-stage, high-growth companies. If they are more mature, they should be able to do an IPO on their own,"" said Jonathan Keidan, founder and managing partner at venture capital firm Torch Capital.
For a graphic on SPACs' surging popularity rivals IPOs:

173,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>","Amazon to Pass Walmart in U.S. Retail Sales in 2025, Report Says","(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). will supplant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. as the biggest U.S. retailer by 2025, according to a new report, suggesting the e-commerce giant has too much momentum for Walmart to stop despite big investments in its own e-commerce offerings.
By 2025, U.S. shoppers will buy $632 billion worth of products at Amazon and retail afflilites including Whole Foods Market, surpassing Walmart’s $523 billion, according to the report by Edge by Ascential, which measured the value of all goods sold by each company online and in stores with the exception of gasoline. Edge by Ascential helps brands sell products online and in stores.
To assess the relative size of Amazon and Walmart, Edge used gross merchandise volume, which measures how much money shoppers spend at each company. Traditionally company size is measured by comparing revenue, but doing so in this case doesn’t capture the full picture because the two companies have different models.
Amazon generates most of its sales from the approximately 2 million third-party merchants on its site, charging these sellers a commission that is typically 15% of a given product’s price. What the merchants collect doesn’t show up on Amazon’s income statement.
While Walmart has a growing online operation and third-party marketplace, it remains mostly a traditional retailer, buying products from wholesalers and marking them up. Most products Walmart sells show up as revenue, so by that measure Walmart will outstrip Amazon for several years.
The report doesn’t include revenue from Amazon’s cloud computing division or advertising sales. It includes sales from both retailer’s affiliates, including Whole Foods for Amazon and Sam’s Club for Walmart, but doesn’t include fees for subscriptions like Amazon Prime or Sam’s Club.
“The pandemic has permanently shifted consumer habits from in-store to e-commerce,” said Deren Baker, CEO of Edge by Ascential. The main beneficiary is Amazon because Walmart is still playing catch-up even though it’s been spending to add features to its online store, including launching a Prime-style subscription service last year. Amazon, meanwhile, continues to build fulfillment centers around the country in an attempt to speed up delivery and erase the advantage Walmart enjoys with curbside pickup at its more than 5,000 locations.
For Edge’s prediction to pan out, Amazon will have to keep appealing to consumers. The company’s recent victory over a union bent on organizing a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, left many Americans with the impression that Amazon treats its workers poorly despite paying them more than twice the federal minimum wage. There also are concerns that Amazon is hurting the environment and small businesses.
Younger consumers in particular are wary of spending too much on the site. Generation Z shoppers, aged roughly 15 to 25, are most likely to feel guilty about shopping on Amazon and are most eager to reduce their spending on the site, according to a survey of 2,000 shoppers by the San Francisco firm Sitecore. The survey found that 53% of Gen Z shoppers were eager to cut back on their Amazon shopping, followed by 49% of Millennials, 36% of Gen X’ers and 25% of Baby Boomers.
Almost 70% of those surveyed were Amazon Prime members and more than half said they typically go to Amazon first for online purchases before search engines such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Sitecore said.

(Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the British chip technology firm being acquired by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp in a $40 billion deal, on Tuesday gave new details about its next generation of data center technology and said  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding will use the chips.
Arm creates underlying intellectual property that other firms such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc or Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) then license to create their own processor chips. Arm's technology powers most mobile phones, but it is making a push into data center processors, where  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have long dominated.
Analysts view Arm's data center efforts as the key reason that Nvidia, which also competes against Intel, sought to buy the firm. British officials have invoked a national security law to review the deal.
Arm said on Tuesday that its ""N2"" Neoverse computing cores are expected to be about 40% faster than the previous generation. The company also said that its ""V1"" cores - which are designed to handle a different type of math commonly used for artificial intelligence - are expected to be 50% faster than traditional methods of doing the same tasks.
Arm said that Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology Inc is making a chip using its new technology. It also said that Oracle will use Arm-based chips made by Ampere Computing in its growing cloud computing business, and that Chinese technology giant Alibaba is preparing to offer Arm-based cloud computing services, though the chip vendor was not disclosed.
The new cloud customers come after Intel for years controlled more than 90% of the market for data center chips. 
Chris Bergey, Arm's senior vice president and general manager for its infrastructure line of business, said that Arm's approach has been to license its technology to many different chip companies who are taking different approaches to winning business from cloud customers.

""We're all engineers here - there's different optimization points, there's different views"" Bergey told Reuters in an interview. ""I don't think anyone is saying Arm is not a viable alternative.""

Shares fell 1.6% to $196.40 before the bell on Tuesday as 3M reiterated its full-year forecast of earnings and total sales growth, a move analysts dubbed conservative.
""Global economic recovery remains uneven and fluid as COVID-19, vaccination deployments and government policies continue to evolve,"" the company said in a statement.
3M said it expects a raw materials and logistics charge of between 30 cents and 50 cents per share in 2021, compared with a prior forecast of flat to a 10 cent hit.
Many U.S companies, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), were forced to temporarily shut operations in February as a severe winter storm caused power outages and gas shortages in parts of the country.
In the first quarter, 3M beat profit and revenue estimates, benefiting from people buying more products to stave off potential coronavirus infection, including 3M's N95 masks, which provide a high level of filtration against airborne contaminants.
General cleaning equipment has also been in high demand as people stay at home to avoid contracting the virus.
Sales in the company's safety and industrial unit jumped 13.7% to $3.3 billion in the quarter ended March 31, boosted by demand for personal safety products, roofing granules and industrial adhesives.

Net income attributable to 3M rose 24.2% to $1.62 billion, or $2.77 per share, from a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn a profit of $2.29 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Net sales rose 9.6% to $8.85 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $8.47 billion.

Investing.com –  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares were trading higher by 3% premarket Tuesday after the ride-hailing company sold its self-driving unit to Toyota,  shortening its path to profitability.
The company had said it expects adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of basic operating profit, to be positive by the end of this year. The sale of its self-driving technology unit, Level 5, will move that date up to the third quarter, by removing $100 million of annualized operating expenses, the company said in a statement. The expenses chiefly reflect the unit’s R&D spend.
Lyft reported a net loss of $1.8 billion in 2020, narrower than the $2.6 billion it posted in 2019. The company has no forecasts for when it will post a net profit.
As of Monday’s close, Lyft’s shares are 8% off their 52-week high of $68.25.
Lyft said on Monday it had agreed to sell its self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, to Toyota for $550 million. Some $200 million of that will be paid upfront, with the rest coming over five years. 
As per a note by Needham & Company analyst Bernie McTernan, Lyft is “a good company with secular tailwinds but a stock that is properly valued”. He rates it as ‘hold’.

(Reuters) -General Electric saw less cash outflow than estimated in the first quarter even as its lucrative jet engine business struggled with the pandemic-led collapse of air travel, driving down company revenue.
The company also reaffirmed its full-year free cash flow and earnings per share outlook. 
Tuesday's earnings report, however, disappointed investors who were expecting the industrial conglomerate to upgrade its 2021 outlook.
The improvement in earnings at power and renewables businesses was also not as strong as some analysts were expecting.
GE's shares, which have gained over 145% since last May, were down 2.80% at $13.19 in pre-market trade.
The Boston-based company reported a cash outflow of $845 million compared with an outflow of $2.2 billion last year. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected a cash outflow of $1.3 billion.
The first quarter tends to be GE's slowest period of the year. However, improved earnings from a year ago and better working capital helped slow the cash burn.
The company expects a similar year-on-year improvement in cash flow in the current quarter.
Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE's operations and ability to pay down debt.
Its jet-engine business, usually GE's cash cow, is still reeling from the plunge in global air travel. The unit generated revenue of $4.99 billion during the quarter, down 28% from a year ago and below analysts' estimate of $5.31 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

GE reported $17.12 billion in revenue, down 12% year-on-year, and lower than $17.5 billion estimated by analysts in a Refinitiv survey.
On an adjusted basis, it earned 3 cents per share in the quarter, compared with 2 cents per share a year earlier.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>",Eli Lilly profit misses as vaccines sap U.S. demand for COVID-19 drugs,"(Reuters) -Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday missed estimates for first-quarter profit and cut the top end of its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings as demand for its COVID-19 antibody therapies took a hit due to the roll-out of vaccines in the United States.
Demand for antibody drugs from Lilly and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) has failed to take off in the United States, given the complexities associated with administering the treatments. 
Sales of Lilly's COVID-19 antibody drug, bamlanivimab, also came under pressure after the U.S. government stopped its distribution as a standalone treatment last month on worries that new variants of the virus could be resistant to it. 
The drugmaker is now focusing on a combination of bamlanivimab with another treatment, etesevimab.
""COVID-19 therapies are reducing in their need as the virus is being arrested by vaccines in the United States,"" Lilly's Chief Executive Officer David Ricks said in an interview with CNBC. 
Lilly earned $810.1 million from its COVID-19 drugs in the quarter, below estimates of $985 million, according to Guggenheim analysts. Lilly shares fell 4% in premarket trading. 
The drugs, which include bamlanivimab as well as its combination with etesevimab, had brought in sales of $871.2 million in the fourth quarter.
The company now expects adjusted full-year earnings of $7.80 to $8 per share from its prior forecast of $7.75 to $8.40 per share. 
Sales from COVID-19 drugs are expected in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion from $1 billion to $2 billion projected previously.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.87 per share, missing estimates of $2.13 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net earnings fell 7% to $1.36 billion, or $1.49 per share, in the quarter ended March 31.

A podcaster could mark episodes as subscriber-only and publish them on Spotify and other podcast listening platforms, the company said in a statement.
Spotify, the world's most popular paid music streaming service, said it won't take a commission from podcast creators' subscriber revenue for the next two years, and planned to charge a 5% fee starting in 2023.
Online stores such as Apple's app store usually charge developers a fee for purchases made on their platforms. 
Spotify filed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-spotify-tech-idUSKCN1TP2D0 a complaint two years ago with European Union regulators saying that the fees Apple charges for taking payments through the store had made it unfairly difficult for rivals to compete for music subscribers.
Apple competes with Spotify for music streaming and earlier this month unveiled https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-goes-battle-with-spotify-premium-podcast-push-2021-04-20/#:~:text=Spotify's%20acquisitions%20include%20about%20%24340,offers%20advertising%20technology%20for%20podcasts a subscription platform that will cost $19.99 per month and will provide creators the tools they need to offer podcast subscriptions.
Spotify has selected 12 independent podcasters to publish subscriber-only bonus content in their existing podcast feeds, and the company will also expand the programme to more creators over the coming months. 
National Public Radio (NPR) will publish five ad-free shows for paid subscribers from May 4, including ""How I Built This with Guy Raz"" and ""Planet Money"". 
Spotify has been boosting its podcast muscle by spending more than half a billion dollars in buying podcast networks Gimlet and Anchor, and podcast ad company Megaphone. 
The new subscription tool is built using Anchor's platform. 

The Swedish company is also testing a system where content publishers on other platforms with existing subscriber bases can deliver paid content using Spotify.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",Analysis: Bankers call for more bang to Britain's big finance fightback,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Shortly after Britain left the European Union, finance minister Rishi Sunak pledged a series of measures he dubbed ""Big Bang 2.0"" to ensure the City of London remained one of the world's top financial centres.
Four months on, many financiers say his reforms to date are a far cry from Margaret Thatcher's explosive changes of the 1980s, which were known as Big Bang and led to London dominating much of global finance during the following decades.
""There is a lot of process going on but it does not add up to a Big Bang 2.0. It's more about fine tuning than radical change,"" Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, which promotes the financial sector, told Reuters.
Britain's 130 billion pound ($181 billion) finance industry has lost thousands of jobs, a trillion pounds in assets, and billions of euros in daily stock and swaps trading to Amsterdam since its full departure from the bloc on Dec. 31 severed the financial hub from the continent.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has responded by proposing changes to make rules on stock market listings, financial technology firms and insurers more flexible along with a review of capital and proprietary trading rules. 
And last week it asked the Bank of England to begin examining a central bank-backed digital currency which Sunak dubbed 'Britcoin'.
But the Treasury faces constraints on how far it can go, with diverging interests, the need to stick to a global rule book, and the Bank of England opposed to softening many of the tough regulations brought in after the 2008 financial crisis. 
That has left many in the industry uncertain as to whether enough is changing to attract much new overseas business, calling on the government for a clear long-distance roadmap.
""A vision would set a framework for regulators and gives our partners, the countries we do business with, a sense of direction of travel and ambition in this area,"" Celic said. 
The Treasury said in a statement that it is boosting competitiveness in a series of reforms ranging from the changes to listing rules to Britain's first ever sovereign green bond. 
""The Chancellor has set out a clear vision for a more open, innovative and greener financial services industry – and we’re moving quickly to deliver this,"" a Treasury representative said.
A senior asset management industry official said it would be good to hear Sunak give a ""strong statement before the summer"" on backing more flexible regulation and keeping the British market open, regardless of what other countries do.
Much is at stake given that Britain's financial services sector employs 1.1 million people and raises about 75.5 billion pounds a year in tax, a figure which consultants PwC expect to ease in 2021 due to the City of London being effectively cut off from the EU, hitherto its biggest export market.
But many rule changes will need legislation, meaning they may not come into effect until 2022 or beyond.
Conor Lawlor, director for capital markets and wholesale at banking industry body UK Finance, said reforms set out so far are well paced but need to speed up. 
""We are keen to see it move to implementation.""
https://graphics.reuters.com/TRADING-CENTERS/qzjpqgwgzpx/chart.png
THE BIG IDEA?
The Treasury is still waiting on Brussels to say if some parts of the industry can get direct access to the EU if it deems the relevant British rule broadly equivalent to its own. 
But bankers say given the EU has said it was in ""no rush"" to decide, the government should stop trying to get access to its erstwhile backyard and focus on further reforms that will help the sector compete better with New York, Singapore and the EU.
""What we are really asking the government for is to get on with reform, bring forward all the regulatory reviews as there is no logical reason to wait,"" a senior official at an international bank in London told Reuters.
On the wishlist of many bankers is a more comprehensive, multi-year commitment that includes taxation, the ability for financial firms to recruit easily from overseas, and ways to retain international banks, such as a bespoke capital regime.
""So far we have just seen a bunch of small ideas stuck together in a new wrapper, but do they add up to enough?"" the banker said.
The Bank of England has warned against being forced to prioritise City competitiveness or dilute capital standards, while the financial sector itself has differing priorities.
Domestic focused insurers and lenders are more concerned with better tailoring of rules for them rather than going all out to boost the City's global attraction.
Bankers want to drive through reform sooner rather than later, mindful of having been left out in the cold since Britain's Brexit referendum in 2016.
Britain, however, tends to be suspicious of continental style ""grand plans"", Celic said.
Nevertheless, Jonathan Hill, the former EU commissioner who authored recommendations to attract more listings to London, said there was now a rare moment for improving competitiveness while Britain's regulators, government and industry are aligned.
""The challenge for us all is how do you keep momentum going,"" Hill said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc told Reuters on Tuesday it has made five additions to its environmental, social and governance (ESG) team, as its steps up the implementation of sustainability and diversity initiatives across its businesses.
The hirings come as buyout firms seek to burnish their ESG credentials. While their lucrative leveraged buyouts have won them a loyal investor base, more investors are now asking questions about their impact on jobs and the environment. 
""We view ESG as central to our mission of delivering strong returns for clients,"" said Blackstone president Jonathan Gray in a statement.
Blackstone said Elizabeth Lewis, who previously worked on climate and impact investing at the International Finance Corporation, will help implement ESG policies across Blackstone's businesses. 
James Mandel, who led a carbon-free building program at the non-profit group Rocky Mountain Institute, will lead Blackstone’s emissions reduction program.
Blackstone also appointed Caroline Hill and Nina James as heads of real estate ESG for Europe and Asia, respectively. Hill is joining from Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY), where she was head of responsible business. James was previously at Investa Property Group, one of Australia's largest commercial real estate companies.
Blackstone has also promoted Rita Mangalick to global head of ESG for its hedge fund and credit businesses, where she will work on reporting, policies and engaging with investors.
The New York-based firm is also in the midst of a search for a global head of ESG, people familiar with the matter said.
Blackstone rolled out a program last year to cut carbon emissions by 15% across new investments where the firm controls the energy usage. It plans to expand this to all its portfolio companies. 

The private equity firm last year said it would aim to have diverse directors fill one-third of the seats on its portfolio companies' boards.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, as the first-quarter earnings season kicks into top gear and the latest two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up just 2 points, S&P 500 Futures traded 1 point higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 6 points, or 0.1%.
The S&P 500 closed at another record high on Monday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9% to hit its first fresh record close since Feb. 12, heading for its best month since November.
These indices have been helped by a strong start to the earnings season, as over 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 which have reported numbers have beaten mainstream consensus forecasts, analysts having once again taken company guidance at face value.
The tech sector will be in focus Tuesday, after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported record net income of $438 million for its first quarter after the close Monday. However, the electric carmaker’s stock has dropped over 2% premarket after relying entirely on the sale of bitcoin and regulatory credits to generate its profits.
The big name due to present results Tuesday is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has been flying high on soaring sales of laptops and cloud services. That trend is expected to continue when the software giant reports after the close.
Other companies reporting Tuesday include  General Electric  (NYSE:GE),  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), while GameStop (NYSE:GME) will also be in focus after the video game retailer raised $551 million through an equity offering to speed up the company’s e-commerce transformation.
Aside from earnings, the Federal Reserve holds its latest two-day policy-setting meeting this week, starting later Tuesday. The central bank is not expected to change its ultra-easy monetary policies, but investors will be listening out for any comments regarding inflation. 
The key economic release this week is on Thursday, with the preliminary reading of first quarter U.S. gross domestic product, but April consumer confidence comes out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) and is expected to rise as the economy reopens.
Oil prices gained Tuesday, as OPEC and its allies led by Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, met to discuss production policy.
OPEC+ kept its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year unchanged on Monday, projecting it to rise by 6 million barrels per day in 2021, but did express concerns about new coronavirus spikes in India and Japan, major importers of crude.
Also of interest will be the release of U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $62.38 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $65.50.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>","UBS, Nomura push global banks' Archegos losses over $10 billion","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS reported an unexpected $774 million loss on Tuesday from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos, taking the total hit to global banks from the stricken family office beyond $10 billion. 
The charge taken by Switzerland's biggest bank comes as the fallout from Archegos continues to ripple across the banking industry, with Nomura posting on Tuesday its biggest quarterly loss in over a decade as a result of its dealings with the stricken fund. The Japanese bank said it will book losses of around $2.9 billion this year on Archegos.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lost nearly $1 billion on the family office's implosion while UBS' cross-town rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has been hit the hardest with a more than $5 billion charge after Archegos defaulted on margin calls in late March, triggering a fire sale of stocks.
UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, said it was now reviewing all of its client relationships both within its prime brokerage unit, which caters to hedge funds, and within its family office business, which manages very large pools of money for wealthy individuals and families. It is also reviewing its risk management systems.
""I understand you're disappointed. We are disappointed as well,"" UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers told analysts on a call fielding queries over the loss, the extent of which had surprised investors.
UBS shares fell 3.0% in morning trade.
""(The Archegos loss) highlights the inherent risk in its capital markets activities and presents a setback against its (UBS's) otherwise risk-averse culture,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) analyst Michael Rohr said in a note. ""The bank's strong capital and liquidity remain key credit strengths safeguarding its financial profile and ratings.""
UBS, which had previously declined to comment on any fallout from Archegos, said on Tuesday the revenue hit to its prime brokerage business had reduced net profit by $434 million in the first quarter.
Still, net profit of $1.82 billion for the first three months of 2021 beat the $1.59 billion median forecast from 20 analysts polled by the bank amid a bumper quarter for debt and stock deals.
Hamers, who took over from long-time boss Sergio Ermotti in November, was hired to help boost the bank's digitalisation efforts after a successful stint doing so at ING.
But his start at UBS, widely lauded as an opportunity to prime the bank for a more tech-centred future, has been complicated by a Dutch criminal investigation into his role in money laundering failings at ING.
Hamers announced several strategic initiatives when he spoke to analysts on Tuesday, centered around making UBS a faster and more client-driven ""digital native"" firm focused on sustainable investing.
A simplification of its setup and new digitalisation efforts should help generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings per year by 2023, the bank said. 
UBS has taken a back seat in financial headlines over recent months, after a slew of painful missteps at its nearest rival Credit Suisse prompted losses, sackings and probes at Switzerland's No. 2 bank.
Hamers on Tuesday said the bank did not feel the need to disclose the loss on Archegos earlier due to the strong Q1 results, and had no plans to ditch its prime brokerage business following the debacle.
It had exited all remaining positions in April, leading to a further $87 million trading loss in the second quarter, Hamers said.
Taking a cautious approach towards the second quarter, the bank said it expected client activity levels to come down from the highs seen in the first three months of the year, partially offset by a boost in recurring fees it generates off managing client investments due to higher asset prices.
RECORD CLIENT ACTIVITY
UBS derives the biggest chunk of its profits from advising and managing money for the world's rich, while also maintaining smaller global investment banking and asset management operations.
It conducts retail and corporate banking only in its home market.
That business model paid off in 2020, as its low-risk lending book - comprised primarily of mortgages and loans to the wealthy, as well as a smaller portion of corporate and retail credits in its prosperous Swiss home market - suffered fewer losses than many high street peers.
Now, in the first three months of 2021, the bank once again overshot financial targets on the back of record activity across its client franchises.
U.S. banks posted forecast-beating results for the first quarter, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) boosting profits six-fold and Morgan Stanley raising profits 150% despite disclosing a nearly $1 billion loss on Archegos.

UBS, however, saw investment banking pre-tax profit fall 42% on the back of the charge related to Archegos and more modest revenue growth in the rest of its trading business.
Wealth management saw profits rise 16% as lending growth and high transaction levels helped cushion the impact from falling and persistently low interest rates.

The move by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's live-streaming platform involved hiring a law firm to conduct investigations into users' misconduct, a new twist in the latest prominent example of tech companies acting on ""off-service"" behavior.
How platforms enforce against activities conducted not just on their services but on other sites and offline, is often only described vaguely in their rules. But as lawmakers and researchers examine tech's relationship with real-world violence or harm, this moderation is gaining attention.
While some groups have praised platforms for being proactive in protecting users, others criticize them for infringing on civil liberties. 
""This isn't content moderation, this is conduct moderation,"" said Corynne McSherry, legal director at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, who said she was concerned about platforms that struggle to effectively moderate content on their own sites extending their reach.
In interviews, platform policy chiefs described how they drew different lines around off-service actions that could impact their sites, acknowledging a minefield of challenges.
""Our team is looking across the web at a number of different platforms and channels where we know that our creators have a presence...to understand as best as possible the activities that they're engaging in there,"" said Laurent Crenshaw, policy head at Patreon, a site where fans pay subscriptions for creators' content.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s rules ban users they deem dangerous, including those involved in terrorist activity, organized hate or criminal groups, convicted sex offenders and mass murderers. People who have murdered one person are mostly allowed, a spokeswoman said, due to the crime's volume. Last year, Facebook expanded the list to include ""militarized social movements"" and ""violence-inducing conspiracy networks"" like QAnon.
Twitch's new rules say it may ban users for ""deliberately acting as an accomplice to non-consensual sexual activities"" or actions that would ""directly and explicitly compromise the physical safety of the Twitch community,"" categories which a spokeswoman said were intentionally broad.
Twitch's change in policy https://reut.rs/3ewoCgf largely stemmed from the gaming industry's #MeToo moment in summer 2020 when the site saw harassment at real-life gaming events and on sites like Twitter and Discord, Chief Operating Officer Sara Clemens told Reuters.
Looking beyond their own sites has helped companies remove extremists and others who have ""learned the hairline cracks"" in site rules to stay online, said Dave Sifry, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center for Technology and Society, which has pushed for major platforms to incorporate this behavior into decisions.
Self-publishing site Medium established off-service behavior rules in 2018, after realizing attendees of the August 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville who had not broken rules on specific sites appeared to be ""bad actors on the internet in general,"" it said.
Last summer's protests over the murder of George Floyd prompted  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) to talk publicly about off-platform rules: CEO Evan Spiegel announced Snapchat would not promote accounts of people who incite racial violence, including off the app. In December 2020, TikTok updated its community guidelines to say it would use information available on other sites and offline in its decisions, a change that a spokeswoman said helped it act against militia groups and violent extremists.
Notably, this year, sites like Facebook,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Twitch took into account former U.S. President Donald Trump's off-service actions that led to his supporters storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 when they banned him.
FROM MURDER TO MONEY LAUNDERING 
Tech companies differ in approaches to off-platform behavior and how they apply their rules can be opaque and inconsistent, say researchers and rights groups. 
Twitter, a site where white nationalists like Richard Spencer continue to operate, focuses its off-service rules on violent organizations, global director of public policy strategy and development Nick Pickles said in an interview. 
Other platforms described specific red-flag activities: Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), which took a hardline approach to health misinformation, might remove someone who spreads false claims outside the platform, policy head Sarah Bromma said. Patreon's Crenshaw said while the subscription site wanted to support rehabilitated offenders, it might prohibit or have restrictions around convicted money launderers or embezzlers using its platform to raise money. 
Sites also diverge on whether to ban users solely for off-service activity or if on-site content has to be linked to the offense. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube says it requires users' content to be closely linked to a real-world offense, but it may remove users' ability to make money from their channel based on off-service behavior. It recently did this to beauty influencer James Charles for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to minors. 
Charles' representatives did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement posted on Twitter this month he said he had taken accountability for conversations with individuals who he said he thought were over 18 and said his legal team was taking action against people who spread misinformation. 
Deciding which real-life actions or allegations require online punishments is a thorny area, say online law and privacy experts.
Linking the activity of users across multiple sites is also difficult for reasons including data privacy and the ability to attribute actions to individuals with any measure of certainty, say experts.

But that has not deterred many companies from expanding the practice. Twitch's Clemens said the site was initially focusing on violence and sexual exploitation, but it planned to add other off-site activities to the list: ""It's incremental by design,"" she said.

(Reuters) - DoorDash Inc, the largest U.S. third-party food delivery company, on Tuesday said it lowered some fees for restaurants to use its platform after many have struggled to stay in business during the recession.
The company will allow restaurants to choose three tiers of service - including its lowest ""basic"" plan that costs a commission of 15%. 
DoorDash and rivals, including Grubhub Inc and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, have come under fire for commissions as high as 30% charged to independent restaurants, prompting some cities to cap the fees during the pandemic.
Under DoorDash's new pricing system, eateries can still choose to pay high delivery commissions to DoorDash in exchange for more marketing, a wider delivery radius and better placement in the app, Chief Operating Officer Christopher Payne said in a call with reporters on Monday.
Fees for pickup orders placed through the app were also lowered to 6% from about 15%, among other reductions.
The changes will have no impact on DoorDash's revenues or on how much money its delivery drivers make, Payne said. He did not say how the company might make up for any reduced revenues.

DoorDash waived commissions in the early months of the pandemic and provided other relief totaling $120 mln. Commissions have faced increased scrutiny with deliveries rising as people stayed home, while restaurants struggled to stay afloat.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>",Turkey's banks shy away from Erdogan's 'crazy' canal - sources,"(Corrects estimated price of project in lira)
By Ebru Tuncay and Can Sezer
ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Some of Turkey's biggest banks are reluctant to finance President Tayyip Erdogan's planned Istanbul canal due to environmental concerns and the investment risks hanging over the massive construction project, four senior bankers told Reuters.
Two of the sources said a global sustainability pact that six of Turkey's top banks have signed was a barrier to funding the Kanal Istanbul, which Erdogan dubbed his ""crazy project"" when he floated it a decade ago.
The government expects to break ground in June on the canal, which would connect the Black Sea to the north with the Marmara Sea to the south, running 45 km (28 miles) through marshland, farms and towns on the western edge of the city.
Erdogan says the canal would protect the Bosphorus Strait, which runs through the heart of Istanbul, by diverting traffic.
Yet Istanbul's mayor, engineers and, according to one poll, most citizens, oppose the project on enviromental grounds, saying it would destroy a marine ecosystem and resources that supply almost a third of the city's fresh water. https://reut.rs/3nnWmQN
Russia, meanwhile, has signalled unease about the project on security grounds as the canal would open a second passage to the Black Sea, which is home to a Russian naval fleet. 
""I don't think we can take part in the funding of Kanal Istanbul,"" said a senior banker who requested anonymity. ""It may trigger some environmental issues.""
Six Turkish banks, including Garanti Bank, Is Bank and Yapi Kredi, have signed the U.N.-backed Principles for Responsible Banking framework which calls on signatories to avoid harming people and the planet.
""Definitely we don't want to give a loan to this kind of project because of the environmental issues,"" a second senior banker told Reuters, adding that signatory banks must abide by the U.N.-backed sustainability pact.
In 2019, the canal's price tag was estimated at 75 billion lira - or $13 billion at the time - in a government report.
'PROFITABLE PROJECT'
The reluctance of some Turkish lenders to finance the project makes it more likely state and foreign financing will have to play a bigger role for Erdogan's dream to come true.
A Finance Ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Asked whether Turkish banks would participate in the financing, Erdogan's spokesman and adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, told Reuters the project would ""certainly"" attract investors and creditors when tenders are held soon. 
Garanti Bank declined to comment. Is Bank and Yapi Kredi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Denizbank and state-owned Vakifbank also declined to comment on the canal's financing while Akbank and state lenders Halkbank and Ziraat Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The cost of the canal would eclipse other mega projects such as Istanbul's vast new airport that have defined Erdogan's legacy of credit-driven growth. 
Massive foreign short-term debt worth some $150 billion for banks and companies has dogged the lira and laid bare the risks of Turkey's depleted foreign exchange reserves. 
A currency crisis in 2018 delayed the canal project but it is back on the agenda as the economy rebounds from the pandemic and the government approved development plans last month.
In an interview on Sunday, Erdogan's adviser Kalin said there was already interest in the bidding that would be open to all including Turkish, European, American and Chinese firms.
""It's a profitable project ... and we are positive it will move forward,"" he told Reuters.
'WHITE ELEPHANT'
But for most of Turkey's banks, especially lenders with European backers and those involved in loan syndications, the risks would likely be too high, the sources said. 
They said taking on such a large project could limit their capacity to carry out further loan syndications while there was also a risk the project could be torpedoed at a later stage.
""No Turkish bank, neither state nor private, could take that risk,"" said a former senior banker.
Turkey's environment ministry has carried out environmental assessments which cleared the way for the project to proceed.
But European backers of Turkish banks would probably not see a Turkish environmental stamp of approval as credible, the former banker said.
""This is one of those white elephants. Other than land price speculation, it is hard to see any value in it,"" he said.
The canal would destroy a marine ecosystem and basins that provide nearly a third of Istanbul's fresh water, according to the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects.
Moscow is concerned the canal might not be covered by the Montreux Convention that restricts foreign warships' access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus Strait.
A Turkish official said in 2019 that the new canal would not be covered by the convention, which dates back to 1936.
This month, amid a build-up of Russia's navy near Ukraine, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin told Erdogan on a call that the convention must be observed.
A fourth banker also said that given opposition parties oppose the project, construction could halt if Erdogan's ruling AK Party is ousted. Presidential elections are set for 2023. 

""The size of the project is tremendously big. It has reputational risks and loan risk,"" the person said. ""It also still seems like government's pet project.""

198,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",U.S. companies boost sustainability scores - Refinitiv data,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. companies' sustainability ratings rose in 2020, based on data from Refinitiv, as investors put more pressure on corporate boards to improve their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials and as authorities propose tougher disclosure rules.
Investors are demanding more information from companies on everything from carbon emissions to boardroom diversity amid a growing belief that companies which perform well on ESG issues will have a stronger performance financially over time.
To help rank companies' efforts, a number of data providers, including Refinitiv, assess corporate disclosures and other data sources. Investors can use them as a starting point for their own analysis before deciding whether to invest.
Latest rankings from Refinitiv based on company annual reports for 2020, shows the average ESG score of 137 U.S. companies, with a market cap of at least $5 billion, is 44.2, compared with 42.8 in 2019.
The Refinitiv score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a stronger performance both on ESG-related disclosures and an absence of events that Refinitiv assesses as being negative for the company concerned.
(GRAPHIC: US ESG scores - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoxlgypd/US%20ESG%20scores.png) 
Fionna Ross, senior ESG analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""Since the beginning of this year alone, we have been contacted by several U.S.-based companies asking for our input as they navigate through publishing their first sustainability reports.""
Pressure on companies to disclose more information relating to sustainability is increasing.
International accounting body the IFRS Foundation, for example, is planning to set out plans for rules to govern company disclosures of risks from climate change. Regulators and policymakers in the United States and Europe are looking to overhaul local disclosure rules.
The Refinitiv data showed consumer discretionary, industrials and technology companies in the United States had the highest ESG scores last year while those in the mining sector lagged.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. sector scores - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgeyaxpq/US%20sector%20scores.png)

(GRAPHIC: Top ESG scores in U.S. - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkbywovm/U.S.top%20ESG%20score.png)
U.S. companies' average score lagged their European peers, whose average was 58 at the end of last year, based on Refinitiv data.
""Europe was the pioneer on ESG, so you have more established reporting and adherence to ESG principles,"" said Brendan Erne, director of portfolio management at Personal Capital. ""With demand growing so fast, U.S. companies will eventually have no choice but to better disclose and manage ESG issues if they want to compete for the same pool of capital."" 
""And I think even more companies will jump on the bandwagon when they realise they can actually improve financial results through better management of ESG issues,"" he said.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March said it would seek input on what companies might report on climate factors in a sign of the growing importance of these issues for investors.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. companies seeing declines in ESG scores in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjdyaovr/Big%20decline%20in%20ESG%20scores.png)

199,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>","BP to resume share buybacks as profit soars on strong oil, gas trading","By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -BP's profit more than tripled to $2.6 billion in the first quarter thanks to stronger oil prices and bumper revenue from natural gas trading, paving the way for the energy company to start buying back its shares.
The jump in profits from a year earlier comes as BP (NYSE:BP) says it expects oil demand to recover in 2021 due to strong growth in the United States and China as COVID-19 vaccination programmes accelerate.
In a sign of growing confidence in the economic recovery and its operations following a year of cutting costs, headcount and its dividend, BP said it will buy back $500 million of shares in the second quarter to offset dilution from an employee share distribution programme.
Helping it deliver on its earlier promise to buy back shares, net debt fell below the company's $35 billion target sooner than expected, dropping $5.6 billion from the end of December to $33.3 billion at the end of March, chiefly due to around $4.8 billion worth of disposals and higher oil prices.
""We estimate a further $1.5-2 billion in buybacks is possible this year,"" Bernstein analysts, who have an outperform rating on BP stock, said in a note.
The company said it would provide an update on the third quarter buyback programme later this year. 
On a conference call, Chief Executive Bernard Looney said it was possible that cash distribution, or dividend, levels could return to pre-pandemic levels over the course of next year.
BP's shares had given up earlier gains of around 3% by 0954 GMT, having risen around 17% year-to-date.
However, the company is the weakest performer among the oil majors, with shares still around a third lower than their pre-pandemic level as investors fret over its energy transition strategy. 
As part of Looney's plan to shift focus to low carbon investments, BP aims to sell $25 billion of assets by 2025.
From a target of 50 gigawatts of renewables capacity by 2030, it currently has 1.6 GW of installed capacity, has given the financial go-ahead to a further 3.3 GW and has an additional pipeline of around 14 GW.
But out of its $13 billion investment budget this year, BP has said it plans to spend $9 billion on oil and gas.
First-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net income, rose to $2.6 billion, far exceeding forecasts of $1.64 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts. 
That was also up from a $110 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2020 and topped the pre-pandemic profit of $2.4 billion posted in the first quarter of 2019. 
""This result was driven by an exceptional gas marketing and trading performance, significantly higher oil prices and higher refining margins,"" BP said.
A freak cold snap in Texas in February resulted in very high gas price volatility. 

Cashflow from operations rose to its highest since Q4 2019 at $6.1 billion and underlying profit at its gas unit soared to $1.7 billion from $2 million in the previous quarter.
BP expects global oil inventories, which swelled as the coronavirus pandemic hit fuel demand, to fall to historic levels by the end of 2021.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Bolsonaro's interventionism could be mixed blessing for state insurance IPO,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The first IPO by a Brazilian state-controlled company under President Jair Bolsonaro's government has emerged as a test of whether his penchant for intervening in the running of state-run firms will dampen investor interest in the Brazilian market.
The government has already slashed by a third the valuation of Caixa Seguridade, the insurance unit of state bank Caixa Economica Federal, ahead of its planned roughly $1 billion IPO. It will be the government's third such attempt to list the business, after pandemic-related delays.
The IPO comes roughly two months after Bolsonaro ousted the chief executives of state lender Banco do Brasil and oil company Petrobras in separate tussles over a cost-cutting plan and oil prices. Many foreign investors dumped their shares in the days after Bolsonaro seemed to prioritize politics over shareholder returns.
Since then, a number of companies have been forced to slash their valuations to conclude IPOs. As well as concerns about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the interventions are hurting sentiment. Bankers cite investor fears that the government could push populist measures, and bust Brazil's budget with increased spending.
But part of whether Tuesday's insurance unit IPO is successful may depend on whether investors are willing to wager that recent signs of rapid growth in parent company Caixa under Bolsonaro-friendly chief executive Pedro Guimaraes could mean that presidential links in this case may be a positive.
Guimaraes regularly joins Bolsonaro on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) livestreams to announce branch openings or lower overdraft rates. Caixa, Brazil's biggest mortgage provider, has said it will keep interest rates flat for borrowers even as the central bank hikes its benchmark rate to fight inflation.
""The more Bolsonaro uses Caixa as a monetary policy tool, the better, because if the bank grants more loans, Caixa Seguridade will sell more insurance, mainly mortgages and life,"" said equity analyst Stefan Darakdjian at asset manager Meraki.
The unlisted lender is opening 400 new branches, while the country's other main state-controlled bank, Banco do Brasil, provoked Bolsonaro's ire by planning branch closures.
Guimaraes has denied the moves on branches and mortgage rates were taken under presidential pressure. He has repeatedly called Caixa ""the math bank,"" meaning all measures are taken to preserve profitability.
While the effect of such moves on Caixa's profitability are uncertain, analysts said its expansion binge will likely boost near term revenues at insurance unit Seguridade.
On Monday, Caixa Seguridade was finding demand to potentially conclude the share offering, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
SELLING POINTS
Caixa's planned sale of a 15% stake in Seguridade gives the insurer a valuation of at least 28 billion reais ($5.1 billion) at the bottom of the price range, valued at 13 times estimated 2021 earnings compared with a ratio of 11.8 for BB Seguridade, an already-listed insurer controlled by Banco do Brasil. For the next year, however, if Caixa Seguridade grows as expected, it would become cheaper than its rival.
""The bank has an enormous footprint across Brazil and this is positive for Seguridade,"" said asset manager Luiz Missagia, at ACE Capital. ""If it outgrows BB Seguridade, it becomes cheaper.""
Still, in a sign it is hedging its bets on the IPO, Caixa has also boosted to 50% the allotment of shares set aside for local retail investors, seen as less discriminating than institutions.
""Bolsonaro's interference can be potentially good for Seguridade, but as a whole I see the government interference as a liability for the deal because its consequences are uncertain,"" said Missagia. ""If this is the only upside for the deal, I don't see it as an upside.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Shares dipped from record highs on Tuesday as optimism about the economic recovery was dented by caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy decision and a raft of earning updates.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, fell 0.1% by 0810 GMT, following a muted session in Asia and slight early losses in Europe.
The index is up 9% year-to-date, underpinned by expectations that rising vaccination rates will allow more economies to recover and give a big boost to company profits. 
Earnings in Europe are expected to have risen 61% in the first quarter, while U.S. profits are seen up more than 31%, according to the latest Refinitiv IBES estimates. 
Many investors, however, stayed on the sidelines ahead of the Fed's policy meeting ending on Wednesday, where the U.S. central bank is expected to confirm that it will maintain its easy monetary policy to bolster the economy.
Markets were also awaiting for results from U.S. tech heavyweights Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) later on Tuesday. 
""There are yet to be any real punctures in the global risk balloon at the moment,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid in a note. ""We'll have to wait and see if these upcoming events might throw this off course.""
In extended trade, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dipped about 0.4% even after the electric car maker beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter revenue.
S&P 500 futures rose almost 0.1%, while earlier the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.06%. 
One area of concern was India, which is struggling with a surge of coronavirus infections that has overwhelmed its healthcare system.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange hit $9,965 a tonne, its highest since March 2011, before retreating.
Oil rebounded after top oil producers stood by their demand forecasts, but there are still downside risks due to surging COVID-19 cases in India, the world's third-biggest oil importer. 
Brent crude was 0.5%, at $65.94 a barrel and U.S. oil gained 0.6% at $62.24. 
Bond traders were are also closely watching an auction of $62-billion of seven-year U.S. Treasuries later on Tuesday.
The Treasury saw very weak demand at a seven-year debt auction in February, which sparked a brutal market selloff across the globe. The notes also saw tepid, although improved, demand in March.
Ahead of the auction results, seven-year U.S. yields edged up to 1.265%, while benchmark 10-year yields rose slightly to 1.573%.
The dollar hovered near multi-week lows versus major peers but moves were narrow as traders avoided taking out big positions before the bond auction and the Fed meeting. 
It was last up 0.08% on the day at 90.961.
The yen pulled back from a seven-week high to fall 0.2% against the dollar after the Bank of Japan lowered its consumer price forecasts only a week after Tokyo and Osaka entered their third state of emergency over a spike in coronavirus infections.

""They will likely want to see a sequence of better data on jobs and economic activity that substantially reduces the 'gaps' to pre-crisis levels, reinforced by a sustainable improvement in the health situation.""
Global stocks have hit record highs recently on optimism about a economic recovery as the pace of vaccination picked up across developed economies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers and suppliers will press Congress again on Tuesday to address the global shortage of semiconductor chips that has curtailed auto production around the world.
A U.S. Senate subcommittee will hear testimony from auto industry groups urging action to address production of ""mature node"" chips.
The industry backs proposals to spend tens of billions of dollars to boost U.S. semiconductor production and new tax incentives to help chip companies offset costs of creating new lines within existing facilities.
""There is an undeniable need to expand semiconductor capacity in the U.S. to meet the growing demand within the auto industry, as well as other sectors across the economy,"" John Bozzella, the head of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, will tell the panel in testimony seen by Reuters.
Bozzella wrote in an April 19 letter to U.S. congressional leaders that some of the new funding should be used to build new chip capacity that ""will support the auto industry, as well as other sectors that rely on mature nodes – including defense, medical, and critical infrastructure.""
Ann Wilson, senior vice president at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, will tell the Senate panel auto suppliers are facing ""a significant supply chain crisis"".
Automakers have warned the shortage could result in 1.3 million fewer vehicles built this year in the United States and disrupt some production for at least another six months.
Last week, both Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Stellantis announced additional chip-related production cuts, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) announced production cuts in Mexico on Monday.
President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure investment package includes $50 billion for semiconductor production and research. It also includes another $50 billion to create a new office at the Commerce Department to monitor domestic industrial capacity and fund investments in the production of critical goods.

The shares rose 1.1% in early trade, outperforming a flat Milan blue-chip index, after the company said late on Monday that it would ask shareholders on June 23 to approve moving the group's legal headquarters to the Netherlands to make it easier to raise financing and pursue tie-ups with partners.
Opposition from Vivendi, which had fought the project in court, had forced Mediaset to shelve a similar plan to set up a Dutch holding company to support its European expansion strategy.
In an effort to ease tensions with Vivendi, Mediaset said it would ask shareholders on May 27 to scrap a loyalty share scheme that strengthened the position of its top investor, Italy's Berlusconi family.
The scheme had been challenged in court by Vivendi, whose position has been boosted by a string of judicial rulings after a European Union court decision in its favour. 
Most recently an Italian court on Friday voided the outcome of a shareholder meeting where Vivendi had been prevented from voting with its full 29% Mediaset stake.
Now that Vivendi has regained full voting rights on its stake, Mediaset needs the French group's backing to push through the plan to move its legal base to the Netherlands.
Mediaset finance chief Marco Giordani on Tuesday told analysts that the relocation plan did not include a special voting system. Under the previous project, an enhanced voting system had been criticised by Vivendi because it further strengthened the Berlusconi family's grip on the company.

Vivendi and Mediaset have been at loggerheads since a failed pay-TV deal in 2016. Two people close to the matter on Monday told Reuters the groups were making a fresh attempt to resolve their dispute.

Ahead of that, the focus has been on the European corporate earnings season.

U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $62.45 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.9% to $65.62.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nomura Holdings Inc reported on Tuesday a $2.3 billion hit from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos, causing it to log its biggest quarterly net loss since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank said while it expects to book a further $570 million in charges related to Archegos this financial year and would be beefing up its risk controls, it saw the debacle as an isolated incident.
""We are not planning to make major changes to our U.S. and global business strategy,"" Nomura CEO Kentaro Okuda told a media briefing.
Its January-March net loss came in at 155.4 billion yen ($1.4 billion). That compares with a 34.4 billion yen loss a year earlier when global stock markets were battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Before Archegos failed to meet margin calls on heavily leveraged stock bets last month, Nomura had been on track for record annual profit, bolstered by a buoyant U.S. trading business. That was set to have been a hard-fought victory in its decade-long, stop-start efforts to successfully expand outside Japan.
Instead, it posted net income of 153.1 billion yen, down 29% from the previous year but a second consecutive year of profit. Most analysts had expected a profit of between 160 billion and 225 billion yen, according to Refinitiv data.
Nomura's Archegos loss, which is slightly larger than a previously flagged $2 billion, is the second worst after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). The Swiss bank booked a 4.4 billion franc ($4.8 billion) Archegos hit in January-March and expects further losses of about 600 million francs this quarter.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lost nearly $1 billion, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) exited without losses, Reuters and other media outlets have reported.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>","After WallStreetBets, Australia's securities regulator warns share trading forums","(Inserts missing word in third paragraph with no other changes)
By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's securities regulator has contacted internet share trading forums to question them about policing of ""pump and dump"" scams on their platforms, a sign of growing scrutiny of an investment subculture that soared during pandemic lockdowns.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) told Reuters it has boosted surveillance of local retail trading internet chatrooms that have sprung up since the ""WallStreetBets"" Reddit chatroom was linked to wild U.S. stock fluctuations this year.
That has led to discussions between the regulator and several operators of the profanity, irony and meme-laden chat forums - who often operate anonymously - about their liability if they allow share inflation schemes to flourish.
""If we see concerning conduct that looks as though it was a clear 'pump and dump' that would result in a market manipulation case, there is appetite within ASIC to take those matters forward,"" said Calissa Aldridge, ASIC's senior executive leader of market supervision.
The strategy shows how a trading frenzy around U.S. video game chain  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other so-called ""meme"" stocks in recent months has reshaped enforcement practices by regulators around the world. 
Retail investors currently account for 15% of trades on Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.6 trillion) stock market, compared to 10% before COVID-19 lockdowns sent most workers and students home. The proportion peaked at 20% in January amid reports of massive gains associated with WallStreetBets, ASIC says.
When suspected market manipulators operated in forums anonymously, ASIC was prepared to identify them by cross-checking the claims they posted online with verified trading data and Australian Taxation Office records. 
""We have seen lots of examples ... where there's people who are talking about what they've just done with their trading - some post a snapshot of their trading accounts with trades that have gone through - in some cases we can reverse engineer that (to) look for the identities of the individuals,"" said Aldridge.
'ROCKET EMOJIS'
Moderators of Reddit forum ASX_Bets, one of the country's most popular trading chatrooms with 68,400 anonymous members, said they spoke to an ASIC representative in March.
ASIC requested they delete a joke in the page's Frequently Asked Questions that ""lots of Rocket Emojis were indicators of a winning stock"", but ""other than this, we have not changed any behaviors nor were we requested to,"" ASX_Bets moderators said in an email, without giving their names.
The moderators said the group, which started in March 2020, bans members from ""pumping"" stocks and attaches notifications for company representatives who post ""to make it clear they are not a neutral party"".
John Rye, founder of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group ""Asx Stock Tips"", which has 20,100 members since starting earlier this month, said he had not been approached by ASIC and was unconcerned about any attention from the regulator.
In a Facebook chat, he said he regularly deleted ""unhelpful"" posts and warned about scammers but did not believe members of his group could influence stock prices since they were ""too stupid to do it here"" and ""the amount of money and co-ordination is too much"".

The country's hospitality industry suffered a major blow from the coronavirus crisis, with travel and entertainment spending severely limited by government rules to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Core net income slipped to $3.4 billion, compared to the $3.5 billion average estimate of nine analysts in a poll by Refinitiv. Sales were 1% higher at $12.4 billion, compared to $12.5 billion forecast in the poll. Net income fell 5% to $2.06 billion.
Novartis confirmed its 2021 outlook, which foresees net sales growing at a low- to mid-single-digit percentage rate, with core operating income expected to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate, ahead of sales. 
Novartis, like many other drugmakers including cross-town rival Roche, has taken a sales hit for drugs in dermatology, eye diseases and breast cancer treatment areas as people shy away from doctor visits during the prolonged pandemic. That is impacting key Novartis medicines including Cosentyx for psoriasis, Lucentis for macular degeneration, and Kisqali for breast cancer. 
""There continues to be COVID-19 related lockdowns and disruptions in several geographies,"" Novartis said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to a historically weak cough and cold season for drugs made by its Sandoz generics unit.

(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' long-planned online migration of some lucrative prime-brokerage businesses picked up steam during the pandemic as hedge funds and investors working from home were unable to meet in person, while other Wall Street banks are taking more measured steps.
Last July,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) launched Marquee Connect, offering online virtual introduction services for top clients. Other prime brokers told Reuters they were also moving to bring some prime broker services online, but one cautioned that clients may be getting ""Zoom fatigue"" with hopes to resume meeting in person once more people are vaccinated.
Humans have long handled capital introduction services, in which third parties like banks attempt to matchmake investors with hedge funds. But as large swathes of other bank services have moved to virtual platforms, banks have been increasingly looking at how to move some of these services online too.
Hedge fund managers and investors on Goldman's Marquee Connect, for example, create profiles that allocators can use to search for the funds that fit their targets. 
Over the past nine months, the application has signed up over 900 hedge funds, more than 600 investor firms and made 4,500-plus connections, executives in Goldman's prime brokerage team told Reuters.
""While we’ve been working on developing Marquee Connect in conjunction with our clients for a few years, the timing of our launch... was fortuitous,"" said Isabella Meyer, a member of the capital introduction team and project lead on Marquee Connect, adding that the work-from-home trend accelerated usage.
Other prime brokers told Reuters that while they had not yet launched a similar product, efforts at looking at how to move some services online may be underway.
""Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) continues to leverage technology to facilitate supply and demand between managers and investors which includes considerations to certain functionalities being brought online,” said Leor Shapiro, Managing Director and Global Head of Capital Intelligence at Jefferies.
Mike Monforth, global head of capital advisory at  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM), said: “We are always looking at digital solutions. Capital introduction is an area of focus but we will be patient to ensure whatever solution we deliver will indeed be valued by our global client base.”
Citi,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) declined to comment. 
One of the key parts of capital introduction matchmaking is often conferences in which hedge funds and investors get to meet face to face. The pandemic forced that aspect online, drawing greater participation. 
Shapiro at Jefferies said its flagship conference went from around 200 investor attendees in the previous year to roughly 300 during the pandemic. 
Monforth at JP Morgan said the bank last year put on 47 events with over 5,500 participants compared to 43 events and 1400 participants the previous year.
Hedge funds have raised more money with the shift online, adding $844 billion in capital since March 2020, with $6.1 billion in new investor cash in the first quarter of 2021, according to data from Hedge Fund Research (HFR).
Despite all the benefits touted of using virtual tools, prime brokers admit investors and hedge funds are keen to get back to in-person meetings.
""There is a bit of Zoom fatigue,"" said Monforth at JP Morgan, adding that virtual meetings were here for the long term alongside face-to-face interactions.

Goldman Sachs' Diana Dieckman, global head of the capital introduction team within prime services, said: ""There're all these now tools out there now, but that doesn't replace in-person, so it will be a hybrid approach going forward.""

South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.18%, after data released earlier in the day said that the country’s GDP grew 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2021. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 1% growth, while GDP grew 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020.

China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.38% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.11%.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.'s shares slipped after trading closed in the U.S., however, as the company's multiyear outlook for growth in deliveries remained unchanged even as it reported better-than-expected profits.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hovered near its 50-day moving average, although it was below the peaks recorded in March 2021.
The ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases in emerging economies including India and Brazil also remains a concern. Although some investors could be taking profits on equities, sentiment remains positive overall thanks to rising COVID-19 vaccination rates in many countries.

These factors are unlikely to shift the Fed’s current dovish stance, however, as it hands down its policy decision on the same day. Investors widely expect the central bank to keep rates on hold and asset purchases unchanged.
Other investors also remained bullish ahead of the Fed decision.
“I am a bull,” Kramer Capital Research CIO Hilary Kramer told Bloomberg. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell “is going to make sure he keeps rates low, he’s going to lag behind rather than trying to get ahead of inflation,” she added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Monday met virtually with top executives of drugmakers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC to discuss a proposed waiver of certain intellectual property rights in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Members of the World Trade Organization are due to discuss a proposal by India and South Africa to waive certain provisions of the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on April 30, but the United States and a few other big countries have blocked such a move.
Democratic lawmakers, civil society groups, and 60 former heads of state and 100 Nobel Prize winners have urged President Joe Biden to back the waiver. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said she had no updates on the issue. 
Tai's meetings with the Pfizer and AstraZeneca executives reflect her intense engagement on the issue, and follow similar meetings with advocacy groups, industry executives and others.
Earlier this month, Tai told a WTO meeting the gaping divide between developed and developing countries' access to medicines was ""completely unacceptable"" and industry needed to make sacrifices in times of crisis.
In her discussion with Pfizer Chief Executive Dr. Albert Bourla, Tai emphasized her commitment to working with other members of the WTO on a global response to the crisis, her office said in a statement.
That included ""the role of developing countries in any solution that addresses critical gaps in global production and distribution of vaccines,"" USTR said.
Tai also discussed the issue with Dr. Ruud Dobber, head of U.S. business at AstraZeneca, as well as the White House's decision to share up to 60 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine with countries in need.

USTR said Tai and Dobber discussed ""increasing vaccine production, global health issues and the proposed waiver.""

221,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 09:00PM ET</span>","Tesla edges past Wall Street target as bitcoin sales, environmental credits boost revenue","By Hyunjoo Jin and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc marginally beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter revenue on Monday boosted by a jump in environmental credit sales to other automakers and liquidating some bitcoins. 
Tesla posted record deliveries in the first quarter despite a global chip shortage that has slammed auto sector rivals, but its profit was not driven by auto sales. 
Tesla, which had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin, trimmed its position by 10% during the quarter, said Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn. Tesla said proceeds from sales of digital assets amounted to $272 million with a $101 million ""positive impact"".
""We do believe long term in the value of bitcoin,"" he said. ""It is our intent to hold what we have long term and continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles."" 
Musk tweeted that he has not sold any of his personal bitcoins.
Tesla has posted profits for seven quarters in a row, most quarters driven by environmental credits. 
Tesla earned $518 million from sales of those credits, up 46% from a year earlier. Tesla earns credits for exceeding emissions and fuel economy standards and sells them to other automakers that fall short.
Net profit was dented by a $299 million award to Chief Executive Elon Musk. Tesla's quarterly performance hit targets qualifying the billionaire entrepreneur for two options payouts worth a combined $11 billion. (Graphic on options payout) https://tmsnrt.rs/3sW7Xrv
""Higher regulatory credits, lower taxes, and bitcoin sales buoyed financial results. Back these out, and it was a large miss,"" Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said. 
Shares of the company were down about 2% in extended trading. 
Tesla posted record deliveries in the first quarter despite a global chip shortage that has slammed auto sector rivals. 
Still, the world's most valuable automaker, whose shares jumped more than eight-fold last year, faces challenges of living up to its valuation and managing expectations. 
The company said it was able to navigate through global chip supply shortage issues in part by pivoting quickly to new chips, while simultaneously developing software for chips made by new suppliers.
Musk said it had ""some of the most difficult supply chain challenges,"" citing a chip shortage. ""We're mostly out of that particular problem,"" he said.
Its vehicle average selling price fell by 13% as production of pricier Model S and Model X vehicles ground to a halt ahead of major updates. 
Tesla said its costs decreased, with its average cost per vehicle below $38,000 in the first quarter, compared with $84,000 in 2017. 
Tesla will start deliveries of the new Model S next month and high-volume production in the third quarter. The Model Y production rate in Shanghai continued to improve, spurring demand in China. 
Tesla said it expects this year's volume growth to exceed 50%, while saying that it is on track to start production and deliveries at its planned factories in Texas and Berlin this year.
Revenue rose to $10.39 billion from $5.99 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $10.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Adjusted profit of 93 cents per share topped Wall Street's consensus of 79 cents. 
TESLA CRASH
In the United States, Tesla's full self-driving software is facing new federal investigations following 28 crashes of Tesla vehicles, including a recent one in Texas that killed two.
On a call with investors, Tesla said it inspected the car with investigators and found that the steering wheel was deformed, raising the likelihood that someone was likely in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. 
""Seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled,"" a Tesla official said during a call.

""We're unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time of impact, but the local authorities are working on doing that and we await their report."" 
Neither federal investigators nor police immediately responded to calls seeking to confirm Tesla's account. Police last week told Reuters that they would send the company a subpoena to get the data the car transmitted to the cloud before the fiery crash.

Futures in New York traded near $62 a barrel after slipping 0.4% on Monday. An OPEC+ technical committee raised its forecast for demand growth in 2021, but cautioned that a resurgent virus in India, Japan and Brazil could derail the oil demand recovery. The second Indian wave has been particularly deadly as it overwhelms the health-care system and cripples fuel consumption.
Indian Oil Corp., the country’s biggest refiner, is looking to offload gasoline into the spot market in a rare sale, while other processors are postponing planned maintenance at some plants as workers either flee or fall ill.
The deteriorating outlook in some countries may pose a challenge to OPEC+ when it meets for a monthly ministerial meeting on Wednesday to discuss its production policy, although the group has already agreed to start adding more supply to the market from May. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said Monday that there are “positive signals” in the global economy, but also pointed to factors in the oil market that require ongoing vigilance.
The prompt timespread for Brent was 62 cents in backwardation -- a bullish market structure were near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- on Monday. That compares with 40 cents at the start of April.
The OPEC+ committee of technical experts forecast that oil consumption will rebound by 6 million barrels a day this year from last, according to delegates who attended the panel on Monday. Most of the fuel inventories glut built up during the pandemic will have cleared by the end of this quarter, they said.

The company, which was at the center of a Reddit-fueled trading frenzy earlier this year, said in a statement it had sold 3.5 million shares in the at-the-market offering. 
Based on Reuters calculation, the average price of the shares sold was $157.43. The company's stock has gained more than 850% this year thanks to a push by retail investors to drive up prices of heavily shorted stocks.
GameStop said earlier this month George Sherman will step down as its chief executive officer in the biggest management shakeup at the retailer, giving top shareholder Ryan Cohen more control. 

Cohen, whose RC Ventures owns nearly 13% of GameStop, is leading the company's transformation into an e-commerce firm that can compete with big retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, as well as technology companies like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Corp (T:6758).

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s quarterly report on Monday hit targets qualifying Chief Executive Elon Musk for two options payouts worth a combined $11 billion. 
The electric car maker beat Wall Street's expectations for first-quarter revenue and profit, boosted by record deliveries, robust demand from China and environmental credit sales. 
It reported quarterly revenue of $10.39 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.84 billion, surpassing milestones that trigger the vesting of the fifth and sixth of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk in his 2018 pay package to buy discounted Tesla shares. (Graphic of options payout) https://tmsnrt.rs/3sW7Xrv
Musk, who is also a major shareholder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, receives no salary at Tesla. His pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of rising targets.
Despite production that is a fraction of that of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), Tesla has become by far the world’s most valuable car maker, with a market capitalization of $700 billion, compared with Toyota’s $250 billion. 
Tesla's shares have receded from record highs in 2021 after jumping more than eight-fold last year. 
GRAPHIC-Elon Musk's expanding payout - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplyegovb/Pasted%20image%201619471409240.png
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70 each, a discount of more than 90% from their current price. At Monday's price of $722, the shares from four previous tranches, plus the fifth and sixth tranches, could generate a profit of nearly $34 billion, or almost $6 billion per tranche.

In its quarterly report after the bell, Tesla said it incurred an expense of $299 million related to Musk's pay package, ""driven by an increase in market capitalization and a new operational milestone becoming probable.""

NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) -Roughly 57% of investor votes cast backed healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s executive pay for 2020, a low level of support for a proposal most shareholders usually rubberstamp.
The low support, not including abstentions, for the non-binding proposal comes after the Office of the Illinois State Treasurer urged other shareholders to vote ""No"" on the company's pay practices, namely because J&J sets aside certain litigation costs when calculating executive compensation, including from the U.S. opioid epidemic.
J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
Proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc also recommended against J&J's pay. Johnson & Johnson had said it has always excluded certain one-time costs in its compensation for top brass.
""This vote demonstrates the significant disapproval among Johnson & Johnson shareholders,"" said Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs in a prepared statement. ""This vote sends a strong message to the company that executives should be accountable for all consequences of corporate conduct.""
Other companies facing low say-on-pay support have said they would change their executive compensation structures in the future. 

Drug distributor  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) has said it will engage with shareholders to incorporate their views in its executive compensation plan after a minority of them revolted in November against a executive pay structure similar to J&J's.

While most EV stocks have become overvalued and many are currently experiencing a sell-off as investors rotate to undervalued cyclical stocks, some car manufacturers are maintaining the momentum they generated last year. For instance, the momentum in  Toyota  Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) (DDAIF) is not expected to end anytime soon. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.The automobile industry had saw huge demand for personal vehicles last year as consumers sought to take COVID-19 precautions. Also, growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs), with widespread, governmental policy support, contributed significantly to the industry’s performance. While EVs’ long-term prospects look bright, with most countries globally seeking to address climate change concerns over the next decade, the global automotive industry could struggle to grow this year. Global automobile sales are expected to be less than 70 million this year, and the largest producer and seller China is expected to witness a 1.4% decline in sales.
Along with this bleak outlook, investors’ rotation away from overvalued automotive (primarily EV) stocks to quality cyclical stocks is leading to a sell-off. This is evident in the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund’s (CARZ) 0.2% decline over the past three months.
However, Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG (VWAGY), and Daimler AG (OTC:DDAIF) have been maintaining strong momentum since last year.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Monday found that Huawei did not violate a court order by sharing certain information with its chief financial officer, who is using it to help fight her extradition from Canada. 
But U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn, warned Huawei lawyers: ""be careful with your filings.""
Lawyers for Huawei Technologies were summoned to the court in New York after U.S. prosecutors accused Huawei of improperly sharing materials the government disclosed in the criminal case against the company with chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who also is charged but considered a fugitive.
Huawei and Meng were indicted for bank fraud and other crimes, in a case that has strained ties between the United States, China and Canada. Meng was arrested in Canada on a U.S. warrant in December 2018.
Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case and Meng has said she is innocent.
The latest dispute stems from two letters. Huawei filed a 10-page letter with the Brooklyn court in February that said recent disclosures by the government undermine the fraud charges in the case.
It also sent a letter to U.S. Department of Justice officials in April that said the prosecution had produced information that directly contradicted the government's representations in the extradition case, according to filings.
Prosecutors said the letters, despite redactions, violate the court's order about sharing sensitive materials with Meng that the government turned over. 
The defense is filing the letters, prosecutor Alexander Solomon told the judge, and telling Meng to ""use the documents as you see fit to obstruct the extradition proceeding."" 
But Huawei's attorneys said neither letter breached the court's order about sensitive information, and the judge agreed.

""I don't see that there's been a violation of the protective order,"" Donnelly said. 
Still, the judge added that she did not want to see 10-page letters filed on a Sunday night that did not seek court action.

Investors on Reddit’s chat room focus mainly on speculative penny stocks that possess high short interest because of their poor financials and bleak growth potential. While WSB’s huge bets against short sellers and consequent short squeezes can help these stocks skyrocket in price, they are tremendously risky investment bets. So, we think Reddit stocks Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN), Castor Maritime (CTRM), and Naked Brand Group (NAKD), which have bleak growth outlooks, are best avoided now. Let’s discuss these names in more detail.The GameStop (GME) frenzy took Wall Street by storm earlier this year in one of the biggest, unprecedented short squeezes in history. The young or novice investors on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets (WSB) chatroom reported substantial gains from this stock because its price soared 3,116.6% over the past year. However, the company lacked fundamental strength--its revenues and earnings were declining over the prior three years, along with a bleak outlook. Investors were primarily targeting highly speculative companies, such as GME, to corner hedge funds to increase their short-term returns.
The investment environment has changed significantly over the past couple of months, however. Investors are now betting on value stocks with solid fundamentals and significant growth potential because the economy is recovering at a faster-than-expected pace. Owing to this change in sentiment, the Reddit community has failed to trigger another GameStop-like short squeeze. Investors are now betting on the U.S.’ economic recovery and a rebound in global markets rather than speculating for short-term gains.
While several Reddit communities, such as WSB and ‘pennystocks’, are trying to precipitate another short squeeze, the majority of stocks targeted by these groups are highly speculative, with bleak growth projections and poor financials. Thus, we believe Reddit stocks  Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL), Ocugen, Inc. (OCGN), Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM), and Naked Brand Group Limited (NAKD) are best avoided now.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Monday, fueled by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other heavyweight growth stocks ahead of a deluge of earnings reports this week.
The Nasdaq's record high close confirmed the end of an 11% correction in the index that began after its previous record high close on Feb. 12, with the index closing at a low on March 8.
In extended trade, Tesla dipped about 0.4% after the electric car maker beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter revenue. During Monday's trading session, Tesla had gained 1.2%.
Companies that constitute about 40% of the S&P 500's market capitalization report from Tuesday through Thursday, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). Shares of those companies also rose. 
Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors climbed, with the energy index leading with a 0.6% gain, while utilities and consumer staples declined. 
Of 124 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 85.5% have topped analysts' earnings estimates, with Refinitiv IBES data now predicting a 34.3% jump in profit growth.
“We’re way above the average for firms reporting earnings above estimates. More important than the fact that they are beating on estimates is that they are raising their expectations and outlooks going forward, and that’s giving the markets a nice boost,” said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ.
Investors will monitor a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning Tuesday, with the U.S. central bank expected to shine some light on whether the employment landscape has affected its plan to leave interest rates near zero for an extended time and to continue buying $120 billion in bonds each month.

Market participants are also watching out for any fresh developments on U.S. President Joe Biden's tax plan after reports last week said he would seek to nearly double the capital gains tax to 39.6% for wealthy individuals.
Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms, including Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Patent Group, surged more than 5% as bitcoin snapped five straight days of losses. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 105 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 154 new highs and 21 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will start to share up to 60 million doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's coronavirus vaccine with other countries as soon as the next few weeks, the White House said on Monday. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the United States would release the doses to other countries as they become available.
She said there could be 10 million doses cleared for export ""in coming weeks."" About 50 million more doses are currently being produced and could ship in May and June. 
""Right now we have zero doses available of AstraZeneca,"" Psaki said, noting that U.S. regulators still need to review the quality of those already produced. 
Psaki said the Biden administration is still deciding what the process will be to determine where and how it will share the vaccine.
""We will consider a range of options from our partner countries and, of course, much of that will be through direct relationships,"" she said.
The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been authorized for U.S. use by the Food and Drug Administration.
The Biden administration in March said it would send roughly 4 million doses of the British drugmaker's vaccine to Canada and Mexico, and is under growing pressure now to expand sharing of its stockpile with India and other countries.
India has become the latest epicenter of the pandemic, threatening to overwhelm its healthcare system.
An AstraZeneca spokeswoman could not comment on specifics of the arrangement, but said the doses were part of its supply commitments to the U.S. government. ""Decisions to send U.S. supply to other countries are made by the U.S. government,"" she said.
The Associated Press earlier on Monday reported the doses would be shared in coming months following their clearance by the FDA.
The AP reported that the doses were made at the Emergent BioSolutions facility in Baltimore, which came under harsh criticism for a long list of cleanliness and manufacturing problems found during an FDA inspection.
AstraZeneca is no longer making vaccine at that plant after a batch of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine was ruined by contamination with ingredients from the AstraZeneca shot.

J&J is now overseeing production of its vaccine at the Emergent plant.

Investing.com -- TheS&P 500 notched another record high on Monday as investors braced for a wave of big tech earnings and the latest musings by the Federal Open Market Committee on the state of the economy.
After Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) disappointed the market with lower than expected new subscriber adds over the past quarter, investors looked warily at the FANG gang, hoping the rest of them would hold up positive trends.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) gets tech earnings off in earnest on Tuesday, followed by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Google’s Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), not to mention non-tech companies. About one-third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report this week.
It’s also a week for data and economic commentary. The Federal Reserve’s policy committee has its two-day meeting starting Tuesday and will opine on the state of things on Wednesday. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Microsoft earnings
Microsoft has been flying high on soaring sales of laptops and cloud services, and that trend is expected to continue. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees 45% growth from cloud offering Azure, which he says is siphoning share from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services. 
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings of $1.78 a share on revenue of $41 billion.
2. Tesla earnings
The electric car maker’s shares soared 740% last year but are barely up 3% this year, trailing the major indexes. And it’s not because of its quirky founder, Elon Musk (who happens to be hosting Saturday Night Live one weekend next month). 
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has dealt with a number of challenges recently, including a crash in Texas and a public relations battle in China. Other carmakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) are also getting into the EV game. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect profit of 74 cents a share on revenue of $10.4 billion.
3. How are you feeling?
Jobs are coming back, and spending is up. The economy is reopening and people are emboldened to spend their government stimulus money. Question is how long is that going to last? 
Consumer confidence for April comes out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The reading is expected to be 113, up from 109.8 the previous month.

Both Fisker (FSR) and Nikola (NKLA) are currently trading at more than 50% below their all-time highs. However, these two stocks are nonetheless still trading at valuations that we think are not justified by their growth prospects. Read on.The last year has seen significant investor interest in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, as governments worldwide announced initiatives to address climate change concerns. The future of the global EV market looks promising, with big opportunities for growth in the battery, hybrid, and plug-in-hybrid EV markets. According to Globe Newswire, the global EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 29% from 2021 - 2026.
However, investors’ ongoing rotation away from the EV stocks to cyclical industries to capitalize on the impending economic recovery is driving a sell-off of overvalued EV stocks. In addition to valuation concerns, rising global competition in the EV space and a semiconductor chip shortage are raising investor concerns regarding the industry’s near-term prospects.
Fisker Inc. (FSR) and Nikola Corporation (NKLA) have already lost significant value since hitting their all-time highs and will likely suffer further declines because they still look overvalued at their current price levels considering their bleak near-term growth prospects. So, we think it could be wise to avoid these stocks now.

We believe that this, coupled with rising prices of semiconductor chips due to a global shortage and increasing demand from EV manufacturers, should result in solid gains for Intel (INTC), ASE Technology (ASX),  Amkor Technology  (NASDAQ:AMKR), and ChipMOS Technologies (IMOS). These names are currently trading at relatively undervalued levels. Read on.The remote working and shopping trend is expected to continue even in the post-pandemic environment due to the convenience and efficiency the activity affords. The demand for semiconductors is here to stay because these chips are the backbone of most of the advanced technology devices. While supply constraints are impacting the industry, strong demand is allowing companies to raise prices for their chips and generate substantial profit. Investors’ increasing interest in the industry is evidenced by SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 100.6% returns over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 49.3% gains over this period.
Continued advancements in computing, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and driverless cars are expected to keep driving the demand in the semiconductor space. According to WBOC, the worldwide market for semiconductor equipment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% over the next five years.
Against this backdrop, we think it is wise to bet on established semiconductor players Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:ASX), Amkor Technology, Inc.

“Given the increasing role of automation, the widening skills gap, and the shift to online learning, we believe Coursera's comprehensive platform will help it gain share in a large TAM that we size between $47B-$50.6B,"" said Needham's Ryan MacDonald, according to StreetInsider. ""While the COVID-driven tailwind to registered learner growth in FY20 creates a difficult consumer segment comp in FY21, we believe Coursera's efficient GTM motion and shift towards higher value enterprise and degrees offerings can drive durable 25%+ growth and gross margin expansion.""

Investing.com – Private equity firm Thoma Bravo agreed to buy Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) in an all-cash transaction that values the software security group at $12.3 billion. Proofpoint rose more than 31%.
Thoma Bravo agreed to pay $176 share for Proofpoint, a 34% premium on the company's Friday close.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called it a “fair but attractive valuation” in his note.
“This was a smart move for Proofpoint to take this very attractive offer and premium as the investment community continued to undervalue this core asset in the market and thus PFPT finally hit the bid,” Ives wrote, adding that he expects a “massive M&A spree in the software and cyber security space” over 12 to 18 months.
A post-pandemic world has created new opportunities for firms proving cyber security solutions.
According to a filing by cyber security solutions provider Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), the pandemic has thrown up new cyber security threats – first as organizations shifted to work-from-home and then as vaccinations rolled out – both situations exploited by hackers to steal data.
Check Point said researchers had found fake vaccination certificates and negative COVID-19 tests being offered on the Darknet, in addition to a sharp increase in the number of advertisements selling alleged coronavirus vaccines.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",GE's recovery seen poised to gather pace,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's turnaround plans looked dead in the water to many last spring when its lucrative jet engine business became another victim of the coronavirus pandemic as global air travel dried up.
Shares of the Boston-based industrial conglomerate lost half of their value in the early days of the pandemic. Declining sales put GE, which was already grappling with crushing debt levels and operating challenges, into survival mode - a quick change in focus from investing in profitable growth opportunities.
Since last May, GE's shares have gained over 145%, outperforming the broader market, as more investors bet its turnaround is gaining traction. They also expect that its businesses in natural gas, wind turbines and renewables will get a big boost as nations and corporations make the transition to a low-carbon economy.
""The long-term earnings potential for this company are dramatically higher,"" said Dan Babkes, a partner at Pzena Investment Management that has a substantial holding in GE.
Analysts at William Blair expect GE's valuation to double over the next three to four years.
On Tuesday, GE's first quarter earnings report should offer evidence to back such bullish bets. Even though the company has forecast a cash outflow, it expects ""significant"" improvement from a year ago when it burnt $2.2 billion in cash.
The improvement would come at a time when its jet-engine business, usually GE's cash cow, is still reeling from the plunge in global air travel.
Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expect GE to report a cash outflow of $1.3 billion.
Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE's operations and ability to pay down debt.
Since taking the reins in 2018, Chief Executive Larry Culp has sold assets to repair the balance sheet, including a $30 billion deal to merge the company's jet-leasing unit with Ireland's AerCap. GE now expects to reduce overall debt by $95 billion by 2023.
Culp says a ""significantly"" derisked balance sheet would allow GE to fund accelerated organic growth.
He has also focused on lean-manufacturing practices aimed at eliminating waste and building profit margins.
Babkes says the cost focus and restructuring has prepared GE's aviation business for a ""dramatic"" bounce-back in earnings as air travel recovers.
Similarly, upcoming earnings reports should reflect the restructuring at GE's power and renewables units. 
""Your financial statements today reflect the execution of historical deals,"" Babkes said. ""Your financial statements tomorrow are going to reflect the cost base that you've achieved with restructuring.""
GE also stands to gain from the green energy transition. The company will supply wind turbines for one of the largest onshore wind farm projects in the United States. Demand has been growing for its new offshore Haliade-X turbines.
GE aims to sell $3 billion in offshore turbines by 2024 from less than $500 million last year, forecasting that the offshore wind energy market will grow at a compound rate exceeding 20% for the next 10 years.
William Blair's analysts estimate more than half of GE's sales by the middle of this decade should come from converting gas turbine power generation to operate on hydrogen and renewables, and grid upgrades.

""In our view, GE's prospects for sustainable outperformance have never been more apparent in recent times,"" they said in a note.

Investing.com --  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) dropped 2% after Wedbush said there are ""better opportunities elsewhere.""
The firm cut shares to neutral from buy as it said to buy Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) or Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) over the electronics retailer.
“We believe that the category will continue to trail home improvement and home furnishings category growth in 2021,” analyst Seth Basham wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. “We see better opportunities in other hardlines names, particularly in the home improvement category (LOW, FND) and home goods/ mattress category (WSM, RH (NYSE:RH), W, OSTK, TPX, CSPR, PRPL).”
Best Buy reported its strongest earnings on tape for the quarter ended in January, taking in more than $16 billion. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion for the period amid a pandemic that kept us homebound.
But the company forecast that comparable sales might fall for the 2022 fiscal year after vaccinations rise and government stimulus gets spent.
The analyst pointed to 29% growth in consumer electronics sales for March, a strong showing, but less so when compared to home furnishings, up 50%, and home improvement, up 32%. 
Discretionary spending is also likely to shift to travel and entertainment as the U.S. reopens, Basham said.

(Reuters) - After a year of declining sales,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) on Tuesday is expected to report record second-quarter revenue of over $6.8 billion, as speedy vaccinations in the United States and China make customers more comfortable with returning to their morning coffee runs. 
The world's largest coffee chain was plagued in 2020 by falling store traffic, as rising infections and the closure of most offices prompted many to start making coffee at home.
""Not everyone's gone back to work, but a lot of people have. So in the mornings you go by the Starbucks and you're back to seeing drive-thrus having long lines,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said on the company's U.S. business.
The bulk of the benefit of the U.S. economy reopening will be seen in the coming quarters and investors will be paying especially close attention to Starbucks' forecast, he added.

THE CONTEXT
Twelve months ago, Starbucks was reeling from the fallout of the early stages of the pandemic, with its stores around the globe either closed or operating under heavily limited capacity.
Fast forward a year, and analysts say the framework the company has built with its online ordering service, loyalty program and drive-thru lanes place it in a strong position to take advantage of a recovering economy.
""They're doing a lot of right things. The digital mix is now over half the business, mobile pay is a quarter of transactions and the newer menu items have seen a lot of traction,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said.
""So they have a lot of visibility into customer habits, more so than any other name in the industry.""
Revenue from the company's smaller international segment is expected to rise about 58%, largely on the near full recovery of business in China and a slowdown in the expansion of accounting scandal-ridden rival  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY). 
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* Starbucks is expected to report second-quarter net revenue of $6.82 billion, a 13.7% increase from a year ago and an 8.1% rise from 2019, according to analysts' mean estimate, based on Refinitiv data.
* Americas revenue expected to rise 7.1% from last year to $4.64 billion
* Earnings per share expected at 53 cents, up from 32 cents.

WALL STREET SENTIMENT
* Starbucks has an average ""buy"" rating on Wall Street and a median price target of $119, according to Refinitiv data.

* The company's shares last traded at $115.71, having gained over 53% in the last year.

However, analysts believe that an increasing threat of inflation will continue to support the bullion market. Also, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in several parts of the world could increase the demand for the metal as a safe-haven asset. Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect gold mining companies  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC),  B2Gold  (NYSE:BTG), and  Yamana Gold  (NYSE:AUY) to rally more than 30% from their current price levels. Let’s discuss.Strong U.S. economic data and a consequent rise in bond yields have been driving selling pressure on gold. A sharp increase in new home sales in the United States, record high output at manufacturing and services sectors, a decline in unemployment, and strong consumer spending signal a rapid economic recovery. As a result, the non-interest-bearing yellow metal is losing its appeal as a safe-haven asset. A strengthening U.S. dollar is another major factor that is reducing the metal’s attractiveness.
However, experts say renewed import demand from India and China could offer some support to gold in the near future. Furthermore, gold prices are likely to strengthen going forward due to global inflationary pressure. Analysts believe that gold prices have yet to factor in an increase in inflation.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts expect gold mining stocks, Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC), and B2Gold Corp (BTG), and Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) to advance more than 30% over the next 12 months.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Apple iPhone privacy update seen hurting Facebook revenue in second-quarter,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - When  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) reports first quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors will be preoccupied with how a new pop-up privacy notification on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones will affect the second quarter.
A full-screen notification will begin to appear on iPhone apps on Monday that will ask users if they consent to being tracked ""across apps and websites owned by other companies” for advertising purposes.
Facebook faces up to a 7% decline in second quarter revenue if 80% of its users block the company from tracking them on iPhones, said mobile ad analyst Eric Seufert. That amounts to nearly $2 billion based on Facebook's fourth quarter earnings. 
Facebook last year hit back against Apple's plans, taking out full-page ads in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, accusing Apple of hurting small businesses that rely on personalized ads and harming the free internet. It has warned investors that a significant number of iPhone users could reject being tracked, and hurt Facebook's digital ad business.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has accused Apple of behaving anti-competitively, handicapping other developers to benefit its own app ecosystem.
""Apple may say that they're doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests,"" he said in January during an earnings call with analysts. 
In March, Zuckerberg said the social network could actually benefit from the iOS changes, because merchants who will have difficulty targeting their ads to potential customers may choose the easier route of selling their products on Facebook, which has 2.8 billion monthly active users. 
Facebook launched “Shops” in May, when many businesses shut their doors during the pandemic. 
The feature lets users browse and purchase items like clothes and jewelry from select merchants within Facebook and Instagram.
Investors will scrutinize this ""social commerce"" strategy, which has the potential to earn “mid-single-digit billion-dollar” new revenue for Facebook, said Mark Mahaney, head of internet research at Evercore ISI. 
""The ad inventory becomes more transactional, which makes it more valuable,"" he said. The possibilities of social commerce are a ""big shining star"" for both Facebook and its advertisers, said Ygal Arounian, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. 
""If you've got a user making a transaction on the platform, you can track the progress from seeing the ad to checkout,"" he said. ""It's incredibly valuable data, as valuable as you can get."" 
Facebook is set to report another quarter of ad revenue growth on Wednesday, as businesses gradually reopen after pandemic restrictions are lifted, and the formation of small businesses, which make up the bulk of Facebook advertisers, is at an all-time high, analysts told Reuters. 
Wall Street is projecting $23.7 billion in revenue for the first quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, up 34% from the prior-year quarter.
In response to Facebook's accusations of anti-competitive behavior, Apple has said that ""we believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users"" and that people should have a choice of whether to allow their data to be collected and shared.

In April, it published a white paper outlining how a web of advertising companies track people's online and offline behavior ""often without their knowledge or permission.""

269,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Higher Ahead of Fed, Tech Earnings Deluge; Dow up","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week higher, ahead of what's likely to be a busy few days dominated by the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting and the first-quarter earnings of the U.S.'s biggest tech companies. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 100 points, or 0.3%, at 34,144 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were up in parallel.
Notable among early gainers were airline stocks, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the New York Times that the EU is likely to allow fully-vaccinated U.S. travelers into the bloc, although she didn't give a precise timeline.  American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 2.6%, while Delta stock rose 2.0% and United Airlines stock was up 1.0%, 
Among the underperformers,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 2.0% after U.S. regulators said they would lift the temporary advisories warning against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-shot Covid-19 vaccine at the weekend.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another underperformer after it announced plans to invest $430 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, a move that underlined the high cost of re-jigging its supply chain away from China so that it is less exposed to geopolitical and logistical risks. Apple stock fell 0.5%.
 Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 3.6% after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) gave an indirect boost to the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency sector, Coindesk reporting that the Wall Street blueblood is planning to offer private banking clients an actively-managed Bitcoin fund. That’s a major turnaround in thinking from the days when chief executive Jamie Dimon was labelling Bitcoin a ‘dangerous fraud’.
Earlier, the market had barely reacted to news that core durable goods orders picked up in March, rising 1.6% after a 0.3% gain in February. Excluding 'lumpy' aerospace and defense orders, the gain was a slightly less impressive 0.9%.

Investing.com – Shares of American airline companies were up premarket Monday as number of bookings suggest more people are willing to travel amid vaccination rollouts and onset of summers.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was up 2% while Delta (NYSE:DAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all up just over 1%.
Airline system sales fell 64.1% for the week ending April 18, compared with the level seen for the same week in 2019 when the world hadn’t heard of Covid-19, according to research from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).  That marks a sequential improvement from the -66.3% and -69.8% levels of the prior two weeks.
The bank added domestic leisure is maintaining its strong run with tickets sold for this segment through online agencies down only 0.4% against the 2019 level.
In expectation of traffic improving further, with customers stuffed full of cash given the hefty levels of fiscal stimulus, airlines like American, Jet, United have also been adding capacities on both domestic and international routes with plans for more.
Adding to the growing air of confidence surrounding the battered travel sector, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, told The New York Times Sunday that the European Union would likely allow fully vaccinated U.S. tourists to visit the region this summer, potentially helping the European tourist economy recover during its crucial summer season.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 09:30AM ET</span>",Explainer: What do Apple's new iPhone privacy changes mean for consumers and businesses?,"By Stephen Nellis and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday will begin rolling out an update of its iOS operating system with new privacy controls designed to limit digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users.
For Apple's more than 1 billion iPhone users, the change will mean a new pop-up notification in some apps seeking their permission to collect data that Apple believes could be used to track their browsing habits across third-party apps and websites. 
For businesses, the rules could bring seismic changes to the nearly $100 billion mobile advertising market if most iPhone users decline to allow data collection, though the exact impact remains a question, according to industry experts.
WHAT IS APPLE DOING?
Apple is requiring app developers who want to collect a digital advertising identifier from iPhone users to show a pop-up saying that the app “would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies,"" along with an explanation from the app developer about why permission is being sought. Some mobile advertising analysts believe that fewer than one in three users are likely to grant permission.
IPhone owners also have a ""tracking"" menu in their phone's privacy settings where they can opt-out of tracking from all apps on their phone with a single switch, or pick and choose among apps to grant permission to.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR DEVELOPERS AND ADVERTISERS? 
Both advertisers and app developers who sell ad inventory say if many iPhone users opt-out of tracking, it will make advertising less effective. The ad industry has long gathered data about people's web browsing behavior in order to serve up ads, such as for clothes or cars, that users might be interested in.
A shrinking pool of user data could lead to lower sales for brands and lower ad revenue for mobile apps and publishers. Apple's move has deepened a rift with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which has said the change will hurt small businesses because it will impede their ability to cost-effectively find local customers to target with advertisements. 
WHY DID APPLE MAKE THE CHANGE?
Apple has said it wanted to give its customers more control over whether data collected on them by apps is shared with third parties.
CAN APPS STILL COLLECT DATA ON IPHONE USERS?
Yes, data collection is still allowed if it is spelled out in an app's privacy policy. The changes only affect whether app developers share data they collect with third parties, or mix their data with outside data from third parties, to help target ads. Apple has introduced privacy ""nutrition labels"" to its App Store to show users what data apps collect.
WILL IPHONE APPS STILL HAVE ADS?

Yes, iPhone users can still see ads even if they decline the new pop-up, as long as those ads are targeted using data the app developer has collected on its own. For example, a social network like Facebook Inc can still target ads based on first-party data such as which groups users join or which posts they like. But if Facebook wants to target ads based on data from which third-party websites users have used their Facebook credentials to log into, it will need to seek permission.

The company, which has development programs for conditions including hepatitis B, prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, has raised $216 million to date from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Sequoia Capital China and Oxford Sciences Innovation among others.
The UK-based company, spun out of Jenner Institute at the Oxford University in 2016, said it plans to list its American Depositary Shares (ADS) on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""VACC"".
It said it was offering 6.5 million ADSs, each representing one ordinary share, priced between $16 and $18 each. At the top end of the range, the IPO would rake in $117 million for Vaccitech.
The company intends to use proceeds from the offering to fund its ongoing clinical programs and its early-stage research and development. 

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Jefferies (NYSE:JEF),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), William Blair and H.C. Wainwright & Co are the underwriters for the offering.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>","As U.S. capital gains tax hike looms, wealthy look for ways to soften the blow","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wealth advisers are counseling clients to max out their retirement accounts, park gains in tax-deferred opportunity zone funds and even sell some assets to avoid being clobbered by a potential U.S. capital gains tax hike.
The White House will this week propose nearly doubling taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, Reuters and other media outlets reported, in what would be the highest tax rate on investment gains since the 1920s.
Any changes will be hard-fought in Congress, where Democrats hold a slim majority, and the final tax rate will likely be lower than the White House's opening salvo. But if a deal can be reached, the new tax rate could come into effect this year.
Wealthy Americans have deluged their advisers and accountants with calls for advice on how to avoid being caught by the potential increase. 
""I don't think anyone is ever comfortable paying more taxes, and we are telling clients it's not an if, it's a matter of when and how much,"" said Alvina Lo, a chief wealth strategist at Wilmington Trust. 
She said her clients are identifying assets and stocks to sell to try to lock in the current tax rate and are maximizing their contributions to tax-deferred individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Some are converting IRAs to Roth IRAs, which do not charge taxes on withdrawals like regular IRAs.
If the tax changes apply retroactively to the start of 2021, it may already be too late to lock in the current lower tax rate on some gains.
""Our clients are resigned to the fact that it's happening and they just want to do what they can to smartly plan about it,"" said Lo.
Currently, people earning more than $200,000 pay a capital gains rate of about 23.8% including the 3.8% net investment tax which helps fund the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. 
Under the new plan, wealthy Americans could face an overall federal capital gains tax rate of 43.4% including the Obamacare tax. For some Americans living in New York and California, their total capital gains tax rate could exceed 50% when state taxes are included, according to the Tax Foundation.
Christopher Karachale, a San Francisco-based tax lawyer with Hanson Bridgett, said many of his clients - founders of startup companies - are anxious about the possibility of paying more than 50% when California's taxes are factored in. 
Some are speeding up deals to sell their businesses or sell their stock, he said. 
""There is going to be real resistance to paying more than a 50% rate. For these people it's on tens of millions of dollars. They're going to look to another area of the code to provide for an exclusion or deferral of the capital gains,"" he said.
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, a major investment adviser, said some of his clients are plowing money into opportunity zone funds created by former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax law to promote investment in low-income communities. 
Investors can defer and possibly reduce the tax they pay on capital gains if they reinvest the gains in opportunity zone funds, which typically invest in real estate. 
""It's an extremely popular investment vehicle largely because many of our clients are CEOs, business owners,"" said Ablin. ""They're contemplating selling their business and looking at a multi-million-dollar capital gain,"" he said. 
Andrew King, vice president, tax policy and research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Ayco Personal Financial Management, said their clients are also exploring opportunity zone funds, but cautioned it was still too early to be able to give the best advice. 
Opportunity zones could also be overhauled under Biden's tax plan, according to media reports. 

""We really don't know the specifics of what this will look like when it will take effect or who it will affect,"" said King.

Investing.com – Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) shares were up a little over 1% in Monday’s premarket as the company’s first quarter performance indicated the company is well positioned to gain from the opportunities in the aftermath of the pandemic.
Check Point’s shares, at Friday’s close, were 16% off their 52-week high of $139.25.
The cyber security solutions provider saw growth in all its business segments including Cloud, network and remote access security with subscriptions revenue growth of 10%.
A company filing pointed out to increased cyber security threats thrown up by the pandemic – first as organizations shifted to work-from-home and then as vaccinations rolled out – both situations exploited by hackers to steal data.
Researchers found fake vaccination certificates and negative COVID-19 tests being offered on the Darknet, in addition to a sharp increase in the number of advertisements selling alleged coronavirus vaccines, the filing said.
For the company’s first quarter ended March, total revenue rose 4% year-on-year to $508 million. Non-GAAP EPS rose 9% to $1.54. Both revenues and non-GAAP EPS grew towards the high end of the company’s guidance.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday said it will establish a new campus in North Carolina that will house up to 3,000 employees, expand its operations in several other U.S. states and increase its spending targets with U.S. suppliers.
Apple said it plans to spend $1 billion as it builds a new campus and engineering hub in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, with most of the jobs expected to focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering and other technology fields. It joins a $1 billion Austin, Texas campus announced in 2019.

“As a North-Carolina native, I’m thrilled Apple is expanding and creating new long-term job opportunities in the community I grew up in,"" Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB), Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. 
""We’re proud that this new investment will also be supporting education and critical infrastructure projects across the state.""
Apple also said it expanded hiring targets at other U.S. locations to hit a goal 20,000 additional jobs by 2026, setting new goals for facilities in Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington state. 
In Apple's home state of California, the company said it will aim to hire 5,000 people in San Diego and 3,000 people in Culver City in the Los Angeles area. 
Apple also increased a U.S. spending target to $430 billion by 2026, up from a five-year goal of $350 billion Apple set in 2018, and said it was on track to exceed.

The target includes Apple's U.S. data centers, capital expenditures and spending to create original television content in 20 states. It also includes spending with Apple's U.S.-headquartered suppliers, though Apple has not said whether it applies only to goods made in those suppliers' U.S. facilities.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>",BP applies to set up U.S. retail power business: filing,"By Ron Bousso and Chris Prentice
LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) has applied to supply U.S. residential customers with electricity generated from wind, solar and natural gas, betting on a rapid growth in power demand as economies shift away from fossil fuels to battle climate change. 
BP wants to supply electricity in California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas in its first foray into the retail power business, according to an April 20 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seen by Reuters.
The British company has no retail energy trading business but is one of the largest North American power traders, supplying wholesale customers such as power generators and cities with gas, renewable energy and storage.
A new subsidiary called BP Retail Energy will supply the power, going head-to-head with utilities that are under growing pressure from investors and governments to cut carbon emissions.
""BP Energy Retail is a retail energy marketing company that intends to sell electricity products directly to commercial and industrial customers and residential customers,"" the filing said.
BP declined to comment.
The filing listed the sources of electricity generation BP Retail Energy is affliated with. They were BP's U.S. onshore wind farms, solar power plants and its natural gas plant in Whiting, Indiana. 
BP has set out plans to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold while reducing its oil output by 40% by 2030 to slash its greenhouse gas emissions.
Its plans rely in large part on expanding its customer base for fuels, electric vehicle charging and convenience stores. It has not said publicly it would set up a retail power business.
European rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and France's Total are also targeting fast growth in the retail power sector as they move away from oil and gas.
Shell's retail business has focused on Britain while Total has built a large portfolio in France and northwest Europe.
BP generates renewable power in the United States through several onshore wind farms and Lightsource BP, a solar developer in which it holds a 50% stake. BP is also developing offshore wind farms with Norway's Equinor off the east coast. 

BP wants to boost its renewable power generation from about 3.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2020 to 50 GW in 2030 and ramp up the volume of electricity it trades from 214 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year to 500 twh over the same period.

(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc publish quarterly results this week, with Britain's two biggest drugmakers both facing pressure from different quarters.
AstraZeneca was one of the leaders in the global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine but has faced a series of controversies.
GSK has fallen behind in the vaccines race and will be certain to face questions about its broader strategy after a report that U.S. activist investor Elliott had built up a multi-billion pound stake. 
GSK reports on Wednesday, with AstraZeneca due on Friday.
VACCINE FOCUS
AstraZeneca will for the first time break out sales from its coronavirus vaccine, Vaxzevria, which it is working on with Oxford University.
Use began early this year, and AstraZeneca has said it will not profit from the vaccine while COVID-19 is being treated as a pandemic. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last week reported $100 million in sales for its shot. 
The two vaccines are embroiled in controversies over possible links to rare blood clots. For AstraZeneca, these events add to a list of problems that have dogged its shot, including doubts over dosing, manufacturing delays and supply cuts.
""Despite vaccine headwinds and headlines, (AstraZeneca) remains a top pick,"" Leerink analysts said in a note.
AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot and his management's updates on production and safety will overshadow financial results, which are seen beating expectations on wide offerings and a boost from divestments, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said.
For its part, GSK, the world's biggest vaccines maker by sales, has focused on supplying its vaccine booster to other COVID-19 shot developers and helping to produce their jabs. Rather than making its own coronavirus vaccine, it is also working on potential treatments.
Updates on GSK's efforts with French partner  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) are highly anticipated, after the duo suffered setbacks, delaying their potential vaccine's launch.
CORE BUSINESS 
AstraZeneca has said it expects 2021 revenue to rise by a low teens percentage and core earnings to grow to $4.75- $5.00 per share.
GSK has predicted earnings will fall by mid-to-high single digits this year. 
This time last year, AstraZeneca and GSK's first quarters benefited from stockpiling. 
Updates on AstraZeneca's $39 billion buyout of Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN), announced in December, will also be sought, as will details on anaemia treatment roxadustat which is under regulatory review for broader use. 
GSK has warned of a lower dividend after it splits up next year into two separate companies, one focusing on pharmaceuticals and another on consumer products.
The separation was spearheaded by boss Emma Walmsley to simplify operations. A former head of GSK's consumer business, Walmsley took the top job in 2017 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-ceo-idUSKCN11Q0IC despite some investor pressure to name an outsider to the role. 
Shareholder pressure may increase with the involvement of Elliott.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note that since a split is under way, it was ""unclear what incremental steps Elliott may want"".

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Monday, as investors gear up for one of the busiest weeks of the first-quarter earnings season, with key economic data and a Federal Reserve meeting thrown in for good measure.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 44 points, or 0.3%.
The week ahead is a major one for corporate earnings, with around 180 S&P 500 companies, including 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average components, set to update investors on how their businesses fared during the first three months of the year. 
The first-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a strong start, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats so far, according to Refinitiv. However, that didn't translate uniformly into gains for the market, with investors raising question marks over various companies' outlooks.
Most of the focus this week will be on the five big-name mega-cap tech companies - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - with all five likely to enjoy another quarter of blockbuster earnings and sales growth, given their dominance in the tech space.
The major earnings release Monday comes after the close, in the form of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Its outlook is likely to be crucial as the electric car maker seeks to maintain its sky-high valuation, which is mostly based on predictions of huge growth down the line.
Aside from earnings, the Federal Reserve holds its latest two-day policy-setting meeting this week, concluding on Wednesday, but is not expected to change its ultra-easy monetary policies. 
On the same day, President Joe Biden is expected to spell out his infrastructure spending plan, and the tax hikes to pay for it, to a joint session of Congress.
March durable goods orders are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), but the major release this week will be Thursday’s  preliminary reading of first quarter U.S. gross domestic product. This is expected to show the economy expanded at an annual rate of 6.5% in the January-March period, accelerating from growth of 4.3% in the previous quarter.
Oil prices eased Monday, on continued concerns that rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in India and Japan, the third and fourth largest crude importers in the world respectively, will hit demand for the product in Asia.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $61.30 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.4% to $64.51. Both contracts fell around 1% last week.
OPEC’s Joint Technical Committee of experts is meeting Monday, and is supposed to end with a formal recommendation to ministers on output policy.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,778.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2090.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>","Analysis: As small-cap stocks lag, Wall Street worries about broad slowdown","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An historic rally in share prices for smaller U.S. companies has slowed sharply in April after six months of strong gains, leading many investors to worry that the stock market as a whole may have already priced in a strong rebound from the pandemic. 
""The easy money has been made for small caps and for the market overall,"" said Doug Foreman, chief investment officer of fund manager Kayne Anderson Rudnick, who expects the broad U.S. market will offer ""single-digit returns"" for the rest of 2021.
""The economic recovery is over in financial markets but not in the real world."" 
Over the last year, the 86.7% gain for the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks has trounced the 48.8% gain for the large-cap S&P 500 index, according to Refinitiv data. 
But since the start of April, the S&P's 5.2% gain has been nearly double the Russell 2000's gain of about 2.3%, and over the last three months the S&P has outperformed with a gain of 8.5% to 5% for the Russell 2000.
For a graphic on smallcaps:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpoxlrxvd/Pasted%20image%201619140658016.png
The Russell 2000 has stalled even as President Joe Biden's administration hit its April 19 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/all-american-adults-to-be-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine-by-april-19-biden-idUSKBN2BT1IF target date for expanding eligibility for the coronavirus vaccine to all adults, which should help the economy recover after the pandemic. Over the last three weeks, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airways both announced plans to recall all furloughed pilots and hire new ones as they prepare for a sharp rebound in travel. 
Wall Street is also bracing for the Biden administration's expected proposal to nearly double taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million. Small-cap investors could feel pressure to take some profits on the strong rally by selling shares before the tax hike kicks in.
By the time Biden marks his 100th day in office on April 30th, the United States will have administered over 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine, a pace far ahead of European countries or Japan. 
Slower gains for small caps probably signal that stocks will start to trade closer to fundamentals, with earnings results growing more important and investors less likely to discount a bad quarter, said Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
""The breakdown of small caps and cyclicals is a potential early warning sign that the actual reopening of the economy will be more difficult than dreaming about it,"" he said. 
Few expect that the Russell index will fall into a correction - a decline of 10% or more - or a bear market anytime soon. The index posted a 1.8% gain Friday, a sign that investors remain optimistic about the U.S. economy overall. 
""We've priced in quite a bit of the good news and the reopen already, but we could still see catalysts like M&A deals or higher oil prices that would give small-caps another leg higher,"" said Esty Dwek, head of Global Thematics & Macro Research at Natixis Investment Managers. 
Investors often look at small cap performance as a measure of the strength of a bull market, said Brain Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. A strong outperformance by small caps often signals that the bull market is an early stage, while a strong outperformance by large caps may mean that the bull market is aging and overall returns may be limited, he said. 
""The market was demonstrating early cycle behavior with value outperforming growth, small outperforming large. Now it's shifting more to mid-cycle behavior even though the economy is far from mid-cycle,"" he said. 
As a result, some small cap fund managers have become more cautious since the start of April. 
""We've been trimming some of the winners that have had massive moves up and deploying them into some of the more mature larger cap names,"" said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co. 
Among Villere's few new purchases are shares of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc, which dropped more than 27% https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-media/viacomcbs-discovery-both-fall-27-leading-media-stock-selloff-idUSKBN2BI380 on March 26 after losses at Archegos, a hedge fund run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, triggered a fire sale of media stocks. 

""There are fewer attractive values to be found in small caps right now,"" Villere said.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Shippers push for CP Railway to win bidding war for Kansas City Southern,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba, (Reuters) - North America's freight rail customers, from grain shippers to logistics companies, are pushing for  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd to win a bidding war for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) over rival Canadian National Railway, eyeing stronger competition and swifter service.
A takeout of KCS, would be the first major North American railroad combination in more than 20 years and create the first network to include the United States, Canada and Mexico.
CN, Canada's biggest railroad, made an unsolicited $30 billion bid for KCS on Tuesday, topping CP's agreed $25 billion bid, but CP said last week it was not considering raising its offer.
Rail customers' lobbying of the regulator, U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), is so far lopsided in favor of CP, which announced its combination with KCS on March 21. 
CP says that 416 rail shippers have written to STB in support. As of Friday, the STB had posted at least 135 letters regarding CP's bid, many of them supporting it and others urging full scrutiny of any merger with KCS.
""The end-to-end CP-KCS transaction will improve
service options, with new single-line hauls and broader access to markets across North America,"" said Dean McQueen, vice-president of Merchandising and Transportation at Canadian grain handler Viterra, in a letter that mirrored the language of numerous other letters of support.
Germany-based potash producer K+S AG, which has a Saskatchewan mine that CP services, wrote that it supports CP's bid and opposes CN's offer because it would reduce competition.
Other CP supporters include marine terminal operator DP World, shipping and container company Hapag-Lloyd, Canadian grain handler Richardson International and oil refiner  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO). 
CN said in a statement that its combination with KCS would create a network that is shorter and faster than rail or truck competitors.
But if CP buys KCS, the bulked-up company will be able to better compete with dominant railway BNSF Railway Co, said Kevin Karel, general manager at The Arthur Companies, which ships corn and other crops by rail. 
CP's line crosses the agricultural state of North Dakota while CN's does not.
""We're really remote here, and so we need access to far more destinations, and that's where this KCS merger really helps North Dakota farmers,"" Karel said in an interview.
SHIPPER VIEWS SEEN KEY 
Freight forwarder DUBO International Logistics, a track inspection technology company and a tire company have filed support letters for CN - the only three STB posted in favor of CN as of Friday. 
Many shippers intend to publicly state their backing for CN's offer in the coming days, CN spokesman Mathieu Gaudreault said. CP's larger number of support letters is due to its earlier bid, he said.
Shippers' views on the competing bids to the board may determine how KCS assesses the relative regulatory risks, investment bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note. CP has no overlapping rail networks with KCS, unlike CN which runs parallel for about 100 kilometres (62 miles) in Louisiana, making it easier for CP's deal to clear regulatory hurdles.
CP on Saturday welcomed the U.S. regulator upholding a waiver that exempts KCS from the same scrutiny larger railroads face during proposed mergers. The STB had granted KCS, the smallest of the Class 1 railways, an exemption from new merger rules in 2001 because a combination involving KCS did not raise the same concerns that any transaction among bigger railways might create.

U.S. agribusiness Cargill Inc, and industry groups for chemical producers, corn refiners, and a trade group that promotes U.S. wheat exports had opposed use of the waiver, saying that a takeover of KCS is big enough to warrant full scrutiny.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",U.S. auto dealers are winners as chip shortage lifts vehicle profits,"By Ben Klayman and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Mike Bowsher shakes his head in wonder when he hears yet another customer at one of his Buick-GMC dealerships near Atlanta has agreed to pay full sticker price of more than $71,000 for a top-of-the-line GMC Yukon XL Denali SUV that is still being assembled at a General Motors (NYSE:GM) factory.
Customers know what Bowsher has arriving by scanning the online inventories of his six stores in the region, and they are often willing to wait more than a week and pay full price to get their desired vehicle.
""I'm selling about 150% of what I have on the ground,"" Bowsher said. ""We are selling stuff so far up in the pipeline that they're putting money down on 'in-process,' which is in the plant.""
Automakers from GM to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Toyota have cut production this year due to the global semiconductor chip shortage. While those automakers have been pinched, dealers are experiencing the best of times. Not only can they charge full price for the hottest-selling trucks and SUVs, but many also have reduced promotional spending and other costs required by full vehicle lots.
""I'll take this till I'm six feet under,"" Bowsher said. ""Customers are coming in just saying, 'I'll take it, full sticker, get it ready.' It's nuts."" 
This means record profits for car dealers. 
AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) Executive Vice President Marc Cannon called it ""Camelot,"" comparing it to the legendary castle and court of King Arthur. He wondered whether this could turn into the new operating model in an industry where consumers in the past were conditioned to seek incentives and rebates that reduced vehicle prices by 10% or more. 
Profits at AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. dealer chain, almost tripled last week as gross profit per new vehicle soared 61% to more than $2,700 in the first quarter. Rival Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD) saw its profit per new vehicle jump 33% to $2,910 as its quarterly results trounced expectations.
The good times won't likely end soon as many industry officials see the chip shortage lasting into 2022. Many dealers report thin vehicle supplies, in some cases as low as 15 days worth.
At his company's Toyota store in Maine, Todd Skelton, chief executive of Prime Automotive Group, had 62 cars in mid-April, down from the typical 300 vehicles.
""We're now beginning to see not only the depletion of what we had in stock, but nothing following behind it,"" said Skelton, whose company has 32 stores in New York, New Jersey and New England across multiple brands. 
One concern of Skelton's is whether reduced supply will drag down overall profits despite higher margins.
And demand is not high for just new cars, as used-car prices are also rising, dealers said.
""If all of a sudden, I don't have a lot of 2021 Santa Fe's, I'm going to want as many 2019 and 2020 Santa Fe's as I can find,"" Andrew DiFeo, dealer principal at a Hyundai dealer in St. Augustine, Florida, said.
Not every dealer is ebullient.
Jim Seavitt, who owns a Ford dealer near the No. 2 U.S. automaker's Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters, said dealers celebrating now could be hurt later if inventories continue to fall.

""They think it's a light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a freight train,"" he said. ""I've got 150 cars on the ground. I've got maybe 30 cars coming next week. I sell 225 a month. Why would I be rejoicing right now?""

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks clawed their way higher on Monday as world markets began the week in a relatively upbeat mood following further signs last week that economies are recovering rapidly.
The start to the week was relatively quiet, however, as investors refrain from taking on large positions ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning on Tuesday and quarterly gross domestic product numbers for the United States.
But the general sentiment remained bullish with Wall Street hitting another intraday record-high on Friday and European shares not far off record highs in early Monday trading.
The broader Euro STOXX 600 gained 0.23% while Germany's DAX rose 0.22%. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.21%.
Asian shares also rallied where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reached its highest since March 18, despite a late sell-off in Chinese shares.
Wall Street futures pointed to a slightly weaker open.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.2%. 
Stocks are basking in a massive rally - the MSCI world index has suffered only three down months in the past 12 and is up nearly 5% this month and 9% for the year as investors bet on a rapid post-pandemic economic rebound turbocharged by vast government and central bank stimulus.
Analysts, however, say stocks look a little too confident and that the rally will run into hurdles after setting such a lightning pace and with so much of the recovery and fiscal stimulus splurge already priced in. 
""The real crux of the issue, however, is what's in the price. The year-to-date rally has increasingly eliminated upside to our targets,"" noted Andrew Sheets, a strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""Across four major global equity markets (the U.S., Europe, Japan and emerging markets), only Japan is currently below our end-2021 strategy forecast.""
BOLSTER CONFIDENCE
Still, recent data pointing to a solid global economic recovery has only served to bolster confidence. Strong corporate earnings and the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in developed economies have also supported sentiment.
Early April manufacturing activity indicators out last week pointed to a robust start to the second quarter with data hitting record highs in the United States and signalling an end to Europe's double-dip recession.
First-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data due later in the week is likely to show activity probably returned to pre-pandemic levels, analysts said.
""We estimate that the economy will close the output gap and rise above potential in the second half of this year,"" ANZ economists wrote in a morning note, suggesting more upside for shares. 
""(Europe) cannot match this, but as 2021 progresses into 2022, the growth differential to the U.S. will narrow,"" they added. 
In bond markets, government debt yields rose as investors dumped safer assets. 
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose 1 basis point to 1.5773% but that is some way off the plus 1.7% levels hit earlier this month when fears about a spike in inflation rattled markets.
In currencies, the dollar -- which had benefited from rising Treasury yields - fell against a basket of currencies to its weakest since early March -- another sign of the bullish mood of global investors this month.
Turkey's lira edged lower, adding to a recent slide and nearing an all-time low as a chill settled on relations with the United States and after the new central bank chief signalled that rate hikes would harm the economy.
In commodities, U.S. crude fell 57 cents to $61.57 per barrel and Brent eased 57 cents to $65.64.

Gold climbed 0.1% to $1,779 an ounce.

However, the Ifo Institute's survey on Monday showed German business morale improved by less than expected in April amid a third wave of COVID-19 infections.
While earnings from mega-cap U.S. technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could set the tone on Wall Street this week, Europe will see a barrage of earnings reports from UK banks, oil majors and healthcare companies.
Of the 15% of STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 66% topped earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 51% beat earnings estimates.
Swedish steelmaker SSAB jumped 2.9% after it reported earnings well above analysts' forecasts and said the market recovery that started last autumn had strengthened in the first quarter.
Dutch health technology company Philips fell 2.6% as a 250-million-euro ($302 million) provision in the first quarter overshadowed a hefty jump in profit.
Austrian sensor maker AMS fell 3.5% after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) double downgraded its stock to ""underperform"", citing concerns around the company potentially losing product supply deals at Apple.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 04:35AM ET</span>","Toshiba must seek suitors, another big shareholder says, after CVC's $21 billion offer","By Makiko Yamazaki and Scott Murdoch
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp's second-biggest shareholder called on the Japanese conglomerate to undergo a strategic review and explicitly solicit suitors, saying potential acquirers were deterred by the company's comments on wanting to remain listed.
The comments by 3D Investment Partners, which owns a 7.2% stake in Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY), come as a $21 billion buyout offer from CVC Capital Partners earlier this month has sparked expectations for a bidding war for the Japanese company.
While Toshiba dismissed that offer citing a lack of details, CVC has not thrown in the towel and sources have said some other private equity investors are also considering making bids.
""We call upon the board to openly welcome interest from suitors who could enhance corporate value and ask the board to conduct a formal review of strategic alternatives,"" 3D said in a letter sent to Toshiba's board on Monday and made public.
""To conduct a fair and proper process, Toshiba should explicitly indicate that it is open to alternative ownership structures and correct media speculation that Toshiba's management team and board have a strong preference for remaining a listed company,"" 3D said.
The industrial conglomerate has said it believed that being publicly traded provided a ""capital structure suitable for enhancing long term value creation"" but added that its board would not disregard various proposals, including those to take the company private.
In response to a request for comment on 3D's letter, Toshiba reiterated that stance on Monday.
""This letter may be the starting point of multi-party dialogue ... other shareholders certainly feel the same way, and addressing the board publicly puts them on the spot,"" Quiddity Advisors analyst Travis Lundy, who writes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.
""I expect more shareholders will come forward with similar letters""
Earlier this month, U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Toshiba's third-largest shareholder with a stake of around 6%, also called on the Japanese conglomerate to seek other offers from potential suitors.
Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, Toshiba's top shareholder with a stake of around 10%, has not commented since CVC's offer was made public.
Bain Capital, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management are also looking at potential bids for Toshiba, Reuters has reported.
A senior executive at one of Toshiba's main lenders said that several private equity funds have contacted his bank for potential financing, but no talks are in progress.
In the letter, Singapore-based 3D suggested it would take further action if the Toshiba board fails to consider its request, saying shareholders ""will have no choice but to seek a more significant and ongoing role in governance"".

It estimated Toshiba's fair stock value in excess of 6,500 yen. Toshiba shares closed 1.3% higher on Monday at 4,465 yen, compared to the broader Tokyo stock market's 0.2% gain.
""Shareholders will hold management accountable if they try to block these interests to buy the company,"" said another Toshiba investor, who could not be named because of confidentiality constraints.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Philips posted a hefty jump in quarterly profit on Monday and nudged its expectations for 2021 higher as the coronavirus pandemic drives demand for its hospital equipment and personal health appliances.
The Dutch health technology company said core earnings surged 74% in the first quarter to 362 million euros ($438 million) compared with the year earlier period, on a 9% rise in comparable sales, easily beating analysts' expectations.
""Revenue growth was a bit stronger than we originally expected"", Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters. 
""On that basis and expecting a strong second quarter, we are raising our guidance.""
Philips, which sells products ranging from electrical toothbrushes to medical imaging systems, said it now expects ""low-to-mid-single-digit comparable sales growth"" for 2021, up from earlier guidance for low growth.
All business segments and markets contributed to the strong growth in the first months of 2021, Van Houten said, as hospitals resumed elective procedures and investments which were put on hold during the first wave of the pandemic last year.
Demand also remained strong at the Connected Care division, which supplies equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients such as respiratory machines and monitoring and software platforms that allow remote care.
Philips still expects the growth of this division to slow over the course of this year, following a surge in demand in the second half of 2020.
The company's shares openend roughly flat on Monday, having risen around 15% since the start of the year.
PROVISION DAMPENS NET PROFIT
However, Philips also said it had made a 250 million euro provision to deal with risks it detected in some of its respiratory care devices.
It said sound abatement foam used in some of its sleep and respiratory care devices could degrade when cleaned incorrectly or when used in hot and humid conditions. 
""We have seen a very low incident rate"", Van Houten said. ""But out of precaution we feel we need to take action and repair affected machines and change this component.""
The provision meant net profit was stable at 40 million euros in the first quarter from the year earlier period.
Analysts had expected 326 million euros in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) and a 6% rise in comparable sales.
Last year's results were restated to reflect the 3.7 billion euro sale of the household appliances business to Hillhouse Capital announced last month.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Monday, continuing the global rally as investors gear up for a busy week of earnings and economic data, with a Federal Reserve meeting also thrown in. 
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%.
Global stocks markets have been lifted to record levels by signs of a global economic improvement, typified by the early April manufacturing activity indicators out last week, with purchasing manager indices hitting record highs in the United States and signaling an end to a double dip recession in Europe
Germany’s highly-watched Ifo Business Climate Index continued the trend for improved sentiment, climbing to 96.8 in April, above the 96.6 level seen in March, although this jump wasn’t as impressive as had been expected.
More concrete economic data comes in the form of the first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product numbers later in the week amid expectations activity is fast returning to pre-pandemic levels.
Also of interest will be the latest policy-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve, which concludes on Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is not expected to announce any policy changes, but is likely to face questions over whether an improving labor market and rising coronavirus vaccinations warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing. 
Back in Europe, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock slipped 2.5% after the Financial Times reported the company was warning about a bigger production hit in the second quarter due to a global chip shortage.
Philips (AS:PHG) stock fell 2.6% after the Dutch health technology company booked a provision of up to 250 million euros ($302 million) from a possible safety risk in some sleep and respiratory care products, even while posting a 74% jump in quarterly core earnings and raised its outlook for 2021.
On the flip side,  Pearson  (LON:PSON) stock rose after strong growth in online education helped the U.K. publishing giant lift revenues by 5% in the first three months of 2021, while IMI (LON:IMI) stock soared 7% after the U.K. engineering firm lifted its full-year guidance and launched a stock buyback program.
A lot of corporate attention this week will be on the U.S. tech giants, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among the companies due to release their earnings.
Oil prices weakened on continued concerns that rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in India and Japan, the third and fourth largest crude importers in the world respectively, will hit demand for the product in Asia.

297,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 02:01AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Edge Higher; German Ifo Due,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Monday, continuing the global rally amid signs the world economic recovery was well on track. 
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%. 
Wall Street closed firmly higher Friday, with the broad-based S&P 500, for example, hitting a record intraday peak to end up 1.1%, and this positive tone continued in Asia, with even India’s Nifty 50 gaining 1.2%, despite the country continuing to battle record levels of new Covid-19 infections.
The risk appetite has been boosted by strong signs of a global economic improvement, typified by the early April manufacturing activity indicators out last week, with data hitting record highs in the United States and signalling an end to Europe's double dip recession.
The release of Germany’s highly-watched Ifo Business Climate Index for April later in today’s session should confirm the improved sentiment, while more concrete economic data comes in the form of the first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product number later in the week amid expectations activity will have returned to pre-pandemic levels.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde assured the market late last week that pullbacks in the central bank’s emergency bond-buying program were not under discussion, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to reiterate that stance when it concludes its two-day policy-setting meeting on Wednesday.
Back in Europe, the earnings season continues, with Philips (AS:PHG) in the spotlight after the Dutch health technology company posted a 74% jump in quarterly core earnings and raised its outlook for 2021 citing pandemic-driven demand for its hospital equipment and personal health appliances.
The likes of U.K. publishing giant  Pearson  (LON:PSON) and French tire manufacturer  Michelin  (PA:MICP) also report quarterly numbers Monday. 
That said, a lot of corporate attention will be on the U.S. tech giants, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among the companies due to release their earnings this week.
Oil prices weakened Monday, on continued concerns that rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in India and Japan, the third and fourth largest crude importers in the world respectively, will hit demand for the product in Asia.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $61.41 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $64.64. Both contracts fell around 1% last week.
India set a new global record for the most infections in a day on Sunday, while in Japan, a third state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures began on the same day, affecting nearly a quarter of the population.
Elsewhere, gold futures were largely flat at $1,777.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2109.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 02:00AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse investors oppose risk chairman's Gottschling re-election,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Shareholders holding more than 15% of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock want to oust the board's risk committee chairman, Andreas Gottschling, after investments imploded, the Financial Times reported on Monday, following a similar call by proxy adviser Glass Lewis.
Credit Suisse is raising capital, and has halted share buybacks, cut its dividend and revamped management after the Swiss lender lost at least $4.7 billion from the collapse of family office Archegos, and after the bank suspended funds linked to insolvent supply chain finance company Greensill.
Now, David Herro, vice-chair of Harris Associates, which says it owns 10.25 per cent of the bank's stock, and the Ethos Foundation, which represents 200 Swiss pension funds that own between 3 and 5 per cent, want Gottschling to be removed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.
Norway's oil fund, which at the end of 2020 owned 3.43% of Credit Suisse stock, also said it would vote against Gottschling's re-election, the FT said.
""Not only should Mr. Gottschling be voted down, but I'm actually surprised in light of current events that he hasn't already resigned,"" Herro told the newspaper.
Earlier this month, Glass Lewis urged Credit Suisse shareholders to oppose Gottschling's re-election, on grounds that as risk committee chairman he should be held accountable for problems tied to Greensill and Archegos.
""Our clients are really angry about what has happened,"" Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Ethos, told the Financial Times. ""Other members of the risk committee have not been there very long so we will give them more of a chance. [Gottschling] took over in 2018 as chair. This now requires a change.”
Credit Suisse did not immediately comment. 
The Zurich-based bank is due to hold its shareholders' meeting on April 30.

In contrast to Glass Lewis, another proxy adviser, ISS, has not recommended investors to oppose Gottschling.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 01:25AM ET</span>",Analysis: Retail trading appetite robust even as stock-buying frenzy cools,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail traders have shifted from ""meme stocks"" to large-cap names and exchange traded funds, and while their activity has eased from its January peak, the blistering pace of new retail account openings means non-professionals are likely to remain a market force.
Retail trading levels skyrocketed at the beginning of the year, helped by the frenzy of buying in stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). But that has been followed by a pullback, according to data, despite expectations that investors would use stimulus checks to trade.
""We were expecting this huge influx of money to come in from retail after the stimulus checks came in, in March. That didn’t happen,"" said Eric Liu, cofounder of Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, which tracks retail trading activity.
Liu said small investors who sold favorites like GameStop in February or March likely got burned, as most of the names retail piled into in January fell between 20% and 30%.
That may have caused some investors to hold some money back from the markets, and driven others towards ETFs, he said. Buying ETFs over single stocks is a more conservative trade as it spreads risk. 
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note on Wednesday that retail activity around small-cap stocks is near year-to-date lows, but it has picked up in the past couple of weeks around large-cap stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), as well as ETFs like Invesco QQQ. 
While overall retail volumes have eased, they remain well above almost any other time period, and other measures of retail engagement, like margin balance, are also robust, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note.
At  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, activity edged slightly higher in the week of April 12, to an average of just over 6 million daily trades, after falling for six-straight weeks from around 9.4 million in the week of Feb. 22, company metrics https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/13-week-table-trades-01192021-to-04162021.pdf show. 
""As we moved into March and now well into April, we did see client engagement moderate to some extent,"" Schwab's chief executive officer, Walt Bettinger, said on Thursday. ""It still is elevated, but it does appear at levels that may be more sustainable for the long term."" 
(GRAPHIC: Daily average trades by Charles Schwab Corp customers - https://graphics.reuters.com/RETAIL-STOCKS/yzdvxbxkrvx/chart.png) 
STILL USING THE APP
The underlying strength of online brokerage account openings, however, means analysts are not counting retail investors out yet. Individuals have been entering the market in droves since October 2019 when large brokers like Schwab and Fidelity dropped their trading commissions, following startups like Robinhood and Social Finance Inc (SoFi). 
Mike Bijesse, a 34-year-old New Yorker with a fintech background, said he started using his Robinhood app daily around the start of the pandemic. 
""I'm definitely a little bit addicted. There's a, 'first thing in the morning have a look,' sort of thing and making some impulse trades,"" he said.
The influx of new investors surged during COVID-19 lockdowns and their frenzied trading of small-cap stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) helped push market volumes to record levels, peaking at 24.48 billion shares traded on Jan. 27, according to Refinitiv data and analysts.
Bijesse said that on that day he sold AMC shares he had bought in December for a 5X return. More recently, he bought a quarter-share of the mega-cap Coinbase after its market debut last week.
At Schwab, customers opened 3.2 million new accounts in the first quarter - more than were opened in all of 2020, not including accounts acquired through mergers and acquisitions, the company said.
At brokerage TradeZero America, new accounts are up between 300% and 400% this year over all of last year, said cofounder Dan Pipitone. 
""While the volumes have definitely tapered off, the pace at which people are onboarding and opening accounts, we really haven't seen a deep decrease in that,"" he said.
With trading costs down so much for small investors, almost everyone can have a brokerage account, even if it's just for entertainment value, said Ivo Welch, a finance professor at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management.

""There are few other cheap thrills and gambles where the odds are so good. Certainly much better than lotteries or Las Vegas,"" he said.

McDormand's win makes her a member of an elite club that includes Meryl Streep, Daniel Day Lewis and Jack Nicholson as the winners of three acting Oscars. The late Katharine Hepburn won a record four.
In ""Nomadland,"" the 63-year-old McDormand plays a widow, who in the wake of the U.S. economic recession, turns her van into a mobile home and sets out on the road, taking on seasonal jobs along the way.
The publicity-shy McDormand was one of the favorites for the best actress prize, which she first won in 1997 for her portrayal of a pregnant police chief in crime drama ""Fargo."" 
McDormand won again in 2018 for playing an angry mother seeking justice for her dead daughter in dark comedy ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."" 
McDormand, who is married to independent movie director Joel Coen and is known for her down-to-earth nature, made her film debut in 1984's ""Blood Simple"" and has gone on to play a wide range of characters.
She has starred in several of Coen and his brother's movies,including ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Burn After Reading."" 
Her other movie roles include ""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Almost Famous"" and ""North Country,"" all three of which earned her Oscar nods, as well as ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Something's Gotta Give.""
McDormand has also left her mark in television and on stage. In 2011, she won a Tony award for her portrayal of a single mother in the play ""Good People"" and in 2015 she picked up an Emmy for her lead role in the television mini-series ""Olive Kitteridge."" 
McDormand won at Britain's BAFTA ceremony and took home multiple prizes from film critics for her performance in ""Nomadland.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Monday morning as investors await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision, due later in the week. Investors will also be keeping an eye on results from the continuing earnings season for clues on the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.27% by 10:37 PM ET (2:37 AM GMT), as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Liberal Democratic Party (LPD) digested the results from Sunday’s by-elections for parliamentary seats in Hokkaido, Hiroshima and Nagano, which were won by opposition parties.
Although the LDP-led coalition kept its majority in both houses of parliament, the results are a blow ahead of the general election, which must be held by October 2021.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.53% while in Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.11%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.20%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.46% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.18%. Chinese shares were headed towards a three-week high over indications that the recovery was on track.
On the data front, U.S. new home sales rebounded in March by 1.021 million units to their highest level since 2006. The manufacturing and service purchasing managers indexes also beat records, coming in at 62.2 and 63.1 respectively.
The 10-year Treasury yield continued to remain below the 1.6% mark on Monday.
Investors remain focused on the Fed decision, however, which is widely expected to reiterate that the central bank is not looking to withdraw its unprecedented COVID-19 support anytime soon even as signs of economic recovery from the virus emerge.
“Treasury yields have declined a little bit, they’ve taken back rate hikes in the future and we can’t really expect the Federal Reserve or other central banks to lift off so quickly, so soon given the uncertainty about the pandemic,” Medley Global Advisors global macro strategy managing director Ben Emons told Bloomberg.
Other central banks handing down decisions in the coming week include the Bank of Japan, which hands down its policy decision on Tuesday.
Corporate earnings also remain of interest to inventors, with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Facebook Inc . (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) among the companies due to release their earnings later in the week.
“If we are going to see big jumps in earnings growth for these companies this week, then I think those it’s a positive backdrop for the markets,” said Medley’s Emons.
On the COVID-19 front, India continues to grapple with a virulent wave of COVID-19, reporting a million cases over the span of three days.
Global shares went on a rollercoaster ride during the previous week as the number of global COVID-19 cases piked and U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration proposed to almost double the capital-gains tax rate for the wealthy. Biden will make his first address as president to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday."
303,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Israel examining heart inflammation cases in people who received Pfizer COVID shot,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Health Ministry said on Sunday it is examining a small number of cases of heart inflammation in people who had received  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine, though it has not yet drawn any conclusions.
Pfizer said it has not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be expected in the general population.
Israel's pandemic response coordinator, Nachman Ash, said that a preliminary study showed ""tens of incidents"" of myocarditis occurring among more than 5 million vaccinated people, primarily after the second dose. 
Ash said it was unclear whether this was unusually high and whether it was connected to the vaccine.
Most of the cases were reported among people up to age 30.
""The Health Ministry is currently examining whether there is an excess in morbidity (disease rate) and whether it can be attributed to the vaccines,"" Ash said.
Ash, who spoke about the issue in a radio interview and during a news conference, referred to it as a ""question mark"", and emphasized that the Health Ministry has yet to draw any conclusions.
Determining a link, he said, would be difficult because myocarditis, a condition that often goes away without complications, can be caused by a variety of viruses and a similar number of cases were reported in previous years.
Pfizer, asked by Reuters about the review, said it is in regular contact with Israel’s Health Ministry to review data on its vaccine.
The company said it ""is aware of the Israeli observations of myocarditis that occurred predominantly in a population of young men who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine"".
""Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established,"" the company said.
""There is no evidence at this time to conclude that myocarditis is a risk associated with the use of Pfizer/BNT COVID-19 vaccine.""
Israel has been a world leader in its vaccination rollout, with close to 60% of its 9.3 million population having received the Pfizer vaccine. Its nationwide database has already showed the vaccine to be highly effective in preventing the symptoms and severe illness associated with COVID-19.
Since January, shortly after the vaccine campaign began, daily infections dropped from a peak of more than 10,000 to just 129 before the weekend.
Nadav Davidovitch, director of the school of public health at Israel's Ben Gurion University, said that even if a correlation between the myocarditis cases and the vaccine were established, it did not appear to be serious enough to stop administering the vaccine.

""It's a situation that should be looked into, and we need to wait for a final report, but in an interim analysis it seems the risk of getting sick from COVID-19 is much higher than from the vaccine's adverse events, and the risk of peri/myo-carditis following the vaccine is low and temporary,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Two of France's richest businessmen are close to a deal over media and publishing company Lagardere that would hit pause on their attempts to cherry-pick its assets for several years, three sources close to the discussions said on Sunday.
Vincent Bollore, the top shareholder in Lagardere via his Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) group, and luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, also a Lagardere investor, have been at the centre of a tussle over the firm and its influential media outlets for months.
The saga has transfixed top political circles in France a year ahead of a presidential election, with some in President Emmanuel Macron's camp fearing that Bollore could seize assets like Lagardere's Europe 1 radio and build up a powerful ring-wing outlet that would go against his campaign.
The three sources familiar with the talks said that Bollore, LVMH boss Arnault and Lagardere's CEO Arnaud Lagardere are finalizing a deal that would include a five-year pact not to dismantle the company.
The details of the agreement and shareholder alliances as well as what would happen to some Lagardere assets, such as Europe 1 and the Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper, have not yet been finalised, the people added.
They cautioned that the deal had not yet been signed and that the talks could come off the boil at the last minute.
Lagardere is due to hold a board meeting on Monday, the sources said.
Arnaud Lagardere, who runs the indebted company founded by his late father, would be ready to let go of an arcane ""commandite"" structure as part of the deal, the three sources added.
That set-up gave him the power of veto over many key decisions despite holding only 7% of the shares, and had been a major obstacle to any takeover attempts of the company.
ARNAUD AT THE HELM 
The ""commandite"" has been the target of criticism from hedge fund Amber Capital, which has waged an activist campaign against Lagardere's management over its governance.
Vivendi holds 27% of Lagardere, ahead of Amber with 20% and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund with 13%, while Bernard Arnault has just under 8% and has also invested in Arnaud Lagardere's personal holding company.
""This deal would help clarify the governance problem. There were two layers before, now there would only be one,"" one of the people close to the talks said.
It is not yet clear, however, how the pact can be cemented to avoid takeover bids on Lagardere, including by Vivendi, and whether there will be get-out clauses. Sources have previously said that Amber and the Qataris are keen to eventually sell out.
Under the deal being discussed, Bollore could be a big winner. Vivendi could get three Lagardere board seats, one of the sources said.
Arnaud Lagardere would get to run the company for five years, the three source said. Les Echos newspaper reported on Saturday that his stake could also be increased to 14%.
Bernard Arnault had been keen to snap up the JDD newspaper or Paris Match magazine, sources previously told Reuters.
The truce would at least meet one of the billionaire's goals, which had been to help Arnaud Lagardere keep his job at the top and avoid a full break-up of the group, another of the sources familiar with the talks said. 
Arnault's investment has so far been profitable, this second source said.

Bernard Arnault had been a close friend of the company's founder, Jean-Luc Lagardere.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Ports, which owns and operates 11 ports and terminals in the United Arab Emirates and Guinea, has secured a $1 billion loan with a group of banks, two sources said.
Nine banks provided the facility, with Citi and First Abu Dhabi Bank having lead roles in the transaction, the first source said on condition of anonymity.
The source added that HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) were also involved in the loan for the company, which is owned by Abu Dhabi state holding company ADQ.
Abu Dhabi Ports, FAB, HSBC and Standard Chartered did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Citi declined to comment.
Issuers in the Gulf have been raising debt, seeking to benefit from low rates as the region emerges from an economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and last year's oil price plunge.
Abu Dhabi Ports was also likely to issue bonds soon, the second said. Fitch Ratings and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings both assigned the company an A+ credit rating on Thursday.
ADQ, which sovereign wealth fund tracker Global SWF said last month was worth $110 billion, has gained prominence in the past year as Abu Dhabi consolidated several government assets under its banner.

Another ADQ subsidiary, power utility TAQA, raised $1.5 billion in a bond deal last week. Food and beverages group Agthia, also owned by ADQ, mainly used bank debt to finance its acquisition of three quarters of Egypt's Ismailia Agricultural and Industrial Investment.

(Reuters) -Canadian Pacific Railway on Saturday welcomed a favorable regulatory decision related to its proposed merger with Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), on the same day that Kansas City said its board has determined that a competing offer from Canadian National Railway could be expected to lead to a ""superior proposal.""
Kansas City Southern said the board made its determination unanimously and said it would open negotiations with Canadian National, although it remains ""bound by the terms of the CP merger agreement."" It noted that its board ""has not determined"" that the CN proposal ""in fact constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.""
 Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP)'s $25 billion cash-and-stock offer, at the time the deal was announced in March, values Kansas City Southern at $275 per share.
Canadian National's rival cash-and-stock offer, made earlier this week, values Kansas City Southern at $325 a share.
Canadian Pacific on Saturday touted a ruling by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, which oversees freight rail, that a waiver of stricter rules governing mergers granted to Kansas City Southern in 2001 would be applicable to a merger of Kansas City and Canadian Pacific.
The pre-2001 rule judges a proposed merger on whether it would adversely affect competition. Under the rule introduced in 2001, rail merger applicants must demonstrate that a proposed tie-up would be in the public interest. Kansas City Southern had been granted the waiver based on its small size.
The STB on Friday confirmed that the waiver it granted to Kansas City Southern in 2001 is applicable to the proposed friendly combination of the two companies.
Both companies expect the STB's review to be completed by the middle of 2022.
According to the regulator, the merger would result in the smallest Class I railroad, based on U.S. operating revenues and also result in few overlapping routes.
Following Canadian National's rival $33.7 billion offer for Kansas City Southern on Tuesday, CP said it would not raise its bid.

Canadian National Railway said in a statement on Saturday that it looked forward to engaging with Kansas City to finalize a merger agreement and that it welcomed the determination by Kansas City Southern's board.
Canadian Pacific, in a response, said the Kansas City Southern board was simply meeting its obligations under the merger agreement with CP and fulfilling its ""fiduciary duty"" to its shareholders by assessing the Canadian National offer.

""We are being told from the suppliers and within the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group that we need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter, probably more challenging than the first quarter,"" Wayne Griffiths, president of Volkswagen's Spanish brand Seat, told the FT. https://on.ft.com/3gBddOE
Griffiths called the shortage the ""biggest challenge"" the company faces at the moment.
He said production at Seat's Martorell plant outside Barcelona was currently ""hand to mouth"", with the brand deciding what cars to build only after it receives chips from suppliers, the report said.
Volkswagen has said it expects chip supply to remain tight in the coming months, adding it could not provide visibility for the full year.
The company has been unable to build 100,000 cars due to the shortage, CEO Herbert Diess said last month, adding the group would not be able to make up for the shortfall in 2021.

""The situation has been exacerbated i.e. by the blizzards that have occurred in Texas, as the large chip manufacturers based there had to stop or reduce their production. For that reason further adjustments to production cannot be ruled out"", Volkswagen said in an emailed statement on Saturday.

(Reuters) - Super Group, the parent company of online bookmaker Betway, is nearing a deal to go public through a merger with blank-check acquisition firm Sports Entertainment Acquisition Corp at a valuation of about $5.1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. 
The deal comes as Betway, which has its roots in Europe, expands in the United States. Betway has agreed to acquire Digital Gaming Corp, tapping the online sports betting and gaming market in 10 U.S. states, according to the sources. 
Shareholders accounting for more than two-thirds of Super Group's equity will maintain their stakes under the deal, the sources said. Sports Entertainment's executive chairman, Eric Grubman, a former National Football League (NFL) executive, will become chairman of Super Group, and Sports Entertainment CEO John Collins, a former National Hockey League chief operating officer, will join Super Group's board, the sources added.
The sources requested anonymity because the deal negotiations are confidential. 
SPACs, such as Sports Entertainment, are shell companies that raise funds in an initial public offering with the aim of merging with a private company, which becomes public as result, providing an alternative to traditional IPOs.
SPAC dealmaking tailed off in recent weeks following a record start to 2021 after U.S. regulators changed the accounting requirements for them. 
Betway's platform enables betting on popular sporting events around the world, including Britain's Premier League football tournament and the cricket tournament Indian Premier League. It has partnerships with U.S. basketball teams such as the Chicago Bulls, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Clippers, and English football teams such as West Ham United. 
Betway earlier this year entered the U.S. betting market, which has been growing rapidly since a ban on sports betting was lifted in 2018.
Super Group also owns Spin, a multi-brand online casino offering. It counts the likes of former cricketer Kevin Pietersen and former jockey Katie Walsh among its ambassadors. 

Sports Entertainment Acquisition completed its IPO in New York in October, raising $400 million. It is backed by Timothy Goodell, general counsel of U.S. oil producer  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) and brother of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, and an affiliate of investment bank PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) Inc.

The suspects are accused of aiding and abetting fraud in combination with tax evasion, indirect false certification and criminal advertising, said Klaus Ziehe from the prosecutor's office in the northern city of Braunschweig.
The scandal saw more than nine million vehicles of the VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda brands sold to consumers with a so-called defeat device which helped to circumvent environmental tests of diesel engines.
The prosecutor's office did not name any of the charged executives, who are accused of bringing cars onto the market in a condition that was not officially approved, meaning they were illegal and advertised misleadingly, Ziehe said.
He added the indictment had now reached 1554 pages.
The prosecutions were earlier reported by news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa).
A Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) spokesman said a criminal investigation against the company was dropped in 2018 after it paid a fine, adding that the company was not involved in the upcoming trail against individual suspects.
""Against this background, we do not comment on the other charges that have come to light...,"" the spokesman added.

Volkswagen said last month that it would claim damages from its former CEO Martin Winterkorn and former Audi boss Rupert Stadler over the diesel emissions scandal, which was discovered in 2015, as it looks to draw a line under its biggest-ever crisis.
The trial of Winterkorn and the other managers has been postponed until September due to the pandemic.

But let’s find out which of these two stocks is a better buy now.The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) manufactures, markets and sells branded consumer lawn and garden care products worldwide. The company operates through three segments—U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne and Other. In addition, it offers hydroponic products and lighting components that help in growing plants and vegetables indoors, using little or no soil.

In addition, it provides nitrogen-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients, and other ancillary services. MOS sells its products to wholesale distributors, retail chains, farmers, cooperatives, independent retailers, and national accounts.
The huge rise in food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic has benefited the fertilizers industry, resulting in record net sales last year. However, the high demand for fertilizers to get good crop yields had caused a shortage in the supply of potash and phosphate, two major components used in producing fertilizers, leading to a rise in their prices.

NEW YORK/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian digital bank Nubank has initiated preparations for a U.S. stock market listing that could come as early as this year, according to people familiar with the matter.
It would be one of the biggest stock market debuts of a South American company in recent years. Nubank was valued at around $25 billion in a January private fundraising round, more than doubling its valuation. 
Nubank, whose legal name is Nu Pagamentos SA, is working with advisers about an initial public offering in New York, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are confidential. 
""We will probably do an IPO at some point in time, but it is not among our current priorities.

It declined to comment specifically on the timeline of or preparations for its IPO.

(Reuters) -U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, driving the S&P 500 to a near-record closing high, after factory data and new home sales underscored a booming economy while megacap stocks rose in anticipation of strong earnings reports next week.
The bounceback follows a sell-off on Thursday when reports that U.S. President Joe Biden plans to almost double the capital gains tax spooked investors. Analysts dismissed the slide as a knee-jerk reaction and pointed to the strong outlook.
As the three major Wall Street indexes surged, the CBOE market volatility or ""fear"" index plunged almost 10% in a sign of tumbling investor anxiety about the risks ahead.
Companies are providing guidance after staying quiet during the pandemic, while lower bond yields and results that beat estimates are driving the rally, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""There is a lot of anticipation of what's to come,"" he said. ""We've seen actual reports beating these very high expectations. Yields have come back down, which is very positive for tech.""
Earnings take center stage next week when 40% of the S&P 500's market cap report on Tuesday through Thursday, including the tech and related heavyweights of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Those names, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), supplied the biggest upside to a broad-based rally in which advancing shares easily outpaced decliners.
Expectations for company results have steadily gained in recent weeks as opposed to a typical decline as earnings season approaches. First-quarter earnings are expected to jump 33.9% from a year ago, the highest quarterly rate since the fourth quarter of 2010, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
U.S. factory activity powered ahead in early April. IHS Markit's flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 60.6 in the first half of this month, the highest reading since the series started in May 2007.
In another sign of strong consumer demand, sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in March, likely boosted by an acute shortage of previously owned houses on the market.
All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with technology and financials leading gains.
Ron Temple, head of U.S. equity at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management, said the U.S. economy is about to post the strongest growth in 50 years, with more than 6% gains both this year and next.
The Federal Reserve will allow the economy to run hotter than in the past, adding to the high-growth outlook.
""Investors are gradually coming around to the sheer magnitude of excess savings, pent-up demand and the implications of such a massive wave of fiscal stimulus,"" Temple said.
Stocks surged just before the bell, with the benchmark S&P 500 falling a bit to miss setting a record close.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.67% to 34,043.49 and the S&P 500 gained 1.09% at 4,180.17, just below its previous closing high of 4,185.47 on April 16. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.44% at 14,016.81.
For the week, the S&P 500 unofficially fell 0.13%, the Dow about 0.46% and the Nasdaq 0.25%.
Some earnings reports on Friday were lackluster, with  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) sliding 1.9% after reporting a slump in credit spending and lower quarterly revenue.
Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) fell 2.1% after missing revenue expectations in aerospace, its biggest business segment.
Naked Brand Group jumped 4.8% after shareholders approved the proposed divestiture of the company's Bendon brick-and-mortar operations.
Image sharing company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc gained 4.2% as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised its price target, saying newer product offerings and expanding footprint in markets abroad will yield higher revenue and user growth.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.62-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.82-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 81 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 20 new lows.

The action comes as the state ramps up efforts to preserve water resources amid worsening drought conditions. 
The order is in response to several water rights complaints and an online petition against Nestle Waters (NYSE:WAT) North America starting in 2015, which led to drinking water supply shortages and impacted environmental resources.
Nestle, one of the world's largest bottled water companies, has 20 days to respond to the draft cease and desist order and request a hearing or the State Water Board may issue a final order, the board said. 
The company may be asked to limit diversions from surface streams to its pre-1914 water rights and submit annual monitoring reports, among other steps, if the order is adopted, it said.
Nestle's facilities in the Strawberry Creek watershed, a tributary of the Santa Ana River, involves 13 sites where spring water is taken and redirected for bottling at numerous plants, including one in downtown Los Angeles.
Parched conditions throughout the U.S. West are following quickly on the heels of a multi-year drought in the region last decade. 
Earlier this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a regional drought emergency in two Northern counties and directed state agencies to take immediate action to address the drought.
""It is concerning that these diversions are continuing despite recommendations from the initial report, and while the state is heading into a second dry year,"" said Jule Rizzardo, assistant deputy director for the Division of Water Rights. 
Nestle sold some struggling North American water brands to private equity firms One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos & Co for $4.3 billion in April, as the food giant doubles down on its premium offerings.

As such, with their progress in the field of therapeutics and cancer research, Novartis (NVS), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) are the top holdings in Wood’s Genomic Revolution (ETF). Thus, we think these companies should be valuable additions to one’s portfolio.Renowned investor Cathie Wood has had a vested interest in the healthcare industry for a long time, with big bets on the genome revolution. To capitalize on biotechnology industry growth, Wood launched Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) in 2014. With the biotech industry holding steady over the past five years, ARKG has gained 27.5% since its inception. However, Wood expects the industry to gain momentum this year because, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, major countries have been restructuring their healthcare sectors to be prepared for future public health calamities. With the potential to cure serious incurable ailments, such as aggressive cancers or cystic fibrosis, Wood believes DNA sequences and genome mapping could redefine healthcare.
With approximately $9.44 billion in net assets, ARKG is one of the largest actively managed ETFs in the industry, with at least 80% of the funds invested directly in relevant domestic and foreign equity securities. Wood expects DNA sequencing to emerge as a global disruptive trend this year itself. This has motivated more investors to bet on the healthcare industry through ARKG. Consequently, ARKG’s NAV has increased 186% over the past year. Novartis AG (NVS), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) are among ARKG’s top seven holdings ARKG. And given their impressive innovative capabilities and solid financials, these companies are expected to lead the healthcare revolution through genomics globally.
Wood recently observed in a CNBC interview that, “We can honestly say that until now more than half of all healthcare decisions were in some part made through guesses or experiences. Now we’re going to have the data.” The global biotechnology market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.8% over the next seven years to reach $752.88 billion by 2028.

Investing.com – The Dow jumped Friday as investors swooped in to buy beaten down financial and tech stocks following Thursday's rout on news that President Biden is mulling a capital gains tax hike.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.83%, or 279 points, the S&P 500 climbed 1.27%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.63%.
Financials were pushed higher by a surge in the regional banking stocks as the wave of better-than-expected earnings for the sector continued, supported by a reflationary environment.
SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) led the pack, up more than 11%, after its first-quarter results topped analysts' expectations, prompting several upgrades from Wall Street.
""The company positively revised its 2021 expectations that suggest robust balance sheet growth, modestly growing fee trends, revenue driven expense growth, and some incremental margin pressure,"" RBC said in a note as it lifted its price target on the stock to $590 from $560.
Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) and  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC) also gained, up from than 3%.
In technology, big tech recovered losses from a day earlier as investors took advantage of the recent selloff ahead of the busy earnings week for the sector next week.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher.
Intel is ""mostly doing the right things … but results will be painful over an elongated period as revenues suffer from past missteps, and costs increase as Intel invests in its turnaround strategy,"" Wedbush said. ""Net, our view remains that the stock recovered too much/too quickly and we continue to see near-term downside from current levels.""
Snap (NYSE:SNAP), meanwhile, was up 2% after social media company topped analysts' estimates on better-than-expected user growth.
The strong rebound for Wall Street comes just a day after markets were roiled by news that Biden is set to propose doubling the capital gains tax on wealthy Americans.
On the pandemic front, worries over rising global cases intensified after infections in India jumped to a one-day record, and Japan declared its third state of emergency in Tokyo.  
In other news, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) said it would acquire the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs in a deal worth $2.75 billion."

326,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",Investors doubt U.S. capital gains tax plan alone can derail market rally,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on Friday from a day-earlier swoon as investors digested the implications of a planned capital gains tax hike, with many pointing to reasons why such a policy alone would be unlikely to threaten the rally in equities. 
The S&P 500 was up more than 1% in afternoon trading, recouping losses from Thursday, when stocks fell after reports that President Joe Biden would seek to nearly double the capital gains tax to 39.6% for wealthy individuals.
That would be the highest tax rate on investment gains, mostly paid by the wealthiest Americans, since the 1920s. The rate has not exceeded 33.8% in the post-World War Two era.
But investors pointed to a broad range of reasons why the markets are likely to take the proposal in stride, including the limited effect of such proposals on equities in the past and expectations that any hike would be much lower than anticipated.
Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management found ""no relationship"" historically between capital gains tax rate changes and stock market performance.
""While we can't rule out some additional modest equity market volatility as investors react to this proposal, we think it will be very short-lived,"" the UBS analysts said in a report.
In the case of past capital gains tax hikes, the key to the market response was the state of the broader economy, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). 
Six months hikes in 2013 and 1987 the S&P 500 was significantly higher, while six months after hikes in 1976 and 1969, the index was lower, Detrick noted. This time around, ""the economy continues to bounce back faster than anyone thinks"" from the coronavirus pandemic, he said.
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), meanwhile, predicted that a 28% rate ""looks most likely, in our view, as it is roughly halfway between the current rate and Biden’s likely proposal"".
Any hike would need to go through Congress, where Biden's Democratic Party holds narrow majorities and is unlikely to win support from Republicans. It could require the unanimous backing of Democrats in the Senate where each party holds 50 seats. 
In the six months ahead of the 2013 capital gains hike, investors pulled $38 billion out of U.S. equity funds and ETFs, according to an analysis of Morningstar data by Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. Over the next six months, such funds saw $58 billion in inflows, according to Miskin, as the S&P 500 rose 18% over that 12-month period.
“It shows that investors likely turned over portfolios and potentially missed out on an accelerating stock market and they probably would have been better off just staying the course,” Miskin said. 
This time, Miskin said, stocks ""may be due for a pullback after such a strong run, but this is not in our opinion a top risk to derail this market.""
Investors also said Biden had long telegraphed his plans, so many market participants probably had already braced for them.

While the prospect of higher taxes may cause jitters, “the stock market has probably priced it in,” Detrick said.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chile settles dispute with Albemarle over lithium reserves data,"By Dave Sherwood 
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean regulators have settled a high stakes dispute over reserves data with top lithium producer  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp, according to a letter viewed by Reuters, defusing a spat that may have led to the suspension of the company's permit to expand its operations in Chile.
Chile in 2016 gave Albemarle approval to hike production from the lithium-rich Atacama salt flat on condition the miner prove its reserves could sustain the increased output.
But Chilean nuclear agency CCHEN, which also licenses lithium exports, said in January that Albemarle had failed to provide the necessary reserves data, a key stipulation in their permit.
In a letter dated April 22 and addressed to Albemarle, however, CCHEN said it had ""thoroughly studied"" new reserves data provided by Albemarle and had determined the report was ""satisfactory"" and complied with the terms of Albemarle's 2016 license.
The rubber stamp brings an end to one of three feuds Albemarle has had in recent months with Chilean authorities, helping to defuse tensions between the U.S.-based lithium giant and the government of the mineral-rich South American nation.
Albemarle's closely-watched expansion in Chile is a key link in satisfying global demand for the electric vehicle battery metal, which is poised to soar in the coming decade as more countries move to electrify transportation.
The company has also entered into international arbitration with another Chilean regulator, Corfo, over royalty payments earlier this year, and has separately filed suit to force the government to turn over a coveted, publicly funded environmental study of the Atacama salt flat.
Albemarle told Reuters by email on Friday that it has ""complied with all our obligations and requests from Chilean public agencies.""
CCHEN did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The spat over reserves data festered for months, in part because Albemarle had initially sought to keep some information confidential, saying U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules impeded it from turning it over, filings show. 
If Albemarle had refused to budge, CCHEN discussed the ""suspension"" of the company's permits until it complied with the government's request, according to minutes seen by Reuters from a previously unreported executive committee meeting in which CCHEN discussed the standoff.

CCHEN relies in large part on miners to provide data on the Atacama's reserves. Albemarle is one of two lithium miners operating on the flat, home to nearly one-quarter of the world's current supply of the white metal.

Because financial market volatility persists, we think it wise to bet on Rio (RIO), Fortescue (FSUGY), and Vector (VGR) because they offer more than 5% dividend yields. Read on.Even though the U.S. economy is on a path of recovery, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from vanquished, with several countries still witnessing increasing numbers of cases each day. So, financial market volatility persists, and the Federal Reserve is also expected to keep interest rates low in the near-term.
In this environment, several investors are turning to dividend yielding stocks to ensure a steady stream of portfolio income. Investors’ interest in dividend stocks is evident in SPDR S&P Dividend ETF’s (SDY) 24.7% returns over the past six months.
While not all high-yielding dividend stocks are a good buy, we think it could be profitable to bet on Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Fortescue Metals Group Limited (OTC:FSUGY), and  Vector Group Ltd .

In addition, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases could push the DJIA into a downtrend in the near term. Against this backdrop, we think it's best to avoid relatively overvalued DJIA stocks, such as The Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS),  Chevron  Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).After rallying to a record high earlier this month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 1.3% to close yesterday’s trading session at $33,815.90. Investors’ concerns over Biden’s proposed capital gains tax hike on the wealthy may have caused the index to lose some of its value. The proposal to almost double the capital gains taxes could lead to a further downtrend in the coming days.
In addition, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in several parts of the world has kept investors on their toes. Amid this environment, we think it could be wise to avoid companies with declining financials and lofty valuations.
Some DJIA stocks have been suffering significant losses, and their premium valuations do not justify their financial performance or growth prospects. Hence, we think it’s best to avoid overvalued stocks The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Chevron Corporation (CVX), and The Boeing Company (BA) for now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said on Friday the potential acquisition of the Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) freight railroad should set off ""alarm bells"" about industry consolidation.
Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, said the deal could spark a ""new wave of railroad mergers that stifle competition and trigger industry-wide consolidation.""
""Wall Street will make money from railroad consolidation, but the U.S. economy and workforce will be worse off for it,"" he said in a statement.
Both Canadian National Railway Co and  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd have offered to buy Kansas City Southern.
Canadian National said on Thursday it had informed Kansas City's board about its confidence in winning regulatory approvals for its $33.7 billion offer for the U.S. railroad.
Canadian National told the U.S. Surface Transportation Board the merged railroads “would remain only the fifth largest railroad in the United States - both on a track-mile basis and on an operating revenue basis” and would not be anti-competitive. 
Canadian argued that “the fiercest and most aggressive ‘competitor’ to the freight rail industry is the trucking industry, which has a dominant market share for the transportation of most commodities - including intermodal traffic.”
The railroads would have limited overlap - just 1% of their network - and Canadian said it would work with customers to ensure they would not be served by just one railroad as a result of a merger.
DeFazio said that there were 33 Class I, or major, railroads in 1980. ""Today there are seven, and a merger between KCS and Canadian National or Canadian Pacific would leave only six.""

He added that a series of mergers ""will likely result in a significant reduction of the railroad workforce, a workforce that has lost tens of thousands of jobs since 2015, and will negatively impact the rail network’s ability to provide affordable and reliable access for our nation’s shippers.""
The railroads did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com – Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s ADRs (OTC:DMLRY) shares were up more than 1% Friday after the German carmaker improved its outlook for 2021 while warning of a global semiconductor chip shortage hurting sales in the ongoing quarter.
The maker of Mercedes-Benz anticipates “group unit sales, revenues and EBIT in 2021 to be significantly above the prior year’s level.”
Daimler now expects an adjusted margin of 10%-12% from its Mercedes cars and van business, up from its previous outlook of 8%-10% growth.
The company also sees higher growth in China -- at 7.5% -- compared to the 2% to 7.5% range it predicted earlier.
Daimler’s optimistic outlook came on the back of the company riding on sales of record number of luxury cars in China and other higher-margin cars elsewhere. Cost reductions helped too.
Mercedes-Benz sales in China rose 60% to 220,520 and exceeded Europe’s where it sold 1.8% more units at 192,302.
In the first quarter of 2021, net profit was 4.3 billion euros ($5.3 billion), as much as 26 times more than 168 million euros in the same quarter last year.
Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said underlying car demand was strong and the chip shortage is holding back sales.

332,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Soaring lumber prices reverberate through U.S. housing market,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Skyrocketing lumber prices threaten to thwart the momentum of the U.S. housing market, which for months has been one of the brightest stars of the recovery from the pandemic recession.
At the onset of the health crisis, ""the mills stopped producing,"" said Dustin Jalbert, senior economist and lumber industry specialist at Fastmarkets in Burlington, Massachusetts. ""As soon as they saw 20 million unemployed, they shut down production.""
But COVID turned out to be a boon for the sector. Demand for low population density and home office space spiked, with historically low mortgage rates acting as an accelerant.
Surging demand pushed housing inventories to record lows. Homebuilders got to work, and lumber producers have struggled to catch up, which might take some time. Meanwhile, lumber prices have jumped more than 300% year-on-year to record highs.
""The logging operation, the shipping of the logs to the mill, the shipping of the finished product, getting workers back on the job, it's not like flipping a switch to bring those back online,"" Jalbert said. 
With lumber prices sky high and a slim supply of housing stock, median home prices of existing homes jumped by a record-breaking 17.2% last month.
The chart below shows lumber prices and inventories over the last two years, along with various housing indicators home prices, residential construction spending, building permits and homebuilder sentiment:
Graphic: Lumber prices and the economy - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yxmvjdxgovr/lumber.png
While homebuilder sentiment remains optimistic, as indicated by the National Association of Homebuilders' (NAHB) Housing Market index, headwinds due to rising building costs have pulled the index down from recent highs.
""The supply chain for residential construction is tight, particularly regarding the cost and availability of lumber, appliances, and other building materials,"" wrote Robert Dietz, chief economist at NAHB.
On Thursday, homebuilder DR Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) reported its quarterly profit nearly doubled, and said on its earnings call that lumber prices might see some relief as mills re-open and the international trade picture improves.
Pultegroup is due to report on April 27, while  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) and  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) Inc are expected to post results on May 5 and 25, respectively.
In the meantime, ""the builders' margins have done fine,"" Jalbert added. ""What does that tell us? The costs are being passed on to the homebuyer.""
Whether those costs will dampen demand is an open question, but a report from the Commerce Department released on Thursday showed sales of newly constructed U.S. homes jumped by 20.7% last month to an annualized rate not seen since 2006, the zenith of the housing bubble.
The stock market appears to be looking beyond current price surges.
The S&P 1500 Homebuilding index and the Philadelphia SE Housing index, which also includes home improvement retailers and building supply firms, have handily outperformed the broader S&P 500 over the last 12 months, as seen in the chart below:
Graphic: Housing stocks - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qzjvqzgqqpx/housingstocks.png
In the short term, mills are moving toward meeting the demand boom.
""The lumber industry is going to hit production capacity this summer, but things will calm down in 2022,"" Jalbert says.
While lumber prices should come back to earth, headwinds remain. Resources remain constrained and Washington has to conduct trade negotiations with Canada, which provides the United States with about 30% of its lumber, according to Jalbert.

""There's going to need to be more investment in the industry to meet this demand.""

(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s shares fell 7% on Friday as Wall Street analysts raised concerns about how soon the chipmaker can close the gap with rivals as it spends billions of dollars to increase manufacturing.
In recent years, Intel has struggled with building new manufacturing technology causing it to fall behind rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp in the race to make smaller chips with a faster processing speed.
Patrick Gelsinger, who returned to the company as CEO this year, has announced plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories and open its factories to other chip makers and advance chip manufacturing capacity.
""There are significant issues that must be overcome if this is to be a success, with investment ahead of time and profits unlikely until after 2025 if not later,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti said.
""In the near term (2-3 years), we do not believe that Intel has an answer to AMD's market share gains.""
On Thursday, Intel announced its second-quarter profit forecast that fell short of analysts' average expectation. The company's Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that the lower profits were because the company was investing in ramping up its new 10-nanometer and 7-nanonmeter manufacturing technologies.
Gelsinger has also announced plans to make chips for car plants at its factories to help alleviate a global chip shortage that has hit the automotive industry.
Analysts were largely on the sidelines; 26 of the 40 covering the stock have a ""hold"" or lower rating. Fourteen analysts have a ""buy"" or higher rating on the stock. The current median price target on the stock is $65, as per Refinitiv data. 

""The shortage...is going to require spending on a mammoth scale for chipmakers. Spending that Intel can ill-afford as it attempts to reclaim its title as the most valuable chipmaker in the U.S.,"" said Samuel Indyk, senior analyst at uk.Investing.com.

For example, the Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF (PEJ) was up 87% from the start of November to mid-February of this year.

Case counts plummeted in the US, although they have plateaued around 50,000 to 70,000 since late February. Already, there are signs of a recovery for these parts of the economy based on upbeat commentary on earnings calls, expectations of pent-up demand, and improvement in data on a month-to-month basis.

GM has come under criticism, including in full-page ads in several national newspapers, from some Black media leaders for not advertising enough in Black-owned media. GM said it will spend 2% of this year's budget in that sector.
""This action plan will transform our engagement model with diverse media in a sustainable way,"" GM Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl said in a statement.
""Over the course of several weeks, we met with many diverse-owned media organizations. We are grateful for the transparency and spirit of collaboration, which helped us frame this inclusive approach.""
GM cut its advertising and promotional spending last year by about $1 billion to $2.7 billion, according to the Detroit company's annual report.
Wahl told Reuters earlier in April its spending would return to normal levels following cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic.
GM also said on Friday it was allocating $50 million over 10 years to support diverse marketing companies.

The company will hold a dedicated ad spending meeting on May 14 with diverse-owned media leaders ahead of its general media spending event later this month.
""I applaud GM for taking the results of their thoughtful and robust discussions with a significant number of diverse media entities,"" said Alfred Liggins, chief executive of Urban One, which operates media properties targeting African Americans, in the same statement.

But CHPT’s stock price has slumped 10.7% over the past months. The stock’s premium valuation despite the company’s unimpressive financials made investors skeptical about the stock’s upside potential in the near term.
Although the EV sector’s market potential is enormous, the risk of heated competition in the nascent sector is high. And with dominant players generating higher profit margins and revenues, it may be tough for CHPT to survive in the crowded EV space.

Rolls-Royce is hoping to secure up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) from the sale of turbine blade-maker ITP Aero, which it has put on the block as part of a 2-billion-pound ($2.8 billion) asset sale to help repair its balance sheet after the pandemic. 
Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday that the disposal could be blocked by Spain unless the buyer could offer reassurances about ITP's future, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
Rolls-Royce said the relevant Spanish authorities - ITP is headquartered in the Basque region of Spain - were involved in the process and talks were positive. 
""The Spanish and Basque governments are important stakeholders and there is an ongoing and constructive dialogue with them,"" a Rolls-Royce spokesman said in an emailed statement. 
Rolls-Royce said there were multiple interested parties in the sale process, adding that ITP would also continue to be a supplier to Rolls-Royce for many decades to come. 
""As a result, it is obviously very important to us that a new owner is able to continue to invest in ITP Aero's technology, innovation and workforce,"" the spokesman said. 
Last month, Rolls-Royce's disposal plan suffered a setback when Norway halted the sale of its maritime engine maker to a Russian company on national security grounds.
Asked about ITP Aero, the Spanish industry ministry did not immediately respond. 
Shares in Rolls-Royce traded down 1.7% at 101 pence at 1356 GMT.
A source close to the matter said that Rolls-Royce was well aware that any deal for ITP would need to include assurances from the buyer.
Bloomberg said Spain was concerned Rolls-Royce could sell ITP to a private equity fund, naming KKR, Bain Capital and TowerBrook Capital as being in the running, and the financial buyers would not have an industrial plan for the unit.

(Reuters) -American Express Co said travel and entertainment-related spending on its cards halved in the first quarter as customers stayed at home due to the COVID-19 crisis, overshadowing a better-than-expected profit and sending its shares down 4%.
Cross-border travel restrictions and a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in several parts of the world have forced people and businesses to put travel on hold, hitting credit-card issuers.
Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said in an interview with Reuters on Friday that the continued travel restrictions would slow a rebound in business travel for large corporations.
""Our baseline assumption remains that by the fourth quarter of this year, global T&E (travel and entertainment) spending will be at around 70% of 2019 levels. But travel for large and global corporations is going to rebound slower,"" Campbell said.
However, Campbell struck a more optimistic tone for the latter half of the year, saying he expected overall spending volumes to be back to pre-pandemic levels either later this year or in 2022.
The credit card issuer reported a six-fold surge in net income to $2.2 billion earlier in the day, as it freed up more than $1 billion of funds that it had set aside to cover credit losses from the pandemic.

Excluding that benefit, earnings were $1.74 per share, higher than a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $1.61 per, thanks to a rebound in non-travel spending. 
Total revenue, excluding interest expense, fell 12% to around $9 billion, primarily reflecting a decline in spending by card holders and lower loan volumes.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Friday, regaining some composure after its heaviest fall in weeks in response to reports of a looming hike in capital gains taxes.
A report by Bloomberg indicated that President Joe Biden is planning to raise the marginal rate of capital gains tax to around 40% from a base rate of 20% currently, aiming to raise revenue for a swatch of social spending projects.
The rise would reverse a major element of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts in 2017 and creates an obvious incentive for stock investors to realize gains by selling before the higher rate is applied. Fox Business reported on Friday that the final higher rate may end up in the high 30%s rather than at 43%, as mooted by Bloomberg, which first reported the story on Thursday.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 58 points, or 0.2%, at 33,758 points. The S&P 500, however, was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%. All three indices had fallen by almost 1% on Thursday.
Earlier, the consultancy IHS Markit had released its purchasing managers' index for the U.S. in April, which showed the pact of economic activity picking up more than expected. Markit's surveys are more closely followed in Europe, where they indicated a similar trend overnight, but tend to be overshadowed by the Institute of Supply Management's surveys in the U.S. 
The ISM PMIs hit multiyear highs last month, breaching the 60 level. Many analysts have pointed out that in the past, when the ISM is above 60, fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy in response have usually led to poor performance by stocks. However, Fed officials have repeatedly stated in recent weeks that such talk would be premature, and that the current recovery is not to be compared with a usual cyclical upswing.
Even so, it remains the case that a generally strong round of corporate earnings this quarter, helped by low comparables and the near-certainty of an improving business outlook, haven't given stocks much in the way of fresh upside momentum this week.  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares all fell in early trade as analysts found something to dislike in all of their updates. 
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock also fell modestly, in a faint echo of a much sharper drop on the cryptocurrencies that are traded on its exchange.
Among the gainers on Friday were Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), which reported solid demand for toys as a results of the extended lockdowns throughout the winter across much of the world. Mattel stock rose 5.2% to its highest in over four years.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock also gained 6.1% after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) both repeated their buy recommendations on the stock in the wake of a strong quarterly report."

However, IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to a nine-month high of 53.7 in April, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 52.8. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
The United States numbers are due at 1345 GMT.
""The euro zone has enjoyed a record manufacturing boom this month as the continent sees its early stages of the recovery efforts reaping rewards,"" said Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, in a client note.
""We could expect some hiccups along the way, but sentiment should remain higher for some time.”
The euro rose 0.3% on the day to $1.2052 after dipping a day earlier, within sight of a seven-week high hit earlier this week. 
The dollar was steady against the yen at 107.92 and the dollar index, which tracks it against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, fell 0.26%.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was steady at 1.5489% after the capital gains tax reports pulled yields lower on Thursday. Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark of the euro area, was also flat.
Oil prices were steady, with support from the European economic recovery countered by persisting coronavirus concerns as infections surged to record levels in India. [O/R]
U.S. crude edged up 0.1% to $61.50 a barrel and global benchmark Brent crude was flat at $65.35 per barrel.

Spot gold was little changed at $1,785 per ounce but was still set for a weekly rise on soft Treasury yields and a subdued dollar. [GOL/]

Investing.com –  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) shares slipped by over 4% in Friday’s premarket as a revenue miss in the first quarter left traders disappointed, coming at a time when most financial services firms have posted solid earnings.
Revenues came at $9.06 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated them to hit $9.21 billion.
The credit card giant, whose business relies more than most on business travel, did manage to exceed quarterly profit estimates as it gained $675 million with the release of $1.05 billion in previously-booked provisions.
The lender had built reserves of $1.7 billion to safeguard its business from pandemic-related damages.
EPS of $2.74 was higher than the anticipated $1.6. Net income was $2.23 billion.
While the payments company reported a decline in spending on cards, it said it added 2.1 million new proprietary cards during the quarter.
“We’ve also seen an uptick across all categories of travel and entertainment spending in the U.S. in recent weeks, increasing our confidence that domestic consumer travel will continue to recover,” AmEx said in a filing.
At its Thursday close of $148.92, the stock wasn’t very far from its 52-week high of $151.42.

Airlines are seeing an uptick in bookings as accelerated vaccination efforts encourage leisure travel with friends and family after months of pandemic-linked restrictions.
""As leisure travel continues to return this summer, we are adding more flights to our June schedule,"" said Ankit Gupta, vice president of domestic planning and scheduling at United.

362,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 07:53AM ET</span>","Intel Slips As Sales From Key Data Center Segment Fall, Margins Erode","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares were down 2% in premarket Friday on concerns the company may be losing market share to rivals in the business of supplying chips to Coud service providers.
Guidance that was an improvement from last time and a booming market for personal computers weren’t enough to offset concern at the drop in sales at its data center business.
Revenue from data centers that run-based services for companies and individuals dropped 20% on the year to $5.6 billion in the three months through March.
The unit is Intel’s most profitable business. As such, its diminished contribution eroded group profit margins by 540 basis points to 55.2%. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Intel blamed it on “digestion” -- customers pausing orders while they work through unused stockpiles of chips.
Intel expects 2021 adjusted revenue and profits of $72.5 billion and $4.60 per share, above analyst estimates of $72.32 billion and $4.58 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
One silver lining was the growth in the PC business where Intel still rules the consumer mindspace. Revenue in that segment grew 8% year-on-year to $10.6 billion as working-from-home led people to spend more on PCs, laptops and other accessories.
Analysts are concerned by the increasing competition in its various businesses with many rivals, American and Asian, now also planning to design their own chips. One of those potential rivals is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - the world's biggest operator of datacenters - which at the end of last year unveiled a new chip for machine-learning processes.

A boom in online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted sales of Honeywell (NYSE:HON)'s warehouse automation unit, part of its safety and productivity solutions business.
Sales in the business jumped 49% to $2.12 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Honeywell also makes aircraft parts for planes manufactured by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc.
Analysts expect to see a recovery in the company's aircraft spare parts business later this year, as rising vaccination rates drive air traffic.
Honeywell said it now expects full-year sales between $34 billion and $34.8 billion, up form its prior forecast of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion.
Net income attributable to Honeywell fell to $1.43 billion, or $2.03 per share, in the first quarter ended, from $1.58 billion, or $2.21 per share, a year earlier. 

On an adjusted basis, Honeywell earned $1.92 per share in the quarter, beating Wall Street's estimate of $1.80 per share.

367,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 07:03AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Higher; Intel and PMI Data in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, rebounding slightly from the previous session’s sharp losses with investors still wary of the potential for a hike in capital gains tax.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 23 points, or 0.2%.
The major U.S. indices all closed just short of 1% lower Thursday, their biggest slide in five weeks, after reports that President Joe Biden is set to propose almost doubling the capital gains tax for those earnings more than $1 million a year, to potentially just short of 40%. 
The news rattled investor sentiment, amid concerns that investors will sell stocks, cashing in before any bill becomes law. That said, there is also a degree of skepticism that the proposal will be able to get through the political process in the form suggested given the likely heated opposition.
The corporate earnings season continues Friday, with companies having for the most part managed to beat Wall Street’s forecasts thus far. Some of the bigger names reporting ahead of the bell on Friday include industrial conglomerate Honeywell (NYSE:HON), personal-care company Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and oilfield services firm Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). All are expected to post lower profit and growth from a year ago.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is also likely to be in the spotlight after the chip maker’s second-quarter profit forecast fell short of expectations, even as it raised its annual sales outlook, as the company was forced to spend heavily to get its manufacturing operations back on track and catch up to rivals with faster chips.
U.S. economic data due for release Friday, at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT), includes preliminary “flash” readings of manufacturing and services PMI indices for April, which are expected to confirm the ongoing recovery.
Equivalent numbers in Europe, released earlier Friday, showed the recovery from the region’s pandemic-induced economic downturn was much stronger than expected in April.
March new home sales are due 15 minutes later, and consensus calls for 885,000, which would be a significant jump over February's 775,000, but come on the heels of a second straight drop in existing home sales on Thursday.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, boosted by the improving economic conditions in Europe and the U.S., but concerns about the second wave of Covid-19 cases in India, with the world’s third-largest oil importer setting records for daily infections and deaths, kept a cap on the gains.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $61.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $65.56. Both contracts are still heading for losses of just under 2% this week.
The keenly-watched Baker Hughes weekly oil rigs count is due for release later Friday.

The agreement brings to an end a months-long labour dispute involving about 650 staff in Berlin and Essen at the call centre unit DB Direkt.
The deal envisages the gradual introduction of a 13th month of pay, a one-time payment and wage increases that average out to be around 2.7% per year.
The strike took place over 13 weeks as the bank announced that it was rewarding some staff for a pandemic-related trading boom with a 29% increase in the bonus pool for last year.
The call centre employees are among the lowest-paid at the German bank, with starting wages of around 12 euros ($14.47) an hour, according to union officials.
Union officials said the strike was disruptive, creating long waits for customers trying to get through to the bank. They argued that call centres had grown in importance during the coronavirus pandemic.
Initially, workers sought a 6% pay increase, while the bank offered pay increases of 1.5% in two rounds.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>","After blazing U.S. stock rally, some warn of tougher market ahead","By Lewis Krauskopf and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street's biggest names are predicting a pause in a rally that has taken the S&P 500 to fresh records this year, leaving investors trying to determine whether to lock in some of the breathtaking gains or stay the course.
Among the most recent has been Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), whose analysts on Wednesday said an expected second-quarter peak in U.S. growth could be tied to weaker stock returns.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) earlier this week warned stocks would soon face headwinds.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) this month called for a pullback of as much as 10% in the S&P 500 as growth decelerates, and BofA Global Research backed a year-end target for the index about 8% below current levels.
A comparatively long period without a serious drop in stocks has also made some investors uneasy. The S&P 500 has declined at least 5% every 177 calendar days, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The latest market advance has lasted 211 days without such a drop.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see some kind of pullback for no particular reason other than people start to think maybe this is a little bit ahead of itself,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.
The flurry of warnings present a conundrum for some investors. While many would like to protect profits from the market's 85% run since last year's pandemic low, pullbacks over the past year have been difficult to time and followed by sharp rebounds, bolstering the case for holding on and buying more when stocks dip.
The S&P's two significant declines since March 2020 have averaged a drop of around 8%, lasting 12 days on the way down and taking 45 days to regain lost ground, according to Stovall. In both cases, the market went on to new highs weeks later, a pattern some have attributed to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus buoying investor confidence. 
""Since the bear market of March of last year, buying dips has been handsomely rewarded,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). 
Since the lows of the Great Financial Crisis, the index has climbed 511%, despite five drops of 10% or more and the 34% fall last March, offering investors another argument for buying and holding.
Nevertheless, some are bracing for potential turbulence, reflecting concerns ranging from rising COVID-19 cases, and worries that most of the economic benefits from massive fiscal stimulus have already been priced in. On Thursday, sources said the White House will propose nearly doubling capital gains taxes for the wealthy. 
Stocks were on track for a decline this week but the S&P 500 is still up 10% in 2021.
In options markets, the one-month moving average of open puts to open calls, a measure of sentiment, is the most bearish in about a year, indicating demand for protection against a decline in stocks. 
Options data also show a drop in demand for upside positioning. The S&P's two-month call skew, an options-based measure of investors' demand for upside, has fallen sharply since early April. 
""Investors are potentially seeing a lack of catalysts for another leg higher,"" Susquehanna International Group's Chris Murphy said in a recent note.
Next week, investors will be keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting, as well as a speech by U.S. President Joe Biden to Congress and earnings from companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
One worry is the comparatively rich valuation of stocks, with the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times forward earnings estimates, compared to a historic average of 15.4 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
""The market is expensive, so we have been looking for stocks that still seem to have upside,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
His firm sold some holdings in tech-related stocks such as Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc in recent weeks, and bought shares of Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), energy company  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) and homebuilder Green Brick Partners (NASDAQ:GRBK).

Still, the market has outperformed analysts' projections before. A Reuters poll of strategists from May 2020 forecast the S&P 500 ending the year with a marginal decline from that point. Instead, the index went on to rally about 25%. A February 2019 poll projected a 3.8% S&P 500 rise for the rest of that year, when it ended up rising some 15% more. 
Even with the market's run, ""you actually can find companies that are not overly expensive right now,"" said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors. 

Sitting in cash, ""you are going to make nothing,"" he said.

The shares climbed 8.7% to 12.50 euros at 9:03 a.m. in Amsterdam from the IPO price of 11.50 euros. The deal values Allfunds at 7.2 billion euros, according to a statement Friday.
Shareholders, including private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, offloaded a combined 26% stake in the company. If there is enough demand, the sellers can increase the deal size to as much as 2.16 billion euros. Allfunds didnot raise any money in the offering. The IPO price was close to the top end of the initial range at which the shares were marketed.
Allfunds casts itself as a one-stop shop for the distribution of fund products, sitting between banks and asset managers. The company says it had more than 1.2 trillion euros of assets under administration as of the end of 2020 and a 12% annual growth rate in revenue since 2016.
The decision to list in Amsterdam is a sign of the city’s increased clout, having surpassed London as Europe’s main share-trading center in January in the wake of Brexit. Allfunds has signaled that it was attracted to the Dutch capital because of its growing appeal as a listings hub for international businesses with a technology focus.
Amsterdam has now hosted two of Europe’s top three biggest IPOs this year, with Allfunds joining Polish parcel-locked provider InPost SA after its debut in late January. Proceeds from initial share sales on Dutch stock exchange now tally about $8 billion this year, the highest amount on record for this period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Blow to Madrid
The choice of venue also means Madrid missed out on what could have been its biggest IPO since wireless tower operator Cellnex Telecom SA in 2015. Allfunds would also easily be big enough to earn a slot in the IBEX-35 benchmark index, if the owners had opted to list on the Spanish bourse.
Allfunds was created by  Banco Santander  SA (NYSE:SAN) in 2000 and is headquartered in Madrid, with most of its top management being Spanish, including Chief Executive Officer Juan Alcaraz. Hellman & Friedman, which has owned the company since 2017, expanded the business through a series of acquisitions, including a purchase of Credit Suisse’s InvestLab platform.
A total of 850 million euros of the offering was taken up by cornerstone investors, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., Jupiter Fund Management Plc, Mawer Investment Management Ltd., Janus Henderson Investors and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management.
BNP Paribas,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Credit Suisse and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are joint global coordinators on Allfunds’ offering. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, CaixaBank SA (OTC:CAIXY),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA),  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV's ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA and Banco Santander (MC:SAN) SA are joint bookrunners.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Jidu Auto, an electric vehicle venture between China's tech giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Chinese automaker Geely, aims to plough 50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion) into producing smart cars over the next five years, its chief executive told Reuters.
Xia Yiping said on Friday that the funding would come from Baidu and other investors and Jidu would aim to launch its first electric vehicle (EV) in three years, as is standard for the industry, but would make efforts to speed this up.
Its first EV would look like a ""robot"" and would target young customers, Xia said, adding that Jidu would analyse big market data before deciding on a final model. 
""It will make you feel like it's a robot that can communicate with you with emotions,"" said Xia, who co-founded and served as chief technology officer at Chinese bike-sharing firm Mobike until it was acquired by Meituan in 2018.
Baidu's Hong Kong-listed shares jumped as much as 1.34% after Reuters reported Jidu's investment plan. 
The launch of the new auto company in January comes as tech companies around the world are racing to develop smart cars after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s success in commercializing EVs. 
Jidu plans to release a new model every one or one-and-a-half years after its first launch, Xia said, without giving a sales target. It plans to hire 2,500 to 3,000 people over two to three years, including 400 to 500 software engineers.
Shanghai and Beijing based Jidu also plans to roll out its branding in the third quarter of 2021, Xia said.
Xia said Jidu, which will use Geely's open-source electric vehicle platform, hopes to make cars in Hangzhou Bay in China's eastern city of Ningbo, where Geely has several plants.
It plans to sell its car directly to customers to begin with, without using dealerships.
Chinese search engine company Baidu in January announced it would set up the company with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to leverage its intelligent driving expertise and Geely's car manufacturing capabilities. Baidu currently owns 55% of Jidu and Geely has a 45% stake.
Jidu is considering using chips designed by Baidu, which has over the years developed smart car technologies including autonomous driving, high-definition maps and cloud. Baidu first established its autonomous driving unit Apollo in 2017.

Smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp and telecom giant Huawei Technologies are among other Chinese tech giants harbouring auto ambitions.

Panasonic, which bought a 20% stake in Blue Yonder for 86 billion yen ($797 million) last year, will acquire the rest of the stock from shareholders including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and New Mountain Capital, in an agreement, including debt, that values Blue Yonder at $8.5 billion, the company said in a press release.
""The need for more intelligent, autonomous and edge-aware supply chains has been dramatically heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Panasonic said. 
Panasonic will use cash for half of the acquisition cost with the remaining covered by a bridge loan that will be refinanced with subordinated bonds and other hybrid finance, it said. 
Better known for consumer electronics and appliances, Panasonic has in recent years focused more on building parts and supplying services to other businesses, such as batteries for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's electric cars.
The Japanese company deepened its partnership with Blue Yonder in May, gaining a seat on its board after acquiring a minority stake. The U.S. company uses machine learning to help companies manage supply chains that connect factories to warehouses and retailers.
Blue Yonder counts companies such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC among its customers.

The Blue Yonder deal will be Panasonic's largest acquisition since it spent 800 billion yen to make Sanyo Electric and Panasonic Electric Works wholly owned subsidiaries in 2011.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>",Volkswagen labour boss who clashed with CEO to take Traton role,"By Jan Schwartz and Nick Carey
HAMBURG (Reuters) -The head of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s powerful works council will take a management position at the carmaker's truck unit Traton, removing a prominent opponent of faster and more drastic restructuring at the German carmaker.
Traton said on Friday that Bernd Osterloh, who has been a member of the supervisory board at Volkswagen since 2005, will take up the position of personnel director on May 1.
Last year, the 64-year-old Osterloh clashed with Volkswagen Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess, opposing an attempt to extend Diess' contract as he strives to cut costs and free up resources to invest more in electric vehicles.
""Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess' most outspoken opponent is sidelined and it's fair to say that it creates the opportunity to run VW in a more rational fashion,"" Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a client note. 
Reuters first reported on Thursday that Volkswagen was considering a supervisory board change that could lead to Osterloh's departure.
""With Bernd Osterloh on the Executive Board team, we will tackle the tasks ahead,"" Traton Chief Executive Officer Matthias Gründler said in a statement. 
""His extensive experience in a globally positioned organization will have a positive impact on cooperation among our brands and partnerships.""
In a statement Volkswagen CEO Diess said Osterloh had ""constructively questioned the management and has thus helped time and again to find solutions that were in the company's best interests.""

Osterloh will step down from all his roles at Volkswagen and will be replaced by deputy works council head Daniela Cavallo as soon as possible, Volkswagen's labour representatives said in a statement. She will also take over Osterloh's functions on Volkswagen's supervisory board, an appointment that requires shareholder approval.
Under Germany's system of corporate governance labour representatives make up half Volkswagen's board.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 04:31AM ET</span>","Daimler raises profit outlook, sees potential Q2 sales hit from chip shortage","By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz car maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) on Friday raised its profit outlook for 2021, but said the global semiconductor chip shortage may continue to impact sales in the second quarter.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said it assumed there would be some recovery in chip availability in the second half of this year but there was limited visibility at present.
Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said underlying car demand was strong, but the chip shortage had prevented sales from reaching full potential.
Wilhelm, speaking on a conference call with analysts, said lost production would only be partially recovered by the end of 2021 and the carmaker would continue to allocate chips more to higher-end products while the shortage lasts.
Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.
The chip shortage has forced a number of automakers to curtail production, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Stellantis, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Daimler's German rival Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY). 
Earlier this week, Daimler cut working hours for up to 18,500 employees and said it would temporarily halt production at two plants in Germany due to the chip shortage.
But the German carmaker still expects its operating profit this year to be significantly above 2020 as the global economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Daimler now expects an adjusted margin from its Mercedes cars and van business of between 10% and 12%, up from its previous outlook of between 8% and 10%.
The company also raised its outlook for China, saying it expected more than 7.5% growth in 2021, up from its previous estimate of between 2% to 7.5%.
CFO Wilhelm told analysts sales in China so far in the second quarter were ""just great"" and the company could probably do even more if the chip shortage had not curtailed production.
Last week, Daimler said soaring Chinese demand for luxury Mercedes-Benz cars and higher prices drove a better-than-expected profit in the first quarter.
Mercedes-Benz sales rose 60% in China in the first quarter. Unable to travel abroad, wealthier Chinese consumers have used their disposable income to splash out on luxury items.
This week rival BMW also said first-quarter earnings received a strong bounce from sales in China and stronger pricing.
Chinese buyers helped to turn around 2020 for Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), with sales rising in the second half of the year and offsetting weaker results in other regions.
Daimler last week unveiled the EQS, a sedan built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform, seen as a solid contender against market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc as electric car sales take off.

""I feel much more comfortable today than a year or two ago that we can accommodate the step-up of electric vehicles without too strong a margin dilution,"" CFO Wilhelm said when asked about earlier Daimler predictions that electric vehicles would not be as profitable as fossil-fuel models until the end of this decade.
""Are we at margin parity today? No, we're not,"" he said. ""But we're making progress.""

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Friday, ending the week on a negative tone as investors study a slew of corporate earnings, particularly from Daimler, and economic data releases.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.4%.
European markets suffered a negative handover from Wall Street, with the major U.S. indices all dropping around 0.9% late Thursday, their biggest slide in five weeks, on reports that President Joe Biden is set to propose almost doubling capital-gains tax for the wealthy.
That said, losses are small, helped by signs of an improving economic picture in Europe as a whole. French and German manufacturing PMI numbers came in better than expected, well above the 50 expansion threshold, while U.K. retail sales jumped 5.4% on the month in March, climbing 7.2% on the year, way ahead of expectations.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde assured the market on Thursday that pullbacks in the central bank’s emergency program were not under discussion despite its prediction of a strong rebound in the euro zone economy from mid-year.
This comes as the region starts to get a grip of the latest wave of Covid-19 infections as it ramps up its vaccination program. France, for example, is set to re-open its schools on Monday and lift domestic travel curbs, which started earlier in the month, on May 3. 
In the corporate sector, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock rose 1.6% after the German car maker raised its profit outlook for 2021, even while warning that the global semiconductor chip shortage may continue to affect sales in the second quarter. 
Tod’s (MI:TOD) stock rose over 8% after LVMH (PA:LVMH), the French luxury goods retailer, increased its stake in the Italian shoe maker, to 10%, for around 75 million euros ($90 million).
Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY) stock fell 0.2% after the French industrial-gas supplier’s revenue dipped slightly in the first quarter, while  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) stock slipped 0.4% after the spirits maker reported a slight rise in sales in its fiscal full-year.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, boosted by the improving economic conditions in Europe and the U.S., but concerns about the second wave of Covid-19 cases in India kept a cap on the gains.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $61.87 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $65.72. 
Both contracts are still heading for losses of just under 2% this week on concerns of weakening fuel demand in India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, as the country sets records for daily infections and deaths from the Covid-19 virus.
India recorded almost 315,000 new cases on Thursday, prompting a number of countries, including Australia, Britain and Canada, to restrict the number of flights from the region.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 03:37AM ET</span>",Leveling up: Embracer's acquisition spree takes it to top of European games business,"By Supantha Mukherjee
KARLSTAD, Sweden (Reuters) - In a quiet corner of the town of Karlstad, 300 kilometres from Stockholm, a Swedish entrepreneur has built Europe's largest gaming company by market value - although most gamers have never likely heard of it.
Working out of an unassuming apartment building, Lars Wingefors' Embracer Group, with a team of fewer than 20, has grown by acquisition. Its catalogue already includes games as diverse as survival game Valheim, racing game MX vs ATV, and Goat Simulator.
And Embracer, which has bought more than a dozen companies during the coronavirus pandemic alone, is not done yet, Wingefors told Reuters in a recent interview.
Many gaming companies prospered during the pandemic as people locked in their homes turned to their screens. Embracer did even better than most, with its market capitalization more than doubling in the last 12 months to over $11 billion, compared with $10 billion for France's Ubisoft and $5 billion for Poland's CD Projekt.
Since going public in 2016 at 20 krona per share, Embracer's shares have climbed, reaching 260 krona by this week.
Wingefors attributes Embracer's success to a unique model under which he allows founders to run their companies as independent businesses, or ""verticals,"" after they are acquired by Embracer, with full creative and operational freedom. 
It's an approach that could have broad appeal in the fast-changing, hit-driven gaming business - which, ironically, analysts cite as a risk for Embracer because too many imitators could push up the cost of acquisitions. Deep-pocketed companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be willing to pay a premium for gaming firms.
The decentralized structure can also make it difficult for the company to take on the biggest gaming projects and compete with the likes of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision, according to analysts and gaming industry executives. 
Still, Wingefors has done a good job incentivising the many studios to pull in the same direction, said Benjamin May, an analyst with Berenberg.
Embracer currently has eight verticals, and is looking to add at least two new ones every year.
""We are working on more deals than ever across all our verticals, and I still have billions left,"" he said in an interview in his office, where the walls are adorned by large paintings, framed stock certificates of old Swedish companies and covers of comic book first editions.
""Right now we are busy trying to consolidate Europe, Russia, and starting to put our foot on the ground in Canada and North America."" COMICS TO GAMES
Wingefors started his first business at 13, buying and selling comic books. He learned the value and year of release of about 50,000 comic books printed in Sweden.
""It gave me a big advantage when buying comic books as I immediately could understand the value of each potential deal,"" Wingefors said.
Soon he started selling used video games by mail order, eventually selling the business to British dotcom startup Gameplay for 8 million pounds in a stock deal in March 2000, at the height of the dotcom bubble.
He became part of the company's European management, before moving on to found Nordic Games in 2008. The company listed on the secondary market in Stockholm in 2016 and rebranded itself as Embracer in 2019.
This year's acquisitions included Gearbox, known for first person shooter Borderlands, in a deal valued at up to $1.36 billion.
""Lars has a very rare balance of intelligence, ambition and humility,"" said Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, who said he was initially not interested in Embracer but changed his view after meeting Wingefors.
Embracer now has 193 game projects under development.
""We are expecting to complete 70 games projects in the next financial year and there are games costing at least $50 million in the pipeline,"" Wingefors said.
Embracer's deals usually include upfront cash, a stake in the company and milestone payments based on game releases. The company has raised money through share sales to fund the deals, including nearly $1 billion last month.
That model likely ""decreases the risk of bad acquisitions compared to other M&A-intense gaming companies,"" said Pareto Securities analyst Marlon Värnik.
Currently listed on Nasdaq First, Embracer hopes to list on the main bourses in the next few years.

""In the next five years to 10 years I want to build something substantially bigger than what we are today,"" Wingefors said.

Tod's said late on Thursday that LVMH would buy a 6.8% holding from Tod's founder and Chairman Diego Della Valle, adding to a 3.2% stake which the group led by French billionaire Bernard Arnault already owns.
""This may represent an excellent reason to consider further opportunities to be taken in the future ahead,"" Della Valle said in Thursday's statement. 
Sources have described the move as ""friendly support"" for the struggling Italian leather goods maker, whose brand portfolio includes Roger Vivier, with one source saying the French luxury goods giant was not expected to raise its stake further for now.

Analysts however said this remained possibility.
""If this transaction reinforces a 20-year friendship between Diego Della Valle and Bernard Arnault, it could signal further moves and represent an opportunity for LVMH to help Mr Della Valle take Tod's private in the future,"" Citi analysts said in a note.

381,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 03:09AM ET</span>",Biden Aims at Top 0.3% With Bid to Tax Capital Gains Like Wages,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden wants to end the preferential U.S. tax treatment of investment income that has benefited the nation’s wealthy as he seeks to fund a sweeping new social-spending program. But he will need to overcome a major political hurdle in Congress to do so.
The White House plans to propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for those earning $1 million or more, to 39.6%, according to people familiar with the proposal. That wouldn’t affect many. Only about 0.32% of American taxpayers reported adjusted gross income of more than $1 million and capital gains or losses on their returns, according to Internal Revenue Service tax return data from 2018.
The move would send the top federal rate on the appreciation in assets sold by the rich as high as 43.4% when including a surtax to help pay for Obamacare. And it would upend a century-old precedent of under-taxing investment relative to wages and salaries.
Surging stock and property prices over the past year only strengthened the Biden team’s determination to follow through on campaign pledges to demand higher taxes from the best-off. The president is betting the initiative will be popular enough to win passage in Congress, where he can’t lose a single Democratic vote in the Senate and only a handful in the House, since Republicans are likely to be united in opposition.
Stocks dropped the most in more than a month on the news Thursday, with the S&P 500 Index closing down 0.9%, though futures trading early Friday in Asia suggested some stabilization.
“If a 1% fall in stock prices is all that you get from a really major increase in capital gains taxes that’s not a big problem,” Nobel economics laurate Paul Krugman said on Bloomberg TV. “Biden has an ambitious agenda” and to help pay for it, “some significant tax increases are going to be part of the story,” he said.
Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for wealthy individuals, saying it’s unfair that many of them pay lower rates than middle-class workers.
The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. A 3.8% tax on investment income that funds Obamacare would be kept in place, they added.
Next Week
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, asked about the capital-gains plan at a press briefing Thursday, said, “we’re still finalizing what the pay-fors look like.” Biden is expected to release the proposal next week as part of the tax increases to finance social spending in the forthcoming American Families Plan.
Other measures that the administration has discussed include enhancing the estate tax for the wealthy. Biden has warned that those earning more than $400,000 a year can expect to pay more in taxes. The White House has already rolled out plans for corporate tax hikes, which go to fund the $2.25 trillion infrastructure-focused American Jobs Plan.
Republicans have insisted on retaining the 2017 tax cuts implemented by former President Donald Trump, and argued that the current capital-gains framework encourages saving and promotes future economic growth.
“It’s going to cut down on investment and cause unemployment,” Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and former chair of that panel, said of the Biden capital-gains plan. He lauded the result of the 2017 tax cuts, and said, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
GOP lawmakers on Thursday called for repurposing previously appropriated, unused pandemic-relief funds to help pay for their counteroffer infrastructure plan. The group underlined opposition to tax increases, other than a potential revamp of the levies that go toward highway funding in a way that would mean higher taxes on electric vehicles.
Biden will detail the American Families Plan in a joint address to Congress on April 28. It is set to include a wave of new spending on children and education, including a temporary extension of an expanded child tax credit that would give parents as much as $300 a month for young children or $250 for those six and older.
Biden’s proposal to equalize the tax rates for wage and capital gains income for high earners would greatly curb the favorable tax treatment on so-called carried interest, which is the cut of profits on investments taken by private equity and hedge fund managers.
The plan would effectively end carried interest benefits for fund managers making more than $1 million, because they wouldn’t be able to pay lower capital gains rates on their earnings. Those earning less than $1 million may be able to still claim the tax break, unless Biden repeals the tax provision entirely.
The capital gains increase would raise $370 billion over a decade, according to an estimate from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center based on Biden’s campaign platform.
For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%.
“It’s enough to bring fear into the taxpayers’ hearts, whether they are a Republican or a Democrat,” Christopher Boyett, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight who advises high-net worth individuals on tax planning, said of the Biden plan. “People are taking this seriously. It’s a high-anxiety time.”Congressional Democrats have separately proposed a series of changes to capital-gains taxation, including imposing the levies annually instead of when they are sold.
“There ought to be equal treatment for wages and wealth,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who’s the chamber’s top tax-writer, told reporters in a phone briefing Thursday. “On the Finance Committee we will be ready to raise whatever sums the Senate Democratic caucus thinks are necessary.”"
382,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 02:21AM ET</span>",The ex-convict's tale: Germany's role in Wirecard scandal under microscope,"By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In February 2019, after a steep drop in Wirecard's share price, German authorities launched criminal probes into short-sellers and journalists who had accused the company of fraud, and banned investors from betting against the company.
Documents seen by Reuters show for the first time that the only independent information - beyond Wirecard's representations - received by Munich prosecutors who launched the criminal probes was a third-hand account of events from a convicted money launderer, Daniel James Harris. 
The rationale that led to the decisions of prosecutors and regulators to launch the criminal probes and short-selling ban, and whether they were overzealous in supporting Wirecard, are central issues being investigated by a parliamentary inquiry into the company's collapse in Germany's biggest post-war fraud scandal.
The criminal probes and short-selling ban were launched by authorities after Wirecard complained it was being targeted by unidentified speculators who it said were in cahoots with two Financial Times journalists and had advance knowledge of a negative report that it said baselessly alleged accounting manipulations.
Some Wirecard executives were in fact engaged in a sophisticated global fraud at that time, the German government, prosecutors and regulators said last year after the payment company filed for insolvency, owing creditors almost $4 billion.
The trove seen by Reuters includes thousands of pages of emails, chat messages and memos provided by German authorities to the parliamentary inquiry, which reaches a climax this week with testimony from Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday. 
The witness testimony from Harris was provided by Wirecard, with a lawyer for the company delivering the two-page written statement in person to a prosecutor on Feb. 14, 2019, according to the documents. 
In the statement, Harris identified himself as an equities trader in Essex, southern England, and said he met his broker, whom he didn't identify, on Jan. 30, 2019, the day Wirecard's share price plunged up to 22%. 
The broker said he had been told that investors were trading in anticipation of a negative FT report about the company, which was published in the afternoon of that day, according to the statement seen by Reuters. 
    ""He told me he had spoken with a friend of his,"" Harris said. ""My broker said that this friend had told him that an article was about to be published about Wirecard.""
In his statement, Harris said he didn't act on the information. However Wirecard argued that market talk of a negative article ahead of publication was proof that investors were trading on inside information, and perhaps in collusion with journalists. At the time, the FT denied this, characterising Wirecard's claims as a ""smokescreen"". 
Reuters was unable to contact Harris or his lawyers for comment.
Harris was sentenced to a two-year jail term in February 2017 for money laundering for drug dealers who ran a moped delivery service in London and Essex, according to Britain's National Crime Agency. 
    A spokeswoman for the Munich state prosecutors said Harris' statement corroborated Wirecard's claims that it was unfairly targeted by speculators.
    ""The statement under oath was used by legal representatives of Wirecard to substantiate the legal complaint,"" she added.
In February this year, the state prosecutor told the parliamentary inquiry that he did not speak to Harris, without elaborating.
Munich prosecutors dropped the inquiry into the journalists last year, concluding there was no evidence of any collusion with investors, while no action has yet been taken against the several short-sellers investigated.
'VERY CONCRETE INFORMATION'
The documents seen by Reuters include correspondence by executives and officials from Wirecard, prosecutors and financial regulator BaFin provided to lawmakers. 
The prosecutors' office emailed Harris' statement to BaFin on Feb. 15, 2019, a Friday, the documents show, and the following Monday BaFin announced the first short-selling ban on a single stock in German history.
BaFin's ban was a watershed in the saga, according to lawmakers who have said it implicitly vouched for the company's credibility, while halting investors that doubted it.
A BaFin spokeswoman said the Harris witness statement played ""no role"" in the short-sale ban, but that it did fit into its examination of market manipulation. 
Yet Sebastian Kimmer, a member of BaFin's staff who corresponded with Munich prosecutors, testified before lawmakers in February this year that the Harris statement provided ""very concrete information"" that supported Wirecard's complaint. 
Kimmer said the information from prosecutors was deemed serious and credible by the regulator. He added that Harris' statement, along with the allegations from Wirecard relayed by prosecutors, were escalated to his superiors.
No details about Harris' statement have been publicly disclosed.
Munich prosecutors have previously defended their role, saying they acted impartially in alerting BaFin to Wirecard's fears that it was going to be targeted by short-sellers.
Felix Hufeld, then president of BaFin but who has since resigned in the wake of the scandal, had defended the short-selling ban as a means to maintain confidence in Germany's stock market.
But three lawmakers on the parliamentary inquiry said that the prosecutors' and BaFin's actions in February 2019 showed their readiness to side with Wirecard against critics, even in the face of what they characterised as flimsy evidence. 
Florian Toncar, one of the lawmakers, said the Munich prosecutors had shown a tendency to take a ""one-sided view on the Wirecard case"".

    ""They held the unsigned draft of a vague testimony ... as a plausible story,"" he added.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 02:20AM ET</span>",Germany's Merkel to be quizzed over Wirecard lobbying in public inquiry,"By John O'Donnell and Christian Kraemer
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel will be asked by German lawmakers on Friday why she lobbied for payments company Wirecard just months before it collapsed in the country's biggest post-war fraud.
Merkel's appearance will mark the climax of a public inquiry into an affair that has tainted Germany's reputation for rectitude, exposed ties between politics and business and prompted resignations and criminal investigations.
The government has said that Merkel did not know at the time of the irregularities at Wirecard, which has since been dismantled after its disclosure of a 1.9 billion euro ($2.3 billion) financial hole triggered its insolvency.
Wirecard, which began by processing payments for gambling and pornography, had been hailed as a rare German technology success story, although few really understood it. Once valued at $28 billion, it abruptly unravelled last year.
Lawmakers say that the German government was biased in favour of the company, turning a blind eye to allegations of irregularities in the run up to its collapse.
Parliamentarians will ask Merkel why she brought up Wirecard's planned takeover of a company in China during a state visit in September 2019. A senior official in her office had also pledged further support to Wirecard.
""The Chancellor lobbied for Wirecard with the most powerful man in China,"" said Fabio De Masi, one of the lawmakers leading the public inquiry, asking why she gave it such priority.
In power since 2005, Merkel remains popular, although her legacy, such as her 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to refugees fleeing war in the Middle East, divided opinion. 
The Wirecard debacle tarnished her government's reputation by shining a spotlight on the lengths some German politicians have gone to in order to support companies.
Stephan Klaus Ohme of Transparency International said had it exposed cracks in Germany's laissez-faire model towards industry, leaving companies largely to their own devices.

Operating earnings for the period fell 32% to 3.48 billion crowns ($413.3 million) on an organic sales drop of 10%, following restrictions and lockdowns to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts had expected a profit of 3.64 billion crowns, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
""Improved market conditions resulting from the ongoing vaccination programmes are expected to result in increased demand for several of Essity's product categories,"" the Swedish company said.
Significantly higher sales in China in the first quarter, and an increase in demand in North America at its professional hygiene division pointed to that, according to Essity.

The company said it expects a previously announced restructuring programme to ""contribute to Essity's total annual cost savings of 500 million to 1 billion crowns through the optimization of the production structure, productivity improvements and raw material and energy savings"".

(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating the death of an Oregon woman and the hospitalisation of another in Texas after receiving Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine, state health officials said.
The incidents come as advisers to the CDC are set to meet on Friday to consider whether it is safe to resume injections of the single-dose vaccine, while senior health officials prepare for a green light.
""It's important to remember that just because something is reported, it doesn't necessarily mean it was caused by, or linked to, the vaccine,"" said Imelda Garcia of the Texas health agency, according to the Austin American-Statesman newspaper.
The CDC notified Oregon about the incident on Tuesday and Texas on Wednesday, the two states' health officials said.
The Oregon woman, who is in her 50s, received the vaccine before the pause order on its use was issued, the state's health authority said in a statement. (https:// She developed ""a rare but serious blood clot within two weeks following vaccination,"" seen in combination with very low platelets, the Oregon Health Authority added. It warned that blame could not be assigned until its investigation was complete. Separately, a woman in Texas who received J&J's vaccine has been hospitalised for symptoms similar to those of six people who recently suffered blood clots after taking the shot in the United States, a Texas health agency spokesman said. Both states confirmed that the new cases were separate from the previous six incidents. Last week, U.S. health agencies recommended a pause in the use of the J&J vaccine over the six rare cases of blood clots, among roughly 7 million people who have received the shot. 
On Tuesday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it found a possible link between J&J's vaccine and rare blood clotting issues in adults who got doses in the United States, but added that the benefits of the shot outweighed the risks.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Friday, as investors try to digest the competing influences of the European Central Bank retaining its ultra easy monetary policies and losses on Wall Street overnight. 
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%. 
The European Central Bank decided at its meeting on Thursday to leave its 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.23 trillion) bond-buying program in place, confirming that purchases will run at an elevated pace in the current quarter. 
While this was expected, President Christine Lagarde also assured the market that pullbacks in this emergency program were not under discussion despite its prediction of a strong rebound in the euro zone economy from mid-year.
This comes as the region starts to get a grip of the latest wave of Covid-19 infections as it ramps up its vaccination program. France, for example, is set to re-open its schools on Monday and lift domestic travel curbs, which started earlier in the month, on May 3. 
Evidence of the improving economic picture in Europe as a whole came from the release of U.K. retail sales data Friday, with the March figure jumping 5.4% on the month, climbing 7.2% on the year, way ahead of expectations.
That said, the handover from Wall Street was negative with U.S. stocks suffering their biggest slide in five weeks on reports that President Joe Biden is set to propose almost doubling capital-gains tax for the wealthy, prompting speculation they may sell shares before any change is made to lock in a lower rate.
Back in Europe, the earnings season continues, with German car maker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) in the spotlight after it raised its profit outlook for 2021, but warned that the global semiconductor chip shortage may continue to affect sales in the second quarter. 
Elsewhere, Swiss cement maker LafargeHolcim's (SIX:LHN) first quarter sales rose amid stronger sales across its markets, while French industrial-gas supplier Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY) confirmed its outlook for this year despite its revenue dipping slightly in the first quarter.
Swedish hygiene products group Essity (ST:ESSITYb) reported a slightly bigger drop than expected in first-quarter operating profit but said it expected Covid-19 vaccine programs to boost demand for many of its product categories.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, boosted by the improving economic conditions in Europe and the U.S., but concerns about the second wave of Covid-19 cases in India kept a cap on the gains.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $61.83 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $65.72. 
Both contracts are still heading for losses of just under 2% this week on concerns of weakening fuel demand in India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, as the country sets records for daily infections and deaths from the Covid-19 virus.
India recorded almost 315,000 new cases on Thursday, prompting a number of countries, including Australia, Britain and Canada, to restrict the number of flights from the region.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,786.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at $1.2026.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Friday morning, steadying after broad-based declines in their U.S. counterparts, as investors continue to digest a U.S. proposal for higher taxes to fund the country’s latest social plan.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.74% by 10:37 PM ET (2:37 AM GMT), with the government preparing to declare a COVID-19 state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures from Apr. 25 to May 11. Eateries serving alcohol, establishments with karaoke equipment and commercial facilities with floor space of 1,000 square meters and over will be asked to close as part of the latest measures.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.10% while in Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.15%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.15%. China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.49% and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.69%
U.S. President Joe Biden will reportedly propose almost doubling the tax on capital gains to 39.6% for those earning more than $1 million a year.
Investors are also keeping an eye on the ongoing earnings season, and the latest batch of mixed results. While AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) beat earnings estimates and saw its shares jump on Thursday, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reported falls in both data-center revenue and gross profit margins. Shares in the biggest chipmaker globally slid after the close of the previous session as a result.
“For the short term most likely we’ll continue to see volatility as investors will use the current environment to capture gains,” Matthews International (NASDAQ:MATW) Capital Management LLC. portfolio manager Teresa Kong told Bloomberg.
However, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases globally continued to dampen investor sentiment. India hit a fresh global record of 314,835 cases on Thursday, with bodies piling up at crematoriums and burial grounds as the latest, brutal wave of the virus continues to hit the country. Several countries moved to restrict the number of flights from India, including Singapore, the UAE and Australia.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus appealed to governments and companies that “control the global supply” of COVID-19 vaccines to share supplies and know-how to make distribution more equitable.
The European Central Bank’s policy decision handed down on Thursday, and further assurance from President Christine Lagarde that pullbacks in the central bank’s emergency bond-buying program are not under discussion even amid improving economic data, also failed to make a dent in markets. Investors now await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision due to be handed down in the following week.
Stocks did get a boost on the data front, with fewer-than-expected 547,000 initial jobless claims filed in the U.S. during the past week. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted 617,000 claims while 586,000 claims were filed during the previous week."

(Reuters) -Mattel Inc will consider turning its collector brands into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the toymaker said after posting a record 47% surge in quarterly sales as Americans snapped up Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars in the usually slow post-holiday months.
NFTs, a type of digital asset that exists on a blockchain, have exploded in popularity this year, with NFT artworks selling for millions of dollars and musicians such as the Kings of Leon rock group embracing them for their latest album. 
California-based Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) on Thursday forecast annual sales to rise 6% to 8% versus prior outlook for a mid-single-digit percentage increase. It also predicted strong sales for the holiday season this year. 
""Toys continue to prove their importance to parents as to where they choose to spend their disposable income,"" said Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz. 
U.S. consumer confidence has got a shot in the arm as COVID-19 vaccination drives gather steam and the government hands out fresh stimulus checks. 
""We are seeing a strong start to the second quarter including the Easter week and we're planning for another great holiday season,"" Kreiz said. 

Mattel, which has been benefiting from stuck-at-home parents using toys to keep their kids entertained, posted net sales of $874.2 million in the first quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $684.2 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Overall gross billings at Barbie, Mattel's biggest brand, rose 87% to $276.2 million.
Excluding certain items, Mattel lost 10 cents per share, smaller than the 35 cents per share loss analysts had expected.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",Tesla CEO Musk puts $100 million jolt into quest for carbon removal,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Nichola Groom
(Reuters) -Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk on Thursday offered inventors $100 million in prize money to develop ways to fight global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or ocean.
""Right now we've only got one planet,"" said Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. ""Even a 0.1% chance of disaster -- why run that risk? That's crazy!""
In January, Musk announced his intention to offer $100 million in prizes and set out the contest rules on Thursday, Earth Day. What organizers called the ""largest incentive prize in history"" will last for four years through Earth Day, 2025.
Carbon capture and storage has drawn growing interest as a warming climate has melted glaciers, intensified tropical storms and resulted in ""sunny day flooding"" of more and more coastal areas. While countries are working to reduce emissions, scientists say carbon removal technology will also be crucial to the goal of getting emissions to net zero by 2050. 
""Both cost and scalability need to be addressed. Is it going to be enough carbon to matter, and can we afford it as a civilization? Those are two things that matter,"" Musk said on a video feed that showed him outdoors, barefoot in a black shirt with water and trees in the background. 
Carbon capture projects have already drawn backing from Silicon Valley startups, public officials worried about the slow pace of cutting emissions, and emitters including oil companies seeking to offset their climate impacts.
The technology is not yet commercially viable. Removing carbon can cost more than $300 per metric tonne in a world that each year emits greenhouse gases equivalent to about 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. By 2050, some 10 billion tonnes of carbon capture may be needed, by some estimates.
""I think this is one of those things that is going to take a while to figure out what the right solution is,"" Musk said. ""And especially to figure out what the best economics are for CO2 removal.""
Musk's $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal is aimed at finding a viable solution for taking 1,000 tonnes out of the atmosphere annually, with potential to scale up dramatically. 
Contenders must have a plan to sequester carbon for at least 100 years. Organizers said they will get feedback by mid May and turn guidelines into rules.
Musk has built a reputation as an industrialist focused on environmentalism, turning electric car maker Tesla into the world's most valuable vehicle company and expanding into solar power so customers can charge their rides carbon-free. He had conversations about the prize with Peter Diamandis, founder and executive chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation.
There are plenty of Silicon Valley startups eager to compete. Venture capital-backed carbon removal companies raised $336.5 million last year, according to PitchBook.

On Monday, XPRIZE announced two winners of a separate, $20 million prize to develop technologies to covert emissions from power plants into concrete. One is CarbonCure Technologies, based in Canada and backed by separate funds by Bill Gates, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others. 
The United Nations has said carbon removal technology is needed to limit increase in planetary warming and avoid catastrophic climate impacts. But some environmentalists have argued that focusing on carbon removal reflects a lack of resolve to end the use of fossil fuels.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 06:50PM ET</span>","Technology, high-growth stocks could lose out from Biden's capital gains tax plan","By David Randall, Lewis Krauskopf and Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street is skeptical President Joe Biden's expected proposal to hike capital gains taxes could pass the Senate, but investors see risks that tax-motivated selling could still weigh on technology and other sectors that skyrocketed during the pandemic.
Biden's proposal calls for increasing the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, and nearly doubling taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, according to sources familiar with the plan.
While any tax increase will likely be lower than Biden's initial proposal given the Democrat's small advantage in the Senate, individual investors who are concerned about rising rates may start to unload shares in order to lock in current rates. 
That would disproportionately weigh on technology stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is up more than 90% over the last year, and hot growth stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, whose shares have jumped nearly 400% since last April, said Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).
""There's a lot of capital gains built into those names, and we think they would be the ones who are most likely to take it on the chin,"" Chiavarone said.
High-flying stocks such as Tesla fell nearly 3% on Thursday afternoon following reports of the Biden tax plan. Apple dropped 1%, while  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) fell 1.5%. The broad S&P 500 dropped 0.9%.
The rally in the U.S. equity market since the start of the year will also likely prompt investors to pause until there is more clarity on the plan, said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York.
""Over the last few weeks, the market has shown itself to be out of breath. And this is one more reason for investors to take some profit,"" he said.
The S&P 500 is up 10.1% since the start of the year and trades at a price to earnings ratio of 29.9, a valuation level near its all-time highs.
""Some traders are looking for an excuse to lock-in profits and they might choose to use this tax story as their catalyst,"" said Ed Moya, senior analyst at FX brokerage OANDA, in a note.
Despite the declines in the stock market on Thursday, many on Wall Street do not expect capital gains taxes to rise substantially given that the Senate is divided with each party holding 50 seats and Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tie-breaking vote.
""When you have a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, in which if you lose one single senator, tax increases and the likes thereof aren't going to get through,"" said Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group in Dallas. 
Should some capital gains tax increase pass, however, dividend-paying stocks could become more attractive.
""If you do have the capital gains tax go above and beyond that on dividends, it could actually end up favoring dividend-paying equities going forward,"" he said.
Qualified dividend income tax rates top out at 20%. The ProShares S&P Dividend Aristocrats ETF dipped 0.7% on Thursday, slightly less than the broader market. 
A significant capital gains tax increase would also likely spur a wave of mergers and acquisitions, said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. 
""People are going to want to seal in lower capital gains rates than they could see in the future,"" he said. 
Still, the long-term outlook for U.S. equities remains positive, investors said.
Investors who do realize their capital gains now may find a hard time finding other attractive places to put it besides the equity market, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.

Thursday's sell-off is ""not anything that is going to be a long-term disincentive to buy stocks,"" he said.

Should investors buy the dip or is this a new bear market? Taylor Dart makes the case for buying the dip.It’s been a volatile two months for the Nasdaq-100 Index (QQQ), but after a sharp double-digit decline, the index has regained its footing and is knocking on the door of new all-time highs. Unfortunately, while several growth names have pulled back considerably from their highs, there is little value out there, with valuations among growth stocks and the indexes sitting at or near record levels. However, these are two names that are out of favor that have been consolidating for several months, and both are now trading at very reasonable valuations. These two names are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Netflix (NFLX), and both look like great buy-the-dip candidates.
(Source: TC2000.com)
While several high-octane growth names have seen a relentless bid under them since the election, NFLX and AMD have taken a back-seat, with AMD underperforming since its Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) acquisition and NFLX seeing muted returns based on fears that a return to normal activity after COVID-19 would weigh on subscriber growth. In the former case, the deal is finally near closing which should help the stock regain its momentum. In the latter case, NFLX just came off a much weaker quarter than anticipated, with net streaming additions coming in at just ~4MM, down from guidance of ~6MM. While this is obviously a disappointment, it does not affect the long-term picture for the stock, which remains quite bullish. This long-term outlook includes significantly higher free cash flow, continued margin expansion with higher prices, and the fact that competition or not, there is a very big pie for all streaming companies as the shift from cable to streaming options continues. Let’s take a closer look at NFLX below:

This incredible recovery has occurred despite the fact that gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) remains in negative territory for the year, suggesting that we could see a large rally ahead for miners if gold can regain its momentum. While many investors are likely nervous about jumping in miners here after a 3-week rally, it’s important to note that many miners are still very reasonably valued, and there are a select few that look like solid buy-the-dip candidates. We’ll take a look at three of these names below, highlighting what makes them special amongst their peers:

The safest way to gain leverage to the price of gold is the GDX, but with several names unable to post positive returns over a 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year basis, many laggards often drag down the index and weigh on its performance. This means that for those willing to do their research or select the top-tier names, one can gain leverage on the index without having ones’ performance partially tied to the serial underperformers within the group. In this update, we’ll look at three stand-out names with exceptional business models, pay competitive dividend yields, and have mines in predominantly safe jurisdictions. These three companies are Newmont (NEM), SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM), and Alamos Gold (NYSE:AGI), with two being intermediate producers (400,000 plus ounces of production per annum) and one being the largest producer in the world.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Mutual fund manager Friess Associates is challenging its firing by asset manager Affiliated Managers Group (NYSE:AMG) and is asking investors to reject the proposed transfer of more than $1 billion in funds to its successors, according to a regulatory filing made on Thursday.
Friess Associates, which managed Brandywine Funds on Affiliated Managers Group's (AMG) platform since 2013, filed preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reuters reported the firm's plans before the filing, which protests the firm's firing and points out that investors had no say in the termination.
The filing lays the groundwork for a fight in the normally staid mutual fund industry, pitting AMG, a publicly traded asset manager valued at $6.5 billion that invests $716 billion in assets, against one of its subadvisers, Friess Associates, a nearly 50-year old investment firm specializing in fast-growing U.S. stocks.
""AMG Funds’ board of trustees acted in the best interests of shareholders in taking action to lower management fees and offer a high-quality, more differentiated lineup of funds,"" an AMG spokesman said on Thursday.
Friess Associates built the Brandywine brand into a magnet for conservative investors who wanted capital preservation plus solid returns.
Last month, the relationship between Friess Associates and AMG ended when AMG fired Friess as the subadviser on the AMG Managers Brandywine Fund and the AMG Brandywine Blue Fund. The two funds have each returned an average 11% a year over their lifetime, beating both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average returns.
The combined Brandywine assets of $1.16 billion have been assigned to other managers on the AMG platform. Investors in the funds, now called the AMG Boston Common Global Impact Fund and the AMG Veritas Global Real Return Fund, will be asked to approve or reject the move at a May 18 special meeting.
AMG filed its proxy statement on April 9, explaining Friess was removed as part of a ""strategic repositioning of the AMG Funds complex"" so that all portfolios are managed by an AMG affiliate subadviser. AMG also removed other unaffiliated subadvisers including DoubleLine Capital, Fairpointe Capital and Loomis Sayles.
In its filing AMG laid out the amount of fees that will be paid. The Global Impact Fund's net expense ratio will be cut to 0.93% from 1.11% and the management fee for the fund will be cut to 0.73% from 0.88%. Previously Friess received 0.78% of the 0.88%. Boston Common will now receive 0.44% of the 0.73%, leaving a bigger chunk for AMG.
The Global Real Return fund's net expense ratio will be cut to 1.16% from 1.17%. The fund will pay a fee of 0.88% of its daily net assets to the investment manager. Previously, Friess received 0.78% of that while Veritas will now receive 0.57% of the total. The remainder goes to AMG. 
“The Investment Manager appears to benefit more from the fee changes than fund shareholders,” Friess said.
AMG said in the regulatory filing made earlier in April that if shareholders fail to approve the move, the funds may be liquidated.
But Friess Associates said that investors are being harmed because their money is no longer being managed the way it was when they first invested. 
The Global Impact Fund follows an ESG mandate and the Global Real Return Fund follows a real return strategy including short positions in global index futures.
As a result, many investors will be hit with higher taxed short-term gains, Friess said.

Considering their fundamental strength and near-term growth prospects, we think  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), V.F. Corporation (VFC), Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), and Burberry (BURBY) now look significantly overvalued. So, it’s wise to avoid these stocks.After suffering a major setback from a near halt in store sales and strong competition from existing e-commerce players in the first half of last year, many retail companies have now adopted online platforms and efficient delivery mechanisms to stay afloat. Now that the economy is reopening, these companies’ brick and mortar stores sales have started recovering too. Furthermore, the $1,400 direct stimulus checks paid out by the federal government have contributed to a favorable backdrop for retailers through increased consumer spending.
These factors have buoyed investors’ optimism about the retail space over the past few months. This is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 70.5% returns over the past six months versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 21.4% gains over this period.
However, many retail stocks have moved too far too fast based solely on investor optimism, and their financials and growth prospects don’t justify their current price levels. With weak fundamentals and growth prospects, Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU), V.F. Corporation (VFC), Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL), and Burberry Group plc (OTC:BURBY) currently look overvalued. So, we think they are best avoided now.

Conversely, we think Wood’s investments in Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:FATE) and  Twist Bioscience Corporation  (TWST) may have a long journey before they can launch their products commercially. So, we believe they are best avoided now.Renowned investor and manager of the world’s largest actively traded ETF company Cathie Wood has been an advocate of the genomics industry for a long time. In a CNBC interview, Wood stated that she views a genomic revolution and fintech growth as two potential industry disruptive trends in 2021, following the electric vehicle (EV) industry boom last year. DNA sequencing has been making breakthrough progress in recent years and is expected to eventually lead to cures for virtually all critical diseases. In this regard, Wood said, “We’re going to be able to cure diseases that we never thought it would be possible to cure, including cancer.”
The biotech industry’s business resiliency and degree of medical innovation were revealed over the past year. Investors poured capital into pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms, which are now leveraging abundant capital funds and advanced technology to make significant progress on critical ailment treatments. Companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) and Incyte Corporation (INCY) have been releasing positive data from clinical trials over the past couple of months, which is driving favorable revenue and earnings growth estimates. Given this backdrop, Wood’s Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) has gained 133.4% over the past year, and 30.1% over the past six months.
While the biotech industry is expected to redefine healthcare standards over the long term, many companies have been making only minor, current advancements in the field. Consequently, it may take a long time for such companies to generate acceptable profits from their drug pipelines. This is because significant investment and technical prowess is required for these companies to develop their drug candidates for commercial use. While Wood has ample funding to hold such stocks until they deliver decent results, retail investors might not have that capacity. Thus, we think some companies held by ARKG, such as Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (FATE) and Twist Bioscience Corporation (TWST), which are currently operating in their preliminary research stages, are best avoided until they release verified data demonstrating progress on their respective drug developments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - While it's still early in the earnings period, a record percentage of first-quarter profit reports from major U.S. companies are coming in above analysts' expectations. 
Earnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows, but many companies were holding off on giving guidance, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year. Some strategists say stronger-than-expected earnings could help underpin the market even as valuations are considered expensive.
With results in from 110 of the S&P 500 companies as of Thursday, 85.5% have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings per share, according to Refinitiv's data. If that trend continues through the reporting season, it would be the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994.
An average of 78% of companies have beaten earnings estimates in the past four quarters.
Stronger-than-expected results from major banks and other companies have driven up the forecast for the quarter. Earnings are now expected to have risen 33.3% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with 24.2% at the start of the month, based on Refinitiv's data.
That's expected to be the highest quarterly profit growth since 2010 following the financial crisis.
To be sure, the S&P 500 is up less than 1% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked into high gear. Wall Street fell Thursday as sources said U.S. President Joe Biden will propose raising taxes on the wealthy next week to fund about $1 trillion in investments. 
A resurgence of coronavirus cases globally added to investor worries.
Also, earlier this week, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) said slower production of TV shows and movies during the pandemic hurt subscriber growth in the first quarter, and its shares dropped sharply.
Despite some high-profile disappointments, ""the momentum for corporate earnings looks positive,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer global wealth management at UBS AG, wrote in a note this week.

""Overall the U.S. earnings season has got off to a strong start.""

Investing.com – The Dow fell sharply Thursday on reports President Biden is considering a major capital gains tax hike on the rich.
Biden is reportedly contemplating almost doubling the capital gains tax hike up to 39.6% on higher income earner to fund child care and education proposals included in his so-called American Family Plan. 
The news rattled investor sentiment and dragged stocks further into the red, overshadowing another wave corporate earnings.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) fell 1.6% after it estimated that it could achieve break-even by June, underpinned by strong leisure travel bookings into the summer months. The upbeat guidance offset mixed quarterly results as revenue fell short of estimates.

Equifax (NYSE:EFX) reported first-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its share price rose 15% higher.
The wave of mostly bullish corporate earnings come in the wake of a surge in cases globally that has cooled expectations over a faster reopening. India reported a record one-day surge in cases on Thursday.
In the U.S., however, Covid-19 cases continue to trend lower, with President Joe Biden confirming the country has achieved its 200 million vaccines milestone.

Investing.com -- Markets tumbled after Joe Biden appeared ready to make good on his promise to hike taxes on the rich.
Biden is reportedly contemplating almost doubling the capital gains tax hike up to 39.6% to fund child care and education proposals included in his so-called American Family Plan.
Lower stocks came amid strong earnings, but also an apparent slowdown in the reopening. And not all countries are recovering equally: India reported a record one-day surge in cases on Thursday.
Economic data has remained optimistic, with fewer people than expected filing for unemployment last week.  
Many more earnings from various sectors are coming in today and tomorrow. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Chips ahoy
Keep an eye on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares in the wake of earnings after the bell Thursday. The company has already laid out its big factory and foundry plans, and said it expects to beat on revenue and EPS. So it's all about the forecast.
2. Toilet paper and more earnings
Also likely to move are some of the bigger names reporting ahead of the bell on Friday. Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) are all due. All are expected to post lower profit and growth from a year ago.
3. New home sales

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration said on Thursday it is moving to withdraw a Trump administration rule that sought to bar states from setting vehicle emissions rules or set zero emission vehicle mandates.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was proposing to revoking the Trump rule issued in September 2019.
If finalized, the Trump rule ""would no longer be a potential barrier to states implementing tough greenhouse gas and zero emission vehicle regulations,"" the agency said.
After formal publication, it will be open for public comment for 30 days and then revocation could be made final.
About two dozen U.S. states filed suit to block a pair of Trump actions that sought to remove California from vehicle emissions regulations. Those court challenges are pending.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to move by next week to begin the process of restoring California's waiver under the Clean Air Act, the landmark federal law to combat air pollution, to set its own emissions rules that was also revoked under Trump.
The EPA in 2013 granted California a waiver for its tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions and zero emission vehicle regulations and in tandem with the NHTSA 2019 rule revoked it under Trump.
""It’s time to put California’s waiver back in its box,” then EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in 2019.
NHTSA and EPA are separately reviewing the Trump administration's March 2020 rule that finalized a rollback of U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama administration rules it discarded.

During the campaign, Biden vowed to ""establish ambitious fuel economy standards"" and to negotiate them with workers, environmentalists, automakers and states. Biden directed the agencies to issue a proposal by July on new standards.

And as 5G deployment picks up speed, we believe Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) are now solid bets. Let’s discuss these names.The increased adoption of 5G technology in several technology areas, such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) have been spurring the demand for 5G solutions globally. Currently, the industry enjoys favorable investor sentiment, as evidenced by the Vanguard Communication Services ETF’s (VOX) 67.8% returns over the past year, compared to the S&P 500’s 52.4% gains over this period.
Given the increased speed and connectivity offered by 5G, companies are increasingly investing in the development of 5G core services. Also, with consumers spending more time at home, a substantial increase in the use of phones and other connected devices should also lead to increased demand for 5G products. The global market for 5G Technology is expected to grow at a CAGR of 70.8% over the next four years to reach $700 billion by 2025.
Because 5G technology adoption is going mainstream quickly, we think it could be wise to bet now on Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO) and Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS) because they are well positioned to capitalize on the trend.

This is likely to continue to push certain semiconductor stocks higher in Q2.A global shortage of semiconductors is having negative ramifications on many industries. Just this week  Ford Motor Co . (NYSE:F) warned that they could miss out on $1 billion to $2.5 billion in sales because of the chip deficit. However, this situation has been a boon to the semiconductor industry and many chip stocks. Through the first three months of the year, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) was up 11.8%, compared to the S&P 500's 5.8% gain.
The demand for chips was already high due to the rollout of 5G. Still, demand skyrocketed as millions of people were forced to stay at home due to the pandemic. Suddenly, sales of laptops and gaming consoles soared. And now that automobile manufacturers have reopened their plants, the demand for semiconductors has exploded with not enough chips to go around.
These shortages reflect a tight supply, but not a lack of demand, which means the chip rally should continue into summer. As the market has been retreating in recent days, it provides an opportunity to pick up chip stocks on the dip. That is why I am recommending two Buy-rated semiconductors that should see their shares rise in the months ahead:  Intel Corp . (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dived on Thursday on reports President Joe Biden planned to almost double the capital gains tax, but analysts said the news was an excuse to take profits in a listless market ahead of big tech's earnings next week.
The three main indexes on Wall Street were trending slightly lower when Bloomberg reported Biden also planned to raise income taxes for the wealthy, a proposal some said would be hard to pass in Congress.
""If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.
Biden will propose raising the marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and nearly double taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, sources told Reuters.
Markets have been listless as investors await guidance from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) when they report earnings next week, Hayes said.
""Until we get out of this information vacuum the market is going to be generally directionless,"" he said. ""All that really matters moving forward is what are those big tech earnings next week?""
Earlier in the session the S&P 500 healthcare sector hit a fresh record high while industrials were the biggest gainers. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co reported smaller-than-expected quarterly losses, signaling a revival in travel demand. Both shares fell, with American down 3.3% and Southwest 0.2%. 
Investors welcomed data showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to a fresh one-year low. The Labor Department report suggested layoffs were subsiding and expectations were rising for another month of blockbuster job growth in April.
Separately, data showed U.S. home sales fell to a seven-month low in March, as an acute property shortage boosted prices and made owning a house more expensive for some first-time buyers.
The speedy U.S. vaccination rollout has improved the economic outlook as people plan summer vacations or spending on leisure activities, while giving a solid start to the first-quarter earnings season.
However, a surge in COVID-19 cases in India and elsewhere in Asia has kept investors anxious, Hayes said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.89%, the S&P 500 lost 0.78% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.74%.
Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to post a drop in first-quarter revenue later in the day, with analysts looking forward to updates on its U.S. manufacturing plants and chips for automakers amid a global microchip supply shortage. Its shares fell 1.1%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 83 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 16 new lows.

Among several reasons for this switch, investors are primarily positioning themselves to reap the benefits of an anticipated economic recovery by betting on undervalued cyclical stocks. Given the solid growth prospects of undervalued stocks, we think it could be wise to bet now on value ETFs Vanguard ETF (VBR), iShares S&P ETF (IVE), iShares Russell ETF (IWN), and iShares MSCI ETF (VLUE). Read on for details.Value investing is one of Wall Street's most popular strategies. That’s because it's one of the most lucrative options for long-term investors. And value exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow investors to buy a basket of value stocks with a single investment, offering diversification and reducing risks. With 73 ETFs traded in the U.S. markets, value ETFs have $328.54 billion in total assets under management. These funds’ average expense ratio is 0.34%.
While growth investing proved to be more profitable than value investing over the past decade, the current, impending, economic recovery positions value stocks well to outperform their growth counterparts. That’s because the shares of many quality companies became undervalued thanks to a temporary pause in their businesses amid the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent shift in investors’ attention away from them. Now, as the economy enters a recovery phase, investors are rotating away from pricey growth stocks to quality bargains. This is evidenced by the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 13.5% returns so far this year versus the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 9.1% gains.
As such, we think investing in the following value ETFs could now be rewarding: Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund ETF Shares (VBR), iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE), iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN), and iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE).

(Reuters) -U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Thursday signaled slower cash burn and pointed to a rebound in summer bookings as accelerated COVID-19 vaccinations make more people confident about traveling again.
After nearly a year in the doldrums due to the pandemic, airlines are seeing light at the end of the tunnel with over 50% of the U.S. population having received one dose of the vaccine. 
""March was clearly a significant improvement over January and February and guidance is for continued improvement into the June quarter and the summer beyond it,"" Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker said.
Southwest forecast second-quarter average daily core cash burn between $2 million and $4 million, compared with about $13 million per day in the prior quarter. It expects second-quarter capacity to rise about 90% from a year earlier. 
""In a normal year, at this point, we would expect to be around 60% booked for May roughly 35% or so booked for June and around 20% booked for July,"" Southwest President Thomas Nealon said. 
""We are currently in the hunt with those levels of bookings.""
American said average daily cash burn slowed to $4 million in March, while its overall average daily cash burn rate was about $27 million in the first quarter.
American sees capacity to be down between 20% and 25% compared with 2019, slowing from a 35% fall in the previous quarter.
Southwest shares were up about 1%, while American Airlines stock was down about 1.8%.
American has a bigger exposure to international travel, which is not expected to rebound soon as most borders remained closed, analysts have said.
""I know (the Biden administration) understands the importance of restoring international travel to the economy,"" American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said. 
""We all need to go look at this in a risk-based way. No one wants to rush for certain, and no one's pushing that either.""
Southwest is recalling some furloughed pilots and flight attendants, while American plans to do it later this year to prepare for 2022.

Meanwhile, operating revenue at the companies fell more than 50%, slower than the about 65% fall in the fourth quarter.
 Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group also forecast improving cash flow from operations after reporting a smaller-than-expected loss.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday named former federal prosecutor Alex Oh as its new head of enforcement, the first woman of color to lead the division, which plays a crucial role in policing U.S. financial markets. 
The appointment of Oh, a native of Seoul who moved to Maryland when she was 11, is the first big move under Chair Gary Gensler and comes amid a diversity push by President Joe Biden's administration.
Oh, who most recently worked for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison Llp in Washington, has extensive trial experience and was previously an assistant U.S. attorney in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. She has also done pro bono work on issues relating to voting restrictions and attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.
""I am committed to working tirelessly to uncover and prosecute violations of the law, whether by businesses or their leaders, so that we can keep American capital markets the strongest in the world,"" Oh said in a statement. 
Oh's return to government comes as the SEC has begun probing the frenzied marketplace for blank-check acquisition companies and has targeted climate risk as a focus for its enforcement unit. The agency is also expected to ratchet up scrutiny of cryptocurrencies.
The new SEC leadership is expected to usher in a tougher regulatory regime for Wall Street. As chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Gensler oversaw the prosecution of big investment banks for rigging Libor, the benchmark for trillions of dollars in lending worldwide. 

""Our capital markets – and the broader economy – thrive when there are clear rules of the road and a cop on the beat to enforce them,"" Gensler said in Thursday's statement.

According to Fitch Ratings, “Passage of an infrastructure bill would be a credit positive for U.S. buildings material issuers but financial implications will depend on the actual size of the bill and take time to materialize.”
Investor interest in this space can be partly evidenced by the SPDR Homebuilders ETF’s (XHB) 28.3% returns so far this year, compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 11.3% gains over this period.
The industry’s prospects look bright worldwide. With mass vaccination drives gradually containing the spread of the virus, increasing activity in the commercial, infrastructure, and residential segments is likely. The global building materials market is expected to grow to $343 billion in 2025 from $272 billion in 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. senators are working to attach legislation to allow automakers to deploy tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles on U.S. roads to a bipartisan China bill, a significant reform that could help speed the commercial use of automated vehicles.
Senators Gary Peters, a Democrat, and John Thune, a Republican, have circulated a draft amendment seen by Reuters that would grant the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the power to initially exempt 15,000 self-driving vehicles per manufacturer from safety standards written with human drivers in mind. The figure would rise to 80,000 within three years.
The pair hope to win Senate Commerce Committee approval for their amendment on Wednesday when the panel takes up a bill to provide $100 billion in funding for science and technology research and development over concerns about maintaining U.S. competitiveness with China.
The amendment would also allow self-driving companies to disable human driving controls in vehicles when in full self-driving mode.
The amendment comes as concerns grow about a series of crashes involving Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) driver assistance system Autopilot that handles some driving tasks but does not make a vehicle autonomous.
The bill says ""the United States risks losing its technological leadership in the autonomous vehicle industry, which is a global market opportunity worth an estimated $8 trillion, unless it enacts policies to protect its leadership against the People's Republic of China and other competitors.""
Peters, who chairs a subcommittee overseeing NHTSA, said in a statement the amendment will ""ensure that the innovation and testing around autonomous vehicles can continue happening safely under the watchful eye of the Department of Transportation.""
Thune and Peters have been working for four years to try to win congressional approval to make it easier to deploy self-driving vehicles.
""Providing the automotive industry with the tools they need to safely test and deploy automated vehicles across the nation will create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in investment, not to mention the numerous safety benefits that AVs have the potential to provide,"" Thune said in a statement.
But the effort has faced opposition from some including the American Association for Justice, which represents trial lawyers, who argue the bill does not have enough safeguards to protect consumers rights.
Any bill ""must include language preserving Americans' rights as they currently stand,"" the association told senators in a letter seen by Reuters. ""Having the right to file a case in a public court of law incentivizes companies to act in the interest of public safety, and nowhere is this more important than within an emerging market in which the technology is new and largely untested."" 
After four years, manufacturers could ask NHTSA to expand the exemptions beyond 80,000.

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving unit Waymo and other automakers for years have urged Congress to make changes to facilitate the deployment of self-driving cars won U.S. roads. Current law allows NHTSA to exempt up to 2,500 vehicles per manufacturer.
Thune said opponents ""should understand that our amendment is about bolstering US technological leadership to ensure we stay ahead of China in development, manufacturing, and deployment of AVs.""

Investing.com – Qualtrics (NASDAQ:XM) was up by more than 25% in Thursday’s session on upgrades by several analysts, enthused by the company reporting strong earnings and forecasting an even better June quarter.
Qualtrics makes software that helps companies engage better with their consumers and employees.  
Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin raised Qualtrics to overweight with a target of $49, which translates into an upside potential of a little over 15% from the stock’s present level of $42.48. He cited the company's growth potential and a favorable risk-reward ratio as reasons behind his optimism.
BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman raised the stock to outperform with a target of $45, as he expects “very strong” demand for the firm’s offerings as the economy improves.
Deutsche's Patrick Colville attributed his belief in the stock to the company’s strong competitive positioning. Colville has a target of $43 for the stock.
Co-headquartered in Seattle, Washington and Provo, Utah, Qualtrics raised its outlook for 2021 on Wednesday.
It now expects January-December total revenue to come between $980 million and $984 million, compared to an earlier forecast of $950 million to $954 million given on March 9.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday said 106 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplanes have been grounded worldwide by an electrical issue and said the U.S. planemaker is still working on a fix.
Boeing disclosed an electrical power system issue on April 7 and recommended operators temporarily remove these airplanes from service. 
The problem involved the electrical grounding - or connections designed to maintain safety in the event of a surge of voltage - inside a backup power control system. The FAA said Thursday ""subsequent analysis and testing showed the issue could involve additional systems.""
The FAA said in a formal notice to international air regulators that 106 airplanes are covered, including 71 registered in the United States. ""All of these airplanes remain on the ground while Boeing continues to develop a proposed fix,"" the agency added.
The FAA said Boeing's investigation showed the issue could impact the standby power control unit, a circuit breaker panel and main instrument panel.
The notice said the ""FAA expects to issue an airworthiness directive mandating corrective action before further flight for all affected airplanes.""
Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said ""we concur with the FAA notice and continue to work closely with the regulator and our customers to address the issue.""
The top three U.S. 737 MAX operators - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines - removed more than 60 jets from service following the notice from Boeing.
U.S. carriers said they expect the issue will be resolved soon, potentially in the next week or two. American Airlines President Robert Isom said ""we have a pretty good idea of exactly what the issue is and the remedies that need to be attended to.""
The FAA said other carriers impacted include Cayman Airways, Copa Airlines, GOL Linhas Aereas, Iceland Air, Minsheng Leasing, Neos Air, Shanding Airlines, SilkAir, Spice Jet, Sunwing Airlines, TUI, Turkish Airlines, Valla Jets Limited, WestJet Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.

The FAA said it ""verified all operators with affected airplanes have voluntarily taken those aircraft out of service."" 
The FAA said the production issue ""is not related to recertification of the flight control system on the 737 MAX, ungrounding of the aircraft, or its return to service."" Boeing has delivered more than 450 MAX airplanes.

By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Even as new setbacks cloud their path to recovery, airline bosses are focusing on the lasting impact of COVID-19 on premium travel, technology and other pillars of their business.
Aviation leaders, forced to gather virtually by the pandemic, have been gauging its longer-term fallout at the World Aviation Festival, after more than a year of lockdowns.
Drawing many top executives and thousands of participants, this week's event comes as doubts over the northern summer vacation season renew scrutiny of airlines' cash and their ability to withstand another washout. 
The addition of France, Britain and 114 other states to the U.S. ""Do Not Travel"" list has also cast a pall.
""There will be a lot of carriers that will not make it through,"" Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith said, citing nameless rivals that were ""not viable prior to the crisis"".
For survivors like state-backed Air France-KLM, market consolidation would be welcome, Smith said, adding: ""Even if it takes longer than planned for traffic to return, with a reduction in capacity that's a good balance for us"".
Air France-KLM expects to need more capital following a 10.4 billion euro ($12.5 billion) bailout in 2020 and 1 billion-euro share issue this week. Long-haul juggernaut Emirates may also need to raise more cash within months, the Gulf carrier's President Tim Clark said during the event.
BUSINESS DECLINE
Despite the deep uncertainties, executives are looking beyond the pandemic to anticipate underlying shifts.
High on the list is a structural slump in business travel as many future meetings - if not airline conferences - stay online.
""A large percentage of this traffic will not come back on long-haul,"" aviation consultant John Strickland predicted, as companies curb travel costs and carbon emissions.
""You can't beat face-to-face in many business situations,"" he said. ""However a big amount can be cut.""
That will hit yields, or fare levels, Clark and his Virgin Atlantic counterpart Shai Weiss acknowledged, although the Emirates boss expects leisure customers to fill business cabins.
""If you drop (fares) by 15% or 20% they will come to business,"" Clark said. Such customers are ""not quite as good as the corporate segments were, but hey ho, you take what you can get and you fill your aircraft."" 
The pandemic has sped efforts by airlines and airports to integrate digital passenger services, information and document checks, while the race is on to deploy ""contactless"" processes and digital health passes with COVID-19 vaccination and test certificates.
DIGITAL DRIVE
EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said digital platform upgrades hurriedly deployed to cope with last year's flood of flight cancellations and refund claims were now among post-crisis ""silver linings"".
""Cost bases have been reset"" after the low-cost carrier invested in ""self-service"" capabilities for its booking system, he said. Airlines that have used the crisis for digital upgrades ""will come out of this in a more efficient way.""
Even with traffic around 10% of pre-crisis levels, airports have warned that COVID-19 paperwork and test results are already clogging ""pinch points"" in check-in and boarding, despite full staffing.
Without swift digitisation of processes including test and vaccine checks, airports could be overwhelmed by a traffic uptick as soon as May, said Emiliano Sorrenti, chief information and technology officer at Aeroporti di Roma, which operates the Italian capital's Fiumicino and Ciampino airports.
""When we reach just 50% of (pre-crisis) passengers, will we be able to cope with those numbers given the new regulations?"" he said. Fully seamless services that now seem far off will rapidly become a ""mandatory level of automation"", he expects.
Vaccination setbacks and concern over COVID-19 variants suggest airports may have a little longer to prepare.
Global airline body IATA this week cut its traffic forecast to reflect a weaker international travel outlook, despite domestic rebounds in U.S. and China.
But Clark, who has put off his retirement to pilot Emirates through the crisis, remained upbeat about the recovery opportunities awaiting his eventual successor.
""We are, dare I say it, on the threshold of something really good here,"" he said. ""Once this pandemic is over.""

Investing.com – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares were flat Thursday but Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said the current estimated 34% year-on-year revenue growth is too conservative.
Analyst Brent Thill raised his price target to $360 from $350 earlier while retaining buy rating on the stock.
Thill’s target is nearly 20% higher from the stock’s current level of $301. 
The analyst believes the stock holds potential for upside surprises, citing several reasons for his optimism. According to him, advertising spending on social platforms is ahead of original plans while a reviving economy is driving companies to spend more on branding.
Also, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) proposed privacy settings in iOS14, changes that could hurt Facebook, haven’t yet been implemented.
Apple’s planned privacy update will inform users about the apps tracking them and ask them if they approve of it.
Facebook is against the changes. The social media giant wants to continue to show Apple users personalized ads, like it does now with them and Android phone users.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has defused a row over the future of a factory in southern Spain, but the  Cadiz  (NASDAQ:CDZI) plant and its 300 jobs remain on the ""critical"" list in a potential setback to completion of a company-wide restructuring, industry sources said.
Airbus on Wednesday cancelled long-deferred plans to sell two French and German units and announced a new proposal to hive off production of small mass-produced parts.
But it postponed any physical changes to a network of more than a dozen commercial jet factories in France, Germany, Britain and Spain, prompting Spanish unions to hail a reprieve for the Puerto Real plant in Cadiz, at least for now.
Unions and local politicians have been fighting to defend the plant since Airbus stopped building the A380 superjumbo. Workers in the robot-assisted plant had assembled the huge horizontal stabilizers for the world’s largest airliner.
Work there has also been disrupted by a drop in demand for other big jets like the A330 during the pandemic.
Tensions erupted earlier this year when a top German executive said the Airbus plant - one of two in Cadiz - was ""not competitive"". Hundreds of protesters gathered there this week.
Spanish unions are reluctant to complete negotiations on a broader Airbus coronavirus restructuring plan until Puerto Real’s future is settled, people familiar with the talks said.
On Wednesday, Airbus agreed to form a negotiating committee and unions said the company would examine new work for the plant from 2023.
""It...is certainly better than if they had announced the firm decision to close the plant and refused to open a dialogue,"" said Juan Antonio Vazquez of the UGT union.
Airbus said it was assessing Spanish operations ""from a workload perspective"" and wanted to ensure the viability and competitiveness of Cadiz. People close to the company said no decisions had been made on its future or its jobs, however.
SPANISH TENSIONS
The plant's fate illustrates the mounting stakes as Airbus battles to cut costs in the face of COVID-19 while preserving a decades-old, politically sensitive European industrial jigsaw.
Airbus is in the midst of shedding some 15,000 jobs but some in the industry have accused the company of avoiding tough choices about reducing factory footprint.
Sources close to Airbus say the changes are the start of a plan to prepare the next generation of jets at lower cost, but acknowledge political constraints on industrial plans in Europe.
Unemployment-stricken Cadiz is the latest irritant to see-saw relations between Airbus and Spain, which owns 4% of the group. Aerospace accounts for 7% of Spain’s industrial GDP.
Spain has long felt sidelined in Airbus, which it helped to found in 1970, and repeatedly clashed with former Airbus CEO Tom Enders over delays to the Seville-assembled A400M airlifter.
In 2019, his successor Guillaume Faury left Spain off a leaner Airbus executive committee following the retirement of Spain's top representative, industry veteran Fernando Alonso.
Tensions came to a head later that year when Spain spurned Airbus as its formal partner for a new European fighter.
But the pandemic has fostered direct contacts between Faury and Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and in July last year, the two sides held a summit that restored some calm.
Last week, Faury announced further management changes restoring Spanish representation on the prestigious committee, even as Spain gave up the management lead on military planes.
The Spanish appointee – new operations chief Alberto Gutierrez – is taking time to consider the fate of the Puerto Real plant as he juggles his new role with the sensitive post of head of the company’s Spanish operations, insiders said.

Airbus meanwhile said it had no immediate plans to review plants in Britain, but the absence of explicit commitments to the UK post-Brexit - versus pledges to other core nations - is widely seen as a signal that Britain will have to compete with other suppliers to maintain wing production on future jets.

The engineers tested Tesla Model Y this week as investigators probe an accident where two men died after their Tesla Model S, which was believed to be operating without anyone in the driver's seat, crashed into a tree on Saturday night north of Houston. 
Over several trips across half-mile closed test track, the Model Y automatically steered along painted lane lines, the magazine said.
""In our evaluation, the system not only failed to make sure the driver was paying attention, but it also couldn't tell if there was a driver there at all,"" said Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports' auto testing. 
""Tesla is falling behind other automakers like GM and Ford that, on models with advanced driver assist systems, use technology to make sure the driver is looking at the road.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The report also comes amid growing scrutiny over Tesla's semi-automated driving system following recent accidents and as it is preparing to launch its updated ""full self-driving"" software to more customers.

Tesla's Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel at times, but Tesla says its features ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

J&J has said the move is consistent with its long-term practices. 
The final results of the vote, including the total number of J&J investors who approved and rejected the pay arrangement, will be released in the coming days.
Gorsky also answered a question from an investor on the possible link between J&J's COVID-19 vaccine and a very rare but serious blood clot condition that led to a U.S. pause in its use.
He said the company was looking forward to a U.S. regulatory meeting and review of the issue scheduled for Friday

""We strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited reporting by healthcare professionals,"" Gorsky said. ""We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine.""

Investing.com – Ford Motor (NYSE:F) shares rose 3% Thursday on positive sentiment created by two brokerages upgrading it to a buy and setting higher price targets.
Under Wolfe Research analyst Rod Lache’s outperform, Ford’s share is seen at $15, a 25% increase from its current level of $12. He believes the company could get a re-rating soon, similar to the one experienced by General Motors (NYSE:GM) last year.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Emmanuel Rosner added Ford to a catalyst call buy list and now sees the stock at $13 from $12 earlier.
According to Wolfe’s Lache, analysts have ""clear reasons to gain confidence in the company’s terminal value, and growth.”
Lache sees Ford exiting manufacturing in South America by the end of this year, largely eliminating losses in Europe while significantly improving its performance in China.
“We expect Ford to lay out a plan to achieve competitive costs for EVs. And we also believe that Ford is positioned to set new benchmarks (amongst legacy OEMs) in vehicle architectures and internal software competency,” Lache wrote.
Deutsche’s Rosner believes that even if Ford lowers its full-year guidance due to second quarter production disruptions, “we would use any weakness in the stock post earnings as an opportunity to add to positions ahead of the company's investor day, expected later this spring.""
The company will release its first quarter earnings on April 28.
Announcing the fourth quarter 2020 earnings on February 4, Ford CFO John Lawler said the company was on course to earn $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes – including a $900 million non-cash gain on its investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian – and generate $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States, Norway and Britain joined forces with companies including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Nestle on Thursday to launch a project aimed at protecting the world's tropical forests.
Announcing the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition at the U.S.-convened Leaders Summit on climate, the public-private project aims to raise at least $1 billion in initial financing, it said.
Governments and companies taking part will pay countries with tropical and subtropical forests for emissions reductions, a move it hopes will help reduce and eventually end deforestation.
As the world looks to move quickly to a low-carbon economy to prevent catastrophic climate change, protecting the forests that help remove carbon from the atmosphere naturally is seen as a crucial step, but one that has so far largely failed. 
The pace of deforestation actually picked up in 2020, LEAF said, with data from Global Forest Watch showing a 12 percent increase from the prior year or more than 10 million hectares of primary tropical forest, roughly the size of Switzerland.
""The LEAF coalition is a groundbreaking example of the scale and type of collaboration that is needed to fight the climate crisis and achieve net-zero emissions globally by 2050,"" said U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.
""Bringing together government and private-sector resources is a necessary step in supporting the large-scale efforts that must be mobilized to halt deforestation and begin to restore tropical and subtropical forests."" 
Countries looking to take part in the programme will need to have the reduction in deforestation-linked emissions verified by a new, more rigorous standard assessed at the national level by an independent third party, the coalition said in a statement.
With applications due by July 2021 and the aim of signing contracts before the end of the year, payments would be based on emissions reductions linked to reducing levels of deforestation or degradation, or by restoring forests, between 2022 and 2026.
Companies looking to take part in the project will only be allowed to join if they can show a commitment to ""deep voluntary cuts"" in their own emissions, in line with science-based targets and the Paris Agreement on climate.
""Climate change is the greatest threat to our planet, and the LEAF coalition offers us an opportunity to bring together governments and companies to fight it,"" said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. 
""In uniting behind a common cause, the countries and companies of the coalition have a chance to end deforestation by 2030.""
Among other companies to sign up to the project are Airbnb, Boston Consulting Group, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), McKinsey, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and Unilever (NYSE:UL), although more are expected to join over time.

U.S. non-profit Emergent will oversee the administration of the project.

The bank has suspended its share buyback and cut dividend. Investors were also not impressed by Credit Suisse raising $2 billion to bolster its capital.

HAMBURG (Reuters) -Volkswagen is considering a change to its supervisory board that could lead to the replacement of Bernd Osterloh, the head of its powerful works council who clashed with CEO Herbert Diess last year, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Osterloh's departure, if confirmed, could weaken resistance to faster and more drastic restructuring at the German carmaker.
Last year, the 64-year-old opposed an attempt by Diess to extend his contract as the CEO strives to cut costs and free up resources to invest more in electric vehicles.
One source said Osterloh had been offered the position of personnel director at Traton, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s truck unit that was spun off and separately listed in 2019.
A second source said the group was considering proposing a new labour representative to its board, but did not give a name.
The company, its main shareholder Porsche SE and the works council declined to comment.
Five sources in total said Volkswagen would in the near future debate an important change in the composition of its supervisory board, adding no final decisions had been taken.
The move follows a surge in Volkswagen's shares, as investors warm to its efforts to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and become a world leader in electric cars.
The shares have risen by more than half in value so far this year, giving the company a market value of 132 billion euros ($159 billion).
Osterloh has been a member of Volkswagen's supervisory board since 2005. Labour representatives make up half the board, under Germany's system of corporate governance.
Should Osterloh leave the supervisory board, as would be required should he take up an executive role at Traton, the most likely candidate to replace him would be deputy works council head Daniela Cavallo, the sources said.

Any nomination would be subject to a confirmatory vote by shareholders at the annual meeting in July.

Tangen took the helm of the fund on Sept. 1 and the move would mark a departure as it has until now broadly tracked a global company reference index set by the finance ministry.
While the fund will continue to track the index, the fund's management, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), should be more selective when choosing stocks, Tangen said. 
""(NBIM) can do more on negative selection, get rid of things which are bad,"" Tangen, a former hedge fund manager, told a digital seminar.
The shift in approach comes as the government plans to cut the fund's company reference index by 25% to 30% to improve the fund's follow-up of firms. 
The move reflects the growing awareness among international investors about risk in the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) field. 
""The amazing example last year ... is how we were pretty much out of Wirecard when that thing exploded and it saved the fund an enormous amount of money,"" Tangen told the seminar, which was published on the fund's website.
""So through forensic accounting, through people who are specialists in discovering fraud, I think we can do more,"" he said.

The fund currently holds stakes in about 9,100 companies. The finance ministry has proposed that its reference index be cut to 6,600 companies from 8,800 now, leading to a reduction in the number of companies it invests in over time.

Investing.com – AT&T (NYSE:T) shares rose 4% Thursday as higher number of users and revenue gains in the March quarter helped outweigh concerns over the telecom and media giant’s debt.
The company said on Thursday it added 595,000 net wireless phone subscribers in the first quarter, more than double what analysts had expected. That helped nudge revenue higher by 2.7% at $43.9 billion versus $42.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue gains also came from growth in fiber-optic internet subscribers and its paid streaming service HBO Max.
Operating income was $7.7 billion versus $7.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, the company attributing the rise to higher revenue and lower amortization costs.
Wireless service revenue rose 0.6% at $14 billion as subscriber gains offset declines in international roaming revenues. The company said it continues to be comfortable with guidance of full-year wireless service revenue growth in the 2% range.
The company’s debt, which is a concern for most telecom operators given as they incur costs on buying spectrum at auction and then setting up networks, rose.
AT&T had to take on more in the last quarter to pay for spectrum. The debt rose by $21 billion to end the quarter at $169 billion. The net debt to Ebitda ratio deteriorated to 3.1x from 2.7x though the company managed to bring it down by 50 basis points.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The company expects to end the financial year around $154 billion in debt and a net debt to Ebitda ratio of 3x.

Investing.com – American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were both up in Thursday’s premarket following earnings updates that indicate better times for their sector as people look to get out and travel after a year of being locked in.
American Airlines reported its net loss fell to $1.3 billion in the March quarter from $2.2 billion in October-December. This was even as revenue remained unchanged at $4 billion.
The company’s total available cash of $17.3 billion at the end of the quarter was higher than its forecast of $15 billion liquidity and it said this could hit $19.5 billion by end of June, as cash flow improves with rising passenger numbers.
Southwest’s performance was even better as the airline managed to generate net income of $116 million for the quarter through March, after a net loss of $908 million for October-December.
For Southwest, total operating revenues rose by $100 million to $2.1 billion. It said it is in the process of adding flights in June, expects June available capacity to be only slightly less than June 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
While leisure travel bounces back, Southwest did warn “business travel is expected to have a significant negative impact on close-in demand and average passenger fares”.
That didn’t deter Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu from maintaining a ‘buy’ on Southwest. She has a target of $75 for the stock, representing upside potential of some 21% from its present price of $62.

Tecfidera generated sales of $3.84 billion in 2020, accounting for 28.5% of the company's total revenue, and Biogen has said it expects a ""financial reset"" in 2021 primarily due to the entry of the generics.

LONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks ground higher while oil ebbed on Thursday as investors diverged over whether to bet on economic recovery in the United States and other developed markets or worry about a surge in COVID-19 cases in India and elsewhere.
With vaccination rates rising and pandemic-weary citizens embracing more freedoms to drive growth in some major economies, MSCI's broadest global gauge of stocks was up 0.3%, trading within 1% of its all-time closing high after a recent mini sell-off.
""The summer earnings season will further test the trajectory of the recovery, but until then, vaccines rollout and economic reopening will be the main triggers for a further upside leg in this bull run,"" Amundi Chief Investment Officer Pascal Blanque said in a note to clients.
With the European Central Bank holding a policy meeting, Europe's top indexes posted stronger gains. The broad STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.5%, also bolstered by upbeat earnings from Nestle and Volvo.
""Markets are currently a tale of three Vs - standing at a crossroads of virus evolution, vaccination rates and v-shaped recoveries,"" Societe General cross-asset strategist Alain Bokobza wrote in a note to clients.
""Our overall stance is unchanged, i.e., no exuberance yet. Credit risk remains under control, so risk assets should continue to ride high... Stick to risk for now.""
The buoyant start to the European day followed overnight gains in Asia, where Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 2.4% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a marginally lower open on Wall Street, down 0.1% albeit within touching distance of a record high.
Despite stocks being generally upbeat, oil - another asset geared to perceptions of economic growth - fell after a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in India and Japan, and a recent surprise stock build in the United States, weighed on sentiment.
U.S. crude futures were down 0.5% at $61.04 per barrel while European benchmark Brent was down 0.6% at $64.95.
""An unexpected and high increase in U.S. inventories fuelled concerns over weak demand which came against expectations for a strong recovery in demand,"" said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.
""What is hurting market sentiment is also the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading again at a fast pace in India and Japan.""
U.S. Treasury yields stayed depressed but moved off intra-day lows, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes at 1.5644% on Thursday.
Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark of the euro area also dipped and was last trading flat at -0.26%.
In currency markets, the dollar last traded flat against a basket of major peers.
The euro was up 0.1% at $1.205, not far from its strongest since March 3. The common currency has gained as much as 3% against the dollar since the start of April. 
While the euro is expected to be little moved by the ECB meeting, with no change expected, traders will be looking out for positive words about the state of the economy and any hints that its bond purchases could be tapered. 
""The European Central Bank isn’t expected to ruffle any feathers this Thursday, with analysts predicting that it will be another steady session from Christine Lagarde and Co,"" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex.
""But with a while until the next meeting – the central bank skips May – the ECB could use this opportunity to sharpen its forward guidance. There are also hawks lurking among the doves, meaning the get-together may not go as smoothly as forecast.""

U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan meetings follow next week.
Against that backdrop, spot gold pulled back from its near-two-month high to trade down 0.5% at $1,785.3 an ounce.

460,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse to boost capital ahead of further Archegos hit,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will raise over $2 billion to strengthen its capital base after flagging a further hit from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos and a shrinking of the prime brokerage unit responsible for the multi-billion dollar debacle.
The demise of Archegos and another major client, British finance firm Greensill, have plunged Credit Suisse into crisis, triggering losses, sackings and bonus cuts at a time when rivals are revelling in bumper profit from trading and dealmaking.
In a further blow for Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, Switzerland's financial regulator has opened enforcement proceedings against the bank over how it handled the risks around Archegos and Greensill. 
Credit Suisse said it expects a hit of about 600 million Swiss francs ($655.81 million) for the April-June quarter after exiting most of its Archegos-related positions. A 4.4 billion hit in January-March wiped out what would have been a stellar trading period, leaving it with a slightly smaller-than-flagged pre-tax loss of 757 million francs.
Its shares fell 5.7%, with analysts pointing to the further Archegos hit and dilution caused by the issuance announced on Thursday of bonds convertible into 203 million shares.
Credit Suisse was the bank hardest-hit from exposure to Archegos, a U.S. based family office which collapsed when it could not meet margin calls on its heavily leveraged stock bets.
In response, the bank is cutting its prime brokerage business, which caters to hedge fund clients, by about a third.
Credit Suisse's shares are down over 20% so far this year and the scandals have wiped out the 50% gain its stock had clocked up since November 2020, when optimism around vaccines and a new U.S. administration buoyed European financials.
For a graphic on Credit Suisse:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznvnaqorpl/Pasted%20image%201619085710457.png
""The loss we report this quarter, because of (the Archegos) matter, is unacceptable,"" Gottstein said.
The Archegos blowup came weeks after Credit Suisse had to suspend investment funds linked to Greensill, creating a double whammy for Gottstein whose appointment at the end of 2019 was meant to signal a new era of calm after a spying scandal felled his predecessor Tidjane Thiam.
Switzeland's financial regulator, which is still investigating the spying controversy, said it had ordered several short-term measures to reduce the bank's risk exposure and had requested a suspension of some bonus payments.
Credit Suisse's new bond issuance will boost the bank's core capital level to around 13% from 12.2%, a level its chief financial officer said he had recommended the bank operate at ""for the foreseeable future"" and higher than its previous guidance.
ONGOING TROUBLES
U.S. rivals, which were quicker to exit trading positions as Archegos collapsed, produced forecast-beating profit for the first quarter. Net income at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) rose nearly six-fold.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) disclosed an almost $1 billion loss from Archegos yet reported a 150% profit jump.
Stripping out the 4.4 billion franc first-quarter hit from Archegos and other significant items, Credit Suisse said pre-tax profit would have been 3.6 billion francs, which would have represented its best quarter operationally in at least a decade.
Highlighting the strong environment, Credit Suisse posted bumper earnings in its Asia-Pacific unit, up 154% year-on-year, and a 25% pre-tax profit rise in its Swiss business - the only two divisions unscathed by the recent Archegos and Greensill episodes.
While Gottstein has been grappling with limiting the damage to the bank's reputation and retaining both clients and staff, broader strategic initiatives have remained pending until incoming Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio takes over on April 30.
Analysts expect the troubles - which have hit the bank's capital reserves - to impact earnings in future quarters, as lower capital reserves may limit risk appetite and impact staff and client relationships.
The bank on Thursday said it had cut compensation and benefit costs by 5% year-on-year, or 109 million francs on an adjusted basis. That represented a fraction of a massive drop in bonus accruals media had previously reported.
""In terms of employee retention (and compensation), we need to walk a balance. If we'd chose to increase compensation accruals this quarter after the bank has made a loss, I don't think that would be really acceptable to shareholders, frankly,"" CFO David Mathers told Reuters.
""That's understood by everybody at the bank. But clearly, there's the rest of the year to play for, and we'll see how performance goes and accrue accordingly,"" he said.
Investment banking posted a $2.6 billion pre-tax loss, as a 29% leap in fixed income sales and trading, 23% leap in equity sales and trading revenue, and much larger gains in capital markets and advisory failed to offset the huge hit from Archegos that the unit recorded.
Its asset management unit, which ran the $10 billion in funds linked to Greensill, saw profit dip 30% as a rise in managed assets failed to stop ""significant items"" pulling down revenue.
The unit, which is undergoing an overhaul, was already a source of trouble in the fourth quarter, when it was hit with a half-billion dollar impairment on a stake in another U.S. investment fund.
In April, it said it had identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds.
Data from researcher Morningstar estimated asset flows into Credit Suisse's Europe-domiciled fund range dropped in March, the month it announced the suspension of Greensill-linked funds.
Total net assets and the market share of actively managed funds also fell, Morningstar estimates showed. That compared with an increase across the broader European market.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Southwest expects lower cash burn as vaccines drive leisure travel rebound,"(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co on Thursday posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly adjusted loss and forecast lower cash burn in the second quarter as rising vaccination rates and pent-up demand for leisure travel signal an ""optimistic summer"".
U.S. airlines are preparing for a rebound in summer bookings after nearly a year in the doldrums due to the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying travel restrictions.
""Vaccinations are on the rise, and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States are down significantly from their peak in January 2021,"" said Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly.
""As a result, we are experiencing steady weekly improvements in domestic leisure bookings.""
The company said it was adding flights and expects second-quarter capacity to rise about 90% from a year earlier, but about 15% below 2019 levels, when air travel was not hit by the COVID-19 crisis.
Second-quarter average core cash burn is expected to be between $2 million and $4 million per day, Southwest said, compared with about $13 million per day in the previous three months.
Southwest said it expects to achieve break-even average core cash flow or better by June.
Excluding items, the Dallas-based company reported a net loss of $1.02 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $77 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total operating revenue fell 51.5% to $2.05 billion.

Analysts on average had expected Southwest to report a loss of $1.85 per share and revenue $2.07 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

State-owned Etihad is targeting to return profit in 2023 as part of a five-year restructuring plan that it has accelerated during the pandemic that has crippled the air travel industry.
""You will see of us a very focused, a very disciplined operating model which is heavily built around the fleet of the (Boeing) 787 Dreamliner and (Airbus) A350-1000,"" CEO Tony Douglas told the online World Aviation Festival.
Etihad operates 19 777s, some of which it has recently converted to cargo flights in response to increased demand.
It has 39 787 Dreamliners in its fleet and has taken delivery of 5 of 20 A350s it ordered.

Douglas said it was too early to comment as to how the Boeing 777X jet, which it has ordered, would fit into its future fleet plans.
Boeing expects the larger version of the 777 to start entering service by late 2023, three years later than initially planned.

An unprecedented winter storm in Texas in February hit supplies of raw materials and forced several chemical plants in the region, including those owned by Dow, to halt their operations, impacting production and pushing up prices. 
Dow said prices rose 14% in the first quarter from the fourth. 
The company brought back assets online within a week and reached pre-storm operating rates by quarter-end, Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said in a statement. 
Dow's chemicals, used in food packaging materials, home care products as well as healthcare sector, have seen a strong pick up in sales as the pandemic boosted hygiene practices. 

The company posted net operating income, which excludes certain items, of $1.02 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with a profit of $607 million, or 81 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",Ad giant WPP pledges net zero emissions by 2025,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -WPP said on Thursday it planned to make the world's largest advertising company reach net zero carbon emissions by 2025 by incorporating many of the virtual production solutions it has developed during the pandemic. 
Announcing on Earth Day what it said was the industry's most ambitious climate target, the British company said it would also work with media partners in television and online to ensure its supply chain is a net zero producer by 2030. 
The owner of the GroupM, Ogilvy and Hill+Knowlton agencies joins a long line of multinational companies and governments that have set out targets to cut carbon emissions by switching to renewable energy sources, reducing travel and reviewing operations. 
It said it had an independently assessed annual carbon footprint of 5.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. 
""WPP (LON:WPP) is the world's largest buyer of advertising space, managing more than $60 billion in media spend on behalf of our clients, and the world's largest producer of advertising content,"" Chief Executive Mark Read said. ""So we have the opportunity to make a real difference.""
WPP, which produces advertising, designs strategies on where to place it and produces PR and data analysis, said the pandemic had accelerated innovation in virtual production technology and reduced the need for staff to gather at carbon-intensive location shoots. 
The firm, which competes with Omnicom, IPG and France's Publicis, said it would work with its media partners to develop an industry-wide standard for measuring the carbon that is emitted through the placement of advertising. 

""(Its media buying arm) GroupM is consolidating its existing carbon calculators to allow a single view of emissions across channels in key markets, and make them available to clients at scale,"" it said. 
The group added that it expected carbon data to increasingly become part of the information that is requested when ad firms pitch to run ad campaigns for brands.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",British Airways-owner IAG to cut emissions with sustainable aviation fuel target,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) committed to powering 10% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, seeking to make progress towards its longer term goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
The group's pledge comes on the same day as a U.S.-led climate change summit hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden, aimed at securing commitments from governments on cutting carbon emissions.
IAG said on Thursday that it plans to purchase one million tonnes of sustainable jet fuel each year by 2030, which will be the equivalent of removing one million cars from Europe's roads each year. 
The sustainable fuel generally produces up to 70% less carbon than fossil fuels, offering airlines a way to become greener while continuing to fly, before less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen aeroplane options become available from the late 2030s. 
IAG, an Anglo-Spanish company, is headquartered in Britain, which has one of the world's most ambitious climate change targets, aiming to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035.
Due to the pandemic, flying is currently at very low levels, but at the same time, pressure is growing on carriers to cut emissions.
""It’s clearly challenging to transition to a low carbon business model but, despite the current pandemic, we remain resolute in our climate commitments,"" IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said in a statement. 
Airlines hope that by reducing their carbon footprints, they can win back passengers who, due to COVID-19, have realised they do not need to fly as much.
Gallego said that government support would be critical to helping attract investment to get sustainable aviation fuel plants up and running and producing sufficient volumes for the future. 

IAG plans to invest $400 million in developing sustainable aviation fuel over the next 20 years, including building a household waste to sustainable jet fuel plant in the UK.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",Carlyle's AlpInvest raises $3.5 billion for eighth co-investment fund,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc's AlpInvest Partners said on Thursday it had raised $3.5 billion for its eighth fund that is dedicated to investing in companies alongside private equity firms.
The fundraising underscores the popularity of so-called co-investments, which allow investors to buy stakes in specific companies at the invitation of private equity firms on more favorable fee terms than their general buyout funds. They also allow the private equity firms to pursue bigger acquisitions. 
The new fund, AlpInvest Co-Investment Fund VIII, exceeded its initial target of $3 billion. Just like its predecessors, the fund will invest alongside private equity firms in businesses in consumer, industrials, healthcare, technology, financial and business services, mostly in North America, Europe, and Asia, Richard Dunne, co-head of co-investments at AlpInvest, said in an interview.
""We are seeking to find high-quality investment opportunities where we are partnered with a lead general partner we know really well to execute the investment thesis of that deal,"" Dunne said.

AlpInvest has raised more than $12 billion for its co-investment funds, which have made about 280 acquisitions since the firm was founded in 2000. It has $55 billion in assets under management.

The move would mark a further step in an EU plan to sever ties with the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker after the company repeatedly cut supplies to the bloc, contributing to major delays in Europe's vaccine rollout.
The news about the legal case was first reported on Thursday by Politico. An EU official involved in talks with drugmakers confirmed the EU was preparing to sue the company.
""EU states have to decide if they (will) participate. It is about fulfillment of deliveries by the end of the second quarter,"" the official said.
The matter was discussed on Wednesday at a meeting with EU diplomats, the official and a diplomat said. Politico, citing five unnamed European diplomats, reported that a majority of EU countries at the meeting said they would support suing the company.
""What matters is that we ensure the delivery of a sufficient number of doses in line with the company's earlier commitments,"" a spokesman for the EU Commission said. ""Together with the member States, we are looking at all options to make this happen.""
There was no immediate response from AstraZeneca on Thursday to a request for comment. 
Brussels in March sent a legal letter to the company in the first step of a potential legal procedure.
When the deadline for a reply expired this month, a spokesman for the Commission said the matter was discussed in a meeting with AstraZeneca but the EU was still seeking further clarification from the company on ""a number of outstanding points"".
The spokesman did not elaborate, but details of the letter published by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera show the EU was seeking clarification on what it deemed a delayed application to the EU regulator for approval of the vaccine.
Brussels also questioned how AstraZeneca spent over 224 million euros ($270 million) granted by the EU in September to buy vaccine ingredients and for which the company had not provided sufficient documents confirming the purchases. 
Under the contract, the company had committed to making its ""best reasonable efforts"" to deliver to the EU 180 million vaccine doses in the second quarter, for a total of 300 million in the period from December to June.
But the company said in a statement on March 12 it would aim to deliver only one third of that. The EU letter was sent a week after that statement.
Under the contract, the parties agreed that Belgian courts would be responsible to settle unresolved disputes.
The EU has already decided not to take up an option to buy 100 million extra doses of AstraZeneca under the contract, an EU official said, after supply delays and safety concerns about very rare cases of blood clots linked to the vaccine.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>","Lagging rivals, Renault sales fall for fifth straight quarter","By Gilles Guillaume and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) -Renault's sales fell for a fifth straight quarter as the French carmaker struggled to shrug off the fallout from the pandemic without a major presence in booming Chinese markets and a global shortage of electronic chips hit production. 
Under Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo, who took the reins last July,  Renault  (PA:RENA) is looking to produce fewer cars and focus on those with higher margins, a strategy that is starting to bear some fruit. 
The company got a boost from rising vehicle prices in January-March, for the third consecutive quarter.
But this was not enough to offset the hit from shrinking inventories and other headwinds like unfavourable foreign exchange effects, and overall revenue fell 1.1% to 10 billion euros ($12 billion) from a year earlier.
Renault, which also makes Dacia and Lada cars and has a financing business, said sales were up 4.4% when stripping out currency and other effects. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said the results were lacklustre and underlying pricing trends where not very different from the rest of the industry.
Renault shares were down 2% at 0752 GMT. 
Like rivals, Renault has been grappling with a global shortage in semiconductor chips, and the group said on Thursday the problem could persist until the third quarter, although it expects an improvement by the end of the year. 
Car production fell by tens of thousands of vehicles in the first quarter as a result of the shortage, finance chief Clotilde Delbos told analysts. 
Renault, which is cutting costs to try to stem losses, has not benefitted like rivals such as Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) from a rebounding car market in China. 
South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co, meanwhile, posted its highest first-quarter profit in four years thanks to sales of luxury cars, another weaker area for Renault.
Renault last year quit its main passenger car business in China due to weak sales there, and is more dependent on its core European market, where some lockdowns to tackle the pandemic are still in place. 
""We're still far from being in a normal situation,"" Delbos told a conference call, adding the group preferred not to give financial guidance due to the uncertain environment. 
Renault was left reeling in late 2018 by a scandal surrounding its former boss-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn, who forged the carmaker's alliance with Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) - a partnership the two are now trying to get back on track. 
They are grappling with rising competition in the market for electric cars, an area where Renault had an early lead but bigger rival Volkswagen is now making huge strides. 

Delbos said electric and hybrid car models were likely to reach up to 15% of group sales in 2021, up from 10% last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union needs to study the rise of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) but it is too early to say if they are a ""bubble"", the executive director designate for EU securities watchdog ESMA said on Thursday.
SPACs have begun attracting big names in European finance, with former UniCredit boss Jean-Pierre Mustier teaming up with France's richest man Bernard Arnault to launch a SPAC that will be listed in Amsterdam and aimed at European financial deals.
Dubbed ""blank check"" companies in the United States, SPACs have attracted billions of dollars in investment on Wall Street and their popularity has spilled over into Europe.
""They beg the question for us in Europe, what that means and whether we are comfortable with our existing rules,"" Natasha Cazenave told the European Parliament.
SPACs list on a stock exchange to raise capital and then have up to two years to use the proceeds to buy existing companies.
They have become a popular alternative for startups wanting to go public with less regulatory scrutiny than they would otherwise face with an IPO.
There have only been 10 SPAC listings in Europe in 2020 and 2021, with a total value of about $1.3 billion - figures dwarfed by the United States where 522 such listings have brought in over $300 billion, end-March data from Refinitiv shows.
""We need to understand why they are so popular, why do people provide money just on the basis of the sponsors' names and announcement of a project,"" said Cazenave, who is currently deputy secretary general of French markets watchdog AMF.
""It's too soon to make a determination... and what should be the appropriate response from a European perspective,"" Cazenave said.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has said it will consult on rule changes for SPACs as Britain tries to attract SPACs to list in London.

The U.S. securities regulator SEC has opened an inquiry into Wall Street's blank check acquisition frenzy and is seeking information on how underwriters are managing the risks involved.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, continuing the global rally, helped by generally positive corporate results ahead of the latest meeting of the European Central Bank. 
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%.
The major indices all closed higher on Wall Street Wednesday, as investors resumed bets on reopening stocks, shrugging off a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases in the likes of India and Japan that threatens to slow the global recovery.
Stock markets in Asia largely followed suit, with Japan’s Nikkei in particular closing over 2% higher, and Europe has continued the theme.
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) stock climbed over 2%, to its highest level in a year, after the French drinks maker reported strong sales growth in the three months to the end of March, helped by strong demand in its key U.S. and Chinese markets. U.K. rival  Diageo  (LON:DGE) also benefited on a read across, with its stock climbing 1.4%, to a 52-week high.
SAP (DE:SAPG) stock rose 2% after CEO Christian Klein said the software group had ""an absolute blowout in the cloud"" in the first quarter, while Hermes (PA:HRMS) stock climbed 2.8%, to an all-time high, after sales at the luxury good manufacturer, famous for its Birkin bag, soared 44% in the first quarter, powered by strong growth in Asia.
Nestle (SIX:NESN) stock also climbed 3% after the Swiss food giant confirmed organic sales should grow more than expected this year after strong demand for its coffee and dairy products boosted growth in the first quarter.
On the flip side,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 3.5% after the Swiss banking giant posted a first-quarter loss and announced a 1.7 billion-franc capital increase, as a hefty hit from the Archegos hedge fund scandal spoiled what would have been its best quarter operationally in at least a decade.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) stock fell 2.2% after the French car maker’s revenue unexpectedly fell in the first quarter as it lagged behind European peers in recovering from the pandemic.
Also of interest later Thursday will be the latest policy-setting meeting of the European Central Bank, even with the central bank widely expected to leave its policy and guidance unchanged.
Oil prices slipped Thursday, continuing to weaken after a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories added to concerns about growing numbers of Covid-19 cases in India and Japan, the third and fourth largest oil importers in the world.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles unexpectedly edged higher in the week ended on April 16 by 594,000 barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, confirming American Petroleum Institute data from the day before.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $60.93 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $64.90. Both contracts fell more than 2% on Wednesday, closing at their lowest since April 13.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>","Hyundai Q1 profit triples, to adjust May auto production due to chip shortage","By Heekyong Yang and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor Co posted a first-quarter profit that nearly tripled to its highest in four years as people bought its luxury cars, but warned it would have to adjust production again in May because of a chip shortage.
Unlike its rivals, the South Korean automaker staved off production halts in the first quarter, thanks to a healthy chip inventory. But the shortage, exacerbated by factors including a fire at a chip factory in Japan and storms in Texas, is now catching up with Hyundai.
Hyundai, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 automakers by sales, has temporarily paused production three times since the beginning of this month and saved chips for its most popular models.
""The condition of semiconductor parts is being a little more prolonged than we expected,"" said Seo Gang-hyun, an executive vice president at Hyundai.
""As the semiconductor procurement condition is rapidly changing, it's difficult to predict production status after May. We expect that there will likely be similar production adjustment in May, similar or more than what we had in April.""
Analysts have said the halts so far are likely to cost Hyundai about 12,000 vehicles in lost production, and future results will be hurt as the chip crisis continues.
""Although Hyundai could end up cutting some production (in the second quarter), the company likely won't see huge impact,"" said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.
This was because favourable market conditions backed by strong demand as well as average selling prices boosted by sales of higher margin cars would probably help offset the decreased output, he added. 
In the quarter ended March 31, however, Hyundai was unscathed as people at home and the United States snapped up its high-margin sports-utility vehicles and premium Genesis cars as the coronavirus pandemic dragged on, fuelling car ownership.
Net profit surged 187% to 1.3 trillion won ($1.16 billion) from 463 billion a year earlier, when business slumped as countries shut down to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
This was in line with an average Refinitiv SmartEstimate. Revenue rose 8.2% to 27.4 trillion won.
Hyundai is expected to report net profit of 1.4 trillion won for the April-June period, up 536% from the corresponding period a year earlier, Refinitiv SmartEstimate showed. 
Shares of Hyundai Motor, Asia's fifth-biggest automaker by market value, rose 2% after its results on Thursday but fell back to trade little changed. The broader market rose 0.2%.
Hyundai stock is the third-best performer this year among large Asian automakers, gaining nearly 18%.
Hyundai, which has lagged its rivals in the electric vehicle (EV) race, also said on Thursday that it was developing solid-state batteries and planned to mass produce EVs using solid state batteries in 2030.

In February, Hyundai launched its Ioniq 5 midsize crossover, the first in a planned family of EVs that it hopes will propel it into the third rank of global EV makers by 2025. Hyundai Motor and Kia together aim to sell 1 million EVs in 2025.
Hyundai affiliate Kia Corp reported operating profit of 1.1 trillion won for January-March, up 142% on the year.

The French luxury group, which has weathered the coronavirus pandemic better than rivals, said revenues at constant exchange rates came in at 2.08 billion euros ($2.50 billion) in the three months to March, beating analyst expectations for a 24% increase. 
Sales in Asia excluding Japan surged 94% over the period, with growth in China especially significant. That, coupled with a rebound in the United States where sales grew by 24% helped the group more than offset a decline in sales in Europe due to a new round of coronavirus lockdowns.
Eric du Halgouët, Executive Vice President for Finance at the group, told reporters the sales growth in the quarter was not driven by a big increase in prices, as the group had nudged prices up by just 1.4% so far this year. 
He said online sales had increased by 100% or more in all regions, and would likely soon exceed 1 billion euros.
The group's strong first quarter - with sales up 33% from their 2019 levels - adds to signs of a comeback for the luxury goods sector, with rivals LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) also reporting a surge in revenues.
However du Halgouët said it was too early to predict that the industry would put the coronavirus crisis squarely behind it this year, pointing to fresh concerns about a possible resurgence of the virus in Japan.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Nestle on Thursday posted its strongest quarterly sales growth in 10 years, citing stronger demand for coffee, dairy and petcare products. 
The world's biggest food group has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic well so far as consumers locked up at home bought more packaged foods for themselves and their pets. 
It also expanded ecommerce and its health science portfolio as consumers bought more online and worried about their health.
""Retail sales saw solid growth and out-of-home channels saw signs of improvement. We confirm our guidance for the year and our mid-term outlook for sustained mid single-digit organic growth,"" Chief Executive Mark Schneider said in the statement.
The maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee expects an increase in organic sales growth this year versus the 3.6% achieved in 2020. 
Organic sales rose 7.7% in the first quarter, versus 4.3% in the year-ago period, Nestle said, easily beating a forecast for 3.3% organic growth in a company-compiled consensus https://www.nestle.com/investors/analysts-consensus and a 3.3% drop in sales posted by peer Danone this week.
""What a blow out – the strongest quarterly number since 2011,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said, pointing to a recovery in emerging markets, while Bernstein's Bruno Monteyne spoke of an ""amazing beat"".
Shares in Nestle, up just over 2% so far this year, were indicated to open 1.7% higher, according to pre-market indications by bank Julius Baer.
Organic growth stood at 7.2% in the Americas, at 4.4% in Europe and at 9.1% in Asia, Nestle said. Asia was in negative territory in the year-ago period as the pandemic hit there first. 
In terms of categories, petcare was up 8.7%, powdered and liquid beverages including coffee rose 9.9%, and dairy increased 15.7%. Nutrition and health science fell 0.5%, dragged down by nutrition. 
Nestle said it had made further progress on portfolio development as it wants to offer more health and wellness foods and get rid of underperforming businesses.

It recently sold its North American water brands to One Rock Capital Partners for $4.3 billion and offloaded its Yinlu peanut milk business in China to Food Wise Co Ltd.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Thursday, taking their lead from the positive close on Wall Street overnight although gains are seen tempered with caution ahead of the latest meeting of the European Central Bank. 
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.9% higher on Wall Street Wednesday, the S&P 500 gained 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite ended up 1.2%, as investors resumed bets on reopening stocks, shrugging off a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases in the likes of India and Japan that threatens to slow the global recovery.
Stock markets in Asia have largely pushed higher as a result, with Japan’s Nikkei in particular up over 2%, and Europe is expected to follow suit.
That said, investors could well adopt a degree of caution as the European Central Bank will hand down its policy decision later in the day, even with the central bank widely expected to leave its policy and guidance unchanged.
“The monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council this week is unlikely to result in new policy announcements, however investors will be looking for more clarity on two issues. First, the ECB’s strategy with regards to capping government bond yields. Second, on how the central bank’s views on the economic outlook are developing,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note.
The earnings season continues Thursday, and the spotlight will be on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) after the Swiss banking giant posted a first-quarter loss as a hefty hit from the Archegos hedge fund scandal spoiled what would have been its best quarter operationally in at least a decade.
Elsewhere, food giant Nestle (SIX:NESN) confirmed organic sales should grow more than expected this year after strong demand for coffee, dairy and pet care products boosted growth in the first quarter, while SAP (DE:SAPG) stock is likely to be in demand after CEO Christian Klein said the software group had ""an absolute blowout in the cloud"" in the first quarter.
Oil prices slipped Thursday, continuing to weaken after a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories added to concerns about growing numbers of Covid-19 cases in India and Japan, the third and fourth largest oil importers in the world.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles unexpectedly edged higher in the week ended on April 16 by 594,000 barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, confirming American Petroleum Institute data from the day before.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $61.03 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $65.00. Both contracts fell more than 2% on Wednesday, closing at their lowest since April 13.

The ordinance will allow the government access to use the 17.4 billion ringgit ($4.23 billion) parked under the national trust fund to secure vaccines ""for an epidemic of any infection disease"", according to the law published in the federal gazette.
The trust fund, which takes contributions from state energy company Petronas and others involved to petroleum exploitation, was set up to support infrastructure and other development and provide federal loans to Malaysia's states.
Petronas already provides annual dividends to the government, having declared an 18 billion ringgit payout for this year.
In January, King Al-Sultan Abdullah declared a nationwide state of emergency to curb the spread of COVID-19, giving the government broad powers to enact temporary laws without needing parliamentary approval.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin in March nearly doubled the country's COVID-19 immunisation budget to 5 billion ringgit, which he expects will help achieve the government's target of innoculating 80% of Malaysia's 32 million population by December.
But the opposition and public have criticised the government for what they said was the slow rollout of the vaccination plan, which was launched in February.
Nearly 750,000 people have been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to data from the health ministry, while around 462,000 more are awaiting their second shots.
Malaysia saw a sharp spike in its COVID-19 infection rate towards the end of 2020 after having kept it largely under control for most of the year.
It now has the third-highest number of infections in the region behind Indonesia and the Philippines, with nearly 382,000 positive cases and 1,400 deaths as of Wednesday.

""We are seeing very strong order entry growth across our applications portfolio,"" said CEO Christian Klein. SAP's new business transformation product, Rise with SAP, was ""rapidly becoming a massive accelerator"".
SAP confirmed its guidance after earlier this month nudging up expectations for cloud and software revenue to 23.4-23.8 billion euros ($28.15-$28.64 billion) this year, representing a rise of 1%-2% year on year.
Klein said SAP had ""an absolute blowout in the cloud"" in the first quarter, with the Rise initiative driving a 19% increase in its current cloud backlog - a management measure of incoming business - at constant currencies.
It also added 400 customers for S/4 HANA, its premium enterprise resource software platform, to bring the total to 16,400, of which 9,600 are live. Customer wins in the quarter included Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY).
As already reported, total revenue including SAP's traditional mainstays of license sales and service revenues, rose by 2% in the first quarter at constant currency to 6.35 billion euros.
Reported operating profit was depressed by executive share compensation, which SAP accounts for as a cash expense. After stripping out the effect of that, adjusted operating profit rose by 24% to 1.74 billion euros at constant currency.

In a bid to tackle racial disparities in the prosecution of marijuana-related crimes, the state accelerated to July 1 its timetable to pass the legislation, rather than waiting until 2024.
""Seventy-one days from now, Virginia will no longer police adults possessing small amounts of marijuana,"" Northam said at Wednesday's ceremonial signing of the bill.
Northam cited a report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that showed Black residents were more than three times as likely to be arrested for possessing small amounts of the drug.
""We are moving forward in a way that promotes equity, provides a clean slate to those with prior convictions, and reinvests in the communities harmed by over-criminalization,"" he said on Twitter https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/1384989019759644679.
The legislation, signed a day after the informal April 20 pot holiday, also known as 4/20, allows anyone aged 21 or more to possess up to one ounce (28.4 grams) of marijuana.
People in the state can cultivate up to four cannabis plants per home for personal use.
NORML, a pro-marijuana group, celebrated the decision as an ""extraordinary victory for cannabis justice"" in the state.
The timeline for the state to adopt provisions licensing commercial cannabis production and sales is July 1, 2024.

On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that lets banks provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal, a step towards levelling what analysts call a barrier to the development of a national industry.

The heir to one of South Korea's most powerful family-run business empires is accused of fraud and stock manipulation and could face a fresh jail term if convicted.
Pressure is mounting on the government to pardon Lee for a previous conviction of bribery and other offences, for which he has served half of a 30-month sentence.
Business lobby groups and some lawmakers say he should be freed to help South Korea secure supplies of coronavirus vaccines.

Samsung (KS:005930) is considering building a $17 billion chip factory in the United States, while Seoul has noted its potential role in helping U.S. President Joe Biden preserve the global chip supply chain. 
The United States has said its first priority is vaccinating Americans, although it has promised to look into options to help other countries bolster their supplies.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is due to visit Washington for a summit with Biden next month. 

South Korea has reported 116,661 coronavirus cases and 1,808 deaths from COVID-19, but just 3% of the population has been vaccinated due to problems with vaccine supplies.

(Reuters) -A Canadian renewable energy firm on Wednesday sued  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) for rejecting force majeure declarations during a February winter storm and billing it over $100 million for replacement power, according to lawsuits filed in a Texas state court. 
Shannon Wind and Flat Top Wind, subsidiaries of Innergex Renewable Energy Inc, operate North Texas wind farms that halted their wind turbines during an arctic deep freeze. Both had agreements to physically deliver power to Citi Energy, a unit of Citigroup Inc, at fixed prices. 
Unusually frigid temperatures knocked out nearly half of the state's power plants in mid-February, leaving 4.5 million people without heat or light for days and bankrupting at least three companies due to high wholesale power prices. 
The wind firms, partly owned by Starwood Energy Group Global and a fund run by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), respectively, declared force majeure after their turbines froze. But, their lawsuits in Harris County District Court claimed, Citi ignored the declarations and invoiced them for electricity it bought at inflated prices. 
Citi and BlackRock declined to comment, and Starwood did not have an immediate comment. Innergex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Citi billed Shannon Wind for $39.5 million for four days of electricity, and billed Flat Top Wind for $79.3 million for seven days of electricity, according to the suits filed in Harris County District Court, Houston. 
The invoices represent more than their projected revenues for the entire year, the lawsuits said, claiming Citi Energy ""improperly defaulted,"" and is poised to foreclose on both projects. 

The lawsuits asked the court to prevent Citi Group from taking further action after the wind companies were advised that they have until Friday to pay their invoices. 
Citi billed for replacement power at $9,000 per megawatt hour, versus the roughly $22 to $26 per megawatt hour under their contracts.

(Reuters) - A U.S. plant that was making Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine must fix a long list of problems including peeling paint, shoddy cleanups, and poorly-trained staff to resume operation, according to a highly critical report by the Food and Drug Administration.
Experts said addressing the issues raised in the scathing FDA inspection report could take months.
Neither J&J nor the FDA has said when they expect vaccine production to resume at the Baltimore plant owned by Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS) Inc. Only one plant, in the Netherlands, is currently producing the key drug substance used in J&J's vaccine, the company said. 
""It may take many months to make these changes,"" said Prashant Yadav, a global healthcare supply-chain expert at the Center for Global Development. He described some of the issues raised by the FDA as ""quite significant.""
J&J said it would ensure that all of the FDA issues are addressed promptly and comprehensively.
The 12-page report described dirty facilities and many instances of potential contamination. In some cases, employees carrying unsealed medical waste collided with containers used to make material for vaccines, it noted, adding that containers had been spotted elsewhere with cracks. 
Problems were not investigated and cleanups were superficial, it added. In one example, a worker moved between rooms where different materials were being made on 19 different days while only documenting a single required shower, the report said. 
FDA inspectors said the facility was not large enough, describing crowded rooms difficult to walk through without bumping into containers of materials and small doors that forced workers to push containers on the ground rather than use machines to carry them. 
""Paint flecks were observed on the floor all along the sides of these walls"" on corridors surrounding the manufacturing room and in a room were vials were filled, it said in one section, adding that there was ""brown residue"" on the wall and ""black residue"" on the floor in one plant room.
The investigation confirmed media reports that J&J shots made at the Emergent plant had been contaminated with material used to make vaccine for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). At the time, workers responded to the mix up with little more than a routine cleaning, it noted.
Millions of J&J doses were ruined, the New York Times reported. Production of AstraZeneca's vaccine was moved elsewhere. 
""There is no assurance that other batches have not been subject to cross-contamination,"" the report said.
J&J has drawn scrutiny for months over its halting process to scale up production of the one-shot vaccine that is easier to handle and use than other authorized vaccines.
Its use in the United States has been paused since last week as health officials study a possible link to a very rare but serious blood clot condition.
Emergent has been seeking regulatory authorization to make the J&J vaccine in the United States. It stopped production at the plant recently, saying the FDA had asked it to do so after an inspection.
""What's important is that the FDA caught these deficiencies"" and took steps to ensure the vaccine produced there was not used, said vaccine researcher Dr. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
""Emergent has some work to do to clean up their process. They will likely need to be re-inspected by the FDA before any vaccine produced there would be accepted,"" she said. 
Johnson & Johnson reiterated on Wednesday that it was working to establish a global supply chain in which 10 manufacturing sites would be involved in production of its COVID-19 vaccine, in addition the Netherlands plant.
The company has a U.S. government-brokered agreement with rival drugmaker Merck & Co, which is preparing to make doses of J&J's vaccine.
FAILURE TO TRAIN PERSONNEL
The inspection report said the FDA team had reviewed security camera footage in addition to an in-person site visit to the Emergent plant.
It found failure to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of COVID-19 vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. 
Earlier this week, the U.S. House Representatives launched an investigation into whether Emergent used its relationship with a Trump administration official to get a vaccine manufacturing contract despite a record of not delivering on contracts.
Emergent said in a statement that it is working with the FDA and J&J to quickly resolve the issues outlined in the report. 
The inspection, carried out between April 12 and April 20, also noted that Emergent did not produce adequate reports showing that the vaccines it was producing met quality standards. 
J&J said it was redoubling its efforts to get authorization for the facility as quickly as possible.
J&J's oversight could help Emergent better address the FDA's concerns, none of which are especially difficult to fix, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brandon Folkes said in a note.

No vaccine manufactured at the Baltimore plant has been distributed for use in the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday deflected concerns over its drive to formulate rules requiring companies to show investors how climate change will affect their activities, saying that waiting for a global approach could take years.
The EU unveiled groundbreaking proposals on Wednesday for sustainability disclosures by companies in the 27 country bloc, and a classification system to define what can be labelled a ""green"" asset or activity in a disclosure.
It leaps ahead of global efforts to create an international sustainability standards board to write disclosure rules, details of which will be published in time for the UN COP26 global climate change conference in November.
Investors have called for global standards to replace a patchwork of norms now emerging, to make comparisons between companies easier and avoid 'greenwashing' or firms overplaying their green credentials.
Global financial regulators have also thrown their weight behind the proposed new sustainability standards board, but it has not stopped the EU from pushing ahead on its own.
""We are a global frontrunner,"" the EU's financial services chief Mairead McGuinness told an online event held by financial industry body IIF.
""At the moment we have a confused situation, an array of different standards companies can use,"" she said.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva welcomed the EU initiative. ""It will be critical for the world to converge on common principles, disclosures, and standards for more reliable sustainability information,"" she said in a tweet. 
Axel Weber, chairman of UBS bank, said global financial institutions need international rules to create a mobile pool of capital that can invest in climate-friendly assets anywhere.
""It's good we are seeing a European approach as opposed to a fragmented approach we have seen in Europe many times in the past, but we need a global approach,"" Weber said.
Foreign regulators could take the EU's approach into account when forging their own, but it was unclear to what degree the EU would be open to approaches from elsewhere, Weber said.
McGuinness said the EU will work with global initiatives, but it should be noted that similar efforts, such as creating international accounting rules, did not happen overnight.
""There isn't any conflict here, we are all working in one direction,"" McGuinness said.

""It will be bumpy... we don't have time to waste.""

Canadian National had informed the STB, which oversees freight rail service and rates in the United States, that it plans to file an application, seeking permission to combine with Kansas City Southern, the company said.
The notice commences a regulatory process should Kansas City Southern accept Canadian National's offer, it added.
The company's offer trumps a $25 billion bid made by rival  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) for Kansas City Southern in March.
Canadian Pacific also wrote to the STB on Wednesday, urging the regulator to allow its bid for Kansas City Southern to proceed.
Analysts widely expect Canadian Pacific to raise it offer for Kansas City Southern that is set to heat up a bidding war for the U.S. company.
Separately, credit rating agency DBRS Ltd placed Canadian National's issuer rating of ""A"" under review with negative implications following its buyout offer. 

The benefits of a deal with Kansas City Southern are not sufficient to compensate for the additional debt needed to fund the transaction, DBRS said.
""The combined entity's debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be just above 4.5 times while cash flow-to-debt will decline below 20%, levels that are no longer commensurate with the current ratings.""

As such, we think the Reddit forums’ WallStreetBets’ short squeeze targets in this space, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), should be avoided now.Investors have been betting on the cannabis industry on optimism over the potential for broad legalization of marijuana in the United States since Joe Biden’s Presidential win last year. This is evidenced by the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF's (YOLO) 68.6% returns over the past six months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 20% gains.
However, many analysts don’t expect broad cannabis legalization in the U.S. to happen anytime soon. According to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, “The President supports leaving decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, rescheduling cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts and, at the federal level, he supports decriminalizing marijuana use and automatically expunging any prior criminal records.”
Given this backdrop, fundamentally weak cannabis stocks that are currently trading at high valuations based solely on optimism over the industry’s growth prospects based on a federal legalization in the near term could retreat. Two such stocks in this space, Tilray, Inc. (TLRY) and  Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL), are also short squeeze targets of Reddit forums’ WallStreetBets. So, investors should avoid these stocks now.

(Reuters) -Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Wednesday said its comparable sales this quarter could grow by as much as 30% as rapid COVID-19 vaccinations encourage consumers to return to its restaurants that offer quick service in a casual dining space.
Shares rose slightly in after hours trading after the burrito chain reported comparable sales rose 17.2% in the first quarter, helped by new menu items like quesadillas and consumers' using federal pandemic relief funds to order tacos and salads online.
Digital sales surged nearly 134% in the first quarter and accounted for half of overall sales, the company said on Wednesday. 
The company's digital sales have grown rapidly during the pandemic, encouraging it to expand order-ahead lanes called ""Chipotlanes"" to a majority of its restaurants in the United States. 

Revenue rose 23.4% to $1.74 billion, matching analyst estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
While the company reiterated that it expects to open about 200 new restaurants in 2021, it continued to shy away from issuing full-year revenue and sales forecasts.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canada judge has agreed to delay Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's U.S. extradition hearings for three months, according to a ruling read in court on Wednesday, handing her defense team a win.
Meng, 49, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on charges of bank fraud in the United States for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng's team had asked for more time to review additional documents that became available after HSBC and Huawei reached a settlement in Hong Kong. Extradition hearings were originally set to wrap up in May.
Defense attorney Richard Peck argued in court on Monday that they were requesting ""a modest frame of time"" to be able to read the documents and potentially file them as evidence in the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Lawyers representing the attorney general of Canada had fought the adjournment of hearings set to start on Monday, arguing that Meng's team had been given more time than was usual in an extradition to make their case, and the contents of the documents were too redacted to be relied upon as significant to the case.
""The outstanding feature of this application is that it's based on speculation,"" prosecutor Robert Frater said on Monday.
But Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes disagreed, siding with the defense in granting an adjournment.

Her reasons will be read out on in court on April 28.

NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) -Wall Street rebounded on Wednesday after a two-day decline in a broad rally as a tilt toward stocks poised to benefit from a recovering economy offset Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s sell-off after its disappointing results a day earlier.
Shares of Netflix slumped 7.4% after the world's largest streaming service said slower production of TV shows and movies during the pandemic hurt subscriber growth in the first quarter.
But stocks rallied throughout the day, building steam as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index overtook the S&P 500 in percentage gain shortly before the close.
 Intuitive Surgical Inc  (NASDAQ:ISRG) surged 9.9%to an all-time high as its results trounced estimates. The maker of robotic surgical systems vied with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for much of the session as the biggest contributor to the S&P 500's upside.
Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rose, with communication services, led by Netflix, and the defensive utilities sectors falling.
Economically sensitive value stocks rose 1.1%, outpacing the 0.8% gain in growth even as the growth-oriented but more concentrated Nasdaq climbed more than the S&P.
The Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks gained 2.4% in its biggest single-day advance since March 1.
""You take Netflix out of today's equation, it's simply a broad-based rally,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, adding technology shares still had room to run. 
The VIX, CBOE's market volatility index, slid below 18, suggesting the market in days to come could be range-bound while shrugging off a rebound in COVID infections, he said.
Analysts expect S&P 500 companies to post first-quarter earnings growth of 30.9% from a year earlier, Refinitiv IBES data shows.
Netflix's results dashed expectations but technology remains a major market focus.
""Investors feel more confident of the earnings growth prospects for technology,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. ""They would rather gravitate toward the sure thing, which right now is tech stocks.""
The Nasdaq Composite added 1.19% to 13,950.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.93% to 34,137.31, while the S&P 500 gained 0.93% at 4,173.42.

Investing -- Stocks regained some of their recent losses on Wednesday as investors warmed again to growth stocks.
Even a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections couldn’t dampen enthusiasm for the so-called reopening trade, pushing shares of cruise operators higher. 
President Joe Biden kicks off a two-day climate summit at the White House on Thursday, inviting 40 world leaders to participate virtually. He is expected to call for emissions to be cut by 50% and for government agencies to report on the risk of climate change.
There are scant data releases on Thursday, but the weekly data on initial and continuing jobless claims.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. AT&T earnings
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) follows  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) with earnings. The telecom giant also has something going for it -- HBO Max, the streaming service of WarnerMedia, which is owned by AT&T. Warner has been releasing movies on HBO at the same time as their theatrical debut, helping to lure subscribers to the relatively new business. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of 78 cents on revenue of $42.7 billion.
2. Intel outlook
Chip stocks have been in the spotlight, in part because of a global shortage of the materials that power everything from iPhones to cars. American chip maker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has promised to spend $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona. It reports earnings on Thursday and analysts expect EPS of $1.14 on revenue of $17.8 billion.
3. FANG fumble 
On television Wednesday, they called it the “FANG fumble,” this fear among investors that the tech giants that have led markets higher for months are somehow losing steam. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) -- the N in FANG -- tumbled after hours on Tuesday and fell another 7% on Wednesday after beating earnings expectations but disclosing far fewer new subscriptions than expected.

The continuing tech sell-off and rising Treasury yields have sapped the momentum from some of her biggest bets. We think four companies held by ARKK, namely Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and Invitae (NYSE:NVTA), are best avoided now because they are expected to incur hefty losses until next year. Read on.Investor Cathie Wood, the founder of Ark Investment Management Services, LLC, operates the world’s largest actively traded ETF. She is known for her bullish stance on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Its gains from this stock put ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) on the map as one of the most successful, industry-disruptive tech ETFs delivering manifold returns. However, the renowned ETF has been losing momentum since March. Specifically, it has declined 19.1% over the past three months due to investors’ rotation away from overvalued tech stocks. ARKK has declined 6.7% over the past five days, and 12.8% since March 1.
As a highly regarded investor on Wall Street, Wood’s bets are replicated by millions of investors worldwide. However, her contrarian investment approach can lead investors to big losses on their bets because many investors do not possess sufficient capital to hold their investments for the long term. As the U.S. focuses on mass vaccine distribution and infrastructure development, technology has taken a backseat as the “it” investment sector. Furthermore, with rising benchmark Treasury yields making equities less attractive, investors are fixating now on companies with solid fundamentals and strong growth potential in the short term.
ARKK holdings Twilio Inc. (TWLO), Teladoc Health, Inc. (TDOC) CRISPR Therapeutics AG (CRSP) and Invitae Corporation (NVTA) possess weak earnings growth outlooks. In fact, their earnings are expected to decline in the coming quarters or years. While Wood possesses the requisite capital to hold her investment positions until these companies’ fortunes improve, we think these stocks might not be well suited for retail investors.

Among home improvement stocks,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) has been one of the major beneficiaries of this trend. But, given that HD’s expenses are soaring, we believe its peers Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) are better positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds in the coming months. Read on for an explanation.The home improvement industry has been surging over the past year as consumers spent more time indoors amid a hastily adopted remote-working-and-learning culture courtesy of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that more millennials are buying homes, given low mortgage rates, or are remodeling their old homes to make their living spaces more comfortable, the home improvement market is gaining noteworthy momentum. The industry has been enjoying favorable investor sentiment, as is evident in the SPDR Homebuilders ETF’s (XHB) 130.3% returns over the past year, compared to the S&P 500’s 46.4% gains. The global home improvement market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% over the next five years to reach $1155.79 billion in 2026.

Its operating expenses were also significantly higher during this period.
Conversely, here are some home improvement players that have been benefiting consistently from the industry tailwinds: Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW), and Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK). So, we think it could be wise to invest in these stocks in lieu of HD.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that final rules announced in December took effect on Wednesday allowing for small drones to fly over people and at night, a significant step toward their eventual use for widespread commercial deliveries.
The effective date was delayed about a month during the change in administration. The FAA said its long-awaited rules for the drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, will address security concerns by requiring remote identification technology in most cases to enable their identification from the ground.
Previously, small drone operations over people were limited to operations over people who were directly participating in the operation, located under a covered structure, or inside a stationary vehicle - unless operators had obtained a waiver from the FAA.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday the rules ""are an important first step in safely and securely managing the growing use of drones in our airspace, though more work remains on the journey to full integration"" of drones.
Drone manufacturers have 18 months to begin producing drones with Remote ID, and operators will have an additional year to provide Remote ID.
Companies have been racing to create drone fleets to speed deliveries. As of December, the United States had over 1.7 million drone registrations and 203,000 FAA-certificated remote pilots.
For at-night operations, the FAA said drones must be equipped with anti-collision lights. The final rules allow operations over moving vehicles in some circumstances.
The new rules eliminate requirements that drones be connected to the internet to transmit location data but do require that they broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast. 

One change, since the rules were first proposed in 2019, requires that small drones not have any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin.

The singling-out of Tesla in China, which accounts for 30% of the U.S. firm's global sales and where it makes cars at its own factory in Shanghai, comes amid ongoing U.S.-China tensions and as other foreign firms have encountered backlash.
On Monday, a disgruntled customer clambered on top of a Tesla at the auto show in protest over the company's handling of her complaints about malfunctioning brakes, triggering a social media storm, with regulators and state media also weighing-in.
Late on Wednesday, China's market regulator urged Tesla to ensure product quality in the country, while the official Xinhua news agency said that Tesla's apology was ""not sincere"".
Tesla declined to comment, but said in a statement it would share data on the brake incident with regulators.
In videos that went viral from Monday's car show, a woman wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""The brakes don't work"" shouted similar accusations while staff and security struggled to restore calm.
Tesla on Tuesday apologised to Chinese consumers for not addressing the complaint in a timely way, and said it would launch a review of its service operations in the world's biggest auto market.
However, the Xinhua news agency said Tesla's apology fell short. 
""A big company should have the responsibility of being a big company, no company can do whatever it wants,"" it said in a commentary on Wednesday night.
""If a company does not rectify when it has a problem, if it does not change a problematic senior executive ... it will eventually make mistakes again,"" it said.
On Monday, Grace Tao, a Tesla vice-president, told a local media outlet that ""there is no possibility Tesla will compromise"" and said the she suspected that there was someone putting the customer up to the protest. The interview prompted accusations of ""arrogance"" on Tesla's part from state media.
Meanwhile, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, published a story on a deadly accident reportedly involving a Tesla that “surfaced online on Wednesday, raising more concerns over the quality control issues of the U.S. car maker.""
Last month, Tesla came under scrutiny in China when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over cameras in its vehicles, sources told Reuters. Earlier this month, Tesla said cameras in its cars are not activated outside of North America.

Chinese internet users last month began calling for boycotts of brands including H&M, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) over past statements saying they do not use cotton from Xinjiang, where some researchers and foreign lawmakers say authorities use coercive labour to meet seasonal needs, which China denies.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>","Explainer: How worried should we be about blood clots linked to Astra, J&J vaccines?","By John Miller and Ludwig Burger
ZURICH (Reuters) - European regulators said the benefits of using Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccines outweigh risks, even as they added warning labels to both shots for extremely rare but potentially fatal blood clotting.
J&J said on April 20 it would resume deliveries of its vaccine in Europe, following the regulator's guidance. U.S. officials are continuing their review of what are now eight reported instances of rare clotting combined with low blood platelets in the United States.
Britain's health regulator has recommended people under the age of 30 get an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if possible, rather than the AstraZeneca shot, while some other European countries are only administering the shot to older people.
Amid concerns that rare side effect reports could undermine confidence, vaccine and immunology experts said clotting risks for both shots remain extremely low and the vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 death and severe disease.
Here's what we know so far:
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
With both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines, the reports involve extremely rare clotting, mainly a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), that were seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets, called thrombocytopenia.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said most clots had occurred in the brain and abdomen.
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee has scheduled a meeting for April 23 to review clots linked to the J&J vaccine, with a possible decision to follow. The U.S. agencies, like their European counterparts, described the clotting as extremely rare. 
There have been more than 300 clotting incidents with low platelets reported worldwide, out of tens of millions of shots administered, according to the EMA.
That includes 287 cases of clotting -- including CVST and splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) which is clotting in veins in the abdomen -- linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine worldwide. 
Of that total, 142 were in the European Economic Area (EEA) out of more than 30 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses administered in Britain and the European Economic Area over the past three months.
The EMA's J&J review covered eight cases in people who got the shot in the United States. All cases occurred in people below 60 years of age, and most were in women, within three weeks of the person being vaccinated. 
About 8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been given in the United States so far.
Five cases have been reported after administration of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s shot and 25 after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s.
The EMA said early this month that of the cases that it has reviewed in depth, 18 were fatalities.
WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?
J&J said a new package label will include a warning on the risk of the rare side effect and instructions on how to recognise and treat it. The company said on April 20 it would restart shipments to the European Union, Norway and Iceland, and is working on restarting clinical trials.
AstraZeneca, which is still delivering its vaccines, said it was ""working to understand individual cases and ""possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events"".
WHAT HAVE REGULATORS SAID?
The U.S. regulator has paused the use of J&J's single-dose vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution"" to ensure that the health care providers are aware of potential side effects and can plan for ""proper recognition and management.""
In part, the pause served to help make sure doctors were aware of treatment options, including what medications to give to help resolve the clots, without further endangering patients' lives.
Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, meanwhile, has made its recommendation for an alternative vaccine to AstraZeneca's to be used for people under 30 after reviewing 79 cases of rare clotting coupled with low platelets, with 19 fatalities - 13 women and six men. 
Eleven of the deaths were of people under the age of 50 and three were under the age of 30.
WHAT TREATMENT IS RECOMMENDED?
In the United States, health officials said treatment of the blood clots with possible ties to the J&J vaccine differs from what might be considered standard in such situations.
""Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots,"" they said. ""In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.""
The EMA, so far, has said heparin should not be given until a diagnosis of a similar condition -- called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) -- is ruled out. Alternative anti-coagulants can be used, including fondaparinux or argatroban. 
But even once HIT is excluded, the EMA says ""it still is unclear whether patients with (the post-vaccination clotting) syndrome could be treated with heparin, mostly because there is little evidence.""
German doctors and scientists investigating clotting associated with AstraZeneca shots have also said the heparin issue remains ""unclear,"" and have recommended that medical professionals administer intravenous immunoglobulin plus anticoagulant.
HOW DID REGULATORS COME TO THEIR DECISIONS?
For AstraZeneca's shot, the EMA said in March that, on average, just 1.35 cases of CVST might normally have been expected among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving the vaccine, whereas by the same cut-off date 12 cases had been recorded.
By comparison, four women out of 10,000 would get a blood clot from taking oral contraception.
British officials who recommended people under 30 receive an alternative vaccine drew on statistics from the University of Cambridge's Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication. 
According to the Centre, the risk of serious harm due to vaccination falls the older people get and the number of admissions to intensive care units falls sharply thanks to vaccinations, boosting the AstraZeneca shot's benefit-to-risk ratio. 
The Centre concluded that only 0.4 people for every 100,000 in the 50-59 age group would suffer vaccine-linked harm, while 95.6 ICU admissions per 100,000 people would be prevented. 
WHAT'S THE EU DOING NOW?
The EMA, which said the benefits of using AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines continue to outweigh any risks, said that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects and has left it up to countries to decide on how to proceed.
Their decisions may vary from nation to nation, the EMA said, depending on factors like infection rates and whether there are vaccine alternatives. Denmark, for instance, has opted to suspend AstraZeneca's shot, and is still mulling plans for J&J's vaccine.
ANY THEORIES ON CAUSE OF THE CLOTS?
Among possible causes being investigated are that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in rare cases. So far, risk factors like age or gender have not been singled out.
While most of the cases reported, so far, involving AstraZeneca have been in women, scientists in Germany say that may be misleading, since women made up most of those people who received the shot.
Health regulators and scientists are also exploring whether the clotting problem may affect the whole class of so-called viral vector vaccines, which EMA said was possible while noting differences in the two shots.
German scientists at Greifswald University have concluded the extremely rare cases of clotting with low platelets - something they are calling ""vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", or VITT - are triggered in part by antibodies found in the affected patients following vaccination with AstraZeneca's shot. 
Separately, Norwegian scientists have drawn similar conclusions - that AstraZeneca's vaccine triggered an immune response that may have led to clotting in a small number of people - in their own investigations.

Investing.com -- Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) dropped 3% after losing out on a massive project to provide cloud services for Israel.
The government chose Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) over Oracle, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) for a project valued at more than $1 billion for the country's public sector and military, Reuters reported.   
A second tender process is underway for additional government cloud projects.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by strength in its trading business against a backdrop of high market volatility and a surge in initial public offerings.
The exchange operator posted adjusted net income of $1.96 per share for the quarter, versus estimates of $1.74 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A new cohort of retail investors armed with mobile trading apps helped spark a broad surge in trading volumes in the quarter, piling into heavily shorted stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, to punish hedge funds that bet against them.
That drove a 20% jump in revenue at Nasdaq's market services unit, its biggest business, to $338 million. 
In listings, Nasdaq said 196 special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) debuted on its exchange in the quarter, along with 79 operating companies, including Bumble, Affirm and Playtika.
More recently, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global started trading on Nasdaq, briefly becoming a $100-billion company, making it more valuable than Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) combined.
Nasdaq provides market surveillance tools and technology to cryptocurrency exchanges. It also compiles a cryptocurrency index that it partnered with Brazilian asset manager Hashdex to create an exchange-traded fund, which accredited non-U.S. investors can buy and sell on the Bermuda Stock Exchange.
""We're hoping with a second partner to kind of hopefully bring that into the U.S. in coming months,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said on a call with analysts. 
Revenue from the New York-based company's investment intelligence segment, which includes indexes, was up 22% from a year earlier at $258 million, as investors poured into products related to the company's tech-heavy indexes. Indexing revenues were up 40% to $29 million year-over-year.

Excluding transaction-based expenses, net revenue surged 21% to $851 million.

Investing.com – Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) shares slipped by almost 3% Wednesday as the battle for the booming podcast business heats up with rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) deciding to launch a paid subscription for its service.
At Tuesday’s Apple Spring Loaded event, the iPhone-maker unveiled new offerings under the service it pioneered.
Apple podcast subscriptions will let users pay to unlock new content and enjoy ad-free listening, CEO Tim Cook said.
Pricing for each subscription will be set by the creator and billed monthly, Apple noted in a press release.
Cook said the app would be enhanced and podcast users will get a better search functionality besides being able to access exclusive content by well-known names.
""Given that (Apple) basically originated podcasting, it would be tough to swallow to lose out to Spotify,"" Reuters quoted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives as saying.
With its new service, Apple will face the challenge of convincing users to pay for podcasts ""when there's a universe of it available for free,"" Reuters quoted Nick Quah as saying. Quah is the author of Hot Pod, an industry newsletter about the podcasting world.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",Wall St. fears Netflix fatigue as subscriber growth slumps,"(Corrects headline to say subscriber growth slumps, not losses mount)
(Reuters) - Wall Street cast doubt on Wednesday on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s ability to bounce back strongly from a first-quarter slowdown in subscriber growth that pointed to fatigue among viewers after a year of COVID-19-driven binge streaming. 
Several analysts said the streaming giant would need fresh and interesting new content along with a creative approach to pricing going forward as it faces a slew of improving competitors. 
The channel had big ratings successes last year with ""The Queen's Gambit"" and ""The Crown"" but production houses are struggling to complete shows worth billions of dollars it has ordered in the hope of extending its dominance of the streaming space. 
Meanwhile, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video have all claimed their own ratings successes and are hoping for boosts from their slates such as ""Nomadland"", ""Promising Young Woman"" and ""The Father"", which are all vying for Oscars this weekend. 
""We are not enthralled with the appeal of the content that Netflix is producing off a high teen billion programming budget,"" Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan said. ""The 2H21 content slate certainly improves from 1H, but we do not think that is especially compelling relative to 'The Crown' and 'Bridgerton' in 2H20."" 
In its quarterly report on Tuesday, Netflix said it had signed up less than 4 million new subscribers globally for the first three months of the year, well below the 6.25 million that analysts expected. 
For the second quarter, Netflix expects just 1 million new customers, versus earlier expectations of 4.8 million. Shares of the streaming giant were down 7.5% after the company blamed the pandemic for stalling production and hindering its subscriber growth.

""We believe that hit entertainment content is necessary, but not sufficient, to compete in the streaming wars going forward,"" Needham analyst Laura Martin said.

But as the company continues to invest in products that are increasingly popular with children, will the company be able to sustain its momentum?

DUBLIN (Reuters) - A global deal overhauling how multinational companies are taxed is likely this year, an official overseeing the talks said on Wednesday, as low-tax Ireland called for any deal to work for small countries and allow for tax competition.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been coordinating talks among 140 countries for years and aims to reach a consensus by mid-2021, bolstered by a push from the new U.S. administration for a global corporate minimum tax rate. 
""There is momentum, there is a new dynamic that is likely to bring us to a resolution,"" OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans told an online conference organised by the Irish government.
Saint-Amans said a July meeting of G20 finance ministers would be a very important milestone and that if some matters remained outstanding, there will certainly be a deal before G20 leaders meet in October.
Speaking at the same conference, the director general of finance at the Italian finance ministry, Fabrizia Lapecorella, said agreement by July was within reach. Italy is this year's president of the Group of 20 rich and emerging nations.
Ireland is one of the countries with most to lose from the process with big multinationals such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - attracted by the country's 12.5% corporate tax rate - directly accounting for around one in eight jobs in the economy.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said Ireland is committed to reaching an agreement but that the narrative in recent weeks has confirmed his reservations about a global minimum corporate tax rate.
Donohoe said countries must agree on the political principles underlying this concept and must have regard for countries like Ireland that use tax to attract jobs and large investments, adding that such discussions have yet to take place.
The tax system must also facilitate innovation, creativity and investment, he said, a nod to how the Irish regime allows companies to cut their tax bills through research and development. 

""I believe that small countries, and Ireland is one of them, need to be able to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for the real, material and persistent advantage enjoyed by larger countries,"" he said.

Tesla apologized to Chinese consumers for not addressing a customer's complaints in a timely way, and said it would begin a review of its service, according to Reuters.

Global traffic this year will amount to 43% of pre-crisis levels based on passenger numbers and distance flown, the International Air Transport Association said, below the 51% it had forecast late last year.
IATA also predicted industry losses of $47.7 billion in 2021. While that represents an improvement on last year's $126.4 billion deficit, the organisation warned that airlines would continue to need government wage support.
""This crisis is longer and deeper than anyone could have expected,"" Director General Willie Walsh said.
The latest industry outlook also sheds light on the multi-speed recovery underway, with large domestic markets led by the United States and China surging ahead. Europe, by contrast, will see only one-third of its 2019 traffic this year, IATA predicts.

Industry revenue is likely to grow 23% from last year's low to $231 billion, it also forecast - still far below the $607 billion generated a year earlier.
Cargo demand will continue to be a bright spot outpacing passenger traffic with 13.1% growth in 2021 to exceed its 2019 level, IATA predicted. Total cargo volumes are seen at 63.1 million tonnes, close to their pre-crisis peak in 2018.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday said it planned to increase the number of companies that must publish environmental and social data after criticism that the current rules were ineffective.
The EU move follows criticism from investors that the existing regime did not cover enough companies and was not sufficiently clear about what information to disclose and in what form, making it harder to compare and assess firms.
The EU said over three years companies covered by the rules - renamed as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive - would more than triple to around 49,000.
The new rules, which require companies to disclose a broader range of data such as their carbon emissions, would also cover many large privately held companies and, eventually, listed small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
Companies would also be required to obtain limited assurance for their sustainability disclosures from an auditor.
""The whole idea behind this is to have clarity of information for investors, and indeed as a management tool for the companies themselves to move towards sustainability,"" EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said.
The EU also said it would draw up more specific standards in a sign that there is growing pressure to define more clearly what information companies should share with investors and broader society about their environmental and social impact.
Initial standards to cover all the reporting areas would aim to be in place by Oct. 31, 2022, with further, more specific sector disclosure guidelines to follow by Oct. 31, 2023.
The EU plan follows a move by international accounting body the IFRS Foundation to look into creating a global standard setting structure, initially for climate-related disclosures.

The new rules are part of a package of sustainable finance-related regulations the bloc has planned to incentivise companies and investors to help to eliminate the EU's net greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday with tech stocks underperforming after a disappointingly weak quarter from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shook some complacency out of the confidence in growth-oriented tech stocks. 
Netflix said its subscriber growth in the first quarter was well below estimates at 4 million, and said it expects that to slow to only 1 million in the second quarter as the pandemic-fueled surge in new customers fades. 
The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4% to test a two-week low.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared a little better, rising 53 points, or 0.2%, to 33,875 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of the stocks to suffer indirectly from the Netflix effect. Assumptions of rapid growth as far as the eye can see have been challenged this week by hints that Beijing could obstruct its sales in China, after a carefully-orchestrated ‘viral’ protest against its alleged quality shortcoming at an auto salon. The stock fell 2.2%. 
Netflix was one of the undisputed winners of the pandemic, which accelerated a secular trend toward streaming (which the company said last night is still very much intact) and closed off many alternative forms of entertainment. Other stocks that profited from analogous trends in their sectors also weakened on Wednesday on concerns that what the pandemic granted will be taken away by economic reopening. Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock, under pressure this week due to a dispute with regulators over product safety, fell another 3.0%. 
The flip side of Netflix's more sober outlook was support for reopening plays, with cruise stocks and airline stocks both rising - that despite the International Air Travel Association raising its estimate for the sector's losses this year to $47 billion.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock was another to have its growth estimates reassessed after a quarter in which it lost more mobile customers than analysts expected, a further sign that the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile has seriously affected its competitive position. The stock fell 0.1%. Also under pressure from rising competition was Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), which fell another 2.1% in the wake of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s decision to launch a podcast subscription services that encroaches on its turf. 
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) and Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE) stocks also all fell after disappointing quarterly updates, the oilfield services companies falling 5% and to a two-month low, and by 1.6% to a four-month low, respectively, while the renewables specialist fell 2.0%.
Elsewhere, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) ADRs rose over 4% after the Dutch-based maker of machinery for semiconductor foundries forecast a 30% rise in sales this year and reported a stellar first quarter that reflected the extreme tightness in global chip markets. "

BERLIN (Reuters) -Daimler will cut working hours for up to 18,500 employees and temporarily halt production at two plants in Germany due to a shortage of semiconductor chips that has hit global car production, it said on Wednesday.
""Currently, there is a worldwide supply shortage of certain semiconductor components,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We continue to play things by ear."" 
""The situation is volatile, so it is not possible to make a forecast about the impact,"" she added.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), which makes Mercedes-Benz cars, said workers at its plants in Bremen and Rastatt would have their hours shortened.
The move will halt production at the factories but allow staff to continue working on special projects. The production halt will take effect from April 23 for one week, initially.
The move was earlier reported by Focus Online, citing dpa news agency.
The global shortage stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete with the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.

The shortage of chips has hurt vehicle production at carmakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Earlier on Wednesday, automaker Stellantis said it would replace digital speedometers with more old-fashioned analogue ones in one of its Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) models, in a fallout from the shortage of semiconductor chips.

A global semiconductor chip shortage has created a supply crunch and forced automakers to raise prices, a move that is aiding earnings for the sector.
Lithia said its total vehicle gross profit per unit increased 18.7% to $4,392 in the quarter.
Sales are also being boosted by low interest rates and a preference for private vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Just like AutoNation yesterday, Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD)' results were stronger than expected on all fronts,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Rajat Gupta said in a note.
Gupta added Lithia has traditionally maintained a higher level of used supply and the key focus would now be on its ability to maintain growth momentum amid strong demand at lower than historical inventory levels.
Peer AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) on Tuesday posted quarterly adjusted profit that almost tripled from last year.
""With a record $6.5 billion of expected annualized revenue acquired in the first nine months of our 5-year plan, we are well ahead of schedule,"" said Chief Executive Officer Bryan DeBoer.
Earlier this month, Lithia bought Troy-based auto dealer The Suburban Collection, adding its 56 auto dealerships and an expected $2.4 billion in annualized revenue.
Lithia said new vehicle retail sales jumped 59.7% in the quarter ended March 31, while used vehicle retail sales rose 54.6%.
Net income was $156.2 million, or $5.81 per share, in the quarter, compared with $46.2 million, or $1.97 per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue surged 55% to $4.34 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned $5.89 per share, compared with a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $4.76.
Lithia shares were up 3.2% at $386.81 in premarket trade.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were a shade weaker in Wednesday’s premarket, hours after the company unveiled its new line-up comprising colorful iMacs and a new iPad Pro hosting its M1 chip.
But it was the company’s latest gadget, ‘AirTag’, that caught Raymond James analyst Chris Caso’s fancy, who said it could be “a several billion-dollar revenue opportunity”.  
AirTag is an accessory that once attached to an item, helps keep track of and locate objects that are prone to being misplaced, the usual keys and wallets.
Whether attached to a handbag, keys, backpack, or other items, AirTag will work with Apple’s ‘Find My app’ and ‘Find My network’ ecosystem to help locate a lost item, all while keeping location data private and anonymous with end-to-end encryption.
Caso sought to compare AirTag with AirPod, saying that at $30, if the former were to sell at a similar unit volume, it would put annual AirTag revenue at $2 billion–$2.5 billion.
“But it’s certainly reasonable that AirTags would sell at a much higher unit volume vs AirPods, since users would likely buy more than one (tagging ones wallet and keys, for example),"" he wrote in his note.

The Dutch company makes machines used by world’s top companies to produce chips that go into mobiles, laptops, TVs and cars. It also provides software and services that help those companies mass produce patterns on silicon.
First quarter sales were 4.4 billion euros ($5.28 billion), higher than the top end of the 3.9 billion euro-4.1 billion euro range it had given in its forecast on January 20. The numbers beat its own forecasts and ASML said it is seeing strong demand across its product portfolio.
Gross margin at 53.9% was also higher than the forecast of 50%-51%.
With its clients focused on products centered around higher-margin 5G services, AI and high-performance computing solutions, the company sees its “revenue growth towards 30% in 2021 compared to last year.”
Net booking for orders were 4.7 billion euros during January-March, up 12% from 4.2 billion euros in the immediate previous quarter.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche predicted on Wednesday that demand for its drugs would accelerate for the remainder of 2021, after first-quarter sales of COVID-19 tests offset a pandemic-influenced slump in its main pharmaceuticals business. 
Chief Executive Severin Schwan's assessment of the pandemic-disrupted market has ranged from mid-2020 optimism that health care systems were learning to navigate the crisis, to later conceding improvements were taking longer as people skipped doctors visits, cutting demand for drugs.
Schwan now sees hope for the rest of 2021.
""We expect to accelerate the growth in pharma, in particular, for the remainder of the year as vaccinations progress and patients resume their doctor visits,"" Schwan told reporters on a call. 
Roche shares rose 1.5% at 1018 GMT, the strongest performers on Switzerland's benchmark Swiss Market Index.
First-quarter sales were 14.9 billion Swiss francs ($16.3 billion), down 1% from 15.1 billion francs a year earlier, Roche said in a statement. The company did not report a quarterly profit.
Diagnostics sales, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests for everything from active infections to antibodies in people who have recovered, rose 55% to 4.3 billion francs. That contrasts with the drug business, where sales slipped 9% to 10.6 billion francs.
Schwan still sees current-year overall sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range at constant exchange rates, with similar core earnings per share growth, helped in part as COVID-19 testing demand remains robust in months to come. 
PANDEMIC PORTFOLIO
Roche's pandemic portfolio was lifted by Actemra, an arthritis drug repurposed for COVID-19 pneumonia whose revenue rose 22% to 779 million francs, and an anti-COVID-19 antibody cocktail that reaped 166 million francs.
Some positive pandemic news actually resulted in a setback for Roche's trial aspirations.
The company delayed a study of its anti-COVID-19 oral pill in Britain, because rising vaccination rates have checked infections and made finding patients harder.
""You set up sites where there's a lot of COVID, and then by the time you're ready to enrol, the pandemic has moved somewhere else and you're sort of chasing it,"" Roche drugs division chief Bill Anderson said.

Investing.com – Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares slipped big in Wednesday’s premarket a day after the streaming giant reported subscriber additions that were less than two-thirds of its forecast before going on to predict an even smaller increase in the current quarter.  
The shares are now 9% off from their 52-week high of $593.29. 
The company said its global streaming paid net subscriber additions were 3.98 million in the three-month period ended March, nowhere close to its forecast of 6 million.
With key big markets like Brazil and India still reeling under the impact of Covid-19, the company sees the user base rising only by 1 million in the June quarter.
Analysts pointed to the rising likelihood that the boost from the pandemic, which kept billions of people at home for longer periods than usual, is now fading. Traditional entertainment and diversions are now reopening across the U.S. and rising vaccination rates suggest that Europe will soon follow that trend.
“People are bored of sitting at home under lockdown restrictions and many will have exhausted all the classic films and boxsets on Netflix by now,” AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould said.
The company now faces increasing competition too, particularly from Disney+ (NYSE:DIS) which has ramped up content beyond what it had in its library built over decades. However, the company said that subscriber churn had been minimal and that competition had had no marked impact on its business in the quarter.

The global rating agency said its outlook for Japan remains stable, reflecting prospects the world's third-largest economy will achieve average nominal growth of about 1.8% over the next four years.
""Our rating on Japan reflects the country's exceptional external position, prosperous and diversified economy, political stability, and savings-rich financial system,"" S&P said.
""Offsetting these factors are Japan's very weak public finances, which are exacerbated by an aging population and persistently low inflation,"" it said.
The rating agency said Japan's economy has weathered the pandemic ""without serious long-term damage,"" pointing to resilience in its job market that will see employment rebound ""relatively quickly as the pandemic fades away.""
S&P said it may lower the ratings if Japan's economic growth persistently lags that of other major economies and a return to deflation puts long-term pressure on its fiscal health.
The country's ratings may be raised, on the other hand, if the government's efforts to fix the country's finances proceed significantly faster than anticipated, it said.
Japan's economy is emerging from last year's initial blow from the pandemic, though a resurgence in infections is clouding the outlook amid expectations that renewed curbs on activity will be imposed in some prefectures.

Japan's public debt, at twice the size of its economy, is the biggest among advanced economies and continues to increase due to rising social welfare costs of a rapidly ageing population.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, although Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is likely to be a drag on the tech-heavy Nasdaq after reporting a dramatic slowdown in its subscriber growth. 
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 11 points, or 0.1%.
The earnings season is in full swing and companies have generally been handing in solid quarterly results, but the bar is high for earnings to lift the major averages after the recent record highs.
A lot of the market’s focus Wednesday will be on Netflix, after the streaming giant became the first of the so-called FAANG stocks - the five prominent technology companies which dominate the major indices - to report earnings after the close Tuesday.
While Netflix offered up strong first-quarter earnings, it also reported that just under 4 million people signed up from January through March, a pronounced slowdown from the record 15.8 million customers it added a year ago as the pandemic forced people to stay at home. It also estimated it will add just 1 million new streaming customers in the second quarter, way below the forecast of nearly 4.8 million.
Wednesday offers a mix of companies reporting results, with telecoms conglomerate Verizon (NYSE:VZ) the headliner in the morning, while  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) are among the slate of corporates due after the close. Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR)'s guidance may also be scanned for what it says about the health of consumer durables as Americans rediscover their freedom for spending on services.
Elsewhere, investors will be keeping an eye on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after the iPhone maker announced on Tuesday a new line of slim iMac computers and iPads as well as the AirTags product to find lost items. 
There's not much U.S. economic data due for release Wednesday, but the release of the weekly MBA mortgage applications index should give an insight into the state of the housing market.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, falling to the lowest levels this week, as a surprise build in U.S. crude oil supplies renewed fuel demand worries.
U.S. crude oil stocks rose by 436,000 last week, according to data from industry body the American Petroleum Institute, compared with an expected draw of around 3 million barrels. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its inventory data for last week later Wednesday.
Further negative news includes soaring Covid-19 cases in India, the second-biggest net importer of crude oil, as well as in two important regions in Japan, with Tokyo and Osaka both seeking emergency lockdowns to combat the virus. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $61.82 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $65.77.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French luxury house Chanel on Wednesday lost its trademark fight with Huawei Technologies after a top European court said their logos bear no similarity to each other.
The trademark spat underlines how luxury brands jealously guard their signature logos and trademarks that often symbolise luxury, style and exclusivity to millions of people worldwide.
The dispute dated to 2017 when Huawei sought approval from the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), a trademark body, to register its computer hardware trademark which has two vertical interlocking semi-circles.
Privately owned Chanel objected, saying that the design was similar to its registered French logo of two horizontal interlocking semi-circles used for its perfumes, cosmetics, costume jewellery, leather goods and clothing.
In 2019, the trademark office dismissed Chanel's objection, saying there was no similarity and no likelihood of confusion in the mind of the public.
The French luxury house subsequently challenged the ruling at the Luxembourg-based General Court, which dismissed the appeal in its ruling on Wednesday.
""The figurative marks at issue are not similar. The marks must be compared as applied for and registered, without altering their orientation,"" the tribunal of judges said. 
The tribunal said the visual differences in the two logos were significant.
""In particular, Chanel's marks have more rounded curves, thicker lines and a horizontal orientation, whereas the orientation of the Huawei mark is vertical. Consequently, the General Court concludes that the marks are different,"" it said.
The ruling can be appealed to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest.

The case is T-44/20 Chanel v EUIPO - Huawei Technologies.

""We will set up a joint venture between the two companies to bring Gogoro's swapping technology into India and set up swapping infrastructure across the country, and then we will take it to the rest of the world,"" Munjal said in a joint interview with Gogoro founder and CEO Horace Luke.
""We know the landscape, we know the customers, we know the requirements ... We will move very, very fast,"" Munjal said, referring to the company's position as the market leader in India. 
Munjal declined to provide details about the partnership plans such as timeline, sales target or how many battery swapping stations would be built, saying the two companies are working on the specifics. 
Partly funded by investors including Singapore's Temasek and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation, Taipei-based Gogoro in recent years has launched scooter-sharing services in Europe and battery sharing infrastructure in Japan.
At home, albeit being the largest electric scooter maker, Gogoro has for years trailed major players such as Kymco and Sanyang Motor in a competitive market long dominated by lower-priced petrol scooters despite government subsidies on electric vehicles, market data shows.
Gogoro's Luke acknowledged the challenge, saying it would take time for consumers to adopt electric vehicles. But with the scale of Hero, he said, pricing and supply chain complexity would be reduced. 

""That certainly can change the market and flip the market over,"" he said.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",How a sweetheart deal gives GameStop CEO a $179 million goodbye gift,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Gamestop Corp chief executive George Sherman can step down this summer with a $179 million windfall that dwarfs CEO salaries at many larger corporations thanks to a sweetheart deal that was turbocharged by this year's furious meme stock rally, compensation experts said.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) said on Monday that Sherman would step down by July 31. The struggling U.S. videogame retailer has been seeking a new leader to work on its e-commerce transition with chairman Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc..
GameStop decoupled some of Sherman's pay from his performance last year in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and granted him stock when its shares were worth a tiny fraction of their current value, according to a Reuters review of security filings and interviews with compensation consultants. 
As a condition of his exit, GameStop is speeding up the time frame for Sherman to receive the shares, generating the award.
Sherman, who has been CEO since April 2019, forfeited $98 million worth of stock this month because he did not meet performance targets, GameStop disclosed last week. 
Still, he stands to receive a stock payout currently worth $179 million because GameStop granted him more shares linked to his tenure at the company rather than to his performance as most companies do with their CEO, said Eric Hoffmann, a vice president at compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC.
""Investors like awards that are performance-based, that have hard pre-established financial goals that the executives have to meet to earn, as opposed to time-based shares, where they just have to hang on to get them,"" Hoffmann said.
A spokesman at Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop declined to comment. Sherman did not respond to requests for comment. Cohen, GameStop's largest shareholder with a 13% stake, could not be reached for comment.
The value of Sherman's severance payout surpasses annual salaries given to many top U.S. CEOs. ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc CEO Joseph Ianniello took home $112.9 million in realized pay in 2019, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s Jamie Dimon's 2019 realized pay hit $107.8 million, according to the most recent tally by corporate governance data provider CGLytics.
Other GameStop employees will not share in Sherman's windfall. The retailer has been shuttering hundreds of stores, according to securities disclosures.
GameStop's shares closed at $158.53 on Tuesday, a stratospheric rise from around $5 last summer, when the company granted the bulk of the stock award to Sherman. They skyrocketed in January as individual traders on Reddit and other social media platforms snapped them up, squeezing short sellers. 
Reuters reported last year how some companies were shielding executives from the financial fallout of the pandemic by moving from performance-based to time-based payouts. They reasoned that the market disruption made it difficult to meet financial targets, and Sherman will benefit from that trend.
Sherman, 59, has been credited internally with slashing costs and steering GameStop through the pandemic that put other retailers out of business, Reuters reported last week. 
But his 25 years of experience have been largely with brick-and-mortar retailers, such as  Advance Auto Parts  (NYSE:AAP) Inc and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). Cohen wants a top executive with skills better suited for GameStop's digital transformation, Reuters reported.
VESTING OF SHARES
GameStop granted Sherman roughly 925,000 shares last June that he was set to receive in thirds over three years, according to regulatory filings.
He is set to receive them all at once upon his exit under terms of a ""transition agreement"" negotiated this month, as well as roughly 200,000 more shares that had not previously vested, the filings show. The filings do not disclose how GameStop's board decided on these awards.
Sherman also stood to eventually receive 308,477 shares awarded last June that were tied to his performance, separate from the stock he forfeited last week. He agreed to forgo those performance-based shares as well, one of the filings shows. It was not clear whether he would have met the performance targets. 

GameStop has said Sherman plans to remain on the board of directors without pay to help the next CEO transition into the role.

(Reuters) - Bitcoin's volatility is its main attraction and not a bug, as that is what gives the cryptocurrency its exponential rises, ex-Goldman Sachs bitcoin enthusiast Raoul Pal said.
""People have to learn to adapt to an asset that is that volatile... it has such a big upside risk-reward skew,"" Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Wednesday.
The Cayman Islands-based former hedge fund manager said he had a diversified crypto assets portfolio to cover exchanges, decentralised finance (DeFi) and community tokens.
""I'm probably right now 50% bitcoin, 30% ethereum and 20% alternative tokens... to try to keep a balance across the whole space, because I don't really know what's going to win in that space and what's not.""
Bitcoin was trading 2.0% lower at $55,424 on the Bitstamp exchange, and ethereum was down 1.6% at $2,297. 
For a graphic on Price performance of top 6 cryptocurrencies:
https://graphics.reuters.com/CRYPTO-CURRENCY/GMF/bdwpkblqbvm/chart.png
Pal said he had a small exposure to meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin as well, to be ""involved in the fun of it"".
""It becomes the in-joke that becomes a network in itself. Will it last forever? Who the hell knows? But I bought some because the crowd is behind that,"" Pal added.
An 8,000% price increase this year has seen Dogecoin, launched as a satirical critique of 2013's cryptocurrency frenzy, overtake more widely used cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, and briefly Tether, to become the sixth-largest coin. It was trading at $0.3272 on the CoinMarketCap exchange.
Pal said increased regulation and uncertainty could push bitcoin lower.
""I think there's a negative narrative that may happen, where we see more risk come back into the markets,"" Pal said.
However, the markets were more worried about the uncertainty than regulation itself, Pal said, which he expected to benefit bitcoin over the longer term.
""I don't think anybody's going to stop this space,"" he said, adding that governments will eventually arrive at a balance to ensure taxation of crypto assets.
Pal expected the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve to launch their digital currencies in the next three-to-five years, and India to move ""quickly"" in this space too.
India already had ""pretty advanced"" digital payment mechanisms, he said. ""I think India will figure this out eventually.""
A senior government official told Reuters in March that India was expected to propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading or even holding such assets in the country.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it is rolling out biometric technology at its Whole Foods stores around Seattle starting on Wednesday, letting shoppers pay for items with a scan of their palm.
The move shows how Amazon is bringing some of the technology already in use at its namesake brick-and-mortar Go and Books stores to the grocery chain it acquired in 2017.
The system, called Amazon One, lets customers associate a credit card with their palm print. It offers a contact-less alternative to cash and card payments, Amazon said.
The deployment stops short of introducing Amazon's cashier-less technology at Whole Foods, which critics have said would result in job cuts. Amazon One still requires scanning items at checkout, and the company said it will not impact jobs at Whole Foods.

Amazon said its biometric technology will be live at a Whole Foods near its headquarters in Seattle on Wednesday and will expand to seven more stores in the metro area in coming months.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",Emirates may need to raise cash if air travel does not pick up,"DUBAI (Reuters) -Emirates may need to raise more cash this year, possibly through another equity injection from the Dubai government, if demand for air travel does not pick up soon, its president said on Wednesday. 
The state carrier had hoped the global vaccine rollout would renew confidence in air travel but demand remains at very low levels, leaving many airlines to ground planes or fly them near-empty.
""We are good for another six, seven or eight months in terms of cash. We have sufficient cash coming in to be able to keep the day-to-day operation at a neutral basis,"" Tim Clark told the online World Aviation Festival.
""But like everybody else, if in six months global demand is where it is today then we are all going to face difficulties. Not just Emirates"" 
Emirates, which lost 12.6 billion dirhams ($ 3.4 billion) in the first half of the year, got $2 billion in equity in 2020 from the Dubai government, its sole shareholder. 
The airline would make a recommendation to the government on raising cash, Clark said without saying exactly when that would be done.
The recommendation could be for equity injection, or for the airline to raise debt or to take other measures, he said without specifying. 
""The balance sheet is pretty strong regardless of what has happened."" 
The cash situation, however, could be turned around by September-October as long as demand picks up, Clark said, adding that he hoped the airline would not have to seek cash.
Emirates has resumed flights with all of its 151 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 jets which are mainly carrying cargo, with about 20,000 to 30,000 passengers a day.
Clark said the airline could retain some of its older 777 passenger jets that are due to retire and instead convert them into cargo-only planes as freight demand remains high.
He said that he expected there would be demand for business class travel post-pandemic even if corporate travel does diminish through executives opting to hold meetings online instead of travelling.

Demand would likely be supported by cheaper fares to fill business class seats if corporate travel does not rebound, he said.
Clark, who was due to retire last year, said he wanted to set the airline on its future course before he retires, but added he no longer knew when that would be.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Britain's driverless car ambitions hit speed bump with insurers,"By Nick Carey, Paul Lienert and Tina Bellon
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's goal to be a leader in adopting self-driving cars could backfire unless automakers and government regulators spell out the current limitations of the technology, insurance companies warn.
Insurers are key players in the shift to automated driving, with some investing in a technology they believe will slash accidents and deaths, and save them billions in payouts.
But they are worried drivers might equate today's lower levels of automation with fully self-driving vehicles, potentially causing more accidents in the short term and permanently damaging public confidence in the technology. 
""What you describe things as is incredibly important, so people don't use them inappropriately,"" said David Williams (NYSE:WMB), managing director of underwriting at AXA Insurance, whose parent AXA SA (PA:AXAF) made 17 billion euros in revenues from property and casualty insurance, including motor insurance, in 2020. 
""I genuinely believe the world will be a safer place with autonomous vehicles and I really don't want that derailed.""
In what would be a world first, Britain is considering regulating the use of Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS) on its roads, possibly even on motorways at speeds of up to 70 miles (113 km) per hour. It is also deciding whether to describe them to the general public as ""automated"" systems. 
It is that one word - automated - that has stirred controversy and put the country at the centre of a global debate about self-driving terminology at a sensitive moment in its evolution. 
The technology is evolving rapidly and there is no consensus on how to deploy it or what to call some features. Regulations in the Americas, Europe and Asia lag far behind technical developments and issues over accident liability are unresolved.
ALKS use sensors and software to keep cars within a lane, accelerating and braking without driver input. They are ""Level 3"" technology on the auto industry's five point scale towards fully autonomous ""Level 5"" driving - meaning they can operate under specific conditions, but require driver intervention.
However, some experts say ALKS should be called ""assisted-driving technology"" to avoid potentially misleading consumers into believing they can let their attention wander at the wheel. 
The dangers of drivers apparently misunderstanding the limits of technology has already become an issue in the United States, where regulators have been looking into about 20 crashes involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s driver assistance tools, such as its ""Autopilot"" system - a ""Level 2"" technology that requires the driver's constant attention.
Britain's Thatcham Research said it had tested cars with the technologies underpinning ALKS and found they cannot swerve out of lane to avoid obstacles, see pedestrians emerging from cars at roadside, or read road signs. The car can alert the driver to resume control, but with a potentially fatal lag at high speeds. 
""If this technology was really automated and could do what you or I could do, insurers would welcome it,"" said Matthew Avery, Thatcham's research director. 
""But this will lead to confusion, it's going to lead to unnecessary crashes, and potentially injuries or fatalities"" if ALKS are not marketed accurately, he added. 
Britain's transport ministry said its primary concern was public safety and it hadn't decided to permit the use of ALKS at high speeds or whether to call the technology ""automated."" Its decisions are expected later this year.
'PROBLEM CHILD'
The World Health Organization estimates road accidents globally kill around 1.35 million people a year. 
With human error estimated to cause around 90% of accidents, that has attracted considerable interest in automated driving technologies from insurers. 
AXA, for instance, has used UK research projects to gather data to create insurance products for autonomous vehicles and owns a stake in self-driving software startup Oxbotica, which also has funding from Chinese tech giant Tencent.
There is potentially a big economic boost too from embracing the new technology. 
Britain's transport ministry forecasts by 2035 around 40% of new UK cars could have self-driving capabilities, creating up to 38,000 new skilled jobs.
""The UK's adoption of ALKS ... is essential for Britain to remain a world leader in vehicle technology while ensuring our roads remain amongst the safest on the planet,"" Mike Hawes, CEO of UK car industry lobby group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Limited, said, noting the United Nations has approved ALKS in slow moving motorway traffic under 37 miles per hour (60 kph). 
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz has been a pioneer of self-driving technology and is seeking global regulatory approval for its ""Level 3"" Drive Pilot system.
In an email, Daimler called the system ""conditional automated driving"" 
""This is a paradigm change, because the vehicle takes control,"" Daimler said. ""The driver can turn away from what is happening on the road"" to surf the internet, or enjoy ""a relaxing seat massage.""
AXA's Williams attended a presentation of Drive Pilot to the Association of British Insurers last year. 
""It is absolutely amazing, but it is driver assistance,"" he said, and not full automation. 
Neil Ingram, insurer Direct Line's head of motor product management, said it was vital ""Level 3"" technologies were described clearly and accurately. 
""We've known for years the path to full automation was a tricky one and Level 3 has always been the problem child,"" he said. ""If the government decides to designate ALKS systems as automated then that makes it very, very real.""
With proper consumer education, ALKS ""could help in slow moving traffic"", said Anthony Smith, CEO of independent UK consumer watchdog Transport Focus. 
""But the word 'automated' needs careful testing on a few focus groups and we need a better name,"" he said. 
Some in the car industry favour a cautious approach. 
Glen De Vos, chief technology officer at Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), a supplier developing self-driving technology, said automakers should be ""very sensitive"" when describing their systems' capabilities ""because what we don't want to do is oversell.""
Even marketed properly, he said some drivers would abuse the technology. So Aptiv advocates using cameras and sensors inside vehicles to keep drivers engaged. 
""If the driver's behaviour doesn't change, you have to lock them out of the system,"" De Vos said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% after a blistering seven-week rally ran into a bout of profit-taking on Tuesday, when it fell 1.9%.
Some analysts pointed to concerns over the strength of a global economic recovery after India's mounting coronavirus crisis and a global spike in COVID-19 cases.
""While the UK and the US may be moving towards re-opening, it's not necessarily a straight line of recovery,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. ""What's been happening in Brazil and India highlights the fact the virus is a massive issue.""
There were concerns about stretched valuations, with global equities trading at all-time highs and earnings expectations surging as vaccination drives and stimulus programmes support global recovery.
European earnings are expected to rise a record 61% in the first quarter of 2021, according to Refinitiv IBES data, placing Europe on course for a rare outperformance versus corporate America.
The world's second-largest brewer Heineken (OTC:HEINY) NV gained 3.9% after it reported better-than-expected quarterly sales, helped by increased beer sales in Africa and Asia.

575,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>",Bain Capital considering bid to take Toshiba private -sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Bain Capital is looking at formulating a bid to acquire Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, two people familiar with the matter said, making it one of several firms said to be interested in taking the Japanese conglomerate private.
The U.S. firm has entered into discussions with Japanese banks including the core units of Mizuho Financial Group Inc and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc to secure funding, one of the people said.
A preliminary $20 billion buyout offer from CVC Capital Partners this month put Toshiba in play. Toshiba, however, on Tuesday dismissed the CVC bid as lacking in substance although it said it would consider any credible offers.
It is unclear whether Bain will team up with co-investors but the sources did not exclude the possibility.
CVC approached Bain about a joint bid before its offer was made public but Bain was not interested, the first person said.
Bain has successfully tackled a major complex deal that involves Toshiba. 
In 2017, it led a consortium with partners including South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to win an intense and long-fought battle for control of Toshiba's chip unit, now called Kioxia Holdings. Toshiba retains around 40% of Kioxia.
Bain's plans for a Toshiba bid are preliminary and could change, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the information was confidential.
Bain and CVC declined to comment. Mizuho also declined to comment, while representatives for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp could not immediately be reached for comment. Both banks are lenders to Toshiba.
Toshiba said it believed that being publicly traded provided a ""capital structure suitable for enhancing long term value creation"" but added that its board would not disregard various proposals, including those to take the company private.
Private equity giant KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management are also looking at potential bids for Toshiba, the two people and a separate person familiar with the situation said.
KKR declined to comment. A Brookfield representative could not be immediately reached for comment but the company has previously declined to comment on reports of potential bid.
Japan Investment Corp (JIC) and Norinchukin Bank are also considering a bid, a Japanese newspaper has reported.
CVC is not expected to aggressively pursue its bid. In an April 18 letter to Toshiba seen by Reuters it said it would stand by its April 6 proposal but that it would not make a tender offer without consent from Toshiba's board. 
""...we respectfully step aside to await your guidance,"" the letter said.
CVC's proposal had sparked a strong backlash from Toshiba managers, prompting them to lobby the government and its lenders against it, sources have said.
Toshiba CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani this month resigned over the proposal from CVC, his former employer, amid criticism the offer, which promised to retain management, was designed to shield Kurumatani from activist shareholders.
Any buyout of the company, which has a market value of $18 billion, would be the largest such deal in the region this year and one of Japan's biggest.
Hit by accounting scandals, huge writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business and the sale of its semiconductor unit, Toshiba is a shadow of its former self.

But it remains one of Japan's few manufacturers of nuclear power reactors and makes defence equipment including lithium-ion batteries for submarines, meaning any sale of Toshiba would need government approval.
Toshiba shares pared earlier losses to close down 3.3% on Wednesday, marking their fourth consecutive day of decline. The stock price is still up 10% from April 6, a day before it was announced that the company was considering CVC's offer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks gained on Wednesday as early indications of a rebound in European corporate earnings offset concerns over rising COVID-19 infections in Asia that have dampened oil prices.
The STOXX index of 600 European shares was up 0.7% at 436.76 points. Analysts said a 1.9% fall on Tuesday, its worst session this year, was overdone and the benchmark remains near its record high of 443.61 points hit on Monday.
MSCI's index of global shares fell 0.2%. It too had reached record highs on Monday.

""It was priced to perfection and with events in Japan and India ahead of earnings, maybe there were going to be a few potholes along the way, a little bit of risk correction,"" Hewson said.
Recent optimism about rising vaccination rates in the United States, Britain and the European Union is shifting to concern that record coronavirus infections in India and a reinforcement of travel restrictions will act as a brake on the world economy.
Stocks in Tokyo also slumped by 2% due to the growing likelihood that Tokyo, Osaka and surrounding areas will be put under lockdown due to a new wave of coronavirus infections. 
Europe kicked off an earnings season that is expected to deliver 61% profit growth, its biggest surge in more than nine years, on the back of recovery from economic lockdowns.

U.S. crude dipped 0.4% to $62.44 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 0.2% to $66.40 per barrel.
""Renewed concerns about the global economic recovery weighed on commodity prices and commodity currencies. Many countries around the world, such as India and Brazil, set new records for infections and deaths,"" analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) said in a research note.
Analysts said they were looking for steers from the European Central Bank on Thursday, followed by the Federal Reserve and Big Tech earnings on Wall Street next week.
NETFLIX SLUMP
S&P 500 e-mini stock futures were slightly firmer, indicating a potential modest rebound from Tuesday's selloff on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.75%, the S&P 500 lost 0.68%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.92% on Tuesday as investors sold airlines and travel-related shares due to fear of a delayed recovery in global tourism.
Some tech shares and companies that benefited from stay-at-home demand could face further pressure on Wednesday after Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported disappointing subscriber growth for its movie streaming service, which sent its shares down 11% in after-hours trading.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1%. Australian stocks dropped 0.3% but shares in China recouped early losses and rose 0.3% due to positive earnings from the healthcare and banking sectors.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies traded 0.2% higher at 91.358.
Investors are closely watching an auction of 20-year U.S. Treasuries later on Wednesday, which will be an important gauge of global demand for fixed income.
Ahead of the auction results, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes traded at 1.5767%, near a six-week low.

Users can use their discretion to report, delete or open messages, which will be sorted into a hidden requests folder, Instagram said.
The feature, which is only applicable to direct message requests and not the inbox itself, will roll out in some countries in the coming weeks, said Instagram. 

Starting in a few weeks, all users will also have the extended option to entirely block out people from contacting them on Instagram, after blocking their account.

In a statement, S&P said it believed Huarong had a high likelihood of receiving ""extraordinary government support"", but that information disclosure delays and a prolonged inability to access capital markets could prompt a reassessment.
""If the extraordinary government support were not forthcoming, we may need to reassess the support for Huarong's offshore subsidiaries as well as the support for offshore subsidiaries of other Chinese government related entities,"" the statement said. 
S&P placed the ratings of Huarong and its rated subsidiaries on watch for possible downgrades earlier this month after China Huarong delayed the release of its 2020 earnings. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch also said they were reviewing ratings.
The earnings delay and a muted official response have led to concern among bond investors over the strength of implicit government backing of offshore subsidiaries of state-owned enterprises. 
Those fears have eased this week following regulatory reassurance and after a key Huarong offshore subsidiary said it recorded a profit in the first quarter.
A portfolio manager said the market's confidence nevertheless remained fragile amid fears that foreign bondholders could still be subject to haircuts on their investments.
But S&P said it expected policymakers to prevent worries over Huarong's creditworthiness from evolving into systemic financial instability that could affect its sovereign rating for China, of A+ with a stable outlook.
""The government has said little about the situation so far. However, we believe they are ready to act if the stress on Chinese financial markets show signs of escalating significantly,"" said S&P Global Ratings sovereign credit analyst KimEng Tan. 

""Policymakers view maintaining stability as a top priority.""

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, rebounding from their worst daily loss so far this year, boosted by strong corporate earnings which have calmed concerns about the march of Covid-19 in India. 
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6%, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5%, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 climbed 0.6%, after dropping nearly 2% on Tuesday.
Tech stocks were the top gainers, with semiconductor equipment maker ASML (AS:ASML) stock climbing 4.8% after it raised its full-year sales forecast to reflect the plans of major chipmakers to increase capacity and address the current global shortage.
Smaller rival ASM International (OTC:ASMIY) stock also rose 0.6%, while Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock slipped 0.7% despite the Swedish telecoms company beating first-quarter profit expectations, helped by sales of 5G equipment.
Elsewhere, Heineken (OTC:HEINY) stock rose 3.5% after the world’s second-largest brewer’s trading update pointed to better-than-expected beer volumes for the first quarter. 
 Kering  (PA:PRTP) stock rose 0.4% after the French luxury group’s leading brand, Gucci, returned to growth, and Roche (SIX:RO) stock rose 0.9% after the Swiss drugmaker confirmed its guidance for the year despite a small drop in sales.
On the flip side, Akzo Nobel (OTC:AKZOY) stock fell 0.8% despite the Dutch paints company reporting a 90% increase in first-quarter profit, while announcing a $1.2 billion share buyback program. The stock has already hit a series of record highs this year as its paints and coatings business gained momentum and market share.
Juventus (MI:JUVE) stock slumped 10% after the breakaway European Super League, of which the Italian soccer club is a founder member, was rocked by the departure of its six English clubs.
Concerns remain that record coronavirus infections in India and the reinforcement of travel restrictions will act as a brake on the global economy.
India, the world's second most populous country, reported its worst daily death Covid toll on Tuesday from the world's highest number of new daily cases. This has led to the imposition of a six-day lockdown throughout much of the country, as well many countries putting India on their banned travel list.
Back in Europe, U.K. consumer price inflation rose 0.7% on the year in March, slightly below the 0.8% expected, illustrating that the Bank of England is under no immediate pressure to tighten its ultra easy monetary policies. 
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, handing back some of the year’s strong gains as concerns over a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in India, the world’s third largest crude importer, and a surprise build in U.S. crude oil supplies renewed fuel demand worries.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its inventory data for last week later on Wednesday.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>",Analysis: Faux meat growth doubts give market food for thought on Impossible,"By Siddharth Cavale and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - A cooling of the U.S. stock market's taste for plant-based meat makers has raised doubts among some investors and analysts about Impossible Foods' plans to achieve a $10 billion flotation.
Impossible is seeking to go public through an initial public offering or via a merger with a blank-check company within the next 12 months, sources told Reuters this month.
The market value of larger competitor Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), however, has sunk from a peak of $14 billion to closer to $8.5 billion and is predicted by several brokerages to fall further.
Both firms carry expectations of being big players in a so-called faux meat market which some predict could be worth $85 billion a year by 2030 as dietary habits shift. 
But with retail sales of some products sliding, four sectoral investors told Reuters that Beyond's 420% rise in value since listing in September 2019 was now seen as overcooked.
""It's pretty shocking when you see some of these valuations come out,"" said Patrick Morris, whose Eat Beyond vehicle has invested in three Canada-listed plant-based ventures.
""The $10 billion for Impossible Foods, with Beyond Meat at $8 or $8.5 billion? The first reaction is that these valuations are coming from outer space,"" added Morris, who said he is looking at investing in Impossible if it opens its books. 
Some existing investors have told Impossible that it should aim to go public at a valuation below where Beyond is trading, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
Impossible declined to comment. 
BIG DEALS
While the signs remain positive for plant-based food, COVID-19 has halted restaurant sales, and sector studies suggest that the industry has yet to convincingly win over shoppers.
Nevertheless, both Beyond and Impossible have signed deals with major restaurant and grocery chains and the U.S. industry as a whole grew by 44% last year during the pandemic. 
Revenues at Beyond and some other producers are growing, but the rate of volume sales growth of fresh and fully cooked plant-based meat alternatives has been declining steadily at U.S. retail stores since July last year, NielsenIQ data shows.
Unit sales growth eased from 32.6% in the July to September period last year to 1% in January to March quarter of 2021, when compared to the same period a year ago, the data showed.
Beyond's sales overall were still just $407 million last year, and its stock trades at nearly 21 times sales per share, according to Refinitiv data, versus 1.6 times and 1.9 times for Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), which last year had sales of $13.78 billion and $26.19 billion respectively.
""Food companies need to trade in a multiple that has some logic to it,"" said Christopher Kerr, Chief Investment Officer at Unovis Asset Management, an early investor in Beyond Meat who cashed out and now holds stakes in Oatly and Zero Egg. 
""The question is can they get to something that represents market valuation tied to revenues ... right now we're seeing some pretty premium valuations out there,"" Kerr added.
(Graphic: Beyond Meat market cap -https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/jznpnandjvl/Beyond%20market%20cap.PNG)
SPAC BOOM
One reason for the valuation floated for Impossible is the boom in special-purpose acquisition deals and initial offerings that has seen big jumps for a range of start-ups at launch. 
Brian Schaeffer, managing director of private equity trading platform InvestX, which allows investors to trade in pre-IPO companies, said Impossible had been one of the top five traded stocks on the platform since introducing it this year. 
""The SPAC trend is super aggressive right now ...so those kind of public valuations are being translated into interest on the private platforms,"" Schaeffer added.
Some market debuts, however, have not gone as well. 
British-based food delivery service Deliveroo flopped on its debut last month. 
While Impossible does not publish sales numbers, some industry estimates give it a less than 4% share of the U.S. imitation meat industry, compared with Beyond Meat's 25%. 
Beyond has signed deals with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum Brands while Impossible last year gave up on McDonald's, citing its inability to supply on the required scale.
Impossible's burgers and sausages are available at only 20,000 stores globally, versus Beyond's 122,000 and it is still seeking regulatory approval in Europe and mainland China, where the genetically modified yeast it uses is banned.
""There is so much money (from SPACs) looking for so few places to go, because the space is so new,"" Curt Albright, managing member of alternative protein investment firm Clear Current Capital said. 

""Whether the valuations are too much or too little, that the market will figure out eventually.""

PARIS (Reuters) -Europe's largest food retailer,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), said it would buy back up to 500 million euros ($601 million) of its shares this year, reflecting confidence in the success of its turnaround plan following a strong first quarter.
Carrefour, which last month agreed to buy Brazil's third-biggest food retailer Grupo BIG for about $1.3 billion, also maintained its financial and operational targets under its 'Carrefour 2022' strategic plan.
""Our confidence in the success of our transformation plan, as well as in our ability to generate high cash flow, is further strengthened,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard said in a statement. 
""In line with our capital allocation policy, we are seizing the opportunity offered by current market conditions to announce a share buyback.""
The buyback will be Carrefour's first in more than a decade.
First quarter sales reached 18.56 billion euros, marking like-for-like growth of 4.2% and reflecting robust food sales in the key markets of Brazil, France and Spain.
In France alone, sales growth reached 3.5% in the first quarter, with Carrefour outperforming in each of its channels: hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience and the Drive.
That performance reflects the success of a method that puts customer satisfaction and in-store execution at the heart of all commercial initiatives, the group said.
By early April, with new lockdown measures in place in France, although less strict than previous lockdowns, growth remained solid, including in hypermarkets.
Carrefour and food retailers worldwide have benefited from demand generated as lockdowns over COVID-19 forced consumers to stay at home.
Carrefour is in the midst of a five-year plan launched in January 2018 to cut costs and boost e-commerce investment.

The plan aims to boost profits and revenues, and fend off competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Wednesday after suffering their worst daily loss so far this year on Tuesday, amid hopes that a positive corporate earnings season will calm concerns about the march of Covid-19 in India.

Akzo Nobel (OTC:AKZOY) will be in focus after the Dutch paints company reported a 90% increase in first-quarter profit, while announcing a $1.2 billion share buyback program. The stock has already hit a series of record highs this year as its paints and coatings business gained momentum and market share.
ASML (AS:ASML), the Dutch maker of chipmaking equipment, raised its 2021 guidance after first-quarter net profit soared, while the Swiss drugmaker Roche (SIX:RO) confirmed its guidance for this year despite its sales falling slightly in the first quarter. 
Still, some tech shares and companies that benefited from stay-at-home demand could face pressure after U.S. streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported disappointing subscriber growth for its movie streaming service late Tuesday.
Additionally, recent optimism about rising vaccination rates in the United States, Britain, and Europe is shifting to concern that record coronavirus infections in India and the reinforcement of travel restrictions will act as a brake on the global economy.
India, the world's second most populous country, reported its worst daily death Covid toll on Tuesday from the world's highest number of new daily cases.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group aims to raise 20 billion yuan ($3.08 billion) for its commercial property management business, before listing the unit in Hong Kong by year-end, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Wanda is targeting primarily private equity investors for Wanda Light Asset Commercial Management Co, aiming for a valuation of 200 billion yuan, said the people.
Several prospective investors tapped by Wanda and its financial advisors, however, have found that valuation ""too high"", one of the people said.
The conglomerate, owned by Wang Jianlin - once China's richest person - aims to complete the fundraising by July and file for an initial public offering (IPO) in September, they said.
Wanda Group did not respond to a request for comment.
The people declined to be identified as the information is confidential.
Chinese developers and real estate managers raised a record $10.4 billion in Hong Kong listings last year, showed data from Refinitiv.
China Evergrande Group, Sunac China Holdings Ltd and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd all floated property management businesses last year. The three are currently trading way above their IPO prices.
If Wanda sold a 10% stake - as is typical for a sizeable IPO - then a 200 billion yuan valuation would make the float Hong Kong's biggest for a property manager at least since 2016, surpassing the $1.8 billion November float of Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd.
The listing plan comes after the unit's debt-laden parent, Wanda Commercial Management Group - China's biggest commercial property developer - withdrew a domestic IPO application in March, saying it would revamp its assets and pursue an overseas listing.
The unit, tasked with managing 368 Wanda Plazas plus 155 under construction, secured 3 billion yuan of investment from the government of the southern city of Zhuhai, the parent said last month.
One of the sources said the local government would count as a lead investor in the pre-IPO fundraising.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",Foxconn mostly abandons $10 billion Wisconsin project touted by Trump,"By David Shepardson and Karen Pierog
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn is drastically scaling back a planned $10 billion factory in Wisconsin, confirming its retreat from a project that former U.S. President Donald Trump once called ""the eighth wonder of the world.""
Under a deal with the state of Wisconsin announced on Tuesday, Foxconn will reduce its planned investment to $672 million from $10 billion and cut the number of new jobs to 1,454 from 13,000. 
The Foxconn-Wisconsin deal was first announced to great fanfare at the White House in July 2017, with Trump boasting of it as an example of how his ""America first"" agenda could revive U.S. tech manufacturing. 
For Foxconn, the investment promise was an opportunity for its charismatic founder and then-chairman, Terry Gou, to build goodwill at a moment when Trump's trade policies threatened the company's cash cow: building Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones in China for export to America. 
Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronic devices, proposed a 20-million-square-foot manufacturing campus in Wisconsin that would have been the largest investment in U.S. history for a new location by a foreign-based company.
It was supposed to build cutting-edge flat-panel display screens for TVs and other devices and instantly establish Wisconsin as a destination for tech firms.
But industry executives, including some at Foxconn, were highly skeptical of the plan from the start, pointing out that none of the crucial suppliers needed for flat-panel display production were located anywhere near Wisconsin. 
The plan faced local opposition too, with critics denouncing a taxpayer giveaway to a foreign company and provisions of the deal that granted extensive water rights and allowed for the acquisition and demolition of houses through eminent domain.
As of 2019, the village where the plant is located had paid just over $152 million for 132 properties to make way for Foxconn, plus $7.9 million in relocation costs, according to village records obtained by Wisconsin Public Radio and analyzed by Wisconsin Watch.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said the new agreement gives it ""flexibility to pursue business opportunities in response to changing global market conditions."" The company said ""original projections used during negotiations in 2017 have at this time changed due to unanticipated market fluctuations.""
After abandoning its plans for advanced displays, Foxconn later said it would build smaller, earlier-generation displays in Wisconsin, but that plan never came to fruition either. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-wisconsin-exclusive/exclusive-foxconn-reconsidering-plans-to-make-lcd-panels-at-wisconsin-plant-idUSKCN1PO0FV)
Prior to Tuesday's announcement, Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told reporters in Taipei that the company currently makes servers, communications technology products and medical devices in Wisconsin, adding that electric vehicles (EVs) have a ""promising future"" there. He did not elaborate. 
Liu had previously said the infrastructure was there in Wisconsin to make EVs because of its proximity to the traditional heartland of U.S. automaking, but the company could also could decide on Mexico. 
Hon Hai shares fell as much as 1.6% on Wednesday morning, underperforming the broader Taiwan market which was down 0.7%.
INCENTIVES
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said the new agreement will save Wisconsin taxpayers ""a total of $2.77 billion compared to the previous contract, maintain accountability measures requiring job creation to receive incentives, and protect hundreds of millions of dollars in local and state infrastructure investments made in support of the project.""
Evers said under the deal negotiated between the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and Foxconn, the Taiwan company is eligible to receive up to $80 million in performance-based tax credits over six years if it meets employment and capital investment targets. He stressed that the incentives were in line with those available to any company.
The state will reduce the tax credits authorized for the project to $80 million from $2.85 billion.
The original Wisconsin package also included local tax incentives and road and highway investments by state and local governments, which brought total taxpayer-funded subsidies to more than $4 billion.

Foxconn noted that since 2017, it has invested $900 million in Wisconsin, including several different facilities in the state.
The state has already spent more than $200 million on road improvements, tax exemptions and grants to local governments for worker training and employment, according to the records obtained by Wisconsin Public Radio.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Wednesday morning, following in U.S. shares’ footsteps as COVID-19 cases continue to resurge globally and overshadowing recent solid corporate earnings.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 2.07% by 10:59 PM ET (2:59 AM GMT) with Tokyo and Osaka reportedly due to ask that a state of emergency be declared in the country’s two biggest cities.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.50% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 1.39%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.67%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.10% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.39%.
Shares in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) climbed after the company reported its largest revenue growth in 11 quarters earlier in the week. However, United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) reported a bigger-than-expected loss and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares also fell in post-market trading after its first-quarter subscriber growth fell short of the average analyst estimate.
Global shares came under pressure after climbing to record highs after rising COVID-19 cases globally introduced the possibility of fresh restrictive measures, threatening the already-fragile economic recovery. The number of COVID-19 cases globally surpassed the 142.5-million mark as of Apr. 21, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Slower-than-expected COVID-19 vaccine uptake numbers and concerns about side effects have also hampered the global economic recovery after positive uptake numbers were recently reported in the U.S., U.K. and Europe.
U.S. health agencies recommended pausing the usage of Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) single-shot vaccine during the previous week as potential side effects are investigated. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is due to reach a decision about the vaccine on Friday, the European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that it would resume use of the jab.
“The data is very mixed: on the positive side we have great vaccine rollouts that are happening and then the negative is that we have the J&J vaccine being halted,” Kayne Anderson Rudnick portfolio manager Julie Biel told Bloomberg.
“Is that going to create more vaccine hesitancy? How much of that is going to impact longer-term the ability to reopen?” The end of the pandemic “is going to be much more of a push-pull, it’s going to happen in increments,” Biel added.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 11:50PM ET</span>",Australian state seeks to build onshore mRNA vaccine site,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Victoria state on Wednesday unveiled plans to develop an onshore messenger-RNA (mRNA) vaccine manufacturing facility and launched three mass coronavirus immunisation centres to speed up the national inoculation programme.
Victoria would spend A$50 million ($39 million) initially to set up the mRNA facility in the state, which authorities said could become the first such centre in the southern hemisphere. The mRNA technology is used in COVID-19 vaccines developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Australia's immunisation drive was thrown into disarray earlier this month after the government restricted the use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, which uses a different technology and is the mainstay of the country's inoculation drive, due to rare bloodclotting cases.
""It is vital that we can develop and manufacture mRNA vaccines and treatments locally to ensure we have vaccine security here in Australia and across our region,"" Victoria Acting Premier James Merlino said in a statement.
Several countries are trying to procure more COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna Inc, that use the mRNA technology, as no major side effects have been identified so far among vaccine recipients.
Reports of possible links between vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and rare blood clotting issues have sidelined those shots.
Australia currently produces AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccines in the country but earlier this month restricted its rollout to people above 50 years.
Merlino said he is liaising with the federal government on the plan and estimated the cost to build the plant could be in ""the hundreds of millions of dollars"". It could take at least a year for the vaccines to be made in the country, he said. 
Victoria, meanwhile, set up three mass immunisation centres in the state on Wednesday to administer AstraZeneca vaccines for anyone above 70 years.
Though Australia has fared much better than many other developed countries during the pandemic, with around 29,500 cases and 910 deaths, only about 1.70 million total doses have been administered so far, far short of the 4 million pledged by end-March.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 10:50PM ET</span>","In Japan Inc, activist investors come in from the cold","By Makiko Yamazaki and Noriyuki Hirata
TOKYO (Reuters) - Yasuo Takeuchi remembers the horror he felt in 2017 when, as chief financial officer of Japan's Olympus Corp, he was told an activist investor had taken a stake in the company: the barbarians were at the gate.
But as he listened to proposals from ValueAct Capital, Takeuchi began to see the San Francisco-based fund as a potential catalyst for change at Olympus, which was still reeling from an accounting scandal and, he believed, remained too domestic in its outlook. 
Fast forward to 2021, a leaner Olympus is on track to double its operating profit margin to 20% by the next financial year.
Olympus is a notable example of how attitudes at some Japanese companies have quietly changed in recent years. The government's recent push for better governance has brought in a wave of seasoned global activists, such as Elliott Management and Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), to Japan; the number of activist funds operating in the country has also more than doubled in three years.
In 2019, Olympus brought a ValueAct partner, Robert Hale, onto its board. ValueAct owned more than 5% of Olympus, the fund's first investment in Japan, before selling some of that late last year.
""I was ready to turn all of our business as usual upside down,"" Takeuchi, now CEO, said of the time he brought Hale on board.
""Rob really watches the company closely and analyses it. He has often given us some great insight in how to execute,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Olympus has since overhauled the traditional seniority-based pay and brought in more overseas executives to make management more global. Takeuchi credits ValueAct with helping him ""think deeper"" about governance, leading to the creation of nominating, audit and compensation committees.
Efforts to become a global medical-technology firm have accelerated. Olympus has bought several overseas medical-equipment firms and sold its digital camera business that had been a long-time money-loser. 
Takeuchi said Hale never told Olympus to sell the camera business, only that he ""pointed out issues, like other external directors"". 
Hale has also helped Olympus communicate its changes to the market, so as to have a greater impact, Takeuchi said. 
Investors appear to be taking note. The company's shares have nearly trebled since early 2019, versus about a 30% gain in the TOPIX index.
ValueAct declined to comment on the story.
'MORE CONVINCING'
Investors, particularly foreign ones, have long argued that many Japanese companies are unresponsive to shareholders and need to improve governance. Issues around governance and management have come under the spotlight in accounting and other scandals at Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, Olympus and elsewhere.
Olympus' plan to boost efficiency ""became more convincing around the time it decided to invite ValueAct to its board,"" said Takashi Akahane, senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
Japanese chip and display materials maker JSR Corp, which is more than 7% owned by ValueAct, is also inviting Hale onto its board.
The company hopes the American's knowledge and expertise will boost its corporate value, said Director Hideki Miyazaki. It wants to speed up decision making and become more global, Miyazaki said.
Joe Bauernfreund, chief executive of London-based Asset Value Investors (AVI), says he sees clear changes at Japanese companies.
As a foreign investor focusing largely on smaller companies, his fund rarely got to meet directors of companies a few years ago, he said. ""I think there definitely is a willingness on the part of companies now to work in a more constructive manner with so-called activists.""
Activists themselves are also taking a different tack, moving away from hostile takeover threats seen decades ago to a focus on governance and long-term corporate value. That approach, experts say, is likely to have more success - and gain more support from conventional institutional investors.
Last month, a motion by Singapore-based activist investor Effissimo Capital Management in Toshiba Corp won approval at a shareholder vote, the first time at such a high profile company in Japan.
Still, experts note it is too early to say shareholder activism has taken full root in Japan.
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group's rejection of Third Point's proposal to spin off its chip unit is a prominent recent example, and despite Effissimo's success at Toshiba's vote the firm's management is yet to fully embrace the activist investor.

""Companies like Olympus are a few exceptions, with most firms hoping to stay away from activists,"" Kazunori Suzuki, professor at Waseda Business School, said. ""But if those early examples prove successful and receive public acclaim, others may follow suit.""

597,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>","Home cooking, booze demand fire up global grocery sales in 2020 - report","(Reuters) - The global grocery sector grew a record 10% in 2020, industry data showed on Wednesday, as people stuck at home under COVID-19 restrictions cooked, baked and drank more. 
Market researcher Kantar said everything from canned meat and beer to sugar and bleaches flew off the shelves, with the United States accounting for the largest chunk of the spending, followed by Western Europe, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia.
Data for the report was collected from households in 42 countries, representing 66% of the global population and 83% of gross domestic product (GDP), Kantar said. 
Beverages, dairy and food, which typically account for almost two-thirds of global grocery sales, saw the biggest gains, with 15 of the top 20 categories most positively impacted by COVID-19 coming from these sectors, according to Kantar's 2021 global FMCG Omnichannel report released on Wednesday.
Growth in scratch cooking and home baking powered sales of canned meat up 26%, sugar and sweeteners up 15% and herbs and seasonings up 13%, the Kantar report showed, with Latin American customers driving the gains in most of the food categories.
Western Europeans, who had dealt with some of the most prolonged lockdowns, nursed their boredom with alcohol, pushing up sales more than five times in 2020, compared with 2019. 
Western Europe and Latin America alcohol sales grew 25% and 20%, respectively, while Asians were more sober in their approach to the pandemic with sales falling 10% in the region last year from 2019.  
The pandemic also led to a big shift in where people shopped.
E-commerce as a channel saw the highest growth in sales, followed by cash-and-carry stores and discounters. E-commerce on the whole now accounts for 6.5% of grocery sales globally, the report said. 

Among retailers, supermarkets saw strong share gains in the United States while discounters grew in Eastern Europe.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>",U.S. watchdog will review FAA decision to unground Boeing 737 MAX,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said on Tuesday it will audit the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) November decision to unground the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and other agency decisions.
The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months killed 346 people. The FAA approved its return to service after significant safety enhancements developed during the plane's 20-month grounding.
The new audit will examine the FAA’s actions following the two accidents, including the the agency's risk assessments, the grounding of the aircraft and the subsequent recertification, the inspector general's office said. Boeing declined to comment.
The inspector general's office added ""its objective is to evaluate FAA’s processes and procedures for grounding
aircraft and implementing corrective actions.""
The FAA said it ""will cooperate fully with the Inspector General’s audit, as it has with all other outside reviews of the agency’s oversight of the Boeing 737 MAX.""
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in November he was ""100% confident"" in the safety of the 737 MAX.
The FAA imposed new training requirements to deal with a key safety system called MICAS that was blamed for the two fatal crashes as well as significant new safeguards and other software changes to ensure the system does not erroneously activate.
The inspector general issued two prior reports on the 737 MAX including one in February that outlined ""weaknesses"" in the FAA's certification of the aircraft.

Legislation signed into law in December revamped the FAA’s aircraft certification program and required an independent review of Boeing's safety culture.
Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department in January as part of a deferred prosecution agreement after the government said the crashes ""exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world’s leading commercial airplane manufacturers.""

Investing.com – The Dow slipped Tuesday, as rising global coronavirus cases triggered fresh jitters over global growth, prompting investors to hit pause on cyclical stocks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.75%, or 256 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.68%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.92%.
Investors sweating over the Covid-19 pandemic was widely thought to be in the rearview mirror, but a spike in cases globally has sparked jitters over global growth.
Energy led the broader market to downside, slipping more than 2% as investors reined in bets that global travel would return sooner rather than later to inject life into energy demand at a time when the market is oversupplied.
APA (NASDAQ:APA),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) fell sharply on the day. 
Industrials also played a role in the broader market selloff, paced by a decline in Boeing (NYSE:BA) as sentiment on the aviation sector soured following weaker guidance from United Airlines.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) guided capacity to be down 45% year-on-year in the second quarter, suggesting that investor optimism for a faster-than-expected snapback in travel was perhaps misplaced.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL)LL were nursing heavy losses, with the latter down more 6%.
Financials were also on the back foot, with banks bearing the brunt of the selling exacerbated by a fall in U.S. bond yields. The U.S. 10-year yields slipped to 1.56% down 38 basis points.
Tech stocks struggled to take advantage of the slip in U.S. bond yields, which had kept a lid on growth last month, as investors awaited for quarterly earnings updates from the first cohort of the FANG stocks.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriber adds after the bell missed Wall Street estimates, sending the stock down more than 10% in the aftermarket session. The streaming giant blamed the weaker net adds on pull-forward demand from last year. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was in focus after its kicking off its first product event for the year. Apple's new iPad product line grabbed most of the attention, with some on Wall Street suggesting that it could spark a wave of demand.
""We estimate less than half of iPad users globally have gone through a refresh the last year with some clear pent-up demand that these new iPads will unleash in the next few quarters thus giving Apple another product tailwind,"" Wedbush said.
Elsewhere in tech,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shrugged off the selloff to rise more than 3% as investors cheered big blue's return to quarterly revenue growth.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ended up 2% after following better-than-expected first-quarter results and reports that some countries had lifted the pause on its Covid-19 vaccine.
Despite the day of red on Wall Street, analysts continued to back the equity bull run, dubbing the selloff a correction.
""So the message here is that yes- the U.S. equities markets are frothy / extended here and thus may be vulnerable to higher volatility ahead; however we are not seeing technical signs that are conducive to prior secular peaks. In other words- brace yourself for a correction, but not the end of the bull market,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said."

(Reuters) - When AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) report their first-quarter results this week, investors will look for clarity on capital spending and margin pressures as wireless carriers shell out billions to upgrade their networks to 5G.
Analysts have been bullish about the pandemic helping the telecom sector, but some have flagged concerns over the rising costs of 5G deployments. Some carriers have paid huge sums in a recent spectrum auction, limiting their ability to spend on infrastructure.
In February, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) won $78 billion in bids in the government's auction of C-Band spectrum, which is seen as the most likely short-term source of available spectrum for next-generation 5G networks.
""We expect upward pressure on Big 3 capex because of the enormous spectrum investments they've made in 2020 and 2021,"" Bernstein analyst Peter Supino said.
Graphic: Capital expenditure at U.S. telecoms set to rise in 2021 - https://graphics.reuters.com/VERIZON-RESULTS/azgvoxjqlpd/chart.png
THE CONTEXT 
Wall Street on average expects AT&T to incur $18.54 billion in capital expenditure this year, an increase of 18% over last year, while Verizon's spending is expected to rise about 10% to nearly $20 billion.
The onset of the 5G era has left customers exploring various available options from among the big three carriers that continue to invest in the rapidly evolving technology, thereby intensifying competition.
Brokerage JP Morgan expects margins at the big three carriers to contract in the second quarter as economies reopen and companies burn cash on aggressive promotions to snap up customers.

Investing.com -- Covid-19 fears are back, sending stocks lower despite really great earnings reports. Energy, financials, airlines and industrials were lower, and even tech -- save for  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), which rallied on its results -- failed to save the day. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced a new iPad product line, prompting hopes that there will be demand for them.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose after earnings results and a resumed vaccine rollout for Europe. The U.S. still hasn't chimed in on a possible return of the vaccine.
We have more earnings coming, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) out today.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Watch Netflix
And by that we don't mean settle into the couch and binge Who Killed Sara? Keep an eye on shares for a reaction to earnings post-market Tuesday. Chances are the streaming giant won't match its record haul of new users from last year's Covid-induced surge, but will it eclipse its own 6 million prediction?
2. More earnings
Wednesday offers a mix of company's reporting results. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the headliner in the morning, while managed-health heavyweight Anthem is also due premarket.  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) are among the slate of companies dues after the close.
3. Mortgage applications 
There's not much on the economic data front, but we do get some insight into home buying via the MBA mortgage applications index. Last week it fell to 3.7%, it's sixth-straight week of declines.

The hearing followed Alvance Aluminium's decision last week to file for voluntary administration for the factories in central France - Alvance Aluminium Wheels, Alvance Aluminium Poitou and Alvance Foundry Poitou.
""All three businesses have faced structural changes in their markets which have been compounded by COVID-19 and a reduction in working capital support available from GFG Alliance following the collapse of Greensill Capital,"" an Alvance spokesman said.
The collapse of supply chain finance firm Greensill, a major creditor of GFG, has forced the group to seek new funding.
Greensill was a major source of funding for Gupta as he bought up struggling metals manufacturing facilities in recent years, including several French sites.
The commercial court in Paris that heard Alvance's request was due to issue a decision on Friday detailing the duration of an administration period, Gery Begeault, a CGT union representative at Alvance Aluminium Poitou, said.

Alvance also owns an aluminium smelter in Dunkirk that is Europe's largest primary aluminium production site.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>",Tesla drives on Autopilot through a regulatory grey zone,"By Hyunjoo Jin, David Shepardson and Tina Bellon
BERKELEY, California (Reuters) - The fatal crash of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with no one apparently behind the wheel has cast a new light on the safety of semi-autonomous vehicles and the nebulous U.S. regulatory terrain they navigate.
Police in Harris County, Texas, said a Tesla Model S smashed into a tree on Saturday at high speed after failing to negotiate a bend and burst into flames, killing one occupant found in the front passenger seat and the owner in the back seat.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Monday that preliminary data downloaded by Tesla indicate the vehicle was not operating on Autopilot, and was not part of the automaker's ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) system. 
Tesla's Autopilot and FSD, as well as the growing number of similar semi-autonomous driving functions in cars made by other automakers, present a challenge to officials responsible for motor vehicle and highway safety.
U.S. federal road safety authority, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has yet to issue specific regulations or performance standards for semi-autonomous systems such as Autopilot, or fully autonomous vehicles (AVs).
There are no NHTSA rules requiring carmakers to ensure systems are used as intended or to stop drivers misusing them. The only significant federal limitation is that vehicles have steering wheels and human controls required under federal rules.
With no performance or technical standards, systems such as Autopilot inhabit a regulatory grey area.
The Texas crash follows a string of crashes involving Tesla cars being driven on Autopilot, its partially automated driving system which performs a range of functions such as helping drivers stay in lanes and steer on highways.
Tesla has also rolled out what it describes as a ""beta"" version of its FSD system to about 2,000 customers since October, effectively allowing them to test how well it works on public roads.
Harris County police are now seeking a search warrant for the Tesla data and said witnesses told them the victims intended to test the car's automated driving.
NO REQUIREMENTS
Adding to the regulatory confusion is that traditionally NHTSA regulates vehicle safety while departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) in individual states oversee drivers.
When it comes to semi-autonomous functions, it may not be apparent whether the onboard computer or the driver are controlling the car, or if the supervision is shared, says the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
California has introduced AV regulations but they only apply to cars equipped with technology that can perform the dynamic driving task without the active physical control or monitoring of a human operator, the state's DMV told Reuters. 
It said Tesla's full self-driving system does not yet meet those standards and is considered a type of Advance Driver Assistance System that it does not regulate. 
That leaves Tesla's Autopilot and its FSD system operating in regulatory limbo in California as the automaker rolls out new versions of the systems for its customers to test.
NHTSA, the federal body responsible for vehicle safety, said this week it has opened 28 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 24 of which remain active, and at least four, including the fatal Texas accident, occurred since March. 
NHTSA has repeatedly argued that its broad authority to demand automakers recall any vehicle that poses an unreasonable safety risk is sufficient to address driver assistance systems.
So far, NHTSA has not taken any enforcement action against Tesla's advanced driving systems.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said NHTSA is ""actively engaged with Tesla and local law enforcement"" on the Texas crash.
The NTSB, a U.S. government agency charged with investigating road accidents, has criticized NHTSA's hands-off approach to regulating cars with self-driving features and AVs.
""NHTSA refuses to take action for vehicles termed as having partial, or lower level, automation, and continues to wait for higher levels of automation before requiring that AV systems meet minimum national standards,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt wrote in a Feb. 1 letter to NHTSA.
""Because NHTSA has put in place no requirements, manufacturers can operate and test vehicles virtually anywhere, even if the location exceeds the AV control systems limitations,"" the letter said.
REVIEWING REGULATIONS
NHTSA told Reuters that with a new administration in place, it was reviewing regulations around AVs and welcomed the NTSB's input as it advanced policies on automated driving systems.
It said the most advanced vehicle technologies on sale required a fully attentive human driver at all times.
""Abusing these technologies is, at a minimum, distracted driving. Every State in the nation holds the driver responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle,"" NHTSA told Reuters.
NTSB also says NHTSA does not have any method to verify whether carmakers have adopted system safeguards. For example, there are no federal regulations requiring drivers to touch the steering wheel within a specific time frame.
""NHTSA is drafting rules on autonomous vehicles, but it has been slow to regulate semi-autonomous vehicles,"" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. ""There is a growing awareness that they deserve more scrutiny priority and regulatory action.""
New York has a law requiring drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel at all times but no other states have legislation that could prevent the use of semi-autonomous cars.
When it comes to AVs, 35 states have enacted legislation or state governors have signed executive orders covering AVs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Such rules allow companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and General Motors (NYSE:GM), among others, to test their Waymo and Cruise vehicles on public roads. 
But regulations differ by state.
AV regulations in Texas state that vehicles must comply with NHTSA processes, though there are no such federal regulations. The Texas Department of Public Safety, the regulator charged with overseeing AVs, did not respond to a request for comment.
Arizona's transport department requires companies to submit regular filings to verify, among other things, that vehicles can operate safely if the autonomous technology fails.
While most automakers offer vehicles with various forms of assisted driving, there are no fully autonomous vehicles for sale to customers in the United States.
RED FLAGS
Concerns about the safety of autonomous driving technology, however, have been mounting in recent years and Tesla has warned about its limitations. 
In February 2020, Tesla's director of autonomous driving technology, Andrej Karpathy, identified a challenge for its Autopilot system: how to recognize when a parked police car's emergency flashing lights are turned on.
""This is an example of a new task we would like to know about,"" Karpathy said at a conference during a talk about Tesla's effort to deliver FSD technology.
In just over a year since then, Tesla vehicles crashed into police cars parked on roads on four separate occasions and since 2016 at least three Tesla vehicles operating on Autopilot have been in fatal crashes.
U.S. safety regulators, police and local government have investigated all four incidents, officials told Reuters.
At least three of the cars were on Autopilot, police said. In one of the cases, a doctor was watching a movie on a phone when his vehicle rammed into a police trooper in North Carolina.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Accidents and investigations have not slowed Musk's drive to promote Tesla cars as capable of driving themselves. 
In a recent Tweet, Musk said Tesla is ""almost ready with FSD Beta V9.0. Step change improvement is massive, especially for weird corner cases & bad weather. Pure vision, no radar."" 
Tesla also says it has used 1 million cars on the road to collect image data and improve Autopilot, using machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Tesla's Karpathy said he has ridden in his Tesla for 20 minutes to get coffee in Palo Alto with no intervention.

""It is not a perfect system but it is getting there,"" he said in a ""Robot Brains"" podcast in March. ""I definitely keep my hands on the wheel.""

610,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 03:11PM ET</span>",U.S indicts two more Fiat Chrysler managers in diesel emissions probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday said two Fiat Chrysler senior managers in Italy had been indicted in the ongoing probe into diesel emissions cheating at the Italian-American automaker.
In January 2019 Fiat Chrysler agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve civil claims that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests in more than 100,000 U.S. vehicles. The Justice Department's criminal investigation into the company, which has since changed its name to Stellantis NV, is pending.
Stellantis said in a statement it continues ""to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice, as we have throughout this issue.""
Sergio Pasini, 43, of Ferrera, Italy, and Gianluca Sabbioni, 55, of Sala Bolognese, Italy, two senior diesel managers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Italy, were indicted in March along with Emanuele Palma, 42, of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, who was previously charged. The new indictment was unsealed Tuesday.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office on Detroit said Pasini and Sabbioni were not in custody.
Palma was charged in September 2019 with making and causing Fiat Chrysler to make misstatements to U.S. regulators about diesel engines’ emission control systems.
Palma, an Italian citizen and auto engineer, is set to go trial in October.
U.S. officials embarked on a wide-ranging investigation into diesel emissions cheating in the auto industry after September 2015, when Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) admitted to using secret software to evade emissions rules.

In October, Fiat Chrysler recognized a new 222 million euro ($267 million) provision to settle matters primarily related to the DOJ’s ongoing criminal probe into diesel emissions.
Fiat Chrysler said then that settlement talks were ongoing and it was not clear if an agreement would be reached. In September, it agreed separately to pay $9.5 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that it misled investors over emissions regulations compliance.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 02:42PM ET</span>","Apple targets remote workers with new iPad Pro, slim iMacs using own chips","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -Apple Inc announced a line of slim iMac computers and iPads with higher-quality video that use its own processors, as it speeds its migration away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and caters to a work-from-home world. 
The company also launched products including AirTags to find lost items and podcast subscription services. AirTags will cost $29 each, while the iMac will start at $1,299. Both will be available on April 30. 
The wide variety of announcements largely had been telegraphed before the presentation, which had no major surprises. Shares of Apple were down 1.3%, slightly more than the 1% drop in the Nasdaq index. 
The thinner iMac computers will use an Apple-designed central processor unit and come in seven colors, including purple and green. With a 24-inch (61-cm) display, the iMacs are flat and 11.5 millimeters thick.
The new iMacs also feature a higher quality front-facing camera and microphone array, responding to complaints from consumers during the pandemic that the computer's cameras had not kept pace with the company's iPhones and iPads during an era of pervasive video calls.
Apple introduced new iPad Pros that use the same M1 chip as its computers, rather than a beefed-up version of its iPhone chips, and additional ports for connecting monitors and 5G connectivity, aiming the device at content creators.
The use of the computer chip in the tablet further blurs the line between the mobile devices and computers, and the new iPad Pro also encroaches on gaming systems. Apple said that controllers from  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox would work with the iPad Pro. 
The expansion of Apple's M1 chips into the iPad Pro continues a migration away from longtime partner Intel. Apple in November announced three new computers would use an in-house processor. 
The company also announced podcast subscription services that will compete with rival Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and an updated Apple TV set top box with better color output and a faster processor chip.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have risen nearly 95% over the past year, faster than the 63% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index, thanks to a record $274.5 billion in sales for fiscal 2020 as consumers stocked up on electronics during the pandemic. 
“The Pro iPads are not the volume sellers, but they blur the line between Mac and iPad. How Apple differentiates between the iPad Pro and the Mac will be very interesting to watch,"" Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies said before the launch.
The AirTag announcement could result in a new round of complaints to lawmakers that Apple is hurting smaller rivals. Tile, a private company that has sold a competing tracker for nearly a decade, last year testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that Apple's App Store rules had made it harder to use Tile's products and will be called before the U.S. Senate to testify on Wednesday.
Apple has said it subjects all apps, including its own, to the same App Store review rules.

Bob O'Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, said he does not believe the trackers will become a big business on their own, since Apple was late to the product, but Bajarin said the trackers could keep people tied to their iPhones to keep track of keys and wallets.
""The more you buy into just one hardware product, the less likely it is you’ll ever leave,"" Bajarin said.

612,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 02:38PM ET</span>",Dow Extends Losses as Pandemic Jitters Return,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The Dow slumped Tuesday as cyclical stocks were hit hard after rising Covid-19 cases muddied the outlook for global growth, and offset the another wave of mostly bullish corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.07%, or 366 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.94%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.3%.
Investors sweating over the Covid-19 pandemic was widely thought to be in the rearview mirror, but a spike in cases globally has sparked jitters over global growth.
Energy led the broader market to downside, slipping more than 2% as investors reined in bets that global travel would return sooner rather than later to inject life into energy demand at a time when the market is oversupplied.
APA (NASDAQ:APA),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) fell more than 5%.
Industrials also played a role in the broader market selloff, paced by a decline in Boeing (NYSE:BA) as sentiment on the aviation sector soured following weaker guidance from United Airlines.
United Airlines guided capacity to be down 45% year-on-year in the second quarter, suggesting that investor optimism for a faster-than-expected snapback in travel was perhaps misplaced.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL)LL were nursing heavy losses, with the latter down more 6%.
Financials were also on the backfoot, with banks bearing the brunt of the selling exacerbated by a fall in U.S. bond yields. The U.S. 10-year yields slipped to 1.56% down 38 basis points.
Tech stocks struggled to take advantage of the slip in U.S. bond yields, which had kept a lid on growth last month, as investors awaited for quarterly earnings updates from the first cohort of the FANG stocks.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is set to report earnings later today after the closing bell. Ahead of its report, analysts appear more constructive amid tough comps for the streaming giant.
Netflix is expected to add about 0.75 million domestic and 5.25 million international streaming subscribers.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was in focus after its kicking off its first product event for the year. Apple's new iPad product line grabbed most of the attention, with some on Wall Street suggesting that it could spark a wave of demand.
""We estimate less than half of iPad users globally have gone through a refresh the last year with some clear pent-up demand that these new iPads will unleash in the next few quarters thus giving Apple another product tailwind,"" Wedbush said.
Elsewhere in tech,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shrugged off the selloff as investors cheered big blue's return to quarterly revenue growth.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was up 2% after following better-than-expected first-quarter results and reports that some countries had lifted the pause on its Covid-19 vaccine.
Despite the day of red on Wall Street, analysts continued to back the equity bull run, dubbing the selloff a correction.
""So the message here is that yes- the U.S. equities markets are frothy / extended here and thus may be vulnerable to higher volatility ahead; however we are not seeing technical signs that are conducive to prior secular peaks. In other words- brace yourself for a correction, but not the end of the bull market,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. regulator barred a former Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) research analyst from the brokerage industry for insider trading in two companies that the company was about to upgrade, and for lying about his trading.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said Brian Maguire bought $850,000 worth of shares in two companies last April and June after receiving internal emails that a fellow analyst would soon raise the companies' ratings to ""buy"" from ""neutral.""
FINRA said the pending upgrades were material nonpublic information, and that shares of both companies rose after the information became public.
It also said Maguire falsely testified to its staff about some of his earlier trading and violated its conflict-of-interest rules, including by trading securities of companies he covered and selling securities he rated ""buy.""
Maguire did not admit or deny the charges, but consented to the FINRA bar.
His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Goldman was not accused of wrongdoing.
Maguire had worked for Goldman in Houston, covering paper, packaging and environmental services companies.
He spent a decade at the Wall Street bank before it terminated him in October, citing concerns about his trading and use of confidential information.

According to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) entry, Maguire has degrees from the University of Notre Dame and the University of Virginia's business school.
FINRA recently regulated more than 3,500 securities firms.

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will virtually tour a South Carolina electric bus and battery manufacturing plant on Tuesday as the White House touts his proposal to boost the production of zero-emission buses and cars.
Biden will tour a U.S. electric bus manufacturer Proterra facility. He has proposed spending $20 billion to electrify at least 20% of school buses and $25 billion to electrify some transit vehicles as part of his $2.3 trillion infrastructure and jobs plan. In total, Biden has proposed $174 billion boost EVs, including $100 billion in consumer rebates.
The White House's push to electrify vehicles comes as China has dominated the world electric bus market. But Proterra estimates 50% of all new North American-built buses in 2025 will be electric.The U.S. has over 475,000 school buses and 65,000 transit buses and most run on diesel fuel, the White House said. Biden ""made a commitment that all American-made buses would be zero-emission by 2030,"" but it is not clear if he would seek to ban the sale of non-zero emission buses.
Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday toured a Thomas Built Buses facility in North Carolina to tout the company's electric bus manufacturing. 
Burlingame, California-based Proterra was founded by mechanical engineer Dale Hill in Golden, Colorado, in 2004 and has provided hundreds of public transport buses to U.S. cities since inception.
The White House has declined to endorsed setting a firm date like California to phaseout gasoline-powered passenger vehicles. 
Proterra in January agreed to go public through a merger with ArcLight Clean Transition Corp in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, including debt.
The company is going public through a merger with a blank-check company or special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). SPACs are shell companies which raise money through an IPO of its shares to take another company public within two years.
The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 02:10PM ET</span>","State Street, PepsiCo offer new goals ahead of U.S. climate summit","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) -  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT)'s asset-management arm said it would join other big investment firms pushing to limit greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, part of a rush by large companies to embrace climate goals. 
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc and Ikea stores owner Ingka Group also announced on Tuesday new efforts ahead of a U.S.-led virtual climate summit with world leaders starting Thursday.
Scientists and activists expect U.S. President Joe Biden to pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, the first upgrade of the national climate target since 2015.
State Street, one of the largest passive fund managers with some $3.6 trillion in assets, was to announce its commitment at a Ceres-sponsored virtual conference on Tuesday where U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry is scheduled to speak. 
State Street will be among 14 new signatories to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative that will now include $37 trillion in assets including prior backing from its rivals BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group Inc.
Net zero refers to a balance between emissions produced and those taken out of the atmosphere through technologies like carbon capture. Signatories pledge to set interim reduction targets for 2030 and report progress under common standards.
The net-zero-by-2050 goal ""is consistent with our commitment to drive long-term value on behalf of our clients"" said Cyrus Taraporevala, CEO of State Street Global Advisors, the company's asset-management arm. 
The corporate support makes the U.S. ambition realistic, said Mindy Lubber, president of climate advocacy group Ceres, and contrasts with executives' long-running skepticism, she said. As the risks posed by climate change become more apparent, Lubber said, ""The light bulbs are going off across the private sector.""
Lubber and others cautioned many questions remain such as exactly what financial disclosures should be required or whether executives should account for how customers use their products like fuel.
Pepsi said it will expand its regenerative farming programs to 7 million acres, or roughly all the land used to grow crops for its products, including adding more than 500,000 acres in the United States by the end of this year.
Ingka Group, the largest owner of Ikea furniture stores, said it will spend 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) on wind and solar power production, in addition to 2.5 billion euros it previously spent on the area.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Black religious leaders in Georgia representing more than 1,000 churches called on Tuesday for a boycott of  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), accusing the home improvement giant of failing to take a stand against the state's new Republican-backed curbs on voting.
In a statement, Bishop Reginald Jackson, who oversees Georgia's African Methodist Episcopal churches, said Home Depot had rejected requests to discuss the new law.
Other Georgia-based corporations - including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co - have sat down with activists and issued statements opposing the voting restrictions. Coca-Cola also hosted a meeting of several companies on April 13 with faith leaders.
""If you as corporate leaders do not believe and lack the courage to speak out against this legislation, we will not spend our money to purchase your products,"" Jackson said.
The Georgia legislation imposed new requirements for absentee ballots, restricted drop boxes and barred people from offering food and water to voters waiting in line.
Republican lawmakers in numerous states have used former President Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity. Opponents say the laws disproportionately harm minority voters.
Home Depot said on Tuesday it believes ""all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation"" and that it would ""continue to work to ensure our associates in Georgia and across the country have the information and resources to vote.""
It also said it ran its own initiatives, including registering more than 15,000 of its associates to vote.
More than 100 U.S. companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), have declared their opposition to new voting limits. Major League Baseball pulled its All-Star Game from Atlanta, citing Georgia's legislation.
Republican Governor Brian Kemp on Tuesday defended the law, telling reporters it will make balloting more secure while expanding weekend early voting.
""This insanity needs to stop,"" he said. ""It's time that hardworking Georgians know that instead of boycotting great companies like HD, we should be supporting them.""

At a news conference to announce the campaign, several pastors warned that the boycott would escalate if Home Depot did not forcefully denounce the law.
""This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue; this is a moral issue,"" said Jamal Harrison Bryant of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church. ""We are telling Home Depot: It is always the right time to do the right thing.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - On the heels of blockbuster earnings from major U.S. banks, investors are focused on whether an upcoming batch of earnings from major technology-related companies can sustain the season's early momentum.
Estimated year-over-year first-quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies rose to 31% from 25% in the past week, based on Refinitiv data, driven by last week's stronger-than-expected results from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and other banks.
Tuesday brings results from stay-at-home winner Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which is part of the FAANG group of high-profile tech-related names. Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s results are due later this week.
After the bell Monday, shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp were up more than 2% as the company resumed sales growth in the first quarter after a year of declines and beat Wall Street targets.
Earnings for the technology sector, which continued to grow last year while S&P 500 overall earnings dropped as the pandemic took its toll on businesses and consumers, are on track for 25% year-over-year growth in the first quarter.
But this year, tech is expected to lag profit growth of sectors that should benefit from the reopening of the economy, such as financials.
First-quarter profit growth for the S&P 500 financials sector, is now estimated at 116%, compared with 76% a week earlier.
""Every time we go to earnings, there's always the question of whether (tech) can keep delivering, especially in terms of guidance,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
""And they have,"" she said. ""What you are seeing is investors are prepared to have them - or some of them - in their portfolios along with cyclicals.""
To be sure, many strategists have been bullish on economically focused sectors, and U.S. technology and growth stocks have recently begun to gain again after months of being outpaced by economically sensitive names that appear to be a better value. 
Netflix still lags the broader market. Its stock is up 2.5% so far in 2021 after gaining 67% in 2020, when consumers embraced at-home entertainment during the early pandemic lockdowns, but some analysts are optimistic Netflix's strong run is not over.
""It is reasonable to anticipate reduced engagement on the platform as the global economy reopens,"" Brian White, an internet and software analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt who recommends buying the stock, wrote in a recent note.
""However, this crisis has acted as a catalyst in introducing more consumers to the service and we believe this story has a long runway of growth in the coming years.""
The current cycle of rising chip demand is expected to help semiconductors, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust Company.
""Semiconductors are operating on all cylinders right now. They can't make them fast enough,"" he said. 
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) shares rose when it forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates due to a rise in demand for memory chips, thanks to 5G smartphones and artificial intelligence software.
As companies have more money to increase their technology spending, that will support tech companies as well.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 01:15PM ET</span>","Boeing shares dive 4% after CFO's shock retirement, CEO extended","By Sanjana Shivdas and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -Boeing Co announced the retirement of its finance chief for the past decade, Greg Smith, and the crisis-hit jetmaker's shares fell 4% even as it signaled stability by prolonging its chief executive.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) extended its required retirement age of 65 to 70 to allow CEO Dave Calhoun to stay in the top job as the U.S. planemaker battles to recover from the coronavirus and 737 MAX crises, and manufacturing flaws on its aircraft programs. [L1N2M91WF]
But shares fell as investors were rattled by the surprise retirement of Smith, 54, Boeing's face to financial markets during one of the most turbulent periods in its history, marked by a safety crisis followed by rising debts during the pandemic.
Calhoun told shareholders at the annual meeting that Boeing would have positive cash flow in the near or medium term, and will prioritize paying down its debt as travel markets and plane demand rebound. Boeing has seen signs of recovery in the single-aisle market. 
In midday trading, shares were down about 4% at $234.41.
Smith, a 30-year Boeing veteran set to retire in July, led the largest bond offering in company history and has been leading a business transformation with cost-cutting and shuffling resources to strengthen Boeing once the COVID-19 and 737 MAX crises ebb.
Many in the industry saw Smith as a future CEO when Boeing was riding high on record production and stock prices until 2019. But some in the company criticized his policy of carrying out regular share buybacks, saying it left insufficient resources to tackle the severe downturn.
European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), by contrast, has weathered the crisis comparatively well while maintaining higher research spending. 
That said, Smith had to handle two unprecedented overlapping crises - the collapse of income surrounding the lengthy grounding of the 737 MAX after fatal crashes and the global pandemic that slammed aviation companies globally.
Smith decided on his own to retire, two people familiar with his thinking said. 
Smith was appointed chief financial officer in 2011. He then served in additional roles as the executive vice president of Finance, Enterprise Performance and Strategy, and then executive vice president of Enterprise Operations, Finance and Sustainability.
Prior to becoming CFO, he was corporate controller and vice president of finance, Boeing's principal liaison with the board of directors' audit committee on regulatory compliance.
Calhoun, a former executive at Blackstone (NYSE:BX) private equity group and experienced corporate crisis manager and a Boeing board member 2009, was named CEO in December after the board ousted Dennis Muilenburg. 
That came after Calhoun was named chairman in October 2019. He gave up the chairmanship when he became CEO.

Calhoun told employees in January he sees ""opportunities to be better. Much better.""
In January, the board approved a $1.4 million annual salary for Calhoun and long-term compensation of $26.5 million if he achieves several milestones.

Investing.com – Shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) erased their early losses and were up just short of 3% on securing the European regulator’s nod to resume supplies of its Covid-19 shots.
The company was able to convince the European Medicines Agency that the risk-reward ratio favored the application of the jabs, outscoring safety concerns.
The EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee reviewed a small number of cases of very rare blood clots in combination with low platelet counts that can occur within one to three weeks following the injection.
The company has promised to carry, with the injection, a summary of product characteristics and leaflet to include important information on the diagnosis and management of this very rare adverse event.  
It said it remains committed to supplying 200 million doses of its vaccine to the E.U., Norway and Iceland.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently are reviewing the same cases of blood clots.
The company earlier today raised its guidance for both sales and earnings per share after reporting healthy growth in its medical devices and pharmaceutical businesses.
J&J also saw the first $100 million in revenue from its Covid-19 shots.
The company increased its 2021 full-year guidance for adjusted operational sales growth to as much as 9.9% from 9.5% in January, and adjusted operational EPS growth to 16.8% from 16.4% earlier this year.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell 4% Tuesday after its chief financial officer, aged 54, decided to retire from the company even as the world’s largest maker of commercial planes extended the CEO’s retirement age to accommodate the incumbent.  
CFO Gregory Smith will leave after a decade in the role. Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard described the news as “odd” and a “surprise development,” according to StreetInsider.
“While a Boeing outsider as CFO could bring a new perspective, this is a company that has tended to promote internally in the past,” StreetInsider quoted the analyst as saying.
Boeing also announced that it was extending the retirement age for its CEO by five years to 70, thus extending the run of David Calhou, 64.
Calhou and Smith have run Boeing through one of its most turbulent times, including two crashes involving its 737 Max planes that raised questions over its safety norms and cost it several billions of dollars in revenue.
Traders ignored the day's $1.8 billion order win by Boeing for 15 units of 737 Max 8 from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise. Last two months have seen Boeing win several orders for its 737 Max series of planes, perhaps a sign these issues are behind it.   "

(Reuters) - The U.S. cannabis industry is hoping that the fourth time is a charm for a major banking reform bill that is once again headed to the Senate for approval after a comfortable victory in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The House voted 321-101 on Monday to approve a legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal.
The bill states that proceeds from legitimate cannabis businesses would not be considered illegal and directs federal regulators to craft rules for how they would supervise such banking activity.
Banks have generally been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run afoul of federal laws.
Cannabis advocacy groups and industry associations are now hoping that a Democrat-led Senate would finally help push the bill through the upper house and to President Joe Biden's desk to be inked into a law.
The bill has been approved thrice in some form by the House in the last three years but failed to make any progress in the Senate, and analysts at brokerage group Cowen & Co voiced some concerns about the roadmap ahead.
""The problem is that Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown does not appear interested in advancing the House version of SAFE,"" the analysts said. ""He wants social justice provisions, which we believe put at risk the GOP votes needed to overcome a filibuster.""
Shares of Green Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF) Inc, Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) Inc and Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF), pot companies which have the biggest U.S. exposure and stand to benefit most from the bill's passage, rose between 1.5% and 3% in early trading.
""Given the bipartisan support behind the bill, and the fact that we currently have a Senate under Democratic control, the bill's chances of being passed by Senate are definitely better this time around,"" Jason Wilson, cannabis and banking expert at ETF Managers Group, said.
The National Cannabis Industry Association also said on Monday that advocates are hopeful that Senate Banking Committee Chair will take up the bill in the near future so that it can begin to move through the upper chamber as soon as possible and become law before the end of the year.
Cowen analysts said they believe there are 60 votes for the SAFE Act in the Senate, but added that it believes Senate Democratic leaders are focusing on federal legalization of marijuana ahead of banking access.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, in an early-April interview with Politico, said he would try to advance legislation legalizing marijuana use for adults.

Asked about the SAFE Banking Act, he said he would like to see such a bill move forward as part of a more comprehensive measure - even if President Biden was not supportive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ratings and research firm Morningstar Inc has asked a New York judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the top U.S. securities regulator over ratings of commercial mortgage-backed securities, according to a court document.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Morningstar's former ratings business in February, saying the firm violated disclosure and internal controls requirements in 30 commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions from 2015 to 2016 when the agency allowed analysts to make undisclosed adjustments to key stresses in its modeling.
The SEC ""does not like that (the firm's) former methodology included these adjustments"" but Morningstar's analytical independence is protected by Congress, lawyers for the company said in the filing, which was filed on Monday. Morningstar said the regulator is overstepping its authority and the firm met all disclosure requirements.
A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment beyond the filing. An SEC official also declined to comment.

Ratings agencies came under criticism after the last financial crisis as inflated ratings of mortgage-backed securities helped fuel a U.S. housing bubble. Congress later charged the SEC with overseeing the ratings agencies, but the agency struggled with the oversight due to insufficient resources and technology changes, Reuters has previously reported.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>","At GM, blue and white collar give way to remote and on-site","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday outlined plans to allow remote work after the pandemic, in part to cast a wider net for recruiting programmers, marketers and other talent needed for its connected, electric vehicle strategy.
""The future of jobs will not be a one-size fits all approach,"" the automaker said in a statement explaining its ""Work Appropriately"" program to cover 155,000 employees worldwide.
Instead, many employees will be allowed to keep working remotely, coming to an office as needed, as long as their tasks are not tied to assembly lines or on-site equipment.
That would allow GM to recruit a programmer who lives in Boston without requiring that employee to move, GM global talent acquisition director Cyril George told reporters on a videoconference. 
In North America, GM has already sought to expand its recruiting footprint beyond its Detroit area base by setting up ""innovation centers"" for employees in technical and marketing fields in Austin, Texas; Chandler, Ariz. and Roswell, GA.
GM's more flexible approach to office attendance reflects a broader rethinking of traditional workplace practices across industries, accelerated by the pandemic. 
For Detroit automakers, an archaic class system of ""blue collar"" manufacturing workers and ""white collar"" salaried employees is giving way to a new distinction: Those who must work on-site, and those who can do their jobs remotely.
Technology adopted during the pandemic has expanded the universe of GM employees who can work from a distance. 
Members of the team that developed the GMC Hummer EV were able to remotely monitor testing of a prototype at the company's Milford, Michigan test track, said Jeff Massimilla, executive director of connected customer and mobility solutions. 

GM officials said the new workplace approach is not aimed at shrinking the automaker's office space, and declined to say what cost impact flexible work policies could have.

Investing.com – Manpower (NYSE:MAN) shares touched their 52-week high Tuesday, boosted by the company's outlook for an even higher earnings per share after a January-March performance that beat its own estimate.
The shares eased off a bit, but were up more than 3%.
The workforce solutions provider reported net earnings of $1.11 per share for the three months ended March 31, compared to $0.03 per share in the prior year period.
This was despite the foreign exchange impact coming at a positive 6 cents, not very different but still lower than the benefit of 7 cents that it had predicted in February.
It had anticipated earnings per share in the first quarter to be between 64 cents and 72 cents.
The company has guided for EPS in the second quarter to be between $1.36 and $1.44. The company sees gains from foreign currency fluctuations – read, a weaker dollar – to continue in the April-June period as well. The benefit is estimated to be worth 10 cents.
Revenue for the first quarter was $4.9 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year period.
The company’s focus on collections and working capital efficiency improved its ‘days sales outstanding’ by 3.7 days over the same period last year."

Investing.com --  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) dropped 2.4% after Citi downgraded shares on a demand slowdown.
Citi's Paul Lejuez downgraded the sports retailer to neutral from buy and lowered the price target by $20 to $140 on pressure amid accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang that boiled up again recently, StreetInsider reported. Nike said in an undated statement that it does not source products from the region and has confirmed with contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region.
Nike had been rallying as demand for gear jumped over the pandemic period, and shares are still up about 50% over the past 12 months. But rights groups have called for bans on the brand, along with others like H&M, saying that Xingjiang's Uyghur minority are forced to pick cotton.
Lejuez has a positive long-term outlook on Nike, but the analyst listed 10 reasons he lowered his rating, including the labor issue, as well as elevated inventory, higher markdown risks, and lower margins. 
Shares are also trading at a higher valuation than its historical average, Lejuez said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Tuesday as renewed fears about the global pandemic weighed on sentiment toward internationally active companies. 
The coronavirus is spiraling out of control in India and, increasingly, Pakistan, two countries that are home to over 20% of the world's population and over 14% of its gross domestic product. That's leading to the country suspending the export of vaccines to countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world, slowing global progress toward herd immunity. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 115 points, or 0.3%, at 33,962 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, as is usual when pandemic concerns dominate, paring overnight losses to trade effectively unchanged.
The day was dominated by a slew of earnings but arguably the biggest eye-catcher was the sustained weakness of Altria (NYSE:MO), which fell another 6.5% on the back of a Wall Street Journal report saying that the administration is looking at new regulation to cut the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. That would make them less addictive, putting fresh pressure on long-term sales.  Altria, which owns the Marlboro brand, had already fallen 6% on Monday in response to the initial news.
Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) stock and Futu (NASDAQ:FUTU) stock also stood out for non-earnings reasons. The railroad operator received a rival bid from Canadian National Railway Co (TSX:CNR), propelling it 15% higher. Meanwhile the digital brokerage platform fell 15% after announcing a secondary offering of ADRs after the close on Monday.
Of the companies reporting earnings in the last 24 hours, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stood out with a 3.8% gain, after reporting its biggest revenue gain in 11 quarters, thanks to a steady increase in adoption of its cloud subscription models.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock went the other way, falling 6.6% after reporting a wider-than-expected loss for the first quarter, unable to offset higher fuel costs with a comparable rise in passenger numbers.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 2.8%, rebounding from concerns about a fatal crash in Texas. CEO Elon Musk said preliminary data collected by the company suggested that its Autopilot software was not engaged at the time of the crash. Harris County police had said at the weekend that neither of the men killed in the crash was sitting in the driver's seat. Tesla had also been the subject of a viral protest in China by a lone woman alleging quality defects at an auto show in China. 
China was also at the heart of concerns about  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock, which fell 3% to test a five-month low after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts downgraded it due to the risk of a backlash to its stance on human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Nike is one of a handful of companies to have been ostracized on Chinese social media for distancing itself from allegations of slave labor in Xinjiang.

In the quarter, COVID-19 test kits generated sales of $2.2 billion and accounted for more than half of the diagnostic unit's revenue. But that compared with $2.4 billion in the prior quarter.
Abbott's shares fell 3% to $120.67 in trading before the bell.

Low interest rates and consumers' preference for private vehicles over public transportation has helped demand at U.S. auto dealers during the COVID-19 pandemic, while a semiconductor chip shortage has created a supply crunch.
""Demand continues to exceed supply for new vehicles, and we expect this to continue throughout 2021, in part due to the production disruption,"" Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said.
AutoNation's gross profit per new vehicle at stores that have stayed open for at least a year jumped 61% to $2,739 in the first quarter from a year earlier. The company's gross profit per used vehicle jumped 17% to $1,744.
At the same time, Jackson said AutoNation kept overhead costs down using digital sales systems. Overhead costs were 62.7% of revenue, down 11.2 percentage points from a year earlier.
So far, Jackson told Reuters, reduced inventories were not cutting into sales. Instead, automakers are cutting production of slow-selling vehicles, and those vehicles that arrive at AutoNation stores ""are going right out the door,"" Jackson said.
""For first time there’s conversation with manufacturers that this may be a better way to run the industry,"" Jackson said.
AutoNation said during the first quarter, it bought 11 stores and a collision center from Peacock Automotive Group, adding $380 million in annual revenue. Jackson said he expects more consolidation among U.S. auto dealers as more vehicle purchases move online.
""Only the biggest groups can build proprietary digital tools. That's tough to compete against,"" Jackson said. ""You're going to see quite a number of acquisitions ..not just by us.""
Fort Lauderdale-based AutoNation's quarterly adjusted net income from continuing operations jumped 183.7% to $233.8 million, or $2.79 share, in the first quarter, compared with $82.4 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose 26.5% to $5.90 billion. The company said it had $2.1 billion of liquidity as of March 31.

LISBON (Reuters) - A new rule banning food companies from comparing plant-based products to dairy in their marketing could be agreed by European Union negotiators this week, despite protests from firms including Danone, Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL).
Products like Nestle's Nescafe Almond Latte, described on the package as a 'delicious alternative to dairy', or Danone's Alpro 'plant-based alternative to Greek-style yogurt' would need new slogans, lawyers said. 
Even the package design of a soy drink resembling a milk carton could be construed as an 'evocation' of milk products and thus banned, they said. 
""It would be almost impossible to communicate about plant-based products,"" Siska Pottie, head of the European Alliance for Plant-Based Foods, told Reuters. 
""Saying a product had half the carbon emission of butter could be forbidden. Even 'lactose-free' might not be allowed... it's madness.""
The draft legislation, Amendment 171, gained the support of the European parliament last October with 54% of MEPS in favour, even in the same voting round that overturned a proposed EU ban on the term 'veggie burger'.
It now needs approval from EU member states and parliament, who will discuss it this week along with the Commission. If eventually signed off, the law would be rolled out across the bloc's 27 member states.
A Commission representative confirmed that the amendment would be discussed in negotiations this week, but said it could not pre-empt the outcome. 
CONSCIOUS CHOICE
Existing EU regulation prohibits plant-based products from being called names like 'vegan yoghurt' or 'almond milk', and representatives for Danone, Nestle and Unilever told Reuters they did not see a need for further restrictions on labelling.
""This is unjust discrimination towards plant-based products,"" said Danone's head of regulatory in Iberia, Pedro Neves, adding that overhauling plant-based product branding would carry a high cost for companies.
Critics say the amendment goes against the commitment outlined in Europe's climate strategy to move consumers towards more plant-based diets, and is caving to pressure from Europe's dairy industry, which has the largest production of milk relative to population size among the G20.
""We are in a race against the climate clock. To introduce legislative barriers at a point when science shows how important it is to shift towards plant-based diets is absurd,"" said Cecilia McAleavy, public affairs director at Swedish plant-based product maker Oatly.
While dairy producers in countries like Australia and the United States are lobbying for the same rule, courts in those countries have largely overruled their proposals as long as product names included a qualifier like 'plant-based'. 
Europe's Dairy Association argues that labels comparing products to dairy confuse the consumer, and that the plant-based food industry is blurring the lines between product types.
""The term 'cheese substitute' misleads consumers' capacities to choose consciously. This so-called 'substitute' clearly differs from real cheese... it is simply a different product,"" its secretary-general Alexander Anton told Reuters. 
But studies by the European Consumer Organisation on consumer understanding of 'meaty' names for vegan alternatives and surveys in Portugal and Spain on perception of dairy alternatives indicate most consumers do not find such comparisons confusing. 
""Descriptive terms such as 'dairy alternative' help consumers understand the characteristics of the product, facilitating more sustainable choices,"" a Unilever spokeswoman said. 
Across Europe, plant-based product sales, currently at 3 billion euros ($3.62 billion), are projected to rise to 5 billion by 2025, according to ING Research – still just 4.1% of dairy sales. Plant-based drinks have the strongest foothold, with 10% of the market for milk.

Investing.com – Shares of Altria (NYSE:MO) and  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) were trading lower in Tuesday’s premarket after a report said that the Biden administration was considering steps that would wean consumers off cigarettes and make it difficult for companies to market them.  
Altria was down over 2%, BAT was down nearly 7% and Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) fell 6%.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Biden administration is weighing whether to move forward with a plan for nicotine reduction in all cigarettes, or impose a menthol ban, or both.
The Food and Drug Administration must respond in court by April 29 to a citizens’ petition to ban menthols by disclosing whether the agency intends to pursue such a policy, WSJ said. 
A policy requiring lower nicotine content would lower the chemical in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels, aiming to push millions of smokers to either quit or switch to less harmful alternatives.
A ban on menthol, often marketed by cigarette makers as a less harmful option to the regular product, would aim to curb smoking initiation among the young. "

GHAZIABAD, India (Reuters) - A handful of startups are trying to find a new way to recycle used car batteries, using water, chemicals and electricity to produce lead instead of the hazardous, high-heat smelting that has been identified as the world's most polluting industry.
One of the first to bring a new recycling technology to market is ACE Green Recycling Inc, which has developed a room-temperature process that turns lead from scrap batteries into ingots, its Singapore-based CEO Nishchay Chadha told Reuters.
At its recycling plant in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of the Indian capital New Delhi, the firm uses machines that run on electricity to refine lead components from scrap batteries into briquettes, which are then cast into ingots and sold to battery manufacturers. Plastic and other components are recycled separately. 
Worldwide, the start-ups so far form only a tiny fraction of the lead battery recycling industry, which is estimated to be a $17.5 billion per year business, counting for just the lead value. But they claim the new technologies produce next to no emissions compared to traditional smelting.
Analysts and experts said the new technologies are promising but it was too early to say if any of them was commercially viable on a large scale.
""I think it's a great step and if it's economically viable it's a terrific step,"" CEO Richard Fuller at environmental agency Pure Earth said. 
Typically, traditional battery recycling units use an ultra-hot furnace at over 1,000 degrees Celsius to refine lead components. If the unit is unregulated, as many are in poorer nations where the sales of cars and car batteries are surging, toxic fumes often escape into the air and effluents seep into groundwater.
Pure Earth and Green Cross Switzerland have said lead battery recycling is the most polluting industry in the world. ""Emissions and fugitive dusts released from the small scale melting and casting of molten lead and from waste are the main exposure pathways,"" the agencies said in a 2016 report.
Farid Ahmed, the principal lead analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the new technologies had ""the potential to be game-changers"".
""But (they) need to reach that point where they can establish the validity of their processes when scaled up to industrial levels of output, plus that they can be competitive in production costs,"" he said. 
Recycling of lead batteries accounts for about two-thirds of the world's supply of refined lead, which is also used in cables, ammunition and paints. The metal currently trades at roughly $2,000 per tonne.
ONE PERCENT OF REFINED LEAD
""We use electricity, and that helps our plant operate at room temperature, and that's why there's zero-emission of gases and effluents from our plant,"" Dhruvendra Kumar Tyagi, ACE Green's general manager, told Reuters.
Luminous Power Technologies, owned by France's Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and one of India's largest auto battery manufacturers, provides ACE Green with more than 200 tonnes per month of used batteries, which ACE said it turns into 120-130 tonnes of lead and sells back to the firm. 
Luminous did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
ACE Green has signed an agreement with Altus Asia Group in Singapore to licence its technology to recycle 5,000 tonnes per year of used lead-acid batteries in the first half of 2022, with the potential to double that capacity in 2023, its Managing Director David Leong said. 
The investment for this plant will be $5 million which Leong expects to raise via private equity and private partners. ""(The technology) basically solves all the problems of running a traditional lead recycling smelter,"" said Leong, adding that the company plans to also set up plants in Malaysia, Vietnam and South Korea using this technology. ACE Green says it has inked licensing and joint-venture deals to recycle 90,000 tonnes per year of used lead-acid batteries with four commercial recyclers in 11 countries, which would produce a total of about 55,800 tonnes per year of lead. It is also planning a 12,000 tonnes per year used lead-acid batteries recycling plant in Australia which would produce 7,440 tonnes per year of lead.
All of that would be equivalent to 1% of the world's recycled lead.
Other companies are developing similar processes.
Nasdaq-listed Aqua Metals (NASDAQ:AQMS), which uses water-based solvents at room temperature to recycle used batteries to produce refined lead, is not initially looking to replace informal recycling or backyard smelting but is focusing on the regulated market where its product can be marketed as an environment friendly, bolt-on technology, Chief Executive Steve Cotton told Reuters. 
He said he plans to commercialize the process and roll out licences as early as June this year.

Ola Hekselman of Imperial College London has been working on a proprietary solvents and chemical process to extract lead from batteries and has co-founded a company called Solveteq which aims to commercialize the technology in the next 18 to 24 months. ""Just being sustainable and green may not be enough for us to convince others to switch to this technology,"" Hekselman said. ""We have to be economically more competitive as well.""

The company's Aeronautics segment reported 17 deliveries of its F-35 jets in the quarter, down from 22 a year earlier. Lockheed plans to deliver between 133 and 139 of the jets this year, said Possenriede.

Though net sales in the quarter rose 3.9% to $16.26 billion, they were below analysts' expectation of $16.33 billion.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>",Abbott's results a litmus test for COVID-19 testing demand,"By Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - Investors will be squarely focused on  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) results on Tuesday to assess the impact of swift vaccination rollout on demand for the company's COVID-19 tests.
Diagnostic test makers such as Abbott, Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) Inc have relied on brisk sales of COVID-19 molecular and antigen tests to offset soft demand for routine testing and medical devices due to pandemic-induced restrictions on movement. 
""I think the investor and Street conversations and concerns are that because of vaccination trends, because of the reopening and trajectory of many economies around the world, especially the U.S., are we going to need all these tests?,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Matt Miksic said. 
Quest, which is set to report its quarterly results on April 22, said in February that it was expecting demand for its COVID-19 tests to shrink in the year as vaccination efforts ramp up.
For 2021, Abbott has forecast sales of about $6.5 billion to $7 billion from its COVID-19 tests, up from nearly $4 billion last year. 
THE CONTEXT
Abbott and Quest have been investing heavily to develop tests that are more accurate with shorter turn-around times. 
Abbott currently has U.S. authorization for several tests including its $5 portable antigen test called BinaxNOW, which last month received U.S. clearance for over-the-counter, at-home use in people without symptoms. 
Sustained demand for these tests has come under question since the United States began to roll out multiple vaccine candidates, including two-shot vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
THE FUNDAMENTALS 
** Abbott is expected to report a 38.3% rise in revenue to $10.69 billion when it reports first-quarter earnings on April 20, according to the mean estimate from 18 analysts, based on Refinitiv data.​​
** The mean analyst estimate for earnings is $1.27 per share. For the same quarter last year, the company reported earnings of 65 cents per share.
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
** The current average analyst rating on Abbott shares is ""buy"", with 10 analysts rating it ""strong buy"", eight ""buy"", four ""hold"" and one ""sell"". 
** Wall Street's median 12-month price target is $137, up from $122 in January.
** The company's shares have gained about 14% so far this year.

For over a year, the global health crisis has caused sales of P&G's hygiene and washing products such as Charmin toilet paper and Tide laundry detergents to swell, as consumers stockpiled on essentials and cleaning supplies to stay prepared for more lockdowns. 
The company said net sales rose 5% to $18.1 billion in the third quarter ended March 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of $17.90 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net income attributable to the company rose to $3.27 billion, or $1.26 per share, from $2.92 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier.

The company, which has previously said the vaccine will be available on a not-for-profit basis until the end of the pandemic, also tightened its forecast for adjusted profit this year, showing it largely performed as previously expected. 
Use of the vaccine was paused last week by U.S. regulators as they review reports of rare but serious blood clots in recipients.

Excluding items, the company earned $2.59 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $2.34 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Sales of cancer drug Darzalex rose 45.7% to $1.37 billion and sales of Stelara, a treatment for Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis, rose about 18% to $2.15 billion.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, the second day of losses after a series of record highs with investors set to digest earnings from big tech companies and consumer-oriented names. 
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 125 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 50 points, or 0.4%.
The major indices closed lower on Wall Street on Monday, dragged down by overall weakness in the technology sector, but this followed another strong week last week, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at record highs on Friday.
After a broadly positive round of bank earnings last week, Tuesday sees the first of the so-called FAANG stocks report - the five technology megacaps that dominate the major indices.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is due to report after the closing bell, and investors will be looking to see if the streaming giant has continued to attract subscribers after they flocked to the company during the early months of the pandemic.
Other key earnings Tuesday include drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which has had to delay vaccine shipments after questions were raised about blood clotting, consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and insurer Travelers (NYSE:TRV). All three beat consensus forecasts for earnings.
Elsewhere, tobacco stocks will remain in focus after slumping Monday on the back of a Wall Street Journal report that the Biden administration is considering capping nicotine levels in cigarettes.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also stay in the spotlight after the company’s CEO Elon Musk said checks showed the Autopilot driver assistance system was not engaged in the fatal car crash over the weekend, a statement seemingly at odds with police information that neither of the two people who died in the crash was sitting in the driver's seat. The crash is the 28th Telsa accident to be investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety.
The economic data slate is largely empty Tuesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury last traded around 1.60%, after falling as low as 1.53% last week.
Oil prices strengthened Tuesday, aided by continued optimism that the reopening of economies will stoke consumption and also boosted by a weaker U.S. dollar.
On the supply side, investors await inventories data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $63.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $67.31 after gaining 4.6% Wednesday. Both contracts are up more than 30% in 2021.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive-DBS, StanChart weigh bids as Citi retreats from Asia consumer business - sources","By Anshuman Daga, Sumeet Chatterjee and Nupur Anand
SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Banks including DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE:MUFG), OCBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) are set to bid for parts of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s consumer business in Asia, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The sale process will start within a couple of weeks, they added, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media. 
The move comes after Citi said it would exit from its consumer franchises in 13 markets, 10 of which are in Asia, as it refocuses on its more lucrative institutional and wealth management businesses in these markets.
Potential bids from the regional banks and StanChart, which makes most of its profit in Asia, underscores their growing appetite for businesses like credit cards and mortgages in a push to lock in long-term income growth.
The businesses Citi is exiting had $82 billion in assets and were allocated $7 billion in tangible common equity last year. Citi has plans to reposition its Asian consumer banking business from its ""wealth centres"" of Hong Kong and Singapore.
As Citi is not giving up its banking licences in most of the markets it is exiting, the sale of the consumer banking portfolios and branches will only appeal to lenders with existing presence in these countries, the people said.
""Asia is critical to our firm's strategy, and we will allocate resources to drive profitable growth,"" a Citi spokesman in Hong Kong said, declining to comment on the sale process.
Representatives at Japanese lender MUFG and StanChart, and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group, which the sources said was another potential bidder, declined to comment.
""DBS has always been open to exploring sensible bolt-on opportunities in markets where we have a consumer banking franchise (China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan) and where we can overlay our digital capabilities,"" Southeast Asia's biggest lender said in a statement.
In 2016, DBS bought ANZ's wealth management and retail businesses in five Asian markets for about $80 million.
Citi's sprawling India consumer business, comprising retail deposits, mortgages and credit cards, and its Taiwan business would be among the most valuable parts of its Asian consumer portfolio, the sources said.
Citi's consumer banking business in the 13 markets accounted for $4.2 billion of the bank's $74.3 billion revenue in 2020. All the markets it is exiting made a combined loss of $40 million in the consumer banking business in the same year.
INDIA 'JEWEL IN THE CROWN'
DBS, the only big foreign bank with a fully owned Indian subsidiary, is eyeing Citi's India business, which is also set to attract StanChart and local lenders Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, the sources said.
SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, a unit of State Bank of India, is also weighing a bid for Citi's credit card portfolio in India, two of the sources said.
Citi's India consumer business is valued at over $2 billion, according to four sources. 
""India is the jewel in the crown and will command a better price than the other markets,"" one of the sources added.
Citi has been in India for decades and was among the first to introduce Indians to credit cards in 1987. It ranks as the sixth largest local card issuer with nearly 2.7 million cards.
Sources say Citi has a significant share in the premium segment, commanding higher spends per card of 10-25% versus the industry average. It is also among the top five wealth management players, with 35 branches and about 4,000 staff in the consumer banking segment.
Kotak Mahindra declined to comment, while Axis Bank and SBI Cards did not respond to a request for comment.
The other markets Citi is exiting as part of its new CEO Jane Fraser's strategy include South Korea, Australia, mainland China and Thailand - countries where it does not have the necessary scale to compete with local rivals.
Singapore's DBS and OCBC, Britain's StanChart, and the Japanese lenders are also weighing bids for some of Citi's Southeast Asia businesses, the people said.

Citi's businesses in Australia and South Korea could attract interest from domestic banks, they added.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>",UK to review bank rules as London looks for post-Brexit boost,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain launched on Tuesday an independent review of banking capital and proprietary trading rules that is set to pit banks against their regulator as London's powerful financial industry looks to boost its global competitiveness after Brexit. 
Since the start of 2019, Britain requires HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and other banks to ""ring-fence"" the retail arms of their operations with capital to shield them from any losses in their riskier, investment banking arms, after taxpayers had to bail out lenders during the financial crisis.
Proprietary trading refers to banks using their own money to take bets on stocks, bonds and other assets on their own account rather than trading on behalf of a client.
The United States has eased its own proprietary trading rules and the City of London financial district is keen to remain competitive with Wall Street. 
""Over the last decade, UK banks have seen significant changes to the environment in which they operate, including the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK’s exit from the EU, and wider changes in the UK financial sector,"" the independent review said in its call for evidence. 
The review was called by the finance ministry and the independent panel is chaired by City veteran Keith Skeoch. The panel includes John Flint, former CEO of HSBC.
Banks also hold multiples of capital in their safety buffers compared with a decade ago, making them far more resilient in the face of shocks.
The Bank of England, which polices ring-fencing, had no comment on Tuesday. Its Deputy Governor Sam Woods told the Telegraph newspaper last year he would defend ring-fencing to ""my last drop of blood"", as it made ""no sense"" to jumble up the domestic banking system with a giant global trading centre in the City.
The review lists a series of questions to ask people's views on the two sets of rules.
Britain's full departure from the European Union on Dec. 31 means it no longer has to comply with the bloc's financial rules, freeing it up to tailor regulation to UK lenders, though the ring-fencing rules are home-grown.
""This review presents a unique opportunity to assess the observed impacts of the regulatory regimes, intended or otherwise, for financial stability, competition, competitiveness, and the balance between these in light of the changes in the UK financial sector and wider economy,"" the review said.
Ring-fencing, which requires an independent board and additional compliance requirements, is applied to banks with retail deposits of more than 25 billion pounds ($35 billion), and banks are expected to push for a higher threshold.
New banks have said the extra costs make it harder for them to build up scale to compete with established banks in mortgages.
Last year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) closed its easy access savings business to new customers in Britain to avoid hitting the threshold for introducing ring-fencing. 

The review will report back to the finance ministry within a year.

Dubai state-owned DAE in 2019 abandoned plans to place a major order with Airbus and Boeing after it said it was unable to reach agreements on pricing.
It instead sought to expand its fleet by taking over a rival, which is yet to take place, and bought aircraft from airlines who would then take them back on lease.
""We are delighted to deepen our already strong relationship with Boeing,"" DAE Chief Executive Firoz Tarapore said in a statement.
""We are confident in the success of these aircraft as domestic and regional air travel is seeing strong signs of recovery.""
The order, worth $1.8 billion at list prices, though discounts are common, also signals a further show of confidence in the narrow-body jet that until recently was banned worldwide.

The United States late last year lifted its safety ban, imposed after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and the United Arab Emirates followed earlier this year.
DAE, which says it own and manages 162 Boeing aircraft, last year announced an agreement to purchase 737 MAX jets from American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), who would then take them back on lease.

PARIS (Reuters) -Danone on Tuesday stuck to its goal of returning to profitable growth in the second half of 2021 after posting a 3.3% fall in first quarter sales, as COVID-19 lockdowns continued to dent its bottled water and baby food sales.
The French food group, which is searching for a new chief executive, said it was banking on a gradual reopening of economies from the second half of this year as COVID-19 vaccination programs are rolled out.
Former boss Emmanuel Faber was abruptly ousted as chairman and CEO last month following clashes with some board members over strategy and calls from activist funds for him to resign over the group's lackluster returns compared with some rivals.
Danone did not elaborate on its search for a new CEO but said it would pay ""careful attention to ensuring a proper transition"". It said previously that it was looking for an external candidate after appointing a duo to manage operations in the interim period.
The company also said it would continue with board-backed changes set in motion by Faber to reorganise Danone around regional hubs rather than brands under a ""Local First"" plan.
It reiterated its expectations for a return to like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter and for a full-year 2021 operating margin broadly in line with the 14% achieved in 2020.
Danone, the world's largest yoghurt maker, said like-for-like sales fell 3.3% to 5.657 billion euros ($6.82 billion) in the first quarter, compared with expectations for a 3.7% decline in a company-compiled consensus of 19 analysts.
A 1.6% rise in Essential Dairy and Plant-based sales was largely offset by an 11.6% fall in water sales and a 7.7% drop in Specialized Nutrition sales.
Infant Nutrition sales continued to be hit by slowing birth rates and COVID-related disruption in China, notably cross-border sales were down by around 45%.
Under Faber, the company pursued a strategy centered on diversifying into fast-growing products featuring probiotics, protein and plant-based ingredients to mitigate slower growth in dairy.
However, the pandemic complicated prospects for the company, which suffered as sales of products such as Evian bottled water to the restaurant sector dwindled during government-enforced lockdowns. 
""We would expect this release to support share price performance until we get some more newsflow on a new CEO before the summer,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.

Danone shares were 0.7% lower in early trade at 59.91 euros. They have gained 12% so far this year, supported by speculation around activist shareholder intervention and following a 27% fall last year. The shares have outperformed their European sector, which has lost 7.6% so far this year.

672,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",Libyan Oil Output Drops Below 1 Million Barrels Amid Funding Row,"(Bloomberg) -- Libya’s oil production has fallen below 1 million barrels a day for the first time in months as a budgetary dispute hinders the OPEC member’s ability to fix war-damaged infrastructure.
The National Oil Corp. stopped exports from the eastern port of Hariga, it said in a statement late Monday. The state firm said the central bank’s “refusal” to release money to the energy sector had forced local producers to pump less.
The quarrel risks derailing a recovery in Libya’s production following a truce in the nation’s civil war around mid-2020. Crude output surged from almost nothing from September and reached 1.25 million barrels a day last month, the highest level in eight years.
“The oil sector is in trouble,” the NOC said. “The national companies are suffering and groaning.”
While Libya appointed its first unity government in years last month, it remains wracked by deep political divisions and thousands of foreign mercenaries are yet to leave the country.
The NOC declared force majeure, a clause in contracts allowing exports to be suspended, at Hariga after one of its subsidiaries reduced flows to the oil terminal. Arabian Gulf Oil Co., which operates fields in the east of the country, was forced to cut production by 280,000 barrels a day, roughly 90% of what it normally pumps. The NOC didn’t say how long force majeure would be in place.
Hariga was scheduled to load six crude cargoes of 1 million barrels each next month -- equivalent to 194,000 barrels a day in total -- according to a loading program.
Other domestic producers are also struggling. Sirte Oil Co., another NOC subsidiary, has had to decrease output by about 20,000 barrels a day and more firms may follow suit, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Libya, home to Africa’s largest oil reserves, has been in chaos or at war since former dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi was toppled in 2011. That’s caused its crude production to be highly volatile.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries started unprecedented production cuts last May to bolster oil prices in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet Libya was exempted from a quota due to its conflict.
The NOC has long complained it needs more money to fix aging energy infrastructure. Its chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, told Bloomberg last month that daily output could rise to 1.45 million barrels this year and 1.6 million within two years if the company received adequate funds.
The NOC said in Monday’s statement that Libya’s central bank bears “full legal responsibility” for the situation after it refused to release 1 billion dinars ($222 million) that the government allocated to the sector. The NOC said it’s received less than 2% of the funds it needs this year to meet maintenance and production targets.
The unity government approved a budget last month that allotted $1.6 billion -- the biggest portion of development spending -- to the state oil company. Sanalla said he was satisfied with that sum.

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, but the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%, while the blue chip Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.3%.
 British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) stock fell 5.6% and Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) stock fell 5.4% on reports that the U.S. administration wants tobacco companies to cut the level of nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels, something that would undermine the groups' long-term sales prospects.
Atos (PA:ATOS) stock dropped 5.1% after the French IT consulting group announced it had acquired three more companies, while reporting a drop in its first-quarter revenue.
Associated British Foods (OTC:ASBFY) stock fell 2.2% after the U.K.-based retailer reported a halving in first half profit, as the Covid-19 lockdown continued to weigh on revenues at its Primark fashion stores.
Petrofac (LON:PFC) stock fell 1.9% as the provider of services to the oil industry reported a loss for 2020, while  Danone  (PA:DANO) stock fell 1.9% after posting a 3.3% fall in first quarter sales, as lockdowns continued to dent its bottled water and baby food sales.
This was some positive economic news, as the U.K. jobless rate fell to 4.9% in the quarter through February, from 5.1%, but this has to be tempered with the realisation that company payrolls fell for the first time in four months as more people pulled out of the workforce.
German producer prices for March also surprised to the upside, climbing 0.9% on the month, a gain of 3.7% on the year.
Earlier Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China kept its loan prime rate steady at 3.85% earlier in the day, as widely expected.

Oil prices strengthened Tuesday, aided by continued optimism that the reopening of economies will stoke consumption and also boosted by a weaker U.S. dollar.
Buyers using other currencies pay less for dollar-denominated oil when the greenback weakens.
On the supply side, investors await inventories data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $64.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $67.87 after gaining 4.6% Wednesday. Both contracts are up more than 30% in 2021.

Tech powerhouse Taiwan, home to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), has become front and centre of efforts to resolve that shortfall, whose impact is now being felt in consumer electronics too.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier wrote to Taiwan's government this year asking for help to ease tight chip supplies, and Europe is also encouraging more chip production at home.
Filip Grzegorzewski, the EU's de facto ambassador in Taiwan, told reporters they will organise another investment forum later this year to sell the bloc as an investment destination.
""We want to organise another round of the European investment forum in the autumn, with the focus on global supply chains, the focus on digital and the focus on semiconductors,"" he said. 
""I'm sure it will be a way for us to present opportunities for Taiwan to reach out to Europe and be more present in Europe.""
Taiwan is a key part of global supply chains and a major trading partner of the EU's, Grzegorzewski said. 
""We need to now make sure that Taiwan uses its assets well ... Taiwan has more than TSMC to offer. There are other excellent semiconductor companies in Taiwan,"" he said.
There needs to be ""more of Taiwan in Europe"" and for the island's business community to think of the opportunities the EU brings, which will also be good for Taiwan, he added. 
""It will strengthen Taiwan's role globally and that will also strengthen Taiwan's role in the global supply chains that are now evolving, changing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

The European Union has no official diplomatic ties with the Chinese-claimed, democratically-run island, though Taiwan considers the bloc to be an important like-minded friend.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 02:20AM ET</span>",Pandemic prompts European life sciences real estate rush,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - London's Francis Crick Institute was already a magnet for investors in the capital's so-called Knowledge Quarter, but the coronavirus pandemic has lifted interest in offices and laboratories dedicated to life sciences to a new level.
Investors have been drawn into European real estate dedicated to life sciences, which spans sectors such as biomedical devices and pharmaceuticals, by an ageing population and strong academic research in the region.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has fast-forwarded the script.
""Life sciences have never been more under the spotlight because of what we've all had to endure,"" Peter Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), chief executive of real estate investor AshbyCapital, told Reuters.
In January, together with Montrose Land, AshbyCapital bought an Edwardian building near the Crick bio-medical research centre in the heart of the Knowledge Quarter life sciences hub. 
The building, which should be fitted out for rental to life science tenants in 2024, was AshbyCapital's first investment in the sector and Ferrari hopes it will be a starting point for taking on ""one or two more"" similar projects.
Investors say there is demand in both urban centres and out-of-town science parks in Britain and other parts of Europe to accommodate an industry which tends to be recession-proof.
Real estate money is looking for new avenues as retail property and offices face the challenge of people increasingly shopping and working from home, analysts and investors say.
Commercial real estate investment volumes in Europe totalled 277 billion euros ($333 billion) in 2020, down 17% from a year earlier as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, real estate broker CBRE says.
Although less than 1% of European real estate investment is in life sciences, a recent report from the Urban Land Institute shows, strong government and venture capital investment in the sector is encouraging piggy-backing by real estate investors.
And real estate broker JLL estimates that up to 15 billion pounds ($21 billion) has been allocated to British life sciences real estate, of which less than 10% has been deployed to date.
Glenn Crocker, head of UK life sciences at JLL, said it had been approached by 20 real estate developers and investors to discuss life sciences in January, following 100 conversations in 2020, reflecting the strength of interest.
Not every area is suitable for a life sciences centre, as the infrastructure of nearby universities, major hospitals and good housing or cultural activities is also needed.
""I am a little bit sceptical about the sudden interest,"" Zachary Gauge, European real estate analyst at UBS, told a recent news briefing, adding that the specialist nature of life science buildings meant they could be difficult to trade.
GOLDEN TRIANGLE
Although Britain's so-called Golden Triangle of life sciences centres in London, Oxford and Cambridge leads the way in Europe, areas such as Bio Science Park in the Dutch city of Leiden, which is home to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine producer Janssen, is one of several major European ones.
Private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX)'s real estate life sciences investment in Britain, which is made through its $20 billion enterprise value portfolio company BioMed Realty, includes several science park buildings in Cambridge.
""The pandemic put the industry and its researchers in the forefront ... There is extraordinary demand for talent and space,"" Bill Kane, BioMed's president of East Coast and UK markets, told Reuters.
Meanwhile, British insurance and investment group Legal & General last year invested 200 million pounds in Oxford University's Life and Mind Building.
""Life science is derisked at the moment by the fact there is huge interest in the sector,"" said Eleanor Jukes, senior investment manager at L&G, adding that real estate valuations had risen due to the ""huge weight of capital"" looking to buy. 
L&G recently sold five buildings in a Cambridge science park after a fierce bidding war for a total 97 million pounds, 59% above valuation levels.
In addition to U.S. investors and Canadian pension funds, Middle Eastern money is also showing interest, said Ghada Sousou, CEO of real estate recruitment firm Sousou Partners.
Real estate demand is outstripping supply. In Cambridge, there are lab requirements of more than 400,000 square feet, and supply of less than 100,000, Sue Foxley, research director at real estate consultancy Bidwells, said.
(Cambridge Office & Labs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprwmoqve/Cambridgeoffice.png)
BUILDING HAZARDS
But the sector is not for the faint-hearted.
Life science buildings range from traditional offices and laboratories to ""dry labs"" - research offices with extra technology needs.
The buildings may have special requirements such as extra power supplies, arrangements for the safe disposal of hazards and higher than average ceilings.
""There's an extra cost in that,"" said Carl Potter, a managing director at real estate consultants Avison Young. 
""That cost has to be reflected in rents.""
Prime office rents in King's Cross, inside the Knowledge Quarter, are 83 pounds per square foot per annum compared with the City of London at 81 pounds and the Canary Wharf district at 51.50 pounds, according to the ULI report.
Investors and developers have to kit out buildings without necessarily knowing who their future tenants will be, and if there will be one or several. 
Richard Fagg, development director at VINCI UK Developments, said this raised the question ""will value be secured?"", adding that ""strong conviction is needed"".
Developers have to be flexible so that buildings can be altered relatively easily. Industry sources say bespoke buildings can be hard to market to new tenants.
""Every commercial developer is interested in life science,"" said Steven Charlton, principal managing director of architects Perkins&Will, adding that the practicalities can be a deterrent.
But Gauge at UBS said there was a risk the enthusiasm for life sciences real estate could be short-lived: ""I'm worried about having a kneejerk reaction to COVID.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese automaker Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp said on Tuesday that it was suspending production at its plant in Indiana through the end of April due to a global shortage of semiconductors.
Automakers from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor have cut production due to the shortage of chips, used extensively in new cars for automatic windows, parking assistance and entertainment systems.
A Subaru spokeswoman said 15,000 vehicles for North America would be affected. 

She said that a continued global shortage for chips, rather than a recent fire at Renesas Electronics Corp's chip-making factory, was the main factor behind the suspension. 
Increased demand for video games from people staying at home amid a global pandemic has also led to the scarcity, analysts say.

The group said it decided to conduct a full accounting review of the two U.S. legal entities and would give a status update at the time of first half results on July 28.
Earlier in April, it disclosed that auditors had found accounting errors at those units, leading the shares to slump 18%.

Atos confirmed its full-year guidance of revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% and an operating margin of between 9.4% and 9.8%.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>","Austria to funnel 651,000 COVID vaccine doses to Western Balkans from EU","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria said on Tuesday it plans to funnel 651,000 doses of BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s coronavirus vaccine to six countries of the Western Balkans by August as part of a European Union scheme to provide assistance to neighbouring countries and Africa.
The European Commission outlined its plans for a vaccine- sharing mechanism in January. Austria said it would serve as that mechanism's coordinator for the Western Balkans, and that this first distribution of doses may be followed by others.
Serbia has one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, but the four other non-EU countries of the former Yugoslavia and Albania have had less success. In Bosnia, the shortage of vaccines has led to street protests.
""With this initiative we are showing that we are not leaving the region behind,"" Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. His country, the successor state to an empire that once stretched deep into the Balkans, maintains close ties with countries in the region.
Austria has negotiated agreements between BioNTech and Pfizer and the recipient countries, its Foreign Ministry said. It will provide bridge financing of 11 million euros ($13 million), though the doses will be paid for from EU assistance funds for EU candidate and potential candidate countries.
""There is absolutely no connection here to the provision of vaccines in Austria and in other (EU) member states,"" said Schallenberg, whose government faces growing public frustration with the slow pace of vaccinations.
""These doses are not from a national quota. These are vaccine doses that the EU explicitly secured from the beginning for the purpose of passing them on to partners.""
They will be distributed from early May according to which countries need them most, he said. Bosnia will get the biggest share with 214,000 doses, followed by Albania with 145,000 and North Macedonia with 119,000. Serbia is last with 36,000.

WASHINGTON/BERKELEY (Reuters) -Texas police will serve search warrants on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Tuesday to secure data from a fatal vehicle crash, a senior officer told Reuters on Monday, after CEO Elon Musk said company checks showed the car's Autopilot driver assistance system was not engaged.
Mark Herman, Harris County Constable Precinct 4, said evidence including witness statements clearly indicated there was nobody in the driver's seat of the Model S when it crashed into a tree, killing two people, on Saturday night. 
Herman said a tweet by Musk on Monday afternoon, saying that data logs retrieved by the company so far ruled out the use of the Autopilot system, was the first officials had heard from the company.
""If he is tweeting that out, if he has already pulled the data, he hasn’t told us that,"" Herman told Reuters. ""We will eagerly wait for that data.""
The crash is the 28th Telsa accident to be investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety. 
It is also being probed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which removed Tesla as a party to an earlier investigation into a fatal crash in 2018 after the company made public details of the probe without authorisation.
In Saturday's accident, the 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at high-speed near Houston when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the road, crashing into a tree and bursting into flames, Herman said.
Authorities found the bodies of two men in the car, one in the front passenger seat and the owner of the car in the backseat.
""We have witness statements from people that said they left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself,"" Herman said.
Tesla's Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel at times, but Tesla says its features ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""
In his tweet, Musk rejected the idea that the vehicle's semi-automated driving software was to blame: ""Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled & this car did not purchase FSD,"" in a reference to Full Self-Driving, Tesla's separate beta semi-automated driver assistance system that still requires driver supervision.
Musk added that ""standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have,"" referring to road markers that need to be captured by a vehicle's cameras to enable autopilot. 
Tesla has access to operational and diagnostic data delivered to its servers at ""regular intervals"" from the car, which has been impounded by police. It is unclear whether investigators will be able to retrieve data directly from the event data recorder in the severely burned vehicle.
Just hours before the crash, Musk had tweeted: ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""
'SHOULDN'T BE A DEATH RISK'
Tesla's Autopilot system, which was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, has come under increasing scrutiny.
NHTSA told Reuters last month it had opened 27 special investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active, in crashes believed to have been tied to Autopilot use. 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Its shares closed down 3.4% Monday before picking up 1.5% in after hours trading following Musk's tweet.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that ""using Tesla's driverless system — or any other — shouldn't be a death risk. Advancements in driving technology must first & foremost be safe.""

The NTSB, which makes safety recommendations but cannot compel recalls, said its investigation into the Texas crash would focus ""on the vehicle's operation and the post-crash fire.""
Fire officials said it took four hours to completely extinguish the fire because of the car's lithium ion battery.

(Reuters) -Australian buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay said on Tuesday it is exploring a U.S. listing after North America became its biggest market, offering global investors an easier path to owning a stock that has boomed through the pandemic.
Afterpay has tapped Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to advise on the listing, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Goldman declined to comment. 
The Melbourne-based firm was last valued at nearly A$37 billion ($28.7 billion) despite never having posted a profit, thanks to the coronavirus-driven surge in online shopping and rapid expansion in overseas markets including the United States.
Releasing its third-quarter results on Tuesday, Afterpay said North America sales had nearly tripled, overtaking Australia and helping to double the total value of transactions it processed to A$5.2 billion compared with a year earlier.
A U.S. listing would likely further open up the Australian fintech star to an investor base that lends greater weight toward growth, and also potentially provide easier access to capital to fund expansion plans.
Afterpay co-CEO Nick Molnar, who co-founded the company in 2015, told Reuters it was a ""proud Australian-headquartered organisation"" but a U.S. listing could provide ""attractive opportunities"".
""The prioritisation on exploring a U.S. listing is purely around does it provide the business more operating leverage from the perspective of being present in the market that is now the greatest contributing segment ... and provide us the right investor base,"" he said.
Afterpay said in a statement it planned to remain headquartered in Australia, but did not specify if a U.S. market debut would be based on a dual-listing structure or result in it giving up its Australian berth. It also did not give a timeframe.
In North America Afterpay is pitted against Affirm, Zip Co's Quadpay, new entrant PayPal and Sweden's Klarna, which is valued at $31 billion and looking at a direct listing in the United States.
Affirm's $17 billion valuation was based on 4.5 million shoppers while Afterpay had 14.6 million, implying a valuation over $47 billion, said Emanuel Datt, founder of Datt Capital which bought Afterpay shares around A$7.00 in 2018.
""U.S. investors are generally willing to pay a higher multiple for a growth business like Afterpay. That is related to the deeper pools of capital that are available ... relative to Australia,"" Datt said.
Shares of Afterpay were trading flat at A$126.17 by midsession on Tuesday, compared to a slight dip in the broader market. The stock is up more than 200% since its pre-pandemic high in Feb 2020.
Afterpay's growth has slowed in Australia and this year it will likely face margin pressure as the country's biggest bank and PayPal launch BNPL offerings with a promise of lower fees.

The company last month launched in parts of mainland Europe and plans to move into Asia. Its self-branded savings accounts linked to  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp are expected to go live later this year.

Lawmakers voted 321-101 to approve the bill and send it to the Senate.
The bill clarifies that proceeds from legitimate cannabis businesses would not be considered illegal and directs federal regulators to craft rules for how they would supervise such banking activity.
Banks have generally been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run afoul of federal laws. 
That has left companies in the marijuana industry with few options, including relying on just a handful of small financial institutions or doing business in cash. 
The American Bankers Association has lobbied aggressively for the ""SAFE Banking Act"" bill. 
""Banks find themselves in a difficult situation due to the conflict between state and federal law, with local communities encouraging them to bank cannabis businesses and federal law prohibiting it,"" the group wrote in a letter to lawmakers on Monday. ""Congress must act to resolve this conflict."" 
Thirty-six states have legalized medical cannabis while 17 states now allow adult use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, in an early-April interview with Politico, said he would try to advance legislation legalizing marijuana use for adults. Asked about the SAFE Banking Act, he said he would like to see such a bill move forward as part of a more comprehensive measure - even if President Joe Biden was not supportive.

UK motorists now have to pay 538 pounds ($747.01) on an average for their comprehensive car insurance premiums, according to the latest index from price comparison site Confused.com in association with insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW).
""The impact of fewer drivers on the roads has led to fewer claims, which have allowed shoppers to see some of the biggest savings on their car insurance in almost six years,"" Chief Executive Officer of Confused.com Louise O'Shea said in the survey report.
""The sensitivity of the current economic climate means that these savings couldn't come at a better time.""
British motor insurers  Admiral Group  (LON:ADML) and Direct Line experienced a boost to their 2020 financials due to fewer claims in the past year.
Premiums during the first three months of 2021 fell by 7% compared with the prior quarter, according to the survey that adopted an updated calculation methodology.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top banks may face action to make it easier for small businesses to open a bank account, British lawmakers said on Tuesday, after companies complained about lenders as they struggle during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mel Stride, the chair of parliament's Treasury Select Committee, said he has written to Natwest,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Metro Bank, HSBC, Santander (MC:SAN) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) to ask if they have changed their criteria for opening business accounts since the pandemic began.
Lawmakers want to know by May 19 whether waiting times for opening an account have increased, how complaints are handled, and whether lenders are planning to withdraw from the small business market.
""It's critical that these institutions are adapting to the requirements of small and medium sized enterprises as the economy starts to pick up,"" Stride said in a statement.
""The Committee wants to know more about the state of the business current account market, and whether action needs to be taken to mitigate the difficulties faced by SMEs.""

Average fuel cost climbed nearly 30% to $1.74 per gallon in the quarter from the previous three months, while passenger traffic fell 52% compared to the same period in 2020. The World Health Organization did not declare COVID-19 a pandemic until near the end of the first quarter in 2020. 
United Airlines said it expects fuel costs to rise by another 5% in the second quarter.
The airline, however, forecast a return to profitability later this year and said it expects to restore some capacity cuts as more people are willing to travel. 
Capacity should reach 45% of 2019's level in the second quarter from 2019, United said. 
United's adjusted net loss was about $2.40 billion for the first quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate for a loss of about $2.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in a statement the airline now sees ""a clear path to profitability.""
United shares fell 1.8% in aftermarket trading.
Rival Delta Air too had pointed to higher fuel costs in part for its quarterly loss and pinned its hope on profitability later in 2021 as rapid COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to boost air travel. 
United said earlier on Monday that it was adding three flights to Croatia, Greece and Iceland, which are among countries reopening for vaccinated travelers.
The Chicago-based carrier expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to turn positive later this year even if business and long-haul international demand remains 70% below 2019 levels.
United forecast its second-quarter total unit revenue, which compares sales to flight capacity, to fall 20% compared with the same period in 2019. That would be less than the 27% drop in the first quarter.

The company expects core cash flow to remain positive for the rest of 2021 after it turned positive in March.

JBS shares were up 4% on Monday afternoon as analysts cheered the meatpacker's move into the fast-growing, value-added vegetarian sector. JBS ""is back in M&A mode,"" BTG Pactual wrote in a client note, highlighting that the company has now announced six acquisitions in the last two years. 
Vivera has a portfolio of 50 products with three production facilities and a research and development facility in the Netherlands. The company sells in the Dutch, German and UK markets, accounting for roughly 60% of Europe's plant-based protein market, as well as other countries, according to JBS.
JBS Chief Executive Gilberto Tomazoni said that Vivera will give the Brazilian company more exposure to the meatless segment. The acquisition will add to JBS' Planterra unit that sells the OZO brand and its Seara unit's Incrível line in Brazil.
""It's a growing segment globally...we will be a relevant player in this sector,"" Tomazoni said in an interview. 
""The acquisition makes strategic sense, to greatly accelerate our strategy in the plant-based segment."" 
JBS said in a statement that Vivera would be maintained as an independent unit with its current leadership.
Vivera has $100 million in annual revenue, which makes it the third largest plant-based protein company in Europe, Tomazoni said. That compares to JBS' 2020 net revenue of 270 billion reais ($48.33 billion), mostly derived from the North American market.
Vivera has grown about 25-30% annually in recent years, Tomazoni said.
The executive said that the company is continuing to actively look for deals at the right price that make strategic sense.

He also said that the company maintains its plans to list its United States subsidiary, and it was only a question of timing. He declined to give further details.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday the company planned to launch several audio products, including Clubhouse-style live audio rooms and a way for users to find and play podcasts.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s incursion into the audio market comes as the sudden explosion of interest in Clubhouse, an audio app where billionaires and celebrities including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk have popped in to chat, could be waning. Downloads of the Clubhouse app, which is only available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iOS devices, suffered an estimated 70% decline in downloads in March from February when it hit a high. 
Zuckerberg said the world's largest social media network planned in the coming months to launch features including short-form audio clips called ""Soundbites"" and ways to create sound effects or improve audio quality. Facebook said in a blog post https:// it would begin to test live audio rooms, which would launch by the summer. 
Zuckerberg said Facebook was looking to ""treat audio as a first-class medium in the way that we would photos or video"" in an interview on Discord with Casey Newton, editor of newsletter Platformer. 
The rapid growth of the year-old app Clubhouse has demonstrated the potential of audio chat services.
What is not clear is if Clubhouse, which just closed a new round of Series C funding in which a source said it was valued at $4 billion, will have staying power as installs decline.
The app, which is not yet available on Android, faces competition from multiple companies working on Clubhouse clones.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) is testing its live audio feature Spaces, along with new features from Discord, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), Slack and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology. 
Reddit also unveiled a preview of its ""Reddit Talks"" product to moderators on Monday. 
Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated Clubhouse had a 72% decline in growth from about 9.6 million February installs to about 2.4 million in March.
Facebook, which has long been criticized for its handling of problematic content across its products, will face the challenges of moderating live and recorded audio content.
Facebook said its live audio rooms would be available on its Messenger product and in its main app. It said it would test the rooms with public figures as well as in Groups - a product the company has vigorously promoted as providing places for people with common interests but which have also been used to spread misinformation and organize extremist activity.
As part of the announcements, Zuckerberg also said Facebook is working with Spotify on ""Project Boombox"" to share and listen to music on its platform.

Facebook said users would be able to send donations, or tips, to creators in live audio rooms through ""Stars"". After launch, it will offer other types of monetization like single-purchase access or subscription for rooms. It also announced an audio creator fund for Soundbites.
The company is working to attract more creators who are accustomed to receiving tips and other direct payments from fans.

Ben Smith, speaking at an online industry event as a 1.036 billion euros ($1.25 billion) share issue by the airline group nears completion, signalled it could move relatively quickly to seek further funds and reduce debt.
""We do have heavy debt that is holding back our balance sheet, so this may have to get looked at again later in the year,"" he said, adding Air France-KLM was encouraged by European progress on vaccinations and digital health passes.
The capital hike sees the French government more than double its stake in the airline group to almost 30% as part of a total recapitalisation package worth about 4 billion euros announced earlier this month.
The stock issue at 4.84 euros per share will raise 1.036 billion euros with the full exercise of an option to increase the offering, the airliner said, after its shares closed at 5.03 euros in Paris.
It follows last year's 10.4 billion-euro debt bailout for the group, backed by the French and Dutch governments.
""This is positive for them in terms of getting through these difficult times but negative in that it's giving them enormous debts for the future and potential political interference,"" aviation consultant John Strickland said at the same event.
As part of the latest package, France is transforming 3 billion euros of government loans into hybrid bond instruments, while the Netherlands is seeking European Union approval for the similar conversion of another 1 billion. The new share issue will dilute the Dutch government's equity stake to 9.3%.
China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) will increase its stake in the group from 8.8% to 9.6%. As expected, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will see its holding diluted to 5.8%.
Air France-KLM currently plans at least to match the 50% of pre-crisis summer flight capacity it managed last year and is optimistic about a sharper rebound, Smith said.
""We're loading capacity on an opportunistic basis,"" the CEO added. ""We do have enough crew trained and qualified to fly much more.""

(Reuters) - Pro-Trump businessman Mike Lindell on Monday escalated his legal fight with voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems, responding to its recent defamation case with a countersuit of his own.
Lindell's privately owned company, My Pillow Inc, sued Dominion in federal court in Minnesota, alleging a campaign to ""silence"" and ""punish"" him for his claims about the election software company.
The lawsuit came two months after Dominion brought a $1.3 billion dollar case against Lindell in federal court in Washington.
""This is a meritless, retaliatory lawsuit, filed by MyPillow to try to distract from the harm it caused to Dominion,"" Stephen Shackelford, a lawyer for Dominion, said in a statement.
Lindell, a staunch supporter of Republican former President Donald Trump, financed post-election protest movements in a bid to overturn Democratic President Joe Biden’s Nov. 3 victory.
Lindell used his personal Twitter account, which had nearly half a million followers before being suspended, and media appearances to falsely claim that Dominion's voting machines rigged the election.
Dominion's Feb. 22 lawsuit, which named both Lindell and Chaska, Minnesota-based My Pillow as defendants, accused the businessman of launching a ""defamatory marketing campaign about Dominion that reached millions of people and caused enormous harm to Dominion.""
The new My Pillow lawsuit said Dominion's litigation against him violates his right to free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Under U.S. law, the First Amendment only applies to government officials and entities, not private companies. Lindell argues that Dominion, because of its role in helping administer elections, was acting ""under color of law"" and should be viewed like a government entity.
Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said My Pillow's lawsuit showed a ""misunderstanding"" of the First Amendment and would be dismissed. 

""It's an abuse of the court system,"" she said.

Google has already come under pressure from the authorities this year for failing to delete what Russia calls banned content. Other western internet companies have also been targeted by Moscow, including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) , which has been punitively slowed down.
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The FAS said the case concerned Google's YouTube unit and that the company's actions had resulted in the sudden blocking and deletion of some users' accounts, which it said could lead to restricted competition.

The state agency last week initiated proceedings against  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX), sometimes referred to as 'Russia's Google', over competition law violations on the company's search engine, allegations that Yandex has denied.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose 0.5% Monday after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said it expects the iPhone maker to announce an additional $50 billion buyback when it declares its earnings on April 28.
Buybacks reduce the total share size of the company and boost EPS. Companies resort to buybacks when they think their stock price is low or when they have excess cash. In Apple’s case, it’s the latter.
Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers reiterated an overweight with a $160 target. That’s 18.5% higher than the stock’s current price.
“Alongside F2Q21 results, we expect the company to announce an increase to its share repurchase authorization of~$50B, which compares to increases of $35B, $100B, $75B, and $50B in 2017, 2018,2019, and 2020, respectively,” Rakers wrote.
But, according to the analyst, a bigger driver of the stock could be an increase in the dividend.  
“Additionally, and perhaps a more important near-term driver of shares, we believe Apple could announce a dividend increase of +10% or more given significant FCF generation,” he said.
If it happens, the dividend hike would be the highest since 2018, when the company announced a 16% dividend increase. It would mark Apple’s return to around 10% annual dividend growth trajectory, up from +5.5% and +6.5% increases in 2019 and 2020, respectively, according to Rakers.
In a not-so-related development, the Cupertino, California-based company will allow Parler to be back on the app store. The move follows improvements the right-leaning social media company has made to moderate hate speech and incitement, according to a letter Apple sent to Congress.
Apple removed the app from its store after the Capitol riots, citing Parler's refusal to remove the hate content posted on the platform.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>","Arizona mining fight pits economy, EVs against conservation, culture","By Ernest Scheyder
SUPERIOR, Ariz. (Reuters) - Early last year, Darrin Lewis paid $800,000 for a hardware store in a tiny Arizona town where mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc hopes to build one of the world's largest underground copper mines.
Rio buys materials from Lewis's Superior Hardware & Lumber for its Resolution mine site, accounting for a third of the store's sales and helping to keep it afloat during the coronavirus pandemic.
But U.S. President Joe Biden put the mining project on hold last month in response to the concerns of Native Americans who say it will destroy sacred land and of environmentalists who worry it will gobble up water in a drought-stricken state. 
That's fueled anxiety among Lewis and others here in Superior, Arizona, who want to reap the economic benefits of a mine that would harvest more than 40 billion pounds of copper.
""I sunk everything I have into this place,"" said Lewis, surrounded by hammer drills, wrenches and other goods in his store. ""It would absolutely devastate us if this mine doesn't open.""
In halting the project, Biden reversed a decision by predecessor Donald Trump that would have given Rio land for the mine. Biden ordered more government analysis of the project.
The ongoing fight pits conservationists and Native Americans against local officials and residents who support its economic benefits. The complex debate is a harbinger of battles to come as the U.S. aims to build more electric vehicles, which use twice as much copper as those with internal combustion engines. The Resolution mine could fill about 25% of the demand for U.S. cooper.
The Arizona dispute centers on Oak Flat Campground, which some Apache (NASDAQ:APA) consider home to deities known as Ga'an. Religious ceremonies are held at the site, near the San Carlos Apache Reservation, to celebrate teenage girls coming of age. Many Apache have ancestors buried under the volcanic rock.
In 2014, the Obama administration and Congress set in motion a complex process intended to give Rio 3,000 acres of federally-owned land, including the campground, in exchange for 4,500 acres that Rio owns nearby. Biden has paused that transfer.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment. 
""If Rio gets this place, then the mine will kill the angels and the deities that live here,"" said Wendsler Nosie, a San Carlos Apache tribe member who has led a protest camp for 18 months at the site. A sign there describes the land, known as Chi'chil Bildagoteel in the Western Apache language, as the physical embodiment of the earth's spirit.
Nosie has marshaled widespread support for his cause, helped by rising global attention to the rights of indigenous peoples. Rio itself fueled that cause last year when it blew up culturally significant Aboriginal rock shelters in Australia.
If the land swap is approved, Rio has said it would keep the campground open for the next few decades before the underground mine causes a crater that would swallow the site. The company has also said it would seek tribal consent for the project and study ways to avoid causing the crater.
""The land exchange gives us the opportunity to collect more data, then we can refine our plans and look for ways that we can do further avoidance and minimization"" of site damage, said Vicky Peacey, a senior permitting manager for the Rio project.
Rio, which is based in Australia and the United Kingdom, has also promised to preserve other cultural sites including Apache Leap, a rock cliff that overlooks Superior and where Apaches jumped to their deaths to avoid capture by U.S. troops in the late 19th century.
'AMERICAN COPPER'
Politicians in Superior - a town of 3,000 residents that voted nearly two-to-one for Democrat Biden last November in a majority-Republican county - are now prodding the president to change his mind.
The land swap, if Biden approves, would also let the town of Superior buy more than 600 acres that officials say is crucial to diversifying the local economy by expanding the airport, developing an industrial park and building affordable housing.
""President Biden is going to have to make some courageous decisions,"" said Mayor Mila Besich, a Democrat.
Mining is essential to accomplishing Biden's goal of expanding EV production, she said. ""We're going to need more American copper,"" she said.
While the region has long been popular with hikers and campers, it is better known as the ""Copper Corridor,"" with mines from Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc and others.
The closure of the Magma copper mine in 1996 devastated Superior's economy. Officials have pinned their hopes now on Resolution. Since the copper deposit was first discoved in 1995, Rio and minority partner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Plc have spent more than $2 billion to dig an exploratory mine shaft and dismantle an old Magma smelter. They have yet to produce any copper. BHP declined to comment.
More than half of the buildings in Superior's downtown sit empty. Several Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc charging stations hint at the town's aspirations to be part of the EV boom. Nikola Corp and Lucid Motors are building their own EV plants less than 50 miles (80 km) away.
Rio has promised to hire 1,400 full-time workers at an average annual salary of more than $100,000. That's nearly half the population in a town whose median income is a third below the national average. 
""What's sacred to my community is that people have a job and have a home,"" said Besich, the mayor.
The mine would boost state, local and federal tax coffers by $280 million annually and add $1 billion to the state's economy, Arizona's governor said.
Besich pushed back when studies showed Rio would only pay the town $350,000 a year in taxes, far below the $1 million would need annually for increased police, firefighting and road maintenance.
Rio agreed to pay the town more, to guarantee Superior's water supply and to donate $1.2 million to the school district. Superintendent Steve Estatico said without Rio's support the district's schools – where enrollment has dropped 13 percent since 2016 – may close.
""Rio's had to learn over the last few years that it cannot take host communities for granted,"" Besich said.
STALLED NEGOTIATIONS
The San Carlos Apache - one of the first Native American tribes to endorse Biden's presidential bid - have not negotiated with Rio because its tribal council favors direct talks with the U.S. government, said Chairman Terry Rambler.
Rio's copper chief, Bold Baatar, said he hopes to negotiate directly with the tribe when he visits Arizona as early as June, once pandemic restrictions allow.
""We are hearing the concerns from everyone,"" Baatar told Reuters. ""There will not be a mine until we achieve maximum effort to seek consent.""
Not all local Native Americans oppose the mine. Some members of the White Mountain Apache tribe, whose reservation is just north of the San Carlos Apache's, say they do not consider the campground a sacred site.
""The belief that the site is religious, that's news to me,"" said Alvena Bush, a White Mountain Apache councilwoman who supports the project. 
WATER WORRIES
Rio has dug a mine shaft nearly 7,000 feet (2 km) underground on land it owns near the campground. The bottom of the shaft has become a staging ground for future mining operations.
The miner is draining water from the nearby copper deposit to make it easier to extract. More than 600 gallons of water are pumped each minute to treatment plants on the surface for use in local farming.
Rio plans to mine the copper using a technique known as block caving. It involves carving a cave out of a large section of rock, which then collapses under the weight of the rock above, creating a crater 2 miles (3 km) wide and 1,000 (304 m) feet deep.
This method would damage aquifers that feed two local springs, according to an environmental study from the U.S. Forest Service. The entire mine would reduce available groundwater in the area, which has been in a drought since the late 1990s, the report said.
""This land is going to be worthless if there's no water to go with it,"" said Henry Munoz, who leads a group of retired Superior miners opposed to the project.
Biden is expected to decide later this spring on whether to give Rio the land for the mine. Lewis, the hardware store owner, hopes his plight will be considered among all the competing interests.

""If I had one thing to say to President Biden, it would be: 'Let the mine open,'"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ukraine could face diesel shortages in May because of planned maintenance at the Belarus Mozyr refinery coinciding with a break in supply from Russia's Rosneft, five trading sources told Reuters on Monday.
Swiss-based trader Proton Energy Group, which supplied Rosneft diesel and liquefied petroleum gas to Ukraine, stopped exports from April 1 and new supplier Coral Energy has yet to take over, sources have said.
Ukraine consumes more than 7 million tonnes of diesel a year, importing two thirds of its needs, mainly from Russia and Belarus. After Proton stopped supplies, Ukraine sought to increase seaborne imports but volumes have been insufficient. 
Rosneft, which supplied about 1.75 million tonnes of diesel to Ukraine last year via pipelines and railways, does not plan to resume exports next month and Belarus Mozyr refinery is set for planned maintenance from May 15 to June 15, traders said. 
Mozyr is expected to supply about 150,000 tonnes of diesel to Ukraine in May, down from the usual 240,000 tonnes a month, traders said. 
""We expect a deficit of around 270,000 tonnes in May,"" one of the sources said.
Another source estimated that the diesel shortages could be between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes next month, when major grain producer Ukraine would be in the middle of its sowing season.
Ukraine has previously increased imports from sea ports and by rail to compensate for shortages, but it was not clear how it would act on this occasion, traders said. 

Rosneft, Coral Energy, Mozyr refinery and the Ukranian Energy Ministry did not respond immediately to Reuters' requests for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England gave the green light on Monday to a new type of account at the central bank to bolster Britain's credentials in financial innovation and open up payments to more competition.
The BoE said it would offer an ""omnibus"" account to cater for a wider range of anticipated payments systems, such as those based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain, the technology which underpins crypto-assets like bitcoin.
""Under the new model, an operator of a payment system can hold funds in the omnibus account to fund their participants’ balances with central bank money,"" the BoE said in a statement.
""This will allow them to offer innovative payment services, while having the security of central bank money settlement.""
A central bank account means less credit risk as potential defaults from many intermediaries will be stripped out.
Fnality, which is backed by 15 banks, said on Monday it has submitted an application to the BoE to become the operator of an omnibus account for its planned DLT-based payment system.
""This is huge for the sector,"" Fnality CEO Rhomaios Ram said of the BoE announcement, adding it was a sign that authorities were becoming more comfortable with blockchain-type innovation.
""The big question before was are the authorities even going to allow something like this to happen.""
Money in the omnibus account would be owned by participants on Fnality's platform, which include  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Lloyds (LON:LLOY), UBS and Santander (MC:SAN). They would exchange stocks, bonds, derivatives and other assets directly with each other on a wholesale basis.
The change of ownership in the assets would be recorded on Fnality's DLT accounting system without the need to go through many intermediaries, thereby saving on time and cost, while the money stayed in the omnibus account.

""This is uncharted territory for the BoE,"" Ram said in response to when he could expect to receive approval for the omnibus account.

BOAO, China (Reuters) - Chinese regulators are closely monitoring flows of foreign capital in and out of the country, government officials said on Monday, as overseas interest in Chinese equities grows.
Foreign investment in China's stock markets started to rise rapidly after their shares were included in the MSCI and FTSE indexes, said Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
The proportion of foreign holdings in Chinese stocks currently stands at 5%, he added in a panel session at the Boao Forum, which Beijing is trying to promote as Asia's answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos
Foreign investors in Chinese listed companies are still subject to a 30% ownership cap and have limited derivatives tools at their disposal in Chinese markets. 
China has a shortage of mature value investors and foreign investors will fill the gap, said Fang.
He added that the CSRC is paying ""close attention"" to large inflows and outflows of foreign funds in Chinese stock markets and that China would create conditions to attract more foreign investment in equities.
The CSRC is confident of keeping China's capital markets stable as the country opens them up, said Fang, adding that the regulator will take precautionary measures to head off risks and maintain daily quotas on foreign investment. 
Meanwhile, Xuan Changneng, deputy administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), said on the same panel that SAFE would also keep up regular monitoring of cross-border capital inflows.
External factors for China's currency, the yuan, to appreciate are weakening, he added.
The yuan gained more than 6% against the dollar in 2020 as China made a comparatively speedy recovery from the coronavirus outbreak and in January this year hit its strongest level since June 2018 at about 6.42 yuan. 

The currency is currently trading around 6.51 yuan to the dollar.

(Reuters) - A labor group that did not secure enough votes from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse workers in Alabama to form a union has formally objected to the election results and alleged the online retailer threatened to lay off staff, according to a government filing.
Amazon has denied the outcome resulted from intimidation of its employees and said it did not threaten layoffs or a facility closure.
Late on Friday, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) submitted nearly two dozen objections to Amazon's conduct during the election, which it said prevented employees from a ""free and uncoerced exercise of choice"" on whether to create the company's first-ever U.S. union.
The vote count earlier this month showed that workers at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse rejected joining the RWDSU by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Labor advocates had hoped the more than 5,800-person election at America's second-largest private employer would grow support for unions after a decline in membership over decades.
In the filing to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, shared with Reuters, the RWDSU requested the election results be set aside. It alleged that Amazon's agents unlawfully threatened employees with closure of the warehouse if they joined the RWDSU, and that the company emailed a warning it would lay off 75% of the proposed bargaining unit because of the union.
Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the alleged email or independently determine its veracity.
When contacted by Reuters, Amazon said in a statement: ""The fact is that less than 16% of employees at BHM1 voted to join a union. Rather than accepting these employees' choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda. We look forward to the next steps in the legal process.""
The RWDSU is requesting that an NLRB regional director schedule a hearing on its objections, which also focused on a ballot collection box at the warehouse - known as BHM1 - that the RWDSU said may have compromised the secrecy of workers' votes.

Amazon said the collection box was installed by the U.S. Postal Service at the site and covered by a tent, making it a convenient and private voting option for employees.

The stock is currently almost 27% off its 52-week high of $112.5.
The analyst sees “multiple positive catalysts (for the stock) over the next several months.”
Lowe listed potential inclusion of a 10-year solar tax credit extension and the revival of the 48C advanced manufacturing tax credit as triggers for the stock.
He believes the U.S. could also extend tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels, and he sees a possibility of sanctions against solar products sources from Xinjiang in China.
“Any one of the catalysts would cause FSLR to outperform, in our view, resulting in an attractive risk/reward proposition over the next several months,"" he wrote.

Investing.com -- The U.S. is born to be wild, again.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) roared 11% higher after raising guidance and blasting through expectations for the first quarter.
Motorcycle sales should increase between 30% and 35% compared to a previous estimate of 20% to 25%, with income margins of 7% to 9%, 200 basis points better than before. Financial services are expected to grow 50% to 60% compared to the initial estimate of 10% to 15%.
Earnings per share of $1.68 was almost double what analysts had forecast on sales of $1.42 billion, compared to estimates of $1.26 billion.
""I am very pleased with the pace of recovery that we have seen across our business, as demonstrated by the strong financial results this quarter. The actions we have taken to reshape the business are having a positive impact on our results, especially for our most important North American region,"" said Jochen Zeitz, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""I am confident Harley-Davidson in 2021 is a significantly leaner, faster, and more efficient organization which is ready to win and successfully deliver on our 5-year Hardwire strategy.""
The motorcycle maker appears to be making good on promises of a turnaround, thanks to demand out of North America, with sales jumping 30%, while Latin American and European sales tumbled. Shares hit their lowest in over a decade at the outset of the pandemic, which was followed by Zeitz's appointment and a plan to cut 700 positions and reduce costs.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has said it will consider forcing companies to disclose conflicting interests when they bid for EU-funded contracts, following an inquiry into its appointment of a division of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to help develop green banking rules.
The European Union watchdog rapped the Commission in November for appointing the Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) unit of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to produce a study that would inform EU plans to integrate sustainability into banking prudential rules.
European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) did not ask the Commission to cancel the contract, but said it should have better scrutinised BlackRock's motivation in bidding, its pricing strategy and its own measures to prevent conflicts of interest.
In a response published on Monday, the Commission said it will consider proposing amendments to EU law to require companies and organisations to disclose conflicting interests when they bid for EU-funded contracts.
It will also consider providing further guidance to assist staff dealing with public procurement.
""The Commission is reflecting on possible clarifications relevant to the procedure to follow when a professional conflicting interest may be at stake in a procurement procedure,"" it said. 
The Ombudsman welcomed the EU executive's response, which it said reflected its own suggestions. The Ombudsman will monitor the proposed changes, it said.
BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
BlackRock beat eight other bidders with its offer of 280,000 euros - roughly half the EU contract’s estimated value. The asset manager said it would ensure ""physical segregation"" of FMA to ensure information did not flow to other parts of its business. 

Any change to EU financial regulation would need to be approved by member states and the European Parliament. The Commission is due to propose an update to the regulation by the end of the year.

731,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 09:53AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Lower; Tesla Slides on Double Blow; Dow Down 110 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Monday, consolidating in the absence of major news after hitting successive record highs last week. 
Market sentiment was somewhat unsettled by the spectacle of an abrupt sell-off in cryptocurrencies at the weekend, a reminder of how febrile the atmosphere in financial markets has been at times during the pandemic. There were also concerns at two setbacks for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which was usual the most actively traded stock in early dealings. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 114 points, or 0.3%, at 34,086 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%. 
Tesla stock was down over 4% after a single protester at an auto show in China staged a protest against the company, alleging various quality defects, which quickly went viral. Given the tight government control over Chinese social media, and the recent state-orchestrated boycotts against other western companies, suspicions were immediately aroused that the protest was being used by the Chinese authorities to put pressure on Tesla, one of the highest-profile U.S. companies in China. That's important because China is expected to be Tesla's largest national market in the years to come.
The protest came after a weekend on which two people died in a crash that cast fresh doubt on the capabilities of Tesla's 'Full Self-Driving' software suite. Neither of the two passengers was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash, according to police in Harris County, Texas. 
Another stock heading lower was Peloton Interactive  (NASDAQ:PTON), after a public dispute with U.S. consumer protection regulators over the safety of its Tread+ exercise machine. The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a unilateral press release at the weekend urging the public not to use the machine, which has been linked to 39 dangerous incidents, including one death. Peloton restated its user guidelines and insisted that the machines are safe if used according to its instructions, but the stock fell 4.4%.
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock fell 0.9%, paring overnight losses after the sharp correction in cryptocurrencies appeared to run its course.
Among the gainers was Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) stock, which rose 11% after the company's guidance suggested a turnaround after a wretched couple of years. The motorcycle maker's first-quarter earnings showed surprisingly strong orders for its touring bikes.
Also gaining was the preferred stock of British soccer club Manchester United  (NYSE:MANU), which rose 8.9% after it and several other leading lights of European soccer revealed plans to break away from Europe's establishment and form their own league. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was reported to have arranged $6 billion for the league's founding members.in order to allay any fears they may have had about being expelled from their current national and European competitions. 
Elsewhere, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 8.9% after news that its CEO is stepping down to make way for a more digitally-oriented successor. In addition, reports indicated that one of the most prominent retail investors supporting the stock, known widely as The Roaring Kitty, had exercised a substantial block of call options on the stock. "
732,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 09:35AM ET</span>",Doctors say clot treatment advice key to U.S. resuming J&J COVID vaccines,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Resuming the use of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine in the United States will require clear guidelines for the medical community on how to best treat patients that develop a rare type of blood clot, as well as alerting vaccine recipients to be aware of the telltale symptoms, according to heart doctors and other medical experts.
    U.S. health regulators recommended last week that use of the J&J vaccine be paused after six cases of rare brain blood clots, accompanied by low platelet levels, were reported in women following vaccination, out of some 7 million people who have received the shot in the United States. A panel of expert advisors to U.S. health agencies will meet later this week to determine whether the pause should continue, with a decision expected as early as Friday. 
   ""My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment.""
Scientists have yet to establish a direct link between the J&J vaccine and the unusual blood clots, which have also been identified among a tiny fraction of people who received AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine outside of the United States. It is not clear how long it would take to determine whether the vaccines cause such symptoms. 
    In the meantime, however, scientists say that both vaccines remain important tools to help combat a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 3 million people globally. The key will be communicating to doctors and patients how to look out for a ""one-in-a-million"" side effect. 
    ""It made sense to pause it,"" said Dr. Rishi Mehta, associate medical director of inpatient operations at Keck Hospital at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, referring to use of the J&J vaccine. ""We should say: 'Listen, the side effects are rare, but there is a potential for you to get them and these are what you should look out for... We are talking about headaches, abdominal pain, confusion.""
   The American Heart Association on Friday said other potential symptoms, which could occur up to two weeks after vaccination, are blurry vision, fainting, sensory changes, seizures, leg pain or shortness of breath.
   Doctors will also need to be vigilant when it comes to treatment. Cases identified so far are of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or blood clots in the brain's veins, rather than in the arteries, which is the case for most strokes.
    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said patients who exhibit clot-related symptoms after receiving the J&J vaccine should not be given heparin, a blood thinner that is widely used to treat clotting disorders, at least until additional testing to determine whether they have low platelet counts. The rare combination of clotting and low platelets signals a condition called heparin-associated thrombocytopenia, and giving heparin can cause harm.
   The FDA warned healthcare providers that use of heparin in these cases could even be fatal and advised them to strongly consider non-heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) instead.
    ""You would need to do a few tests with anyone who has symptoms like this, and based on those tests, you would be reasonably positioned to treat without putting the person at risk,"" Dr. Jeffrey Berger, a cardiologist focused on blood clotting disease at New York University.  
   According to details published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday, a 48-year-old woman who had the J&J shot was transferred to the University of Nebraska Medical Center after being diagnosed with extensive blood clotting, or thrombosis. She was treated with heparin, but her condition worsened and she was switched to a different anticoagulant and IVIG. The patient remained critically ill at the time of the report. (https://     ""If they give heparin they can make matters worse, so that's a good reason to call the attention to this,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters.  
    Doctors said the pause in J&J vaccinations allows time for hospital systems to update their own recommendations.        ""It's certainly a very serious condition, but there are recommendations for treatment,"" said Dr. Annabelle de St. Maurice, infectious disease specialist, University of California at Los Angeles. ""Prior to this, someone who had the vaccine and had a headache, our first idea wouldn't be to consider CVST and order the labs and imaging to assess that.""     Officials at J&J and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OSLO (Reuters) - Equinor urged its shareholders on Monday to reject a proposal by an activist group to set intermediate targets for reducing emissions from the use of its energy products.
The majority state-owned company has pledged to boost investment in renewables and has set a long-term goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, including from the use of its products by customers, known as Scope 3 emissions.
""The board of directors is of the opinion that the company's climate strategy is supporting a sustainable and balanced transition to a low carbon society. Consequently, the board of directors recommends the general meeting to vote against this proposal,"" Equinor said.
Dutch activist group Follow This has tabled a resolution for Equinor's annual general meeting in May calling on shareholders to vote in favour of setting short, medium and long-term targets for emissions cuts consistent with the Paris climate agreement.
While the resolution includes all emissions, including those from Equinor's own operations, the company has already set intermediate targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Follow This mainly wants new, intermediate targets for Scope 3. 
""The elephant in the room is Scope 3 emissions which account for about 80% of total oil and gas emissions,"" said Mark van Baal, a founder of the group. ""Ignoring those is like a tobacco company saying its workers will quit smoking, but it will continue selling cigarettes.""
The world's biggest oil and gas companies have set varying targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Europe's oil majors have included Scope 3 emissions in their goals though the big U.S. oil companies have excluded them.
The vote on the Follow This resolution is due on May 11. The Norwegian government, which holds two-thirds of Equinor's shares, is expected to follow the board's recommendations.
Equinor said it would announce short- and medium-term plans in support of its net-zero ambition at a strategy update on June 15, but has not said whether they will include Scope 3.
""Several of the ambitions are, however, dependent on society and hence outside the control of the company – and should therefore not be translated into firm targets,"" Equinor added.
The company aims to reduce absolute emissions in Norway by 40% by 2030 and by 70% by 2040, but those goals do not include the company's international business or Scope 3 emissions.

Equinor also said it would propose shareholders hold an advisory vote on its energy transition plan in 2022, updating it every three years.

Investing.com – Manchester United (NYSE:MANU) shares were up more than 7% after joining a $6 billion European soccer league that has JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) as one of its sponsors.
""The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model,"" Manchester United said in a statement. Higher-quality matches and additional financial resources are necessary to support the industry, the team said.
Manchester United is saddled with net debts of £455.5 million ($633 million), according to its latest accounts, and increased borrowing by £60m during the pandemic as playing to a closed Old Trafford cost the club about £6m a game, The Guardian said.
Not everyone was happy about the news.
“Plans for a European Super League would be very damaging for football and we support football authorities in taking action. They would strike at the heart of the domestic game, and will concern fans across the country,” U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted.
Manchester United’s billionaire co-chairman Joel Glazer will be the vice-chairman of the new league.
The breakaway football league so far has commitment from six English clubs and three each from Italy and Spain, including AC Milan, Arsenal, Atlético Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur. Three more clubs are expected to join by the inaugural season, expected to begin soon.

The Grammy-nominated boy band's meal will launch starting next month in nearly 50 countries, including South Korea, McDonald's said in a statement on Monday, and will include chicken McNuggets, fries, and two dips.
The burger chain has seen its revenue outside the United States drop during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company is tapping on promotional campaigns through celebrity endorsements and limited-time menu items to get customers back into restaurants as economies reopen with the roll-out of vaccines. 
The BTS meal follows similar U.S.-only deals with singers J Balvin and Travis Scott, which McDonald's says boosted sales in the later half of last year. 

The spike in demand during the Travis Scott promotion caused the company to temporarily run short of ingredients to assemble its signature Quarter Pounder burgers at some restaurants.

AMSTERDAM/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank's chief executive Chris Vogelzang, who was hired to help it recover from a multi-billion dollar money laundering scandal, resigned on Monday after Dutch authorities labelled him as a suspect in a separate case at ABN Amro.
Vogelzang said he was quitting after the Dutch prosecution service said it was investigating three former board members at ABN. The Dutch bank also said it had reached a 480 million euro ($577 million) settlement over systematic failures to tackle money laundering.
""I am very surprised by the decision by the Dutch authorities,"" Vogelzang said, adding his status as a suspect did not imply that he would be charged.
Vogelzang joins a growing list of European bank CEOs to depart over the past 18 months. Italy's UniCredit , Swiss banks UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) , Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) have all announced leadership changes since the start of 2020.
And Danske's former CEO, Thomas Borgen, stepped down in September 2018, also over money laundering missteps.
Prosecutors in the Netherlands are investigating the failure of bank boards to catch illicit money trails, targeting executives who have since landed top jobs elsewhere.
While the prosecutors did not name the three individuals, they said they had been identified as suspects ""effectively responsible"" for breaking the Dutch money laundering act.
ABN's former CEO Gerrit Zalm, a long-time Dutch finance minister, also stepped down from the board on of Denmark's largest bank and confirmed to Dutch broadcaster NOS that he was one of the individuals being targeted.
The investigation into anti money laundering failures at ABN began a year after fellow Dutch bank ING paid a record fine of 775 million euros to settle a similar case.
Although the ING settlement stated that no managers would be prosecuted, a Dutch court in December ordered a criminal investigation into the role of former ING CEO Ralph Hamers, who is now the top executive at Swiss bank UBS.
Hamers has said in media interviews he always acted in good conscience during ten years at ING and that he is confident that the case will ""turn out well,"" while UBS Chairman Axel Weber said he has ""full confidence"" in his ability to lead the bank.
""Given the special situation Danske Bank is in and the intense scrutiny the bank is under ... I do not want speculations about my person to get in the way of the continued development of Danske Bank,"" Vogelzang said in a statement.
Danske is still under investigation in several countries, including the United States, over some 200 billion euros ($246 billion) of suspicious transactions that passed through the bank's tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
Dutchman Vogelzang, who took the helm of Danske in June 2019 with a mandate to steer it through the money-laundering affair, will be replaced by Carsten Egeriis.
""It is super unfortunate that it's once again money laundering that this is related to. It's almost embarrassing,"" Jyske Bank analyst Anders Haulund Vollesen told Reuters. 
While Vogelzang has made strides in cleaning up Danske, he would ""not get to see the fruits of his labour,"" Haulund said.
Analysts viewed Danske's choice of Egeriis, 44, as a safe bet based on his experience within compliance and risk. 
Egeriis joined Danske in 2017 as head of risk management after working for more than a decade within credit risk at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in London, indicating Danske ""will take no chances"", Sydbank analyst Mikkel Emil Jensen said.
Denmark's financial watchdog has told Danske it expects to approve him as new CEO.
""Danske Bank works to underline, that there can be no doubt that anyone there is anything but absolutely clean,"" Per Hansen, investment economist at Nordnet, told Reuters.
Egeriis told Reuters he regretted Vogelzang's exit and that he plans to pursue his predecessor's strategy.
BILLIONS LAUNDERED
In the Netherlands, several inquiries have been looking into suspected money laundering, with investigators estimating some 13 billion euros was laundered each year between 2004 and 2014, a sum equivalent to roughly 2% of Dutch GDP.
ABN, which was bailed out during the financial crisis and is 56%-owned by the Dutch state, said it had agreed to pay a fine of 300 million euros and 180 million euros as disgorgement reflecting ""the seriousness, scope and duration of the identified shortcomings"".
Prosecutors in September 2019 alleged it failed to spot accounts involved in money laundering, end relations with suspicious clients and report such transactions.
While the bank failed as a whole as a gatekeeper, three former executives ""presumably are effectively responsible for the violation of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act,"" prosecutors said in a statement. 
Although the executives are suspects, ""this does not necessarily entail that they will be prosecuted,"" they added.
Among examples cited by prosecutors was an ABN client with the lowest risk classification, who had opened 192 bank accounts for 49 companies between 2014 and 2018. The client committed fiscal fraud, receiving almost 200,000 euros from tax authorities, which was transferred and withdrawn.
Since ING's fine, leading Dutch banks have invested heavily at increasing their capacity to detect money laundering.
""This settlement marks the end of a painful and disappointing episode for ABN Amro,"" its CEO Robert Swaak said.

ABN has dedicated more than 3,000 new employees to regulatory monitoring, adding staff for the first time after years of job cuts.

Harris County police said two people died when the Tesla car left the road and crashed into a tree. Neither man was sitting in the driver’s seat, suggesting that they had relied on the car’s ‘full self-driving’ software to navigate.
Tesla has already told the National Highway Transportation Safety Authority that its FSD software, in its current state, cannot provide more than Level 2 autonomy.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Carsten Egeriis, who was named as Danske Bank chief executive on Monday, said he plans to continue the strategy set out by his predecessor for Denmark's largest lender. 
Chris Vogelzang resigned unexpectedly after Dutch authorities labelled him as a suspect in a separate case at his former employer, ABN Amro.
Egeriis, 44, takes the helm at Danske less than two years after Vogelzang was tasked with restoring trust in the bank whose involvement in one of the world's biggest money-laundering scandals rocked investor confidence.
""The plan is to fully continue the strategy that Chris Vogelzang and the rest of the management team have set out,"" Egeriis told Reuters after his appointment.
Danske has set out a 2023 plan for further digitalization, to cut costs and implement a new organizational structure. It is also working with authorities in several countries, including the United States, to settle inquiries into money laundering. 
Egeriis, who worked for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) for a decade, joined Danske in 2017 as head of risk management, the same position held in his last year at the British bank in London.
His rapid promotion stands in contrast to Danske's former finance chief Jacob Aarup Andersen, who Denmark's financial watchdog in 2018 decided not to approve as new CEO due to what i said was a lack of top management experience.
""I have led large teams both at Barclays in London and at Danske in Copenhagen,"" Egeriis said in an interview.
""My experience is not a concern to me."" 
The FSA has told the bank that it expects to approve Egeriis as its new CEO.
""This all happened very fast. It's a great responsibility, and I'm of course incredibly happy and proud that the board has put so much trust in me,"" Egeriis said.
Vogelzang became Danske CEO in June 2019 with the job of steering Danske through a scandal which involving 200 billion euros ($239 billion) in suspicious transactions passing through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
He announced his resignation after Dutch authorities labelled him as a suspect in the ABN case.

""I am very sorry about this situation and that Chris is leaving the bank. But we must move forward and execute on our strategy and be there for our customers."" Egeriis said.

Since the middle of last year, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company, which has struggled to grow sales for the past several years, shifted its focus to big bikes, traditional markets such as the United States and Europe, and older and wealthier customers.
In February, the motorcycle maker unveiled a new turnaround plan that targets low double-digit earnings growth through 2025. 
The company said its retail sales, a measure of demand at its dealerships, surged 30% to 32,800 motorcycles in North America in its first quarter.
Retail sales in Europe, Harley's second biggest market outside the United States, slumped 36% to 4,900 motorcycles, due to the company's decision to stop selling its smaller and less profitable Street or Sportster motorcycles and shipping delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company said lower sales incentives and a cut in its selling, general and administrative expense lifted its motorcycle business operating margin by over 10 points to 18.5%.
It now expects motorcycles business revenue to grow in the range of 30% to 35% in 2021, up from its prior estimate of between 20% and 25%.

Harley's net income jumped over threefold to $259 million in the quarter ended March 28, from $70 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.68 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 88 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's revenue rose to $1.42 billion from about $1.30 billion. (https://

Investing.com – Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares were trading a tad higher in pre-market after the company repeated its forecast for a high-single digit revenue growth in 2021 despite fading support from currency factors. 
The soft drinks giant now expects foreign exchange factors to add between 1% and 2% to per share earnings in the current fiscal year, as against 2% to 3% earlier. Coca-Cola expects to deliver comparable EPS growth of around 10% versus $1.95 in 2020.
The market seemed to be absorbing the company’s performance in the last quarter as “the path to recovery, however, remains asynchronous around the world.”
 The company’s underlying effective tax rate is now estimated to be 19.1%, lower than 19.5% forecast in January.
Net revenue grew 5% to $9 billion for the quarter ended April 2, aided by higher sales of concentrates and better pricing.
The company said March volume was back to 2019 levels with growth in at-home consumption being offset by continued weakness in other distribution channels. Solid growth in trademark Coca-Cola, sparkling flavors and the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages category was offset by pressure in the hydration category during the quarter.

746,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>",Toyota to review climate stance as investors turn up the heat,"By Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp signalled a shift in its climate change stance on Monday, saying it would review its lobbying and be more transparent on what steps it is taking as it faces increased activist and investor pressure.
The carmaker came under scrutiny after siding with the Trump administration in 2019 in a bid to bar the state of California from setting its own fuel efficiency rules. 
Toyota ""will review public policy engagement activities through our company and industry associations to confirm they are consistent with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement,"" it said in a statement, adding that actions will be announced by the end of this year.
The automaker also said it will ""strive to provide more information so that our stakeholders can understand our effort to achieve carbon neutrality.""
A company spokeswoman, who confirmed that ""public policy engagement activities"" includes lobbying, was not able to respond immediately to questions about pressure from investors.
Four funds with about $235 billion in assets under management are pressuring Toyota before its annual shareholder meeting in June to draw a line under its lobbying against international efforts to prevent catastrophic global warming.
""This move must not be a PR exercise but instead signal a clear end to its role in negative climate lobbying which has given it a laggard status,"" Jens Munch Holst, chief executive officer of Danish pension fund AkademikerPension, told Reuters.
AkademikerPension has ""escalated via intense direct engagement"" with Toyota after a decade of communicating with the automaker through a third party, Troels Børrild, spokesman at the Danish fund, told Reuters.
'UNDERMINED CLIMATE ACTION' 
AkademikerPension will consider preparing a shareholders resolution to submit at next year's annual general meeting if ""Toyota fails to deliver on its commitment,"" Børrild said. 
The fund would consider selling its Toyota holding if there is no change, but the spokesman said fund officials did not believe it would come to that.
""Right up until now, the company has repeatedly undermined climate action, from opposing the U.K. government's ban on internal combustion engines by 2030 to opposing car fuel economy standards in the U.S.,"" Munch Holst said.
The Toyota spokeswoman told Reuters that it would need more time to respond to Munch Holst's comments.
The other investors are Church of England Pensions Board, Sweden's AP7 and Norway's Storebrand.
Toyota was among major automakers that supported the Trump administration in its attempt to bar California from setting its own fuel-efficiency rules or zero-emission requirements.
They have since dropped that support in a ""gesture of good faith an to find a constructive path forward"" with the Biden administration.
With pressure growing on carmakers to slash emissions, Toyota is also scrambling to produce EVs that can compete globally with rivals' models.

Toyota this year settled a lengthy Justice Department civil probe into its delayed filing of emissions-related defect reports for $180 million.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thailand's Gulf Energy Development Pcl is planning a $5.4 billion buyout of Intouch Holdings which controls  Advanced Info  Service Pcl (AIS) (BK:ADVANC), the country's top mobile operator. 
Bangkok-based Gulf Energy, which owns 18.9% of Intouch, said in a filing it had offered to buy the rest of the shares for 65 baht per share, 11% higher than its close on Friday. 
The $5.4 billion bid if successful would be the second largest M&A deal in Thai history, behind only Tesco (OTC:TSCDY)'s $10.6 billion sale of its local operations last March, Dealogic data showed. 
If Gulf is able to secure at least 50% of Intouch, it will also offer to buy out AIS at 122.86 baht per share, it said in a filing, well below the stock's Monday close at 169.50. 
The company added that Intouch, which owns 40.45% of AIS, had high potential to generate cash flow given the telecom firm's growth potential. 
""The company is confident that such investments will generate sustainable and long-term returns in terms of dividends,"" Gulf said in the filing. 
AIS acknowledged the plan in a filing but did not comment on whether the bid was welcome. A representative for Intouch could not immediately be reached for comment.
Gulf said it does not intend to buy out Intouch's satellite operator Thaicom Pcl and will request that Thailand's securities regulator waive its requirement for a tender offer, it said. 
Singapore Telecommunications, the biggest shareholder in Intouch with a 21% holding and which also owns 23% of AIS, said it was reviewing its options for the stakes. 
""Singtel views its stakes in (Intouch) and (AIS) as strategic investments and we believe in the long term outlook of the businesses,"" the company said in a statement. 
Intouch shares were up 7.69% in late Monday trade following the news, while Gulf Energy, which is led by billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi, was down by around 1.5%. AIS shares were up 0.89%.
AIS competes with True Corp, the country's No. 2 mobile operator, and Total Access Communication (DTAC), owned by Norway's Telenor. 
Gulf said it would use working capital and financing from financial institutions to fund the transaction. The company will also retain an independent financial adviser to provide opinions for its shareholders. 

Gulf and Intouch did not name their financial advisers in the filings.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",'Our factories are hungry' - U.S. farm machinery maker faces dearth of components,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farmers flush with cash after a run-up in grain prices are clamoring for farm machinery maker AGCO Corp to get them new equipment in time for this year's harvest.
This is a boom time for the Georgia-based company after years of depressed demand. But AGCO is scrambling to keep up because disruptions all along its supply chain have left it short of the steel, plastics, microchips and tires it needs to make tractors and combines. Some of its suppliers in the United States and Europe are facing a labor crunch because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The supply logjam has hit AGCO, one of the world's largest farm machinery makers, just as planting season gets under way in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere is in the middle of its harvesting season. AGCO has had to tell customers they may have to wait as long as six months for their machinery - effectively too late for the harvest in the United States, a major producer of corn and soybeans.
""Our factories are hungry right now,"" said Greg Toornman, who oversees AGCO's global supply chain management.
The farm equipment maker is not alone. Other farm equipment makers affected by the supply logjam include Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, and CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI).
As the U.S. economy roars back from the pandemic-induced recession, it is generating unusually high orders for parts and materials at a time when inventories are at the lowest level in decades and the pandemic and weather-related disruptions have left global supply chains in a mess.
The Institute for Supply Management's index for new orders in March hit its highest level since January 2004, while the index for order backlogs, one of the best U.S. metrics for how quickly manufacturers are meeting demand, was at the highest level in 28 years. 
See graphic on new orders: https://tmsnrt.rs/3sjSuB5
The delays and lack of needed materials are holding back the pace of economic recovery, translating into inflationary pressure and threatening to weigh on corporate profits. 3M Co, which makes industrial adhesives, recently warned that elevated manufacturing and logistics costs could cut its profit this year by as much as 20 cents per share.
For farm machinery companies like AGCO, whose business is highly seasonal, sourcing problems could mean lost sales. 
TIGHT INVENTORIES 
Lonn Schlueter, an Iowa-based dealer who sells rival equipment maker CNH Industrial's New Holland tractors and Kinze's planters, told Reuters he is scouting for used tractors as the orders for new ones are not expected to be delivered before the end of the year.
""The big problem is getting inventory, getting the product to sell,"" Schlueter said. ""We are told that the manufacturing is really delayed because they can't get raw products to finish up the machines.""
See graphic on customers' inventories: https://tmsnrt.rs/3aeQyUq
Tractor supply in North America is the tightest in 18 years, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Equity Research. A recent  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) survey of U.S. farm equipment dealers noted concerns about the potential impact of a lack of inventory on sales.
While dealers of all major farm equipment brands complained of tight inventories, the survey found that the situation was worse for those selling Deere's equipment. 
The Illinois-based company declined to comment. However, in February, Deere told investors it was facing growing constraints for some electronic components.
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS
AGCO is prioritizing orders that dealers have received from customers over those placed to replenish stocks at showrooms. Chief Executive Eric Hansotia said he is talking to the company's top suppliers and using ""creative solutions"" to get a handle on the supply situation.
The company is relying more on air freight to move components and is buying machines, particularly in South America and Europe, to help suppliers ramp up. It has added more shifts on weekends and moved production into its own factories in cases where suppliers are out of capacity.
AGCO is also storing excess raw material in its warehouses and has authorized its suppliers to procure up to 30 weeks of materials that are in short supply.
It is trying to leverage its network of global suppliers to address the shortfalls. 
See graphic on order backlog: https://tmsnrt.rs/3gcTMeU
For example, capacity constraints and dwindling rubber supplies in part due to strong Chinese demand are causing tire shortages, particularly in Brazil. To get around the problem, AGCO is shipping tires to its factories in the South American country from suppliers in Asia and Europe - a departure from the company's standard policy of buying them locally.
In the United States, it has shifted production out of some locations where it has become difficult to increase headcount because of COVID-19 restrictions.
""It's our number one challenge right now by far - managing all the logistics and the volatility in the system,"" Hansotia told Reuters.
'I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS'
It is a sharp contrast from last spring when machinery companies including AGCO were cutting production, anticipating a prolonged downturn in equipment demand. Back then, no one expected ""a hot market like this,"" Hansotia said.
The shortages have not yet interrupted AGCO's production, but its procurement team is working feverishly to secure alternative supplies of semiconductor chips, steel and plastics. 
While farm equipment makers require far fewer chips than automakers, the drive to make their machines smarter has made them susceptible to chip supply shocks.
Toornman said the number of chips going into AGCO's tractors has gone up ""substantially"" in the past decade. As a result, chips are the first item on the agenda at its weekly meetings on supply chains, he said.
Meanwhile, a slow ramp-up in steel production following the cuts last year has made it difficult to procure the metal on time and at a competitive price. Similarly, mass blackouts in Texas following a historic February storm has sparked a global plastics shortage.
Toornman said the wait times for both the raw materials have doubled. He expects steel shortages to persist through the year but has little clarity on when the supplies of plastics would normalize.

""I have never seen anything like this,"" Toornman said. ""It is ... like a perfect storm.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Monday, consolidating after last week’s record levels ahead of a busy week for corporate results. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 75 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 20 points, or 0.2%.
Wall Street registered another strong week last week, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at record highs on Friday, benefiting from earnings topping estimates and strong economic data. 
The S&P and Dow each gained around 1.4% last week for their fourth straight week of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite posted its third positive week in a row.
The earnings season kicks into top gear this week with just over 70 S&P 500 companies reporting, including 10 Dow stocks. The focus turns from banking to the tech sector, with streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) due to report its latest financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday.
One-time tech bellwether  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) is also due to report earnings after the close Monday, while attention will also be on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and in particular its self-driving software, after one of its cars was involved in a fatal crash over the weekend. 
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock retreated premarket Monday after safety regulators in the U.S. warned people to stop using the company’s Tread+ treadmill ""immediately"" if they have children or pets in the home, citing 39 incidents including one death. Peloton called the warning “misleading and inaccurate.”
Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has also just released strong first-quarter numbers, with revenues and earnings beating expectations, but the company declined to raise guidance, citing continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.
The U.S. vaccination rollout has reached a milestone with half the adult population now having had at least one shot. This comes as the World Health Organisation warned that more people worldwide were diagnosed with Covid-19 last week than at any other time since the pandemic erupted over a year ago.
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, but the week as a whole includes a number of housing releases, the weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday and the IHS Markit's composite flash U.S. Purchasing Managers' Index for April on Friday.
Oil prices edged lower Monday, struggling to add to recent gains amid concerns that surging coronavirus infections worldwide could have implications for global economic activity.
That said, the wider tone in the crude market has been positive of late, helped by signs of robust recoveries in both the U.S. and China, the two largest consumers of oil in the world. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $63.16 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $66.72 after gaining 4.6% Wednesday. Both contracts rose around 6% last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,788.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.2047.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>","U.S. banks deploy AI to monitor customers, workers amid tech backlash","By Paresh Dave and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Several U.S. banks have started deploying camera software that can analyze customer preferences, monitor workers and spot people sleeping near ATMs, even as they remain wary about possible backlash over increased surveillance, more than a dozen banking and technology sources told Reuters.
Previously unreported trials at City National Bank of Florida and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) as well as earlier rollouts at banks such as  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co offer a rare view into the potential U.S. financial institutions see in facial recognition and related artificial intelligence systems.
Widespread deployment of such visual AI tools in the heavily regulated banking sector would be a significant step toward their becoming mainstream in corporate America.
Bobby Dominguez, chief information security officer at City National, said smartphones that unlock via a face scan have paved the way.
""We're already leveraging facial recognition on mobile,"" he said. ""Why not leverage it in the real world?""
City National will begin facial recognition trials early next year to identify customers at teller machines and employees at branches, aiming to replace clunky and less secure authentication measures at its 31 sites, Dominguez said. Eventually, the software could spot people on government watch lists, he said.
JPMorgan said it is ""conducting a small test of video analytic technology with a handful of branches in Ohio."" Wells Fargo said it works to prevent fraud but declined to discuss how.
Civil liberties issues loom large. Critics point to arrests of innocent individuals following faulty facial matches, disproportionate use of the systems to monitor lower-income and non-white communities, and the loss of privacy inherent in ubiquitous surveillance.
Portland, Oregon, as of Jan. 1 banned businesses from using facial recognition ""in places of public accommodation,"" and drugstore chain Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp shut a nationwide face recognition program last year.
Dominguez and other bank executives said their deployments are sensitive to the issues.
""We're never going to compromise our clients' privacy,"" Dominguez said. ""We're getting off to an early start on technology already used in other parts of the world and that is rapidly coming to the American banking network.""
Still, the big question among banks, said Fredrik Nilsson, vice president of the Americas at Axis Communications, a top maker of surveillance cameras, is ""what will be the potential backlash from the public if we roll this out?""
Walter Connors, chief information officer at Brannen Bank, said the Florida company had discussed but not adopted the technology for its 12 locations. ""Anybody walking into a branch expects to be recorded,"" Connors said. ""But when you're talking about face recognition, that's a larger conversation.""
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
JPMorgan began assessing the potential of computer vision in 2019 by using internally developed software to analyze archived footage from Chase branches in New York and Ohio, where one of its two Innovation Labs is located, said two people including former employee Neil Bhandar, who oversaw some of the effort at the time.
Chase aims to gather data to better schedule staff and design branches, three people said and the bank confirmed. Bhandar said some staff even went to one of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cashier-less convenience stores to learn about its computer vision system.
Preliminary analysis by Bhandar of branch footage revealed more men would visit before or after lunch, while women tended to arrive mid-afternoon. Bhandar said he also wanted to analyze whether women avoided compact spaces in ATM lobbies because they might bump into someone, but the pandemic halted the plan.
Testing facial recognition to identify clients as they walk into a Chase bank, if they consented to it, has been another possibility considered to enhance their experience, a current employee involved in innovation projects said.
Chase would not be the first to evaluate those uses. A bank in the Northeast recently used computer vision to identify busy areas in branches with newer layouts, an executive there said, speaking on the condition the company not be named.
A Midwestern credit union last year tested facial recognition for client identification at four locations before pausing over cost concerns, a source said.
While Chase developed custom computer vision in-house using components from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Watson and Amazon Web Services, it also considered fully built systems from software startups AnyVision and Vintra, people including Bhandar said. AnyVision declined to comment, and Vintra did not respond to requests for comment.
Chase said it ultimately chose a different vendor, which it declined to name, out of 11 options considered and began testing that company's technology at a handful of Ohio locations last October. The effort aims to identify transaction times, how many people leave because of long queues and which activities are occupying workers.
The bank added that facial, race and gender recognition are not part of this test.
Using technology to guess customers' demographics can be problematic, some ethics experts say, because it reinforces stereotypes. Some computer vision programs also are less accurate on people of color, and critics have warned that could lead to unjust outcomes.
Chase has weighed ethical questions. For instance, some internally called for reconsidering planned testing in Harlem, a historically Black neighborhood in New York, because it could be viewed as racially insensitive, two of the people said. The discussions emerged about the same time as a December 2019 New York Times article about racism at Chase branches in Arizona. 
Analyzing race was not part of the eventually tabled plans, and the Harlem branch had been selected because it housed the other Chase Innovation Lab for evaluating new technology, the people said and the bank confirmed.
TARGETING THE HOMELESS
Security uses for computer vision long have stirred banks' interest. Wells Fargo used primitive software from the company 3VR over a decade ago to review footage of crimes and see if any faces matched those of known offenders, said John Honovich, who worked at 3VR and founded video surveillance research organization IPVM.
Identiv (NASDAQ:INVE), which acquired 3VR in 2018, said banking sales were a major focus, but it declined to comment on Wells Fargo.
A security executive at a mid-sized Southern bank, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss secret measures, said over the last 18 months it has rolled out video analytics software at nearly every branch to generate alerts when doors to safes, computer server rooms and other sensitive areas are left open.
Outside, the bank monitors for loitering, such as the recurring issue of people setting up tents under the overhang for drive-through ATMs. Security staff at a control center can play an audio recording politely asking those people to leave, the executive said.
The issue of people sleeping in enclosed ATM lobbies has long been an industry concern, said Brian Karas, vice president of sales at Airship Industries, which develops video management and analytics software.
Systems that detected loitering so staff could activate a siren or strobe light helped increase ATM usage and reduce vandalism for several banks, he said. Though companies did not want to displace people seeking shelter, they felt this was necessary to make ATMs safe and accessible, Karas said.
City National's Dominguez said the bank's branches use computer vision to detect suspicious activity outside.
Sales records from 2010 and 2011 reviewed by Reuters show that Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) purchased ""iCVR"" cameras, which were marketed at the time as helping organizations reduce loitering in ATM lobbies. Bank of America said it no longer uses iCVR technology.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's interest in computer vision has not abated. Its officials met with AnyVision on multiple occasions in 2019, including at a September conference during which the startup demonstrated how it could identify the face of a Bank of America executive, according to records of the presentation seen by Reuters and a person in attendance.

The bank said, ""We are always reviewing potential new technology solutions that are on the market.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) plans to expand its investment banking business in China and will soon apply to set up local underwriting, sales and trading and futures trading businesses by the end of June, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The move comes after the U.S. bank revealed last week it would sell its retail banking assets in 13 markets, including mainland China.
Citigroup's applications to regulators are being finalised and should be officially lodged shortly, the source said. 
The expanded investment banking unit could employ about 100 people, consisting of existing employees and new hires, by the time it is operational, the person added. 
When contacted, a Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
Citigroup's move reflects ""the broad trend of China's opening up, and local brokerages are fully prepared for the foreign competition,"" said Zhu Feifei, analyst at Huafu Securities Co. 
Zhu said that China represented a huge potential market for foreign players, but it would take time for them to win market share.
A local underwriting licence would allow Citigroup to participate in the fast-growing mainland Chinese IPO market, especially the STAR Board, which is dominated by local institutions.
There were $8.9 billion worth of IPOs on the main Shanghai Stock Exchange board, STAR Market and Shenzhen ChiNext in the first quarter of 2021, according to Refinitiv data.
Regulatory rules require lead underwriters for STAR IPOs to buy 2% to 5% of stock on sale and hold it for two years. This requirement has discouraged foreign institutions, as it ties up capital, leaving the market to be dominated by major Chinese banks.
Citigroup sold its stake in its Chinese joint venture with Orient Securities in 2019, paving the way for the U.S. bank to launch its own investment bank, as China opened up its brokerage sector. 

The bank was given a domestic custody licence last year and already has licences to settle and underwrite bonds in mainland China.

Available from this summer, Maserati's first hybrid SUV will be based on a mild-hybrid technology, which offers some electric assistance to a traditional engine. 
""A plug-in hybrid platform would have added too much weight to the car, jeopardising performance,"" Maserati Head of product development Francesco Tonon said during a web presentation. 
Combining a 4 cylinder, 2 litre engine with a 48-volt hybrid system, the Levante reaches a top speed of more than 240 kilometres per hour.
Maserati has said it will offer hybrid or fully-electric versions of its new models, and its entire range will be electrified by 2025.
The carmaker already offers a hybrid version of its Ghibli sedan, while its new Grecale SUV, expected in the second half of this year, will also be available as a hybrid.

Maserati's first full-electric vehicle is expected next year with the release of the new Gran Turismo. It will be followed by planned releases of electric versions of new Gran Cabrio and MC20 super car.

LONDON (Reuters) -British market research firm Kantar is in final talks to buy U.S. rival Numerator from Vista Equity Partners in a deal worth about $1.5 billion, two sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.
The deal, expected to be announced imminently, will see Kantar taking full control of the U.S. firm which specialises in providing market intelligence and has been backed by buyout fund Vista since 2017, the sources said
Kantar declined to comment. Vista was not immediately available for comment. 
Kantar, a former unit of media giant WPP (LON:WPP), will use the deal to boost its global presence - particularly in the U.S. consumer panel section of the market - and better compete with rivals including Nielsen and Information Resources Inc (IRI) which teamed up as part of a joint venture deal in 2009.
Numerator will help Kantar gain access to a wider pool of consumers in the United States where it collects purchasing data from more than a million contributors.

Bain Capital bought about 60% of Kantar in 2019 in a deal that valued the business at about $4 billion while WPP retained a 40% stake.
In the event of a cash and stock transaction WPP would have to invest along with Bain to avoid being diluted and keep its 40% equity holding in Kantar, one of the sources said.

While Taiwan is developing its own long-range missiles, to give it an ability to strike back deep into China in the event of war, it has also looked to the United States to help provide it more advanced weaponry.
Asked in parliament which weapons systems Taiwan wants to buy but the United States has not yet said it can, Lee Shih-chiang, head of Taiwan's defence ministry's strategic planning department, named  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT)'s AGM-158.
""We are still in the process of seeking it"" from the United States, Lee said. ""Communication channels are very smooth and normal.""
He did not elaborate.
The AGM-158 JASSM - standing for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile - can have a range of almost 1,000 km (621 miles) depending on the model, and be fixed to aircraft including F-16s, which Taiwan operates.
Lockheed Martin says the missile is designed to destroy high-value, well-defended, fixed and relocatable targets, and be launched far enough away to keep the launch aircraft well away from enemy air defence systems.
China has stepped up military activity near Taiwan, as it tries to force the government in Taipei to accept Beijing's claims of sovereignty.
Taiwan's armed forces, dwarfed by China's, are in the midst of a modernisation programme to offer a more effective deterrent, including the ability to hit back at bases far from China's coast in the event of a conflict.
Taiwan's armed forces have traditionally concentrated on defending the island from a Chinese attack.
But President Tsai Ing-wen has stressed the importance of developing an ""asymmetrical"" deterrent, using mobile equipment that is hard to find and destroy, and capable of hitting targets far away from Taiwan.
Washington, Taipei's main foreign arms supplier, has been eager to create a military counterbalance to Chinese forces, building on an effort known within the Pentagon as ""Fortress Taiwan"".
Beijing views Taiwan as sovereign Chinese territory, and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.

VTB's financial performance took a hit in 2020 from the need to increase provisions against bad loans but this year could bring some respite after the central bank said it did not see any debt-related problems in the Russian banking system.
VTB said it made 85.1 billion roubles ($1.12 billion) in first quarter net profit compared with 39.8 billion roubles in the same period a year ago.
The increase took place as VTB set aside 22.6 billion roubles in loan loss provisions in January-March, down from 45.1 billion roubles in the same period of 2020.
VTB's shares underperformed the market after the results were published, falling 1.2% on the day, compared with a 0.2% decline in the benchmark MOEX index.
First-quarter results reflect VTB's ""robust operating performance as well as the post-pandemic economic recovery,"" said Dmitry Pianov, the bank's chief financial officer.
""These results fully confirm our guidance for the full year and put VTB firmly on track to deliver a solid return on equity going forward.""
VTB aims for a record income in 2021 of 250-270 billion roubles in 2021 after reporting a 63% decline in net profit last year as the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a hike in provisions against bad loans.
VTB's cost of risk for the first three months of 2021 amounted to 0.7%, an 80 basis points decline compared to the same period of 2020.

Europe's STOXX 600 reached a record high and was up 0.2% at 0736 GMT. Asian shares hit one-month highs overnight.
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat on the day, having come close to but not surpassed Friday's record high. MSCI's main European Index was up 0.1%.
Matthias Scheiber, global head of portfolio management at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management cited low interest rates, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the fiscal stimulus package in the United States as reasons for his bullish stance on equities.
""Risk is coming down, volatility is coming down … we see the slow reopening of global economies, the rollout of the vaccine and the huge catch-up in demand so from that perspective it should be positive for economic growth.""

The euro was up 0.3% versus the dollar at $1.20165.
""We have been highlighting over the past two months that USD could bottom out, in contrast to consensus, and believed that this would be a tactical problem for EM and for certain commodity trades,"" wrote JP Morgan's head of global and European equity strategy, Mislav Matejka, in a note to clients. ""We think the risk of a firmer USD, through rising US-Europe interest rate differential, is not finished.""
Matejka also said that, although there is the technical potential for a correction in equities, he would not cut stocks exposure on the six- to nine-month horizon.
""We think that it is more likely that we will be raising our year-end targets, rather than reducing them, as we move through the summer,"" he said.
Likewise, Wells Fargo Asset Management's Matthias Scheiber said ""We believe we are in the 'buy the dip' environment at this moment given that both fiscal and monetary policy are very supportive, so if we would see a correction … we would probably increase the equity position.”

764,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 04:46AM ET</span>",Analysis: Cabling Italy - what price the single network as Rome dithers?,"By Stephen Jewkes, Elvira Pollina and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN (Reuters) - When mayor Filippo Tripoli got a phone call from  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) last December to cable his town in Sicily he was taken by surprise. Bagheria, population 55,000, had already been cabled by rival Open Fiber and another network seemed extravagant.
""It knocked me sideways,"" Tripoli said. ""What's the point of cabling a place that has already been cabled once."" 
Open Fiber finished work in Bagheria earlier this year and is now busy resurfacing the streets. Telecom Italia (TIM) has just started, but could be finished by the end of the year. Cost? Some 4.5 million euros ($5.4 million) for Open Fiber and around 3 million euros for TIM. 
The case highlights the downsides of the Italian government's struggle to forge a deal between TIM and Open Fiber to speed up the rollout of fast broadband and help the country close a digital - and economic - gap with major European rivals.
""The government, I understand, wants TIM and Open Fiber to join forces so Italy has only one network and can save money ... but what I’m seeing here is each of them going their own way,"" Tripoli said.
Rome, through state lender CDP, jointly owns Open Fiber with utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and is the No. 2 shareholder in TIM. Last year, it tried to broker a deal to merge assets of former phone monopoly TIM with its smaller rival to create a national champion and avoid duplicating investments.
But differences over issues such as governance and regulation created a deadlock. 
The new government of Mario Draghi, which has digital infrastructure at the heart of its agenda, has yet to say if it will pursue the single network project. 
But it risks being overtaken by events on the ground as TIM and Open Fiber lay parallel networks across swathes of Italy. 
""These are two different animals and as time goes by it becomes increasingly difficult to integrate them and generate synergies,"" warned Michele Polo, professor of industrial organisation and competition policy at Milan’s Bocconi University.
Advisers working for Open Fiber and TIM say a single network would certainly cut costs, with savings ranging anywhere from 500 million to more than 2 billion euros. But both sides agree the synergies are dependent on the job being done quickly - 18 months at most to achieve the top-end estimate. 
TIM, Open Fiber and the Innovation and Economy ministries declined to comment.
COMPETING NETWORKS
A full-fibre network is also crucial for the rollout of Italy's 5G mobile networks, which need fibre back-up connections for their towers and cells.
Vittorio Colao, drafted in by Draghi to lead Italy's digital drive, is convinced competition has a role to play. The former Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) CEO has put the focus on a speedy rollout, keeping an open mind on technology and resisting the creation of dominant positions. 
""Colao officially says this is a matter between TIM and Open Fiber, but behind the scenes is going mad to block the single network plan,"" a government source said.
But others in government have not dropped the idea of a unified network in some form and Economy Minister Daniele Franco is pressing ahead with plans to make sure CDP wins control of Open Fiber.
Greater competition could certainly ease regulatory concerns. Italy's antitrust authority recently told the government it believed competing networks were the best way forward, with the exception of remote regions that require state support to be economically viable. 
TIM, whose biggest shareholder is French media giant Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), has repeatedly said it wants control of any merged entity with Open Fiber.
For Bagheria, competing networks may mean more upheaval, but there are upsides. 
""We gave TIM the green light providing it also cabled areas Open Fiber didn’t reach, like the seafront area that we want to develop for tourism and business,"" Tripoli said. ""In the end it's working out well."" 
SLOW COACH
Italy ranked fourth to last in the European Union for digital competitiveness in 2019, according to the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). Only 7.1% of households had a fibre-to-the-home subscription last year compared with 21% across the EU, according to consultants IDATE.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many businesses and homes to rethink the way they work, speeding up digitisation. Rome is looking to use about 7 billion euros of European recovery funds to help finance its ultra-fast network plans, which include offering every home and business access by 2026. 
With demand on the rise, both TIM and Open Fiber have turned to big infrastructure funds. Attracted by potential returns on investment above 10%, KKR has invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in TIM's fibre venture, while Macquarie is in talks to buy up to 50% of its rival. 
TIM last year welcomed the single network plan, but has since stepped up efforts to roll out its own last-mile fibre network through purpose-built vehicle FiberCop. 
It has pledged to spend almost 6 billion euros by 2025, versus the 7.1 billion its rival has earmarked to cable almost 20 million homes by 2023.
""What was TIM's Plan B is turning into Plan A,"" a source close to the matter said.
FiberCop aims to connect 56% of Italian households and businesses over the next four years, and is taking the battle to Open Fiber, which has so far passed fibre to 11.5 households and is adding more than 2.5 million a year.
Businesses in Bagheria are delighted TIM is cabling parts of the town its rival missed.
""We’re investing 3 million euros over the next year or two to digitise our warehouse and use artificial intelligence to help make the business more competitive,"" said Giovanni Pileri, who runs fish packaging company Flott. 
""Connectivity is crucial. It makes no difference to us if there's one or two networks, the important thing is it’s fast, top quality and goes everywhere.""

Juventus (MI:JUVE) stock rose 6.7%, AFC Ajax (AS:AJAX) stock rose 0.6% and Borussia Dortmund (DE:BVB) stock rose 3% following reports of an attempt to form a new breakaway soccer league in Europe. Only Juve of those three is a member of the proposed breakaway league.
Later in the week, the European Central Bank will hand down its policy decision, with the central bank likely to keep the rate unchanged and to strike a cautiously optimistic tone on the economy.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse serves investors thin gruel as Wall Street feasts on deals,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - While Wall Street rivals feast off a boom in trading and deals,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is stuck in limbo.
The collapse of Archegos, a U.S. investment fund, has left the Swiss bank nursing an anticipated pretax loss of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter. That, plus the demise of another client, Greensill Capital, have triggered internal and external probes and the ousting of a swathe of executives.
Investors seeking clarity on what next for Credit Suisse's investment bank, at the heart of the Archegos debacle, and its asset management division, which ran $10 billion in funds linked to Greensill, are unlikely to get final answers on Thursday, when the bank publishes first quarter results. 
Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein has said that Credit Suisse's incoming chairman, former Lloyd's boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, will likely undertake a strategic review of the bank when he joins next month.
Buoyed by a boom in capital raising and deals, Credit Suisse was on the cusp of a bumper start to 2021 before a 4.4 billion franc ($4.77 billion) loss from Archegos.
Credit Suisse has emerged as the bank hardest-hit from its exposure to Archegos, which collapsed when it couldn't meet margin calls. Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) say Credit Suisse may face another loss of around $400 million this quarter from unwinding Archegos-linked stocks.
Credit Suisse has declined to comment on the estimate.
Stripping out the 4.4 billion franc charge, the implied underlying pre-tax profit of around 3.5 billion francs would have represented the bank's best quarter operationally in at least a decade.
U.S. rivals, some of which were quicker to exit trading positions as Archegos collapsed, produced forecast-beating profits. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' first quarter net income rose nearly sixfold.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reported a 150% jump in profit despite disclosing an almost $1 billion loss from Archegos.
Credit Suisse shareholders, meanwhile, are facing a slashed dividend, halted share buybacks and a share price down 15% so far this year.
The bank has said further buybacks will have to wait until it returns capital to target ratios and is able to restore its dividend.
The Financial Times reported last week the group had slashed costs through bonus cuts and other one-off items.
While the move helped bolster capital it could hurt the bank's franchise.
Widespread departures are a real worry for management, one source familiar with the bank's operations told Reuters.
""You have many areas which likely performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, and bankers expect to be paid for exceptional performance. So this becomes a major issue for staff retention,"" Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said. ""The options are limited: either they face the risk of losing staff, or they have to make up for this gap with higher accruals in the remaining three quarters.""
Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
It had previously aimed for a common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 12.5% for the first half of 2021, but now expects a first quarter ratio of at least 12%.
""The big question Credit Suisse will have to discuss this week is: what will FINMA impose in terms of stricter capital requirements, as they did in 2011 with UBS?"" Venditti said.
FINMA, Switzerland's financial supervisor, declined comment.
In 2011, when rival UBS suffered a $2.3 billion loss over rogue trades executed by a London-based employee, FINMA imposed capital restrictions and requested UBS bulk up on capital to back its operational risks.
Venditti said he expected to see an RWA inflation at Credit Suisse from the second quarter.
That would give the bank less room for manoeuvre in its handling of disgruntled fund investors seeking payout after the Greensill debacle, he said, while also posing a potential drag to future earnings during a period of record deal-making and roaring trading.
Credit Suisse still faces questions over how it will address $2.3 billion at-risk funds that it is seeking to return to investors following the collapse of its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds.
It has, so far, distributed $4.8 billion to clients.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 02:30AM ET</span>",Explainer: What's next for Jack Ma's Ant Group after China orders revamp?,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China has imposed a sweeping restructuring plan on Jack Ma's Ant Group, the fintech conglomerate whose record $37 billion IPO was derailed by regulators in November, that will see the group become a financial holdings company among other things.
Ant, valued at around $315 billion at its IPO pricing, is also exploring options for founder Ma to divest his stake and give up control, as meetings with regulators signalled the move could help draw a line under Beijing's scrutiny of its business, Reuters exclusively reported on Saturday. 
Here is a look at what the company needs to do in the near-to-medium term as a result of the revamp: 
HOW MUCH EXTRA CAPITAL DOES ANT NEED?
New regulation requires fintech platforms to own 30% of all the loans that they co-lend with banks.
Brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) estimated in a report last week that Ant will need 13.4-20.1 billion yuan ($2-$3 billion) of capital to meet the minimum capital adequacy ratio for consumer finance companies. A third to half of Ant's 1.7 trillion yuan consumer loans are in the co-lending model, Jefferies estimates.
HOW WILL ANT RAISE CAPITAL?
It will be tough for Ant to inject more capital into its consumer finance company of which it owns only 50%, brokerage Macquarie has said. 
Also, then Ant will have to convince other shareholders to come up with more capital to maintain shareholding percentages, said a Hong Kong-based analyst with a U.S asset manager which had subscribed to Ant's halted IPO.
If that is not possible, any potential shareholding change will require negotiations on the company's valuation which Ant might not want to get to, the analyst added.
One Ant investor, however, told Reuters that the potential capital shortfall would be well within Ant's means and that it would not need to raise more money from outside investors.
Ant declined to comment. 
The analyst and the investor spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.
HOW WILL ANT'S VALUATION CHANGE AFTER THE RESTRUCTURING?
It is too early for analysts to come up with a new valuation estimate based on Ant's revamp plan as more details are needed.
Some investors told Reuters they are optimistic that Ant will not be valued as cheaply as a Chinese bank, given the scope of its business and the technology and data power it possesses in the world's second-largest economy.
Major lenders in China's main banks stock index trade at 5-12 times forward earnings and 0.4-1.7 times their forward book value, Eikon data shows. Ant would be worth $33 billion if priced at one time book value based on its net assets reported last year, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations.
Some global investors valued Ant at over $200 billion based on its 2020 performance, Reuters has reported.
WHAT HAPPENS TO ANT'S PAYMENT BUSINESS? 
It is unclear how Ant is going to break up its payment business from its credit products Jiebei and Huabei. 
Jiebei and Huabei are currently embedded within Alipay and rely on the mobile payment app for user traffic. 
Any de-link would reduce users of the credit products and potentially affect Ant's loan quality if data access to Alipay would somehow be limited or affected, the Hong Kong-based analyst said.
WHAT ELSE WILL CHANGE AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING?
Ant has said it will set up a personal credit reporting company and apply for a personal credit reporting license. 
It is already a shareholder in Baihang Credit, one of the only two credit agencies licensed by the central bank.

Macquarie analysts believe the People's Bank of China may not grant Ant a license for its own credit company, while Jefferies said Ant may have to partner with a state-owned company to set up the agency.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Oaktree Capital Group has proposed funding a A$3 billion ($2.3 billion) buyback by Australia's Crown Resorts Ltd of its founder's stake, setting up a clash with rival Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) for the troubled casino firm's future.
Private equity giant Oaktree's offer of a ""structured instrument"" to help Crown buy back James Packer's 37% stake comes just a month after Blackstone lobbed an A$8 billion full takeover offer.
Crown did not specify what Oaktree would receive under its proposal, which it said it was considering, along with Blackstone's offer.
Billionaire Packer's status as Crown's major shareholder has been under scrutiny since an inquiry named his influence as a factor when it in February declared the company unfit for a Sydney casino licence, citing activities including money laundering.
Oaktree's approach to removing Packer from the register would give Crown a way to resolve regulator concerns without selling the whole company at a price below pre-coronavirus levels.
Packer, who left the Crown board in 2018, has indicated he is willing to sell up his stake and has said he supports the board's decision on an exit strategy. Packer would walk away with around A$3 billion under either proposal. 
Many investors have declined to endorse Blackstone's approach, saying it undervalues the company, pointing to Crown's higher market capitalisation in early 2020 before the pandemic and regulatory attention hammered its shares.
Blackstone had a history of buying casino companies and spinning off their property assets profitably, and with Oaktree's help there was ""no reason Crown couldn't copy the strategy and do it themselves"", said Nathan Bell, portfolio manager of Intelligent Investor, which has Crown shares.
Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management, which has Crown shares, questioned the structure of the Oaktree offer, which limits its exposure but not other shareholders'.
""There is obviously a reason Oaktree doesn't want some element of the business or wants to receive some uplift in the return that accrues to them, above and beyond the return of a normal shareholder,"" Gluskie said.
Shares of Crown were up 0.5% at A$11.97 in mid-session trading on Monday, in line with the broader market, but ahead of Blackstone's proposed purchase price of A$11.85 per share.
Oaktree, Blackstone and a representative for Packer declined to comment on Monday. 
REGULATOR SCRUTINY
A government-backed inquiry into Crown's operations uncovered money laundering and dealings with tour operators linked to organised crime.
The subsequent decision by the regulator to withhold Crown's Sydney gaming licence was a major blow just ahead of the scheduled grand opening of the company's A$2.2 billion waterside casino, apartment and hotel tower.
With the Sydney casino shuttered, the inquiry prompted regulators with responsibility for Crown's casinos in Melbourne and Perth to open their own investigations, which are ongoing.
Australia's financial crime watchdog, AUSTRAC, is also investigating the money laundering finding, while two shareholder class action lawsuits accuse Crown of failing to report operational risks that resulted in large share price falls. Crown is defending the lawsuits.

The regulator for Crown's Sydney complex, the Independent Gaming & Liquor Authority, has said it hopes to return Crown's gambling licence soon, and that it would not require Packer to sell his stake before doing so.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swedish carmaker Volvo Cars said on Monday it has signed an agreement to provide cars to the autonomous driving technology unit of China's top ride-hailing firm, Didi Chuxing, for its self-driving test fleet.
Volvo will provide XC90 SUVs equipped with backup steering and braking systems that DiDi Autonomous Driving will integrate with Didi Gemini, its new self-driving hardware platform.
Didi is currently working toward an initial public offering with a valuation of at least $100 billion.
Just last week self-driving startup Cruise, which is backed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), said it had raised $2.75 billion in its latest funding round from investors including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, taking its valuation to over $30 billion.
Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, will initially provide Didi with hundreds of vehicles, with the aim of adding more as the self-driving test fleet expands, head of strategy Alexander Petrofski told Reuters.
""For us this is a tremendous opportunity because we gain real-world know-how and get to test our vehicles in a real-world environment,"" Petrofski said. ""This is something we will benefit from when we start rolling out this technology in applications for our customers."" 
Petrofski said a few of the vehicles have already been delivered to Didi.
Volvo began providing test cars to Uber's autonomous driving unit back in 2016. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc sold that business to self-driving car startup Aurora last year and is still using Volvo vehicles. 
""This (new agreement with Didi) is in line with our vision to be the partner of choice on a global level"" for self-driving fleets, said Volvo's head of autonomous driving strategy, Johan Taws.

The built-in backup systems and safety features on Volvo's XC90 cars, combined with Didi's self-driving system ,will eventually allow the cars to operate without safety drivers in robotaxi services, Volvo said.

South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.38%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.15%, ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes of its latest policy meeting on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.09%, even after reporting its first two cases of the mutated N501Y COVID-19 strain over the weekend. Flights into the city from India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, where numbers of COVID-19 cases are surging, have been banned for two weeks.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.26% while the Shenzhen Component soared 1.92%. Asian credit markets could get a boost from a rebound in  China Huarong Asset Management  Co. Ltd. (HK:2799) bonds, after China’s financial regulator said on Friday that China Huarong had ample liquidity in its first official comments since the company missed its deadline to report earnings.
Treasury yields steadied well below recent peaks in U.S. trade, after U.S. equity futures fell after stocks ended the previous week at a record high.
Economic data released by China and the U.S. on Friday also boosted investor sentiment, with China’s GDP growing 18.3% and 0.6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter respectively. The U.S. will also release manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes on Friday.
A pullback in bond yields from recent highs has also decreased the risk of another destabilizing increase in borrowing costs.
“At the global level, you have both China and the U.S. growing fast. That’s driving markets across the globe,” Nasser Saidi & Associates president and founder Nasser Al-Saidi told Bloomberg.
“The simultaneous rally in stocks and bonds is temporary, but it suggests confidence in continued central bank support and “no fear of rapid inflation ramping up,” he added.
In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) will hand down its policy decision later in the week. The central bank is likely to keep the rate unchanged and to strike a cautiously optimistic tone on the economy and stabilization in borrowing rates.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hundreds of passengers thronged Australian airports on Monday as an open border system began with New Zealand, a pandemic milestone that allows Australian residents to fly there for the first time in over a year without having to quarantine for two weeks.
Though most Australian states have allowed quarantine-free visits from New Zealand residents since late last year, New Zealand had enforced isolation for arrivals from its neighbour, citing concern about sporadic virus outbreaks there.
Television footage showed hundreds of passengers crowding the international departure terminals at Australian airports.
""It is the first time in 400 days that people can travel quarantine-free and we are adding 16 return flights a day to New Zealand, and they are full,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday. 
The open border will help drive the economic recovery for both countries and reunite thousands with families and friends, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a joint statement.
""It is truly exciting to start quarantine-free travel with Australia. Be it returning family, friends or holiday-makers, New Zealand says welcome and enjoy yourself,"" Ardern said.
Both Australia and New Zealand had largely closed their borders to non-citizens and permanent residents more than a year ago, helping to keep their COVID-19 numbers relatively low compared with several other developed countries. 
Morrison and Ardern warned travellers to prepare for disruptions to travel arrangements at short notice in the event of COVID-19 outbreaks, and said the risks of quarantine-free travel will be under ""constant review"". 

Both leaders also flagged the possibility of extending quarantine-free travel to other countries in the Pacific region when ""it is safe to do so.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A policy shift by China's government is ratcheting up pressure on automakers to hasten development of green vehicles or pay rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Chinese startups for green credits.
Regulators are putting more teeth on a system of tradable green car credits to wean the industry off a decade-long policy of subsidies which has helped create some of the biggest companies in the industry. 
The system gives automakers credits for selling electric or fuel-efficient vehicles that can offset penalties on their more carbon-intensive models. 
The shift has happened fast, catching some global automakers and state-owned Chinese manufacturers flat-footed.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), for example, only began counting the cost of Chinese green car credits in 2020 when executives realised they needed more to comply with the requirement for the year, sources familiar with the matter said. 
The German automaker, which aims to be a world leader in electric vehicles, had to buy credits from U.S. rival Tesla for its China venture with state-owned FAW Group, sources told Reuters.
FAW-Volkswagen, which sold 2.16 million cars last year, was the biggest negative credit generator in 2019 thanks to its popular gasoline sport-utility vehicles.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) told Reuters it was ""strategically targeting to be self-compliant"" with the rules in China, and would buy credits if required. It declined to comment further.
China has had a green-car credit system since 2017 but fuel-efficiency standards tightened significantly last year and many manufacturers failed to comply, according to preliminary 2020 credit data published by MIIT.
Electric vehicle sales were lower in 2020 than policymakers had expected, explaining the credit deficit, Haitong International analyst Shi Ji said.
""We suggest automakers with large gasoline car sales volume will accelerate electrification,"" Shi said.
All six major state-owned auto groups are struggling to comply with the credit system, the chairman of state-owned automaker Changan, Zhu Huarong, said in January.
Changan, which has a venture with Ford, lost 4,000 yuan ($611.86) per car because it needed to buy credits or sell unprofitable EVs, he told an industry conference.
DRIVING CHANGE
In modified rules starting this year, regulators also raised the standards for electric vehicles to qualify for credits and introduced new standards such as EV power efficiency. 
Policymakers are considering further tightening the credit system and are expected to roll out rules for commercial vehicles this year, said sources familiar with the process, who declined to be named.
Driving the changes are officials at China's finance ministry, who want to shift government funding to other industries such as semiconductors, according to officials' speeches and people with understanding of policy discussions. 
China's finance ministry and industry ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Subsidies helped a swathe of Chinese EV makers including BYD and Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc improve products and boost sales. Chinese EV technology suppliers were buoyed as well. Battery maker CATL became one of world's top battery makers, competing with established players such as Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) and LG Chem.
Beijing hopes the compliance system will consolidate China's lead in electric vehicles, with credit trading meant to encourage automakers that have been slow to develop electric cars to support EV startups, sources said.
Tesla, the leading electric vehicle maker, is the top green credit generator in China, according to MIIT. Tesla reported receiving $1.58 billion from credit sales last year globally.
Automakers under compliance pressure include Geely, General Motor Co's China tie-up with SAIC Motor,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s partnership with BAIC Motor, another Volkswagen venture with SAIC Motor. 
Geely, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), GM all told Reuters they will manage the credits between different ventures and will comply with the rules by expanding electric lineup in next years.
Geely President An Conghui said the group was compliant thanks to roll-over credits from previous years and new electric models, and would not buy credits from external companies.

Daimler and GM both said they planned to expand their ranges of electric vehicles in China.

The agreement includes a $1.65 billion contract for the establishment and operation of a training centre for the Hellenic Air Force by Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT) over a 22-year period, Israel's defence ministry said.
The training centre will be modelled on Israel's own flight academy and will be equipped with 10 M-346 training aircraft produced by Italy's Leonardo, the ministry said.
Elbit will supply kits to upgrade and operate Greece's T-6 aircraft and also provide training, simulators and logistical support.
""I am certain that (this programme) will upgrade the capabilities and strengthen the economies of Israel and Greece and thus the partnership between our two countries will deepen on the defence, economic and political levels,"" said Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz.
The announcement follows a meeting in Cyprus on Friday between the UAE, Greek, Cypriot and Israeli foreign ministers, who agreed to deepen cooperation.
The Israeli and Greek air forces on Sunday launched a joint exercise in Greece, the Israeli military said. 

In at least one past exercise over Greece, Israeli fighter planes practised against an S-300 posted on Crete. The Russian-made air defence system is also deployed in Syria and Iran, Israel's foes. 
A source in the Hellenic National Defence Command said the S-300 had not been activated in the joint exercise that began Sunday.

A trace by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives turned up the two legal purchases last July and September by Brandon Hole, 19, a former employee at the facility, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said on Saturday. 
An IMDB spokesman on Sunday said the department was not disclosing where the guns were bought.
The purchases were made a few months after Hole was briefly placed under psychiatric detention in March and a shotgun was seized from his home when his mother contacted law enforcement to report he might try to commit ""suicide by cop,"" according to the FBI. 
Based on items seen in his bedroom at that time, Hole was interviewed in April, but the FBI agents found no criminal violation and determined that he had no ""racially motivated violent extremism ideology,"" Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office, said on Friday. 
The attack on Thursday in Indiana's state capital, the third most populous city in the Midwest, was the latest in a spate of deadly mass shootings in the United States over the past month.
Police are still investigating what motivated Hole to open fire. Four members of the Sikh religious community - three women and a man - were among the eight people killed.

The New York-based Sikh Coalition, a civil rights advocacy group, has called for a full investigation into ""the possibility of bias as factor"" in the FedEx killings.

TCI's letter, dated April 12, asks the government to allow Atlantia to evaluate ""independently and free from any political interference"" an offer for Autostrade from Spanish infrastructure group ACS.
Autostrade, which manages half of Italy's motorway network, has been in the political crosshairs since the 2018 deadly collapse of a Genoa motorway bridge run by the company.
As part of a government-backed initiative to reclaim control of the motorways, Atlantia is in advanced talks with a consortium led by Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), which has presented a binding offer for Autostrade.
However, ACS has sent an expression of interest for Atlantia's 88% stake in Autostrade, which it values at between 9 billion and 10 billion euros ($12 billion), in a move that could foil the government's plans.
""Atlantia should be allowed to take the required time to consider the ACS offer,"" TCI said in the letter, adding that Rome should not make approval of Autostrade's economic and financial plan conditional on a deal with the CDP-led consortium.
Such a condition would be a ""blatant violation of the principle of free movement of capital"", TCI said.
The offer from the CDP and partners Macquarie and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) is based on an Autostrade valuation of 9.1 billion euros, which some Atlantia investors, including TCI, believe is too low.
On Sunday Italian newspaper La Stampa reported that U.S. investment firm Apollo and Italian group Toto Holding might also submit offers.
The Atlantia board has called a shareholder meeting on May 28 to examine the CDP-led bid.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>",A tale of two carmakers: GM and Toyota take different electric roads in China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Toyota pioneered the world's most successful hybrid car but when it comes to pure electric vehicles it has some catching up to do, especially in China.
The Hong Guang Mini EV, a tiny, no-frills car made by a General Motors (NYSE:GM) joint venture that costs under $5,000 is a smash hit in the world's biggest car market while Toyota has yet to launch its own small, low-cost electric vehicle in China.
Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker, is set to unveil its solution at the Shanghai auto show on April 19: a new universal platform for electric vehicles (EVs) called e-TNGA that will underpin an array of models from small runarounds to large SUVs.
It will also display its concept electric mid-sized sport-utility vehicle (SUV), based on the e-TNGA platform, which is set to be sold worldwide within a couple of years, two people familiar with Toyota's plans said.
Toyota's executives have long called for a small electric runabout but the fact it is going first with a mid-sized SUV is a sign of the challenges it still faces to produce small, low-cost EVs that are also competitive, comfortable and safe.
With pressure growing on carmakers to slash emissions, Toyota is scrambling to produce EVs that can compete globally with the Mini EV, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s high-end sedans, mid-range models from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) and sleek EVs from Chinese startups like and Xpeng.
While Toyota's Prius hybrid became a world bestseller, one of its early efforts to develop a small EV, the eQ, was a flop. 
After selling about 100 eQs in 2012, Toyota ditched it due to concerns about the limits of EVs, such as their high price, short range and long charge time. 
The eQ, an electric version of Toyota's mini iQ, cost 3.6 million yen ($33,000), roughly the price of its mid-sized Camry.
COST CONTROL
One key issue in developing an affordable, small EV is the need to use electric powertrains that have yet to achieve parity with their gasoline counterparts, the people familiar with Toyota's plans said. 
Cramming bulky batteries into a tiny car is another challenge. 
Many EVs have high floors because the batteries are stacked underneath, leaving automakers the choice of making cars much higher to give passengers ample room, or keeping them lower and sacrificing comfort, the sources said.
Toyota doesn't want to compromise on quality, comfort or performance with its small EV, but it is aware it needs to develop expertise in slashing engineering costs to deliver such a vehicle with a price well under $20,000.
That expertise is precisely what GM leveraged to make the Mini EV, which can cost as little as 28,800 yuan ($4,410).
Its joint venture, SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW), is the biggest manufacturer in China of no-frills commercial vans that start at about 30,000 yuan and it tapped that cost-control know-how.
""Wuling basically has simply had to replace gasoline engines in those commercial vans with simple electric powertrains,"" said Yale Zhang, head of consultancy Automotive Foresight.
He expects sales of the the Mini EV and its upscale Macaron version to hit 500,000 this year. 
Zhou Xing, a SGMW vice president in charge of Wuling and Baojun sales and marketing, said it was set to roll out four small EVs by early 2022 under its brands, taking the model range to 10 just as more rivals enter the market.
NATIONAL PRIDE
The Mini EV also cuts corners that would not be allowed in the United States or Europe, underlining the challenge Toyota faces in developing a viable rival that handles easily in a crowded city and is still high in quality and performance.
The Mini EV only has one air bag, for example, with none for passengers or on the sides to protect occupants if it rolls.
The car has an anti-lock braking system but no stability control technology even though its relatively tall, stubby profile makes it prone to tipping over when cornering sharply at speed, two people familiar with its development told Reuters.
""First of all, the product meets all the vehicle safety requirements of China. The Hong Guang Mini EV is basically a commuting tool, helping people go from point A to B in city traffic. It's highly unlikely for them to drive this car at high speeds,"" said SGMW's Zhou.
The no-frills approach certainly hasn't dented its appeal. 
Launched in July, cost-conscious Chinese customers and young, fashionable urbanites are snapping up about 100,000 Mini EVs a quarter, making it one of the top EV sellers in China.
Some younger drivers are buying it and other Wuling cars in part after a video of a Wuling van racing deftly on a twisty mountain road went viral. For many, seeing a basic Chinese van doing tricky manoeuvres tickled their national pride.
""I am proud of what Chinese-made vehicles like Wuling workhorse vans can achieve,"" said Huang Peixian, 26, a small business owner in the city of Shantou in Guangdong province. 
""When I saw the Hong Guang Mini EV, I thought this could be a good car for me,"" she said. ""I'm not just attracted to the car because of its cheap price, it's really fun to drive.""
Many drivers personalise their Mini EV's with a new paint job and sleek head and tail lamps. A few are even customising their other cars, such as Audis and BMWs, with Wuling stickers and badges.
Huang went all out, turning the interior of her Mini EV pink and splashing characters from Japanese cartoon series Chibi Maruko-chan on the white exterior.
GREEN CREDIT BOOST
Toyota's electric SUV will be the first car produced by its new zero emissions vehicle design division in Japan, known as ZEV Factory. 
To get the low-cost know-how it needs, however, it has turned to Chinese battery and automaker BYD through a joint research and development company they started last year.
The plan is to use BYD's expertise in building small EVs and some key components, including batteries. 
But there is still a good chance Toyota will use electric powertrain technology - a combination of the motor, inverter and gears - called e-Axle made by its affiliate BluE Nexus, according to one of the people familiar with Toyota's plans. 
The Hong Guang Mini EV also plays an important role for GM and SAIC as it generates green-car credits. Automakers in China need to make enough New Energy Vehicles (NEV) to earn credits to offset their production of combustion engine cars. 
The success of the Mini EV means GM and SAIC have the scope to sell credits to rivals or produce more, bigger, luxurious gasoline vehicles without being penalised.
Automotive Foresight's Zhang also said the green-credit system means the Mini EV can be priced very competitively to the point it barely makes a profit.
SGMW's Zhou declined to say whether the Mini EV makes money, or how much it earns from green credits.
""We have seen quite a few companies come to us and buy credits from us. But we don't want to disclose who they are,"" he said.
The two sources familiar with Toyota's plans said it was not planning to lose money on the retail price of its small EV or leverage green credits to make it more competitive.
A company spokesman declined to comment on whether Toyota had enough Chinese NEV credits, or if it would consider selling them as an integral part of its strategy.

SHANGHAI/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's financially challenged Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co is expected to show off a new ""must-succeed"" car and explain its green-car strategy for China at the Shanghai auto show which starts on Monday, two company officials told Reuters.
The car Nissan plans to show off at the motor show is the significantly redesigned X-Trail sport-utility vehicle (SUV). A similar SUV called the Rogue hit the U.S. market last year. The new X-Trail will be available in China later this year.
The new car is powered by a fuel-sipping three-cylinder, petrol-powered turbo engine, which one of the sources said might face an uphill battle in gaining acceptance in China where similar technologies have proven unpopular.
The car is a ""must succeed, a must win car for us,"" one of the two sources said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with reporters.
In addition to the X-Trail's China debut, Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta is expected to tell reporters in Shanghai virtually from Japan on Monday that Nissan's green car strategy is two-pronged: the company will focus on fuel efficiency-enhancing petrol-electric hybrid technology, as well as battery electric cars to make its lineup of vehicles in China greener.
In January, Nissan said all its new vehicles in key markets, including China, would be electrified by the early 2030s, as part of its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
The strategy comes as regulatory pressure in China grows on carmakers to slash emissions.
China is a key pillar of Nissan's turnaround strategy, which involves focusing on producing profitable cars for China, Japan and the United States, rather than chasing all-out global growth pursued by ousted boss Carlos Ghosn.
The company is scrambling to slash its production capacity and model line-up by a fifth and to cut fixed costs by 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion). Nissan aims to achieve a 5% operating profit margin and a sustainable global market share of 6% by the end of fiscal year 2023
It wasn't immediately clear how much detail Nissan plans to share on its China strategy on Monday.
The two sources said Nissan nonetheless plans to start taking ""pre-orders"" in China for its upcoming electric Ariya SUV before the end of this year. 
Nissan also plans to launch a hybrid ""e-Power"" version of the Sylphy compact car this year and an e-Power X-Trail as early as next year.
A company spokeswoman said Nissan plans to showcase in Shanghai the redesign X-Trail crossover, as well as the introduction of Nissan's e-power petrol-electric hybrid technology to China. She declined to comment otherwise.

SAHPRA said on Wednesday that it had recently reviewed data from Johnson & Johnson's local research study immunising healthcare workers and found no major safety concerns.
South Africa suspended the rollout of the J&J vaccine in the ""implementation study"" on Tuesday, after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use because of rare cases of blood clots in six people inoculated with it, out of some 7 million people who have received the shot in the United States.

Based on the evidence available, Canada still maintains that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the potential risks, the statement said.
Canada health authorities ""will continue to monitor the use of all COVID-19 vaccines closely and examine and assess any new safety concerns,"" the statement said.
Canada reported a first blood clotting associated with the vaccine on Tuesday, and a day later, after a review, health authorities said they would not restrict use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
A separate advisory council had earlier recommended Canada stop offering the vaccine to people under 55. That panel is in the process of reviewing its advice.
Canada has been ramping up its vaccination campaign, but still has a smaller percentage of its population inoculated than dozens of other countries, including the United States and Britain.

Amid a spiking third wave of infections, Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced new public health restrictions on Friday, including closing the provinces borders to domestic travelers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Air Force One subcontractor GDC Technics countersued Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Friday seeking at least $20 million after the largest U.S. airplane manufacturer canceled contracts for work on the aircraft that carries the U.S. president.
Boeing said in its suit filed April 7 that Texas-based GDC failed to complete interior work on the two heavily modified 747-8 Air Force One planes and is ""roughly one year behind schedule in meeting its contractual obligations.""
GDC's counterclaim argues it is ""Boeing's mismanagement of the completion of two Air Force One presidential aircraft, not delays caused by GDC, that has caused a delay in the completion of those aircraft.""
A Boeing spokeswoman on Saturday declined to comment on GDC's filing.
Boeing chose to utilize existing aircraft for the two replacement Air Force One aircraft rather than new planes, GDC said.
""Because of its problems with engineering, program management, and its own financial difficulties, Boeing has fallen behind in the project schedule for the aircraft. Boeing
looked to GDC as a scapegoat to excuse its lack of performance on the aircraft to the United States Air Force,"" GDC said, adding Boeing's ""false"" statements have damaged its reputation with the Air Force ""and the aviation industry worldwide.""
Boeing's suit says GDC's delays ""have resulted in millions of dollars in damages to Boeing and threaten to jeopardize work that is of critical importance.""
In July 2018, Boeing received a $3.9 billion contract to build two 747-8 aircraft for use as Air Force One, due to be delivered by December 2024. A Boeing spokeswoman said on April 8 the planemaker still planned to meet the Air Force's delivery schedule.

The Boeing 747-8s are designed to be like an airborne White House, able to fly in worst-case security scenarios such as nuclear war, and are modified with military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defense system.

""Our ambition, by 2030, is to achieve more revenue (from recycling and repair at Flins) than from assembling cars there,"" said Luca de Meo, Renault's chief executive. ""And to generate more than a billion euros in turnover in the circular economy.""
This represents a little more than 2% of the Renault's total sales in 2020. The group will report its first-quarter sales on Thursday. 
Renault confirmed last year that it would stop assembling new cars at the Flins factory and turn the site into a research, recycling and repair centre by 2024 in a move to save full-time jobs at the plant.

The loss-making carmaker said it aimed to employ 3,000 people at the revamped site by 2030.

The decision was made in recent days after Wyss' associates examined the Tribune's finances as part of a due diligence process, according to the NYT report, which cited people with knowledge of the matter.
Wyss had come to believe it would be difficult for him to realize his ambition of transforming The Chicago Tribune, the paper he was most interested in, into a national publication, the New York Times said. 
Earlier this month, Tribune Publishing received a $680 million takeover offer from Newslight LLC, a bid that trumped an earlier proposal from hedge fund Alden Global Capital for the owner of the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News.
Tribune said in a statement on April 5 that its board had determined that the $18.50 per share proposal from Newslight, jointly owned by Choice Hotels (NYSE:CHH) International Inc Chairman Stewart Bainum and Wyss, was superior to Alden's bid.
Bainum has also done due diligence on the deal and remains committed to a bid, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing a source. 
The Bloomberg report added that Bainum is exploring alternative partnerships and financing, and has received inquiries in recent weeks from potential investors.

Tribune Publishing did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

(Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga asked U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) on Saturday to provide additional supplies of COVID-19 vaccine to Japan this year, Nikkei reported.
Pfizer confirmed in an email that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla met with Suga virtually to discuss vaccine supply on the last day of Suga's three-day visit to Washington. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the only one approved in Japan. 
Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported earlier that Suga asked Pfizer to provide more vaccine doses.
Inoculations of Japan's sizable elderly population began on Monday, but some experts cautioned that the general population may not have access to vaccination until late summer or even winter because of constrained supplies.
Japan was among the last major economies to begin COVID-19 inoculations when it started in mid-February, after domestic trials to ensure safety. 
Only 0.9% of the Japanese public received their first vaccine shot as of Friday, compared with 2.5% in South Korea, and 48% in the United Kingdom.
Japan's top health experts have acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has entered a fourth wave.
Japan has exhibited ""poor performance"" in containing virus transmission, along with limited testing capacity and a slow vaccination rollout, according to a commentary of health experts published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday.

Tokyo's Olympics chief said on Friday that Japan was committed to holding a safe Games this summer, as a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted an expansion of contagion controls and with fresh calls for the Games to again be postponed or canceled.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Ant explores ways for Jack Ma to exit as Beijing piles pressure - sources,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group is exploring options for founder Jack Ma to divest his stake in the financial technology giant and give up control, as meetings with Chinese regulators signaled to the company that the move could help draw a line under Beijing's scrutiny of its business, according to a source familiar with regulators' thinking and two people with close ties to the company. 
Reuters is for the first time reporting details of the latest round of meetings and the discussions about the future of Ma's control of Ant, exercised through a complicated structure of investment vehicles. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Ma had offered in a November meeting with regulators to hand over parts of Ant to the Chinese government. https://on.wsj.com/2QvkHbc
Officials from the central bank, People's Bank of China (PBOC), and financial regulator China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) held talks between January and March with Ma and Ant separately, where the possibility of the tycoon's exit from the company was discussed, according to accounts provided by the source familiar with the regulators' thinking and one of the sources with close ties to the company.
Ant denied that a divestment of Ma's stake was ever under consideration. ""Divestment of Mr. Ma's stake in Ant Group has never been the subject of discussions with anyone,"" an Ant spokesman said in a statement.
Reuters could not determine whether Ant and Ma would proceed with a divestment option, and if so, which one. The company hoped Ma's stake, which is worth billions of dollars, could be sold to existing investors in Ant or its e-commerce affiliate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd without involving any external entity, one of the sources with company ties said.
But the second source also with company connections said that during discussions with regulators, Ma was told that he would not be allowed to sell his stake to any entity or individual close to him, and would instead have to exit completely. Another option would be to transfer his stake to a Chinese investor affiliated with the state, the source said.
Any move would need Beijing's approval, both sources with knowledge of the company's thinking said. 
The accounts provided by all the three sources are consistent in terms of the timeline for how discussions have evolved over the past few months. On the company side, one source said Ma met regulators more than once before the Chinese New Year, which was in early February. And the second source said Ant started working on options for Ma's possible exit about a couple of months ago. The source familiar with the regulators' thinking said Ant had told officials during a meeting sometime before mid-March that it was working on options. 
The source familiar with the regulators' thinking has direct knowledge of conversations between Ant and officials, while one of the sources with company ties has been briefed on Ma's interactions with regulators and Ant's plans. The other one has direct knowledge of Ant's discussions about options. They requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. 
The Ant spokesman did not provide any comments from Ma. Alibaba referred questions to Ant. Jack Ma's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment made via Ant. The State Council Information Office, PBOC, and CBIRC, also did not respond to requests for comment.
The high-stakes discussions come amid a revamp of Ant and a broader regulatory clampdown on China's technology sector that was set in motion after Ma's public criticism of regulators in a speech in October last year. 
Ma's exit could help clear the way for Ant to revive plans to go public, which stalled after the tycoon's speech, both sources proximate to the company said. Ant, which was about to raise an estimated $37 billion in what would have been the world's largest initial public offering, aborted plans the day after Ma's Nov. 2 meeting with regulators.
'TOO BIG FOR THEIR BRITCHES' 
Since then Beijing has unleashed a series of investigations and new regulations that have not only reined in Ma's empire but also swept across the country's technology sector, including other high-profile, billionaire entrepreneurs.
For Ma, 56, who also founded Alibaba and once commanded cult-like reverence in China, the consequences have been particularly severe. The tycoon completely withdrew from the public eye for about three months and has continued to keep a low profile after a brief January appearance.
China's antitrust regulator fined Alibaba a record $2.75 billion on April 10 following an antimonopoly probe that found it had abused its dominant market position for several years. A couple of days later Ant was asked by the central bank to become a financial holding company, bringing it under the ambit of banking rules that it had managed to avoid so far and allowed it to grow rapidly. 
""China still likes to promote its technology firms as global leaders just as long as they don't get too big for their britches,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.
CONTROLLING STAKE
Although Ma had previously stepped down from corporate positions, he retains effective control over Ant and significant influence over Alibaba.
While he only owns a 10% stake in Ant, Ma exercises control over the company through related entities, according to Ant's IPO prospectus.
Hangzhou Yunbo, an investment vehicle for Ma, has control over two other entities that own a combined 50.5% stake of Ant, the prospectus shows. Yunbo can decide all matters related to Ant and exercise the combined voting power of the three entities, the prospectus shows. 
Ma holds a 34% equity interest in Yunbo, the prospectus shows. 
One of the sources with company ties said there's ""a big chance"" Ma would sell his equity interest in Yunbo to exit from Ant, ultimately paving the way for the fintech major to move closer to completing its revamp and reviving its listing.

Reuters could not reach Yunbo for comment. Ant did not provide a comment on behalf of Yunbo.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",Power companies urge Biden to implement policies to cut emissions 80% by 2030,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. electricity companies wrote to President Joe Biden this week saying it will work with his administration and Congress to design a broad set of policies to reach a near-term goal of slashing the sector's carbon emissions by 2030. 
Washington should implement policies, including a clean energy standard, or CES, to ensure the electricity industry cuts carbon emissions 80% below 2005 levels by 2030, the group of 13 power interests, including generators  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC), PSEG and Talen Energy Corp, said in a letter to Biden. 
The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, did not mention Biden's goal to fully decarbonize the power sector by 2035 as part of his strategy to fight climate change. But it said the 2030 timeline is consistent with Biden's wider goal of decarbonizing the entire economy by 2050. 
""A federal policy framework can be designed to support the power sector’s deployment of strategies that are technically feasible, ensure reliability, and maintain affordability for customers,"" said the letter, sent to Biden on Friday.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 2030 goal was consistent with Evergreen Action, an advocacy group that proposed a CES in February. Sam Ricketts, a co-founder, said utilities should worry less about the 2035 goal, and focus on early wins as the last portion of emissions cuts is the hardest to achieve.
Several lawmakers, including Democrats U.S. Representative Frank Pallone and Senator Tina Smith, have introduced legislation that includes a CES. 
The standard would set gradually rising targets for the power industry to cut emissions until they hit net-zero, with a range of methods from adopting wind and solar power, using existing and advanced nuclear energy, or sucking up carbon from coal and natural gas plants before they reach the atmosphere. 
The White House this month included a CES in its $2.3 trillion infrastructure package, without detailing how it would work. 

Some plans for a CES include flexibilities such as allowing utilities to earn bankable credits for over-achieving in early years that could be used for compliance in later years when progress on cutting emissions becomes more difficult.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Tech retakes market lead as investors eye yields, earnings","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. technology and growth stocks have taken the market's reins in recent weeks, pausing a rotation into value shares as investors assess the trajectory of bond yields and upcoming earnings reports. 
Technology has been the top-performing S&P 500 sector in April, rising 8% versus a 5% rise for the benchmark index. Big tech-related growth stocks in other S&P 500 sectors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc have also charged higher.
The gains have followed a months-long rotation in which tech stocks were outpaced by shares of banks, energy companies and other economically-sensitive names that have surged since breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccines late last year. 
The increases in many of these so-called value stocks have slowed lately, while U.S. Treasury prices have come galloping back in April after a sharp first-quarter sell-off. This suggests that some investors may have already priced in a rapid growth spurt that is showing up in economic data. 
""Tech and growth has started to pick up a little bit because people are getting a little more cautious,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. ""Investors are in this wait-and-see mode ... at least until earnings get underway.""
One of the key drivers of the move in tech has been the Treasury market, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling about 15 basis points in April to about 1.6% on Friday.
Higher bond yields are particularly challenging for the performance of tech and other shares with high valuations and high expected future profits, as rising yields reduce the stocks' values in many standard models. The 10-year yield rose about 83 basis points in the first quarter.
""People are probably taking a little bit of a deep breath and saying, 'OK, maybe rates aren't going to go straight to (2.50%),'"" said Chris Galipeau, senior market strategist at Putnam Investments. 
6-month chart of S&P tech sector and 10-yr U.S. Treasury https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnaxlkvl/Pasted%20image%201618508231031.png
Shares of tech and other companies with strong ""stay-at-home"" businesses could also strengthen if there are snags in the countrywide vaccination drive or other problems with the recovery, investors said.
For example, a call by U.S. health agencies this week to pause use of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s coronavirus vaccine spurred a move into some stay-at-home stocks and out of travel names tied to the economic reopening. Investors also pointed to the impending influx of quarterly reports as key to determining market leadership, with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) among the major tech and growth company earnings due next week.
Many investors think the recent market shift is just a pause, with value and cyclical stocks due to regain command after years of lagging, as investors seize on shares expected to benefit most from what the Federal Reserve expects will be the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years.
""My guess is we will see more of this internal rotation where growth takes a break and then it comes on and then value takes a break and then it comes on,"" Galipeau said. ""It won't surprise me if that continues for a couple of years.""
Others have become more wary of the equity market in general. Strategists at BofA Global Research recently issued a report listing five reasons for caution on stocks, including high valuations and outsized returns over the past year. The bank kept its year-end S&P 500 target at 3,800, some 9% below current levels. The index has risen 11% this year. 

""Amid increasingly euphoric sentiment, lofty valuations, and peak stimulus, we continue to believe the market has overly priced in the good news,"" BofA's strategists wrote.

(Reuters) - Half of the eight workers shot to death at an Indianapolis FedEx (NYSE:FDX) facility by a former employee before he killed himself belonged to the Sikh religious community, leading an advocacy group to urge a probe of possible racial or ethnic hatred as a factor.
Law enforcement officials said Friday they have yet to determine what motivated the gunman, 19-year-old Brandon Hole, who was white, to carry out Thursday night's rampage, at a FedEx operations center near Indianapolis International Airport.
The attack in Indiana's state capital, the third most populous city in the Midwest, was the latest in a spate of at least seven deadly mass shootings in the United States over the past month. 
It came a little over a year after Hole was briefly placed under psychiatric detention by police when his mother reported her concerns that he was contemplating ""suicide by cop,"" according to the FBI. A shotgun was seized from his home.
FBI agents who interviewed the teenager last April found no criminal violation at the time and determined he possessed no ""racially motivated violent extremism ideology,"" said Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office.
But the New York-based Sikh Coalition, a civil rights advocacy group, called for a full investigation into ""the possibility of bias as factor"" in the FedEx killings. 
Four members of the Sikh faith - three women and a man - were among the dead in Thursday night's shooting spree, and at least one Sikh individual was wounded, said Gurinder Singh Khalsa, a businessman and leader of the local Sikh community who said he was briefed by victims' families. 
Singh Khalsa also told Reuters the majority of employees at the FedEx site are Sikhs, whose religion originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. 
He said the FedEx center was known for hiring older members of the local Sikh community who did not necessarily speak fluent English.
The Sikh Coalition's executive director, Satjeet Kaur, said more than 8,000 Sikh-Americans live in Indiana.
SPATE OF VIOLENCE
The recent surge in U.S. mass gun violence began on March 16 when a gunman shot eight people to death, including six Asian woman, at three Atlanta-area day spas before he was arrested.
That rampage heightened tensions already brewing over a rise in hate crimes and discrimination directed at Asian Americans in recent years, stoked in part by racially inflammatory rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic's origins in China.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States perpetrated by the Islamist militant group al Qaeda, Sikh men have sometimes been confused publicly with Muslims because they wear turbans with their hair and beards uncut. 
The eight people killed in Thursday night's violence ranged in age from 19 to 74. The shooting lasted only a couple of minutes and was over by the time police responded to the scene, Craig McCartt, the Indianapolis police department's deputy chief, said on Friday.
Witnesses described a chaotic attack, as the gunman opened fire with a rifle in the parking lot before entering the facility and continuing to shoot, leaving victims both inside and outside the building. Officers found the suspect dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
McCartt told reporters the suspect was believed to have last worked at the plant in the fall of 2020.
Asked what brought him back to the facility on Thursday night, McCartt replied: ""I wish I could answer that.""

Neither authorities nor FedEx officials would say what ended Hole's employment at FedEx.

A sharp drop in temperatures that lasted five days shut individual units and sometimes entire plants at 25 refineries in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Tennessee. 
Six million barrels per day (bpd) of national refining capacity was out of production before refineries in Beaumont, Corpus Christi and Port Arthur, Texas, began restarting on Feb. 22.
Bt comparison, Hurricane Harvey idled a fifth of national refining capacity at the end of August 2017.
The last major unit shut by the storm, the 38,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) vacuum distillation unit (VDU) at  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Corp’s 112,229 bpd Pasadena, Texas, refinery, restarted on Wednesday, according to sources familiar with plant operations. 
But like in a hurricane, problems inside the plants were compounded by outages of larger systems on which the refineries rely.
Problems began on the night of Feb. 14 when the 30-degree drop to 15 degrees Fahrenheit froze instrumentation needed to operate production units, said sources familiar with operations at several refineries. 
Crews struggled throughout the night maintaining minimum levels of production, but on the Feb. 15 utilities failed, including industrial gas supplies, natural gas for power and steam production as well as external power, forcing complete shutdowns at many of the plants, the sources said. 
Oil companies have begun describing the financial cost of the freeze.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said at the end of March that the shutdown of its refineries in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas, accounts for as much as a quarter of the estimated $800-million loss the company incurred in February.
The nation’s second largest refiner,  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), said last week it will take a charge between $520 million and $535 million for higher electricity and natural gas costs in the first quarter. 
Eight of Valero’s 12 U.S. refineries were shut by the storm. 

Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) said its loss for the first quarter could reach $865 million, but up to $210 million of that is due to a pre-tax impairment for a pipeline project.

(Reuters) - A pension fund filed a lawsuit against  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG on Friday in a U.S. court, accusing the Swiss bank of misleading investors and mismanaging risk exposure to high-risk clients, including Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management.
The pension fund, City of St. Clair Shores Police & Fire Retirement System, based in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, filed the class action lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan, alleging violations of federal securities laws.
""Specifically, defendants concealed material defects in the Company's risk policies and procedures and compliance oversight functions and efforts to allow high-risk clients to take on excessive leverage, including Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management, exposing the company to billions of dollars in losses,"" the lawsuit said.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of British fund Greensill and then U.S. investment fund Archegos within the course of one month.
Reuters reported last month that Credit Suisse was considering compensating investors hit by the collapse of funds linked to Greensill.
Credit Suisse's asset management unit last month was forced to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the British firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.
Huge losses at Archegos last month prompted Credit Suisse to replace its heads of investment banking and of compliance and risk after it said it would book a $4.7 billion first-quarter charge from exposure to the stricken firm.
Archegos, a single-family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, defaulted on margin calls by its lenders, in turn causing lenders to sell big blocks of securities to recoup what they were owed.

The head of Switzerland's financial regulator, FINMA, had questioned Credit Suisse over risks in its dealings with Greensill Capital ""months"" before the bank was forced to close $10 billion of funds linked to Greensill, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday.

(Reuters) - An electrical problem that led to dozens of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets being suspended from service has widened after engineers found similar grounding flaws elsewhere in the cockpit, industry sources said on Friday.
Airlines pulled dozens of MAX jets from service a week ago after  Boeing Co  warned of a production-related electrical grounding problem in a backup power control unit situated in the cockpit on some recently built airplanes.
Since then, suspected grounding problems have been found in two other places on the flight deck, the sources said.
These include the storage rack where the affected control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.
Boeing had no immediate comment on the wider problem, which was first reported by Aviation Week. (https:// Boeing shares closed down 1.2%. The glitch - which affects about a fifth of MAX jets in the market - is the latest issue to beset Boeing's most-sold model but is not related to design problems that contributed to a 20-month worldwide safety ban in the wake of two fatal crashes. Boeing is expected to draw up bulletins advising airlines how to fix the problems with grounding, or the electrical paths designed to maintain safety in the event of a surge of voltage.  U.S. regulators must first approve the bulletins.  While most analysts say the fix is expected to be relatively straightforward, no details were immediately available on the timing of the repair bulletins needed to start the work on some 90 jets affected by the suspension. The planemaker had initially told airlines a fix could take hours or a few days per jet, according to a notification seen by Reuters when the partial suspension was first announced. The problem has been traced back to a change in material coating once production of the 737 MAX resumed last year.  Nearly all the affected jets were built before deliveries of the MAX resumed in December, shortly after U.S. regulators lifted the fleet-wide ban caused by the 2018 and 2019 crashes. Boeing has said it plans to raise production of the 737 MAX gradually from an unspecified current ""low rate"" to a target of 31 jets a month by early 2022. Industry sources estimate it is currently producing around four jets a month.  
Airline sources say Boeing has not, however, delivered any MAX jets since the electrical problem was identified last week.

The move indicates the Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to restart work on the proposed rule, which the regulator shelved under President Donald Trump after it had been initially unveiled under President Barack Obama.
""This is an important step toward finalizing rules that will facilitate clarity and efficiency for shareholders voting in director elections,"" said SEC Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee in a statement.
The 2016 proposal would have changed how shareholders vote during activist investor-led fights for board seats, an issue that has divided companies and investors for years. The decision to restart the rulewriting process seems to be a win for activist investors who say the current system favors company management in board fights. Companies have cautioned changing the rules could spark more disruptive activist-led fights.
Right now, shareholders voting remotely have to choose from a full slate of board directors nominated by the management or a competing set of nominees provided by an activist investor. Investors cannot pick and choose specific preferred candidates unless they send a representative to vote in person at the annual meeting, and most votes are cast remotely.

The proposed SEC rule would establish a ""universal proxy"" standard that would allow voters to mix-and-match candidates remotely. The SEC is accepting new comments on that proposal for 30 days.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The defense team for Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, will ask a Canadian court to delay upcoming hearings in her U.S. extradition case, the court said on Friday.
Meng's U.S. extradition hearings have lasted more than two years and she is scheduled to be back in the British Columbia Supreme Court on April 26.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the application was a result of an agreement announced last week in a Hong Kong court between Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and HSBC regarding publication of internal documents relating to the fraud allegations against Meng.
The source was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.
Meng, 49, is facing charges in the United States for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, potentially causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
She has been held under house arrest in Canada since her arrest at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018.
Meng's lawyers have been seeking the release of more documents from HSBC, arguing the charges against her were based on a presentation she gave to a senior HSBC executive in 2013. They claim that ""an incomplete version"" of her statements made in the presentation was used by U.S. authorities to request her extradition, and have pushed HSBC to release documents detailing the contents of the meeting.
A British judge in February blocked the release of internal HSBC documents sought by Huawei.
Meng's extradition hearings are scheduled to wrap up in May, although the potential for appeals on either side means the case could drag on for years.

Canada's justice department did not offer an immediate comment.

Investing.com --  Boeing (NYSE:BA) dropped 1.5% after Reuters reported more problems have been found with the 737 MAX.
Inspections are showing more electrical issues akin to those that led to jets being suspended from service last week, Reuters said, citing industry sources.
It's the latest in a series of problems plaguing the planemaker, which saw the aircraft grounded after two fatal crashes killed more than 340 people in 2018 and 2019. Boeing admitted to defrauding the public and agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion after getting criminally charged by the Department of Justice.
Dozens of MAX aircraft were pulled from service last week after Boeing warned of an electrical insulation fault in a backup power control unit, and inspections are revealing similar problems in other parts of the plane, Reuters reported.

Investing.com – Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) shares rose 4% in Friday’s trading as the crypto exchange continues to dazzle stakeholders two days after its Nasdaq debut.
Loop Capital analyst Kenneth Hill is the latest to join its list of admirers, initiating coverage of the crypto exchange with a buy rating and a $394 target, an upside of 17% from the stock's current price.  
Coinbase, which listed directly, briefly touched a $100 billion market capitalization the same day. Its reference listing price was set at $250 per share.
According to Hill, Coinbase is many things, starting with it being an exchange at its most basic level, storing over 11% of the cryptocurrency in the world.
“The path to success is by no means a foregone conclusion. There are some very sizable risks to manage (growing competition, fee compression, etc.) as well as navigating a volatile crypto backdrop,” Hill wrote in the note.
It's not the trading volumes, a key determinant in the success of an exchange, but it is customer acquisition and asset accumulation that will decide Coinbase’s fate, Hill wrote.
In a vote of confidence for the new kid on the block, Ark Invest, led by the widely-followed Cathie Wood, bought 750,000 shares of Coinbase for $246 million on its first very day of listing.
According to data released by Ark, the firm purchased the shares for three of its actively managed exchange-traded funds.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 01:15PM ET</span>",Drug companies to face first opioid trial following pandemic delays,"By Nate Raymond and Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - Four drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, will go to trial on Monday over claims they helped fuel an opioid crisis that has resulted in nearly 500,000 overdose deaths in the United States.
The trial is one of several looking to hold companies accountable for the overdose and abuse crisis that are set to take place this year after the coronavirus pandemic delayed litigation, putting renewed pressure on them to enter into multi-billion dollar settlements.
J&J, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) PLC and Abbvie's Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit are accused by several California counties of deceptively marketing painkillers in ways that downplayed their addictive risks to boost sales.
If the companies are held liable by Orange County Superior Court Judge Peter Wilson following a trial conducted virtually, the counties say they should have to pay $50 billion to help foot the costs of abating the public nuisance they created plus penalties.
Opioids have resulted in the overdose deaths of nearly 500,000 people from 1999 to 2019 in the United States, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""We need these companies to fund what it takes to try to undo the harms that they have caused, and the scope and scale of that is enormous,"" Santa Clara County Counsel James Williams (NYSE:WMB) said in an interview.
His county is suing the companies along with Los Angeles and Orange counties and the city of Oakland.
The drugmakers deny wrongdoing, arguing they acted appropriately in marketing medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and that the counties cannot prove their promotion of opioids caused the crisis.
J&J in a statement called its marketing of the drugs ""appropriate and responsible,"" Israel-based Teva said it will defend itself against these ""unproven allegations."" Endo and Allergan declined to comment.
More than 3,400 lawsuits brought largely by states and local governments are pending against companies accused of fueling the opioid epidemic.
The state of Oklahoma in 2019 won a $465 million judgment against J&J in only such trial so far. Opioid cases that were set to go to trial in 2020 were put off as a massive new public health crisis made gathering jurors and lawyers in the same room untenable.
'DAY OF RECKONING'
Some plaintiffs' lawyers said the delays benefited the companies at the cost of states, counties and municipalities who say they need settlements to help pay for the costs of addressing a painkiller addiction epidemic that only grew worse during the coronavirus pandemic.
The nation's three largest drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) - and J&J have proposed paying a combined $26 billion to resolve the cases against them.
The proposal, a version of which was first put forward in 2019, has yet to be finalized, and some plaintiffs lawyers say that only with trials will they and other companies come to the table to finalize payouts.
""They keep putting off the day of judgment,"" Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a law professor at University of Georgia, said of the companies. ""You really need trials to create that moment of pressure.""
Next month, a closely-watched case is set to go to trial in West Virginia accusing the three drug distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the highly addictive painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. They deny the allegations.
That case will be followed in June by a jury trial in New York against several drugmakers and distributors, which was delayed on the eve of trial in March 2020 because of the pandemic.

""The day of reckoning is coming,"" said Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer at Napoli Shkolnik who is representing New York's Nassau County. ""They've been able to slow roll because there was no trial like looming over their heads. Now they have a trial.""

Wolfe is at least the third brokerage upgrade, after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) did last month.
The stock hit a high of $53.18 on Friday but eased off a bit to trade 2.3% higher.
Wolfe’s Jeffrey Kvaal has put a target of $63 on the stock, an upside of almost 19% from the current price even after the latest boost.
Goldman has set a 12-month price target of $59 while JP Morgan’s is at $55.  
A higher contribution to the revenue mix from software will contribute to multiple expansion, along with an improving hyperscale play, Kvaal wrote in the note.
Strong IT spending should prove a tailwind to estimates through the 2022 fiscal year, he said.
Cisco has mostly missed out on the rally seen in tech stocks in the year so far. Analysts see the company benefiting from higher networking opportunities as vaccinations help people return to offices."

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in an interview aired on CNBC Thursday, said people will ""likely"" need a third dose of its shot within six to 12 months of vaccination. Bourla also said vaccination against the coronavirus may well be required every year.
The Pfizer vaccine, developed by the U.S.-based company in partnership with German firm BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), currently plays a leading role in American and European vaccination campaigns.

Investing.com – Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) shares jumped more than 7% on Friday after an upgrade to overweight from Piper Sandler analyst Kashy Harrison.
Harrison sees the stock at $77, still more than 50% higher from the stock’s current price. 
Harrison attributed his bullish outlook on the solar panel maker to strong growth expected from the residential sector as more people opt for the renewable source of power. Long-term federal policy support via the America Jobs Plan and interest rates that are only moving lower will also help the company, the analyst said.
He also credited the management team. Lynn Jurich is chief executive officer and co-founder of the home solar, battery storage, and energy services company. With Sunrun co-founder Ed Fenster, Jurich invented the business model “solar-as-a-service” that helped people generate and store electricity using rechargeable home solar and batteries.
Sunrun’s share price is almost half of its 52-week high of $100.93, also a factor behind Harrison’s upgrade.

The discussion, which centered around how the pandemic-battered industry could get back into business, comes after the CDC said passengers and crew would need COVID-19 vaccine shots and more frequent testing, but did not give a timeline on when it will lift its ban on cruises.
Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, the industry's largest player, had said the instructions were ""unworkable"" and threatened to shift home ports of its cruise ships to other parts of the world if the United States did not allow it to start sailing.
Industry leaders showed their frustration with the guidelines relating to vaccination requirements and sought to set up a working group with industry and CDC, the agency said in a statement about the meeting that took place on Monday.
The CDC said it wanted to restart sailing in a phased approach, but again did not provide a timeline.
The chief executives of Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group attended the Monday meeting, CNBC reported.
The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The state of Florida, where the three companies are based, had earlier this month filed a lawsuit against the CDC, demanding cruise ships be allowed to resume sailing.

""We welcome the CDC's expressed commitment to working with the cruise industry... to address the changes in the science, including the impact of vaccines, that will move us toward our shared goal of responsibly resuming operations this summer,"" the Cruise Lines International Association said in a statement.

DraftKings will also act as an exclusive ""official daily fantasy partner,"" giving it exclusive rights to promote daily fantasy sports contests.
Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly said this development could accelerate legalization of online sports betting (in various states) and increasing consumer adoption. Kelly expects the NFL to change its policy and allow gambling commercials during its broadcasts.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Friday, as robust earnings from Main Street banks and a sharp rebound in housing starts in March sustained the positive mood created by Thursday's retail sales and jobless claims data.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT). the Dow Jones Industrial Average had pushed to a new record high of 34,213 points, up 177 points, or 0.5% from Thursday's close. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% but the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2% as strong economic data again encouraged outflows into cyclical and value stocks. 
Earlier, the Census Bureau reported that housing starts rose to their highest in nearly 15 years in March, rebounding 19% from a weather-depressed February. Building permits also surprised to the upside, rising to 1.766 million, just below their January high.
Among early movers,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fell 1.2% after reporting a $911 million loss on trading with Archegos Capital, the family office of ex-fund manager that blew up at the start of the month. The disclosure took the gloss off a set of quarterly earnings that was in other respects as strong as the rest of Wall Street. PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) stock and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) stock rose 2.6% and 0.5% respectively as their quarterly updates turned out better than expected.

Battery maker Quantumscape's  (NYSE:QS) stock managed only the weakest of rebounds after tumbling on Thursday to its lowest in over three months on the back of a short report by Scorpion Capital.  The stock rose 0.9% after the company said it stood by its data which, it said, ""speaks for itself."" It didn't offer any more detailed rebuttal of Scorpion's claims, which were dismissed by analysts backing the stock as ""hearsay.""
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), which courted controversy last year when it tied up with Nikola, another aggressively-hyped electric mobility company, fell 0.5% after announcing plans to invest $2.3 billion in battery-making capacity together with LG Chem. The announcement comes only days after LG settled a long-running dispute over patent infringement with rival SK Hynix.

MINAMISOMA, Japan (Reuters) - Koji Suzuki's surf shop, which he first opened in 1989, was washed away by the devastating tsunami that hit northeast Japan in March 2011. But that did not kill his love of the sea. 
The 66-year-old reopened Sun Marine Surf in November of the following year in a new location in Minamisoma city, a few kilometres from the coast, and he visits the beaches of Fukushima Prefecture daily to surf.
So he takes personally Japan's decision to release nearly 1.3 million tonnes of treated water into the sea from the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant, which was severely damaged by the same tsunami and the earthquake that unleashed it. 
""I definitely do not want to be in a contaminated sea, and I am completely against the government's decision"", said Suzuki after riding the waves on Friday morning. 
The first release of water from the plant will take place in about two years, giving operator Tokyo Electric Power time to filter it to remove harmful isotopes, build infrastructure and get approval from regulators. 
Japan has said the release is necessary to press ahead with the complex decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. It also says similarly treated water is released from nuclear plants around the world. 
Suzuki said he knows the government insists the treated water will be safe, but he is concerned others may not think so. 
""I was hoping that the number (of visitors) will recover to pre-disaster levels, but now it's decided that treated water will be released into the sea. I'm worried that the figure may fall again,"" he said. 
The first of Fukushima's beaches did not reopen to the public until several years after the disaster following a huge decontamination effort, with Kitaizumi beach, 22 km (14 miles) north of the plant, not reopening until July 2019.
Suzuki, who tends to surf at a different beach further away from Fukushima Daiichi, says numbers visiting the area have picked up again. But he is afraid the central government's decision will end up impacting the local marine sports industry, including surfing.

""I don't think anyone wants to surf at contaminated beaches,"" Suzuki said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks hit a record high on Friday and oil climbed after strong U.S. and Chinese economic data bolstered expectations of a solid global recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump.
Government stimulus, a string of strong corporate earnings releases and signs of economic recovery in countries ahead in the COVID-19 vaccination race have all helped push stock markets onto new heights in recent days. 
""As the economic re-opening accelerates in the coming months, we believe the bull market remains on a solid footing,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer, UBS Global Wealth Management.
MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks edged higher in early European trade, up 0.2% to a record high. Europe's top indexes all opened higher, led by Britain's FTSE 100, up 0.5% and passing 7,000 points for the first time since February 2020.
""As the global recovery becomes more entrenched, fuelled by continued fiscal stimulus and ultra-loose monetary policy, we think this should translate into continued positive UK equity market performance,"" said Nick Peters, multi asset portfolio manager, Fidelity International.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed open on Wall Street, with those for the S&P 500 up 0.1% and Nasdaq futures down 0.1%
Overnight, Asian markets had tracked a path similar to Europe's. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last up 0.5%, with Shanghai shares adding 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei up 0.1%.
Driving the move was Chinese data showing record 18.3% growth in the first quarter, though the reading slightly undershot expectations. Retail sales bounced strongly last month.
""We remain focused on a China-led rebound steadily helping the Asia-Pacific region,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
""As the U.S. economy and then European economies open up, it should further help Asian exports. This should support Emerging Market and APAC equities as well as China equities and fixed income."" 
Despite the punchy GDP number, gains were tempered by the view that Beijing will act to rein in the brisk expansion later in the year to stop the economy overheating.
The strong Chinese data had followed similarly upbeat numbers out of the United States overnight. Retail sales rebounded 9.8% in March, pushing the level of sales 17.1% above its pre-pandemic level to a record high.
The brightening economic prospects were underscored by other data, including first-time claims for unemployment benefits, which tumbled last week to the lowest level since March 2020.
All of which initially helped oil prices push on, hitting one-month highs thanks to the economic data and higher demand forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC, before pulling back.
Brent futures were last flat at $66.94 per barrel. U.S. crude was down 0.1% at $63.4 per barrel, both on course for their first substantial weekly gains in six.
Despite the strong data, U.S. bond yields dropped, in part driven by buying from Japan, which began a new financial year this month. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield was last at 1.573%.
""We retain a modest short position in U.S. rates and would be inclined to add to this should yields drop towards 1.5% on the 10-year part of the yield curve,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management.
In the currency market, lower U.S. yields were a drag on the dollar overnight, and the dollar index ebbed in late morning trade in Europe to be down 0.2%.

The euro was up 0.2% at $1.1989, having hit a six-week high of $1.19935 overnight. The pound was down flat at 1.3791.

This adds to the $250 million ARK had already purchased.
There are more economic numbers to pore over Friday, after Thursday’s stunning 9.8% retail sales March gain, with housing starts due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). Better weather in March should contribute to a rebound, with economists calling for a 1.7% jump in the month. The Michigan consumer sentiment release for April is also due later Friday.
Oil prices climbed to one-month highs Friday, helped by an improved oil demand outlook on the back of strong economic recoveries in China and the United States, the two largest consumers of oil in the world.
Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency have this week upgraded their forecasts for world oil demand growth this year.
Eyes will turn to the release of the Baker Hughes oil rig count later Friday, to see whether U.S. shale producers are trying to take advantage of the higher crude prices to increase supply.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Toshiba bid to test Japan's corporate governance rules,"By Scott Murdoch, Alun John and Makiko Yamazaki
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A potential bid for Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp is set to test both corporate governance at the scandal-hit conglomerate as well as rule changes in Japan designed to improve transparency and protect minority shareholders.
The process puts the spotlight on the world's third-largest economy's efforts to attract more investments from overseas just as global private equity firms are hunting for more big-ticket deals in the country.
Toshiba, which has been hit by a succession of accounting and other scandals, has just lost its CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani, who left this week after facing criticism over governance issues. Buyout firms are already circling to take the industrial group private.
The conglomerate, whose products range from escalators to sewerage plants, is expected to consider interest expressed by private equity firms, including a potential $20 billion offer from CVC Capital Partners.
""This is the next big corporate governance test for Toshiba: whether they will run an open and transparent process, in line with METI's Fair M&A Guidelines,"" Seth Fischer, Oasis Management chief investment officer and Toshiba shareholder, told Reuters.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), in 2019, brought in new rules to provide greater protections for minority investors during transactions by laying out a process to secure fair deal terms.
They would require Toshiba, for example, to establish a special committee of independent outside directors and auditors promptly to evaluate the deal.
But the rules have faced criticism from investors because they are voluntary. 
Japan, which has the world's third-largest equity market, ranked seventh in Asia for corporate governance, behind Malaysia and Thailand, based on the latest scores from the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA). 
The investor organisation said that recent efforts in Japan to improve governance standards were more focused on codes of best practice and guidelines rather than company law and regulation.
""Takeover protections for minority shareholders in Japan, are much weaker than in other developed Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore,"" said Jamie Allen Secretary General of the ACGA. 
Another complication for investors is that Japan tightened rules last year on foreign ownership of strategically important companies. Under these rules, foreign private equity bidders interested in Toshiba, whose technology is used in defence systems, could potentially be blocked from buying the company.
Some investors are concerned that if Toshiba is taken private with government support to allay national security concerns, other undervalued companies in 'restricted industries' might follow suit, Allen said.
Some Japan state-backed funds are considering buying Toshiba, the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun reported on Thursday, a Japan-led bid which may be more palatable to regulators and management than rival offers by foreign funds.
Ashley Pittard, head of global equities at Sydney-based Pendal Group, an investor in several Japanese companies, hoped a Toshiba bid would lead to more corporate activity in Japan which could help to foster improved corporate governance standards.
""Japanese companies are making improvements in corporate governance aspects but it's moving at a glacial pace,"" he said. 
The bidding process will put Toshiba's own governance standards under scrutiny.
The company's past problems included an accounting scandal in 2015 and allegations investors were pressured ahead of its annual shareholders' meeting last year, which resulted in an independent probe into the allegations, resisted by Toshiba's management. 
Nicholas Benes, a corporate governance expert and head of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan, said the fact a majority of Toshiba's board were apparently willing to support management in opposing the independent probe shows outside directors need ""true independence, dedication and temerity."" 
Concerning the take-private deal, ""Given this board's mix of independent directors ... one would hope the board will conduct a fair auction that maximizes competition and delivers full value to shareholders,"" he said.
Toshiba shares plunged 6% on Friday following media reports that the company plans to reject the CVC proposal.

Toshiba had said it would give the initial proposal careful consideration.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Grab mulling secondary Singapore listing after SPAC merger - sources,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Grab Holdings, Southeast Asia's ride-hailing to delivery giant, is considering a secondary listing in its home market of Singapore after completing a Nasdaq listing via a $40 billion SPAC merger, three sources familiar with the matter said. Listing on Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, the people said, potentially offering its customers, drivers and merchant partners easier access to trade its shares. Grab, a household name across Southeast Asia, is in the early stages of considering a secondary listing in the city-state, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak about the matter.
Grab and SGX declined to comment on the listing plans.
""For the right issuer, a secondary listing could well be a good move. You can get the best of both worlds,"" said Raymond Tong, capital markets and M&A partner at law firm Rajah & Tann Singapore.
""If your home markets are in this region, a Singapore listing can help you tap another pool of investors as there are many family offices and funds based in Singapore,"" said Tong.
The potential Singapore listing plans come after Grab this week struck a $40 billion merger with Altimeter Growth Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), setting a record for the world's biggest SPAC deal.
As part of the transaction, Grab is raising $4 billion from investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Temasek Holdings, Fidelity International, Malaysia's Permodalan Nasional Bhd and some of Indonesia's richest family groups.
Grab, which began as a ride-hailing business in 2012, now operates in eight countries and more than 400 cities and has expanded into food and grocery deliveries, as well as digital payments. Last year, it won a digital banking licence in Singapore.
It wasn't clear how much Grab might aim to raise in any secondary listing, with financial terms and timetable still in the early stages of consideration, the sources said.
The company with the top valuation on the Singapore bourse is bank DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Ltd, currently worth about S$74 billion ($55.4 billion) by capitalisation.
One of the sources said that while Grab has sufficient cash reserves and could end up raising only a small amount on SGX, a listing would mark a big win for the exchange.
SGX has mainly only seen large IPOs from real estate investment trusts. Hindered by a small base of retail investors in the city-state, it has struggled with low liquidity and valuations, forcing a spate of delistings and also discouraging big-ticket listings from regional high-growth companies.
The Hong Kong bourse, however, has benefited from diplomatic and political tensions between the United States and China that have led many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. Global fund managers have also been swapping China holdings from Wall Street to Hong Kong.
SGX has taken many steps to try to bulk up its stock market in recent years, and under Chief Executive Loh Boon Chye, who was appointed six years ago, it has acquired firms to transform itself into a multi-asset exchange.
Over the past three years, SGX-listed companies have raised about four times more funds in the secondary market than from primary fund raising.
Currently, there are 28 companies with a secondary listing on SGX, including Malaysia's IHH Healthcare Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings (OTC:JMHLY).
Last year, AMTD International (NYSE:HKIB) became the first NYSE-listed firm to list on SGX. It also became the first to take advantage of a dual-class share structure in Singapore.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",Biden White House's secret weapon on infrastructure: small businesses,"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - The Biden administration is seeking to leverage a secret weapon in its bid to get corporate America to pay for a sweeping jobs and infrastructure package: the nation's some 30 million small businesses. 
The White House's effort, previously unreported, seeks to harness the political popularity of small businesses and the current agitation among them over a tax structure many view as generous to larger, billion-dollar corporations like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) over Main Street establishments.
In doing so, the White House believes it has allies that will serve as an antidote to the large national trade groups – like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and The Business Roundtable – who have come out in favor of infrastructure investment but strongly against President Joe Biden's plan to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to %28. 
Biden is also seeking to limit the ability of American firms to avoid taxes by shifting profits overseas. Biden's plan faces stiff opposition from Republican lawmakers who are more likely to dig in their heels than be swayed by small business sentiment.
Reuters has learned that in recent weeks, White House officials have held a spate of private briefings with small business leaders to explain Biden's more than $2 trillion-dollar plan, which includes money for traditional infrastructure projects alongside addressing domestic policy priorities like climate change and racial equity. 
'LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD'
On Tuesday, White House economic advisers and the head of the Small Business Administration, Isabel Guzman, joined thousands of local small business leaders on a call to detail the plan and field questions. The issue of tax fairness was a major theme.
""The Made in America tax plan will help level the playing field between small businesses and large multinational corporations, by ensuring that big corporations can't escape or eliminate the taxes they owe by offshoring jobs and profits in the United States, and pay a lower tax rate than small businesses,"" Isabel Guzman, administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, told business leaders on Tuesday. 
Most small businesses are pass-through businesses like limited-liability organizations and S-corporations that don't pay a corporate tax. Instead, the owners report business income and pay the tax on their personal tax returns. 
Depending on the income, small business owners could pay anywhere from 10% to 37% on their income. Fortune 500 companies, on the other hand, paid an average rate of 11.3% in 2018, due to tax deductions and other measures that lower their tax liability, according to the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy.
A White House official involved in the effort told Reuters that the ""vast majority"" of small businesses will be spared a tax increase under the president's plan.
""Our message to them is you're absolutely not going to be impacted by the additional taxes on large multi-national corporations, but what you will benefit from is all the programs,"" the White House official said. 
Michael Canty, President of Ohio-based Alloy Precision Technologies, says he will not be part of the vast majority spared from Biden's tax plan. His manufacturing company employs roughly 85 people and is formed as a C-corp under the federal tax code and subject to the corporate tax rate.
He said the proposal amounts to a 33 percent increase is his company's taxes and warned that it will make companies like his less competitive in the global marketplace.
""We have already started a hiring freeze. Between the tax increase and what we see as a tough regulatory environment, we have to prepare,"" Canty said. 
Frank Knapp owns a one-man public relations firm in South Carolina and is the co-chair of Small Business for America's Future, which represents some 85,000 small businesses across the country. The group has polled its members routinely in the past few years and the results show the Republican tax cuts passed under President Donald Trump in 2017 were wildly unpopular with members who viewed them as a big giveaway to big businesses. 
Recent polling by his organization shows 65% of members support increasing taxes on large corporations, Knapp says. 
A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that a plurality of Americans - 44% compared to 38% - support Biden's plan. Support grows for the infrastructure plan if it is funded by raising taxes on corporations, with 53% supporting it and 39% opposed. 
Knapp says he sees the role of his organization as debunking what he calls the myth that American businesses oppose raising the corporate tax rate. He says opposing lawmakers have already started to use the argument that the package would hurt small businesses and weaken employment in the nation's largest sector. 

""Our role is to step up and say, No, you're absolutely wrong. Yes, we are the job creators, but we're not going to be negatively impacted by this. We're positively impacted and this is good for small businesses,"" Knapp said.

(Reuters) -European stocks hit a record high on Friday after strong U.S. and China data spurred optimism about a speedy global recovery, while strong results from Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) boosted carmakers.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3%. The German DAX gained 0.6% to hit an all-time high, while UK's FTSE 100 was up 0.4%.
Global stocks stood near record highs after data showed China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter and U.S. retail sales rose by the most in 10 months in March.
German car and truck maker Daimler rose 2.5% as higher vehicle prices and strong demand in China helped it post a better-than-expected surge in quarterly operating profit.
The wider automobiles & parts index gained 1.6% to lead gains among European sectors. Data showed new car registrations jumped 87.3% in March in the European Union.
While the STOXX 600 is set for its seventh straight week of gains, the moves have been tight-ranged this week, with most European bourses holding near pre-pandemic levels.
""A lot of the good news has been priced in,"" said Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at Kingswood. ""Equity markets are probably going to continue to trend higher but they definitely need to consolidate.""
Analysts expect profit for STOXX 600 companies to jump more than 55% in the first quarter after a slide of nearly 40% in the same quarter last year, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Meanwhile, a Reuters poll of economists showed the euro zone economy will recover at a much weaker rate this quarter than expected only a month earlier, with a slower vaccine roll-out among the biggest risks.
The survey showed the bloc was set to emerge from a double-dip recession and grow 1.5% this quarter, but a sharp downgrade from the 2.1% predicted in March.
Bank of Ireland jumped 6.5% to the top of STOXX 600 after it reached a deal with Belgian financial group KBC to explore the sale of most of KBC's Irish unit.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Belgian financial group KBC could become the latest lender to leave the Irish market after it entered an agreement with Bank of Ireland on Friday to explore the sale of the bulk of its Irish unit's assets. 
The surprise move comes just weeks after NatWest said it was winding down its underperforming Ulster Bank business in the Irish Republic, a move that had already left the country with just four retail banks.
Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement that KBC's decision to seek the sale - involving most of KBC's performing loans and deposits - was regrettable but hoped the negotiations with Bank of Ireland would conclude quickly.
""It is the case that the competitive dynamic has changed, I couldn't pretend otherwise to your listeners this morning,"" Donohoe told national broadcaster RTE, adding that additional competition would come from non-bank lenders.
The transaction remains subject to due diligence, further negotiation and agreement of final terms, the two banks said. KBC Bank Ireland CEO Peter Roebben said the talks were at a ""very, very early stage"".
Bank of Ireland's shares were 6.6% higher at 0740 GMT while KBC was up 1.8%. Bank of Ireland should be able to fund the transaction with its own resources, Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst Eamonn Hughes said in a note, describing it ""a potentially very accretive deal for the bank.""
KBC had 10 billion euros ($12 billion) worth of Irish loans, 5 billion in deposits and a 12.6% share of the mortgage market at the end of last year. It gave no specific reasons for wanting to exit the Irish market but in a statement cited ""the challenging operational context for European banks"".
Exits by KBC and NatWest look set to further strengthen Bank of Ireland and main rival Allied Irish Banks' grip on their home market. AIB entered an agreement with NatWest to buy around 4 billion euros of corporate and commercial loans.
The withdrawal of a string of foreign banks a decade ago following Ireland's banking crash made the two banks the dominant players in a market former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi once described as a ""quasi-monopoly"".
KBC is also reviewing its options to divest its non-performing mortgage loan portfolio, which is not part of the agreement with Bank of Ireland, it said.
Ireland's central bank said in a statement it understood there will be concerns that the KBC transaction, if it goes ahead, will reduce competition and choice in the market.
""Competitive pressures can clearly have an effect on the functioning of the financial system,"" Ed Sibley, deputy central bank governor with responsibility for prudential regulation, said.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China asks banks not to withhold loans to asset manager Huarong - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese regulators have asked some banks not to withhold loans to embattled asset management giant China Huarong Asset Management Co, as part of the supportive measures to stabilize its cash flow position, sources told Reuters.
Huarong, one of China's four biggest asset management companies (AMCs) which counts the Ministry of Finance as its biggest shareholder, has been hit by an offshore bond selloff and a suspension in its shares since March 31, after it announced a delay in its earnings report due to a ""relevant transaction"" yet to be finalised.
That is the latest in the troubles for the distressed-debt manager whose failed investments and expanded businesses have forced it into restructuring talks since 2018 and whose Chairman Lai Xiaomin was executed in January after a graft probe.
Huarong and its subsidiaries currently have outstanding offshore bonds worth $22.39 billion, according to Refinitiv data, with some $3.57 billion of them are maturing in 2021. 
The latest measures urged by the financial regulators are aimed at containing contagion and to make sure Huarong's onshore cash situation is stable, according to four sources who include creditors of Huarong and who have direct knowledge of firm's asset restructuring plan.
Some state-banks have also been notified to be prepared to support Huarong, one of the four sources said, without elaborating.
Investors are concerned that any debt restructuring by the company could leave holders of its U.S. dollar bonds unprotected and force an expensive reassessment of long-standing government support for Chinese state-owned issuers.
Market concerns have spilled over into other issuers and lifted the cost of insurance against a default in China's dollar debt to its highest since October.
The support comes as Huarong prepares to repay a 2.5 billion yuan ($382.84 million) exchange-traded onshore bond maturing on April 18, though investors do not expect the company to face difficulties with that bond. 
The yield on that instrument stood at 4.293% on Friday, according to Refinitiv data, down from 4.365% on March 31.
Huarong repaid two maturing onshore enterprise bonds with a combined value of 3.1 billion yuan on March 15.
The firm is also looking into the possibility of repaying its offshore debts that are due to mature with onshore funds, a measure that needs coordination and final approvals from the Ministry of Finance and the country's foreign exchange regulator, one of the sources said.
The sources could not be identified as the information has not yet been made public and they are not authorized to speak to media.
The Finance Ministry, the People's Bank of China and banking and foreign exchange regulators did not respond to requests for comment. There was no immediate response from Huarong, either. 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) told a media briefing that mainland asset management firms were operating normally and their indicators were stable.
Huarong's troubles began in 2018 after then-chairman Lai was targeted in an anti-corruption investigation, and found guilty by local courts in the country's biggest financial corruption case since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
Since his fall, Huarong has been under an asset restructuring plan to clean up the massive pile of distressed debt amassed through investments under Lai's tenure.
As of mid-2020, Huarong had 160 billion yuan in net assets, and more than 30 billion yuan in loan-loss provisions.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, helped by strong earnings from German auto giant  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) as well as rising sentiment over a global economic recovery. 
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, climbing to a record high, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5%, climbing to a new 52-week high, while the blue chip Euro Stoxx 50 rose 0.3% to an all-time high.
Stock markets around the globe, with Europe being no exception, have climbed to record levels of late on expectations that the global vaccination program coupled with hefty stimulus packages, especially in the U.S., will unleash pent up demand.
Evidence of this emerged in the U.S. Thursday, as retail sales surged 9.8% in March, easily outstripping consensus expectations. This was backed up earlier Friday as China's economy posted growth of over 18% on the year, although the quarterly growth dynamic slowed modestly.
Adding to the enthusiasm Friday has been strong corporate news in Europe, led by the auto sector.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) stock gained 2.1% as the German car and truck maker reported higher vehicle prices and solid demand in China, helped by a strong performance from its Mercedes Benz cars, resulting in a surge in quarterly operating profit. 
European car registrations jumped in March, rising over 63% year-on-year, industry data showed on Friday, as the sector recovered from the damage a year ago when coronavirus lockdowns devastated sales. EU sales, which exclude the U.K., rose an even stronger 87%.
Elsewhere, HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) stock rose 4.8% after the meal kit delivery company announced strong first-quarter preliminary results and lifted its 2021 outlook, as customers cooked more at home during the pandemic.
On the flip side, L’Oreal (PA:OREP) stock fell 1.6% despite the French cosmetics group posting a further pickup in sales in the first quarter. The luxury sector has posted strong gains of late amid expectations customers will return with a bang as the global economy reopens.
On the economic data slate, final euro area inflation figures for March are due later in the session, but are unlikely to have an immediate impact on the thinking at the European Central Bank given their current subdued level.
Oil prices climbed to one-month highs Friday, helped by an improved oil demand outlook on the back of strong economic recoveries in China and the United States, the two largest consumers of oil in the world.
Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency have this week upgraded their forecasts for world oil demand growth this year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $63.70 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $67.22, both contracts on course for around 7% gains this week.

855,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 02:27AM ET</span>","Europe Car Sales Surge 63% in March, Erasing Early-Year Decline","(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s auto sales soared last month from a depressed level a year ago, making up for a dismal start to the year even as virus-related restrictions persisted in key markets.
New car-registrations rose 63% in March, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Friday. The gains erased an early-year decline to leave sales up 0.9% for the quarter.
While automakers are benefiting from easy comparisons to a year ago, when countries were locking down to contain the spread of Covid-19, last month’s sales stack up well even relative to pre-pandemic. The 1.39 million vehicles registered was the highest since June 2019.
The figures are a welcome development for the industry after months of Europe’s car market lagging behind the recoveries seen in China and the U.S. Carmakers’ concerns have shifted dramatically from demand to supply issues, with the global chip shortage hampering production for the likes of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Stellantis NV and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY).
“Only the critical global supply situation for various semiconductor categories currently has a limiting effect on this upswing,” VW Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said at the Hannover Messe trade fair Thursday.
March tends to be a seasonally strong time of year for Europe’s auto industry, so registrations were still about 13% below what the industry averaged for the month in the decade before the pandemic, according to the ACEA.
While Italy -- the epicenter of Europe’s initial virus outbreak -- saw sales rise almost 500% last month, they remained 12% below 2019 levels as virus-related measures curb economic activity.
Carmakers have been coping with restrictions by moving sales processes online and taking advantage of government subsidies for electric vehicles. Economic forecasters have said the continent’s growth prospects rest on a vaccination program that started slowly but has begun to accelerate.
Among Europe’s five largest markets, sales rose 29% and 21% in Italy and France in the first quarter. Registrations fell 15% in Spain, 12% in the U.K. and 6.4% in Germany.
The industry witnessed historic consolidation during the quarter, with France’s PSA Group merging with Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis. About 47% of vehicles registered in the first three months of the year were VW or Stellantis models.

The airline had previously said rules that took effect on Feb. 20 and required most crew to quarantine for two weeks in hotels before returning to normal life in Hong Kong would increase cash burn by about HK$300 million to HK$400 million ($38.62 million-$51.49 million) per month, on top of the regular HK$1 billion to HK$1.5 billion levels.
""Just this week, the government announced that it would lift the mandatory quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated Hong Kong-based aircrew on freighters and cargo-only passenger flights from today,"" Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said. 
""This will have a positive impact on our cargo business while also progressively reducing our monthly operating cash burn.""
It did not say by how much its cash burn would fall or by how much its freight capacity will rise. Shares were up 1.1% in trading before the announcement made during the Hong Kong market's lunch break.
The airline said there had been zero positive COVID-19 tests this year among the more than 18,500 tests its operating Hong Kong-based crew had taken in the days following their arrival in Hong Kong.
Cathay carried just 18,539 passengers in March, having cut capacity by 47% from February due to the crew quarantine rules.
However, Lam said the Hong Kong government's stated intention of lifting the mandatory quarantine period for travellers from mainland China and reducing it for those arriving from low- and 
medium-risk places was a positive step in the right direction. 
Cathay reported a record cargo load factor of 86.4% in March, though freight carriage fell by 29.6% from a year earlier.
Nearly 60% of Cathay's 2020 revenue of HK$47.9 billion was from its cargo operations, up from about 20% in 2019.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) on Friday declined to rule out buying the local consumer finance and credit card operations of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), which unveiled plans to exit some businesses in Asia and Europe overnight.
Citi, the fifth-largest provider of credit cards in Australia behind NAB and the country's other three major lenders, on Thursday said it would exit retail banking in Australia, Korea and 11 other markets across Asia and Europe.
Facing questions at a parliamentary committee about the high concentration of Australia's banking system and whether NAB would be interested in a deal with Citi, NAB Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan declined to rule out or comment on any specific transaction.
""Our strategy today is to grow through our own activities but you know, every business, be it a bank or anybody else would look at areas that might add to the customer services and make it more efficient,"" he said. 
The questioning follows NAB's agreement in January to purchase Australia's largest digital-only retail lender, 86 400, for A$220 million ($170.1 million). 
NAB is Australia's third-largest lender by assets, putting it among the so-called Big Four banks that dominate most commercial banking products including home loans, credit cards and business finance. 
NAB, Commonwealth Bank,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group account for over 75% of the county's A$2.85 trillion in banking assets, official data shows. 
Accounting for 3.5% of its global consumer finance business, Citi had $9.3 billion in loans in Australia, a figure that had shrunk 12% in the past year, it said on Thursday.
The U.S. lender had already received approaches from a number of unnamed parties to buy the Australian unit, which operates credit cards, mortgages, and wealth management, Citi said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Friday morning, as investors digested the latest economic data from both the U.S. and China.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.24% by 11:10 PM ET (3:10 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.35%. Economic data released earlier in the day was also mixed, with the GDP for the first quarter growing 18.3% and 0.6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter respectively in March. Both figures were lower than forecasted, with economic growth soaring from a year earlier but slowing down quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, industrial production grew 14.1% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.07%. The city’s government said on Thursday that it would open its COVID-19 vaccination program to those aged between 16 and 29, with registration to commence in the following week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.16%, even as an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the country could lead to the cancellation of the Tokyo Olympics, now less than 100 days away.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.05% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.35%.
Investors also continued to digest Thursday’s better-than-expected U.S. economic data, including retail sales and initial jobless claims.
""The U.S. economic data released yesterday was strong, confirming the U.S. economy is firmly on a recovery track,"" Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities chief investment strategist Norihiro Fujito told Reuters.
A slide in bond yields including those from the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, overshadowed better-than-expected revenues from  Citigroup  Inc. (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC).
However, Treasuries climbed despite the better-than-expected U.S. data. There were suggestions that foreign buying and geopolitical risks, such as the U.S. slapping sanctions on Russia on Thursday, could have contributed to Treasuries’ gains and thus positioned investors for further weakness.
Equities hit a record high for the week thanks to a rebound in global economic growth, an upbeat start to the corporate earnings season and continued confidence that central banks, including the Federal Reserve, will continue their policy support.
However, some investors warned of the persistent risks highlighted in the government bond rally, as some countries face new waves of COVID-19 cases in addition to setbacks in their COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
The bond market’s surge is currently “one of the more confusing dynamics in markets”,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors investment strategist Michael Arone told Bloomberg.
“Part of it is that you saw the 10-year make a very rapid move over a very short period of time, so this could be a pause before it starts to move higher again.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will present a united front on Taiwan, China's most sensitive territorial issue, in a summit meeting on Friday, according to a senior U.S. administration official.
Biden and Suga are expected to agree on a joint statement on the Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled island at Biden's first in-person meeting with a foreign leader, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Biden and Suga will also discuss Beijing's treatment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and its influence over Hong Kong, while announcing a $2 billion Japanese investment in 5G telecommunications to counter China's Huawei Technologies.
""You've seen a series of statements out of both the United States and Japan on the cross-strait circumstances on Taiwan, on our desire for the maintenance of peace and stability, on preserving the status quo, and I expect that you will see both a formal statement and consultations on these matters,"" the senior administration official told reporters.
The last time U.S and Japanese leaders referred to Taiwan in a joint statement was in 1969, when Japan's prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the ""Taiwan area"" was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalized ties with Beijing.
The move now aims to ratchet up pressure on China. However, such a statement appears likely to fall short of what the United States has been hoping to see from Suga, who inherited a China policy that sought to balance security concerns with deep economic ties when he took over as premier last September.
In a statement after a March meeting of U.S.-Japan defense and foreign ministers, the two sides ""underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" and shared ""serious concerns"" about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
The U.S. official said the summit statement would follow on ""nicely"" from that, and that both countries, while not wanting to raise tensions or provoke China, sought to send a clear signal that Beijing's dispatch of warplanes into Taiwan's airspace was incompatible with peace and stability.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen told emissaries visiting at Biden's request on Thursday that the island would work with the United States to deter threats from Chinese military activities.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES
A Japanese foreign ministry official said this week it had not been decided whether there would be a joint statement, and two Japanese ruling party lawmakers familiar with the discussions said officials have been divided over whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan.
The U.S. official said Washington expected ""each of our countries has slightly different perspectives"" and would not ""insist on Japan somehow signing on to every dimension of our approach.""
""We also recognize the deep economic and commercial ties between Japan and China and Prime Minister Suga wants to walk a careful course, and we respect that,"" he added.
With his first in-person summit with Suga and another planned with South Korea's leader in May, Biden is working to focus U.S. military and diplomatic resources to the Indo-Pacific and managing China’s rising global power, which Biden sees as the critical foreign policy issue of the era.
""The big issues that are playing out are playing out in the western Pacific, and Afghanistan was really receiving a disproportionate amount of time and focus and attention to the senior-most leadership,"" said the U.S. official, after Biden announced plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Sept. 11.
UNITED QUAD 
Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan, known as the Quad, plus South Korea, to counter both China and a longtime foe, North Korea. Biden and Suga are expected to announce plans for the next Quad meeting on Friday, the official said.
Presenting a united front will require a delicate balancing act given Japan and South Korea's economic ties with China and the frosty relations between Seoul and Tokyo.
""It is concerning to us, even to the point of being painful, for us to see relations between Japan and South Korea fall to the current level,"" the U.S. official said.

""The political tensions are such that we believe it actually impedes all of our abilities to be effective in Northeast Asia, and I think the president will want to discuss this in some detail with Prime Minister Suga.""
Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have frayed over issues connected to Japan's 1910-45 colonization of Korea, including that of Korean women forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Over 400 financial firms in Britain have shifted activities, staff and a combined trillion pounds ($1.4 trillion) in assets to hubs in the European Union due to Brexit, with more pain to come, a study from New Financial think tank said on Friday.
""We think it is an underestimate and we expect the numbers to increase over time: we are only at the end of the beginning of Brexit,"" the study said.
The EU has offered Britain little in the way of direct market access for financial services, which were not included in the bloc's trade deal with the United Kingdom from January.
""That access is unlikely to be forthcoming, so it is perhaps better for the industry to take the damage from Brexit on the chin and focus instead on recalibrating the framework in the UK so that it is more tailored to the unique nature of the UK financial services industry,"" the study said.
Some 7,400 jobs have moved from Britain or been created at new hubs in the EU, the study said. Bankers have told Reuters that some staff moves have been delayed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.
The total of 440 relocations is higher than anticipated and well above the 269 in New Financial's 2019 survey. New Financial believes the real number is well over 500. 
New Financial Graphic 1: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkbzdopm/New%20Financial%20Graphic%201.PNG
DUBLIN WINNER
Dublin has emerged as the biggest beneficiary with 135 relocations, followed by Paris with 102, Luxembourg 95, Frankfurt 63, and Amsterdam 48.
""This redistribution of activity across the EU has wound the clock back by about 20 years,"" the study said. 
Banks have moved or are moving over 900 billion pounds in assets from Britain to the EU, while insurers and asset managers have transferred over 100 billion pounds in assets and funds, reducing the UK tax base.
""We expect Frankfurt will be the 'winner' in terms of assets in the longer-term, and that Paris will ultimately be the biggest beneficiary in terms of jobs,"" the study said.
Amsterdam toppling London as Europe's biggest share trading centre since January has been the most visible sign of Brexit in finance.
The study expects that 300 to 500 smaller EU financial firms may open a permanent office in Britain, far fewer than the prevailing forecasts of around 1,000.
The City of London will remain the dominant financial centre in Europe for the foreseeable future, but its influence will be chipped away, risking a reduction in Britain's 26 billion pounds annual trade surplus in financial services with the EU, the study added.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investor David Einhorn said on Thursday that prominent venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya and entrepreneur Elon Musk threw ""jet fuel"" on the  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy in January when the video retailer's shares rose by 2,000% and later prompted a hearing in U.S. Congress.
Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, also said U.S. lawmakers seeking answers to how day traders were able to wrest control of GameStop's share price from established hedge funds should probe regulators instead of investors.
Amateur investors organized on social media sites such as Reddit staged a stubborn buying spree three months ago, winning out over Wall Street hedge funds that had shorted GameStop's shares or bet that the price would fall.
The wild price swings caused heavy losses for hedge fund Melvin Capital, among others. U.S. lawmakers reacted by organizing a U.S. House of Representatives hearing in February where they quizzed hedge funds, a day trader and the chief of the online trading app Robinhood.
Einhorn on Thursday blamed Palihapitiya and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's CEO, Musk, for throwing what he called ""jet fuel on the GME squeeze."" His comments appeared in a quarterly letter to Greenlight Capital investors which was seen by Reuters.
Representatives for Palihapitiya and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Einhorn said it is appropriate for investors to discuss stocks.
""Investors discussing why they think GameStop (or any other stock) should go up or down ought to be encouraged,"" he wrote. ""There is no reason to drag anyone before Congress for making a stock pick.""
Einhorn said Palihapitiya, who appeared on TV in late January and dismissed criticism of day traders, might have been trying to harm Robinhood because it competes with fintech startup SoFi, which was backed by Palihapitiya.
And Musk, whose Tesla shares Einhorn has long bet against, waded in to the drama by tweeting ""Gamestonk!!"" and adding a link to the Reddit forum where day traders were discussing GameStop. 
""If regulators wanted Elon Musk to stop manipulating stocks, they should have done so with more than a light slap on the wrist when they accused him of manipulating Tesla's shares in 2018,"" Einhorn wrote.
Einhorn said if lawmakers wanted to understand ""why GameStop did what it did ... it would be better to call to account the absentee regulators and their philosophical backers."" 

He told investors that his Greenlight Capital Funds were essentially flat in the first quarter, inching down 0.1%, while the S&P500 index gained 6.2%

Simply put, dividends are distribution payments a company makes to share profits with its stockholders. 
When looking for dividend stocks, investors can choose from an array of dividend strategies, but one that isn't as well known to many investors is called the Dogs of the Dow. This strategy is based on selecting the highest dividend-paying stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The concept is to invest in the ten highest dividend-yielding, blue-chip stocks in the Dow at the beginning of each year.
This strategy has returned an average of 9.5% since 2000, outperforming the S&P 500's 7.5% average return.

In a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Representative Michael McCaul and Senator Tom Cotton said the rule that requires U.S. licenses to sell semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology to Huawei should apply to any Chinese company designing more advanced chips at 14-nanometers or below.
The letter, which is dated April 13 and was made public on Thursday, seeks licenses for the sale of electronic design automation (EDA) software, among other curbs on chip-related sales to Chinese companies.
The actions would ""ensure U.S. companies as well as those from partner and allied countries are not permitted to sell the communists the rope they will use to hang us all,"" the letter said.
A representative of the Commerce Department, acknowledging receipt of the letter, noted that seven Chinese supercomputing entities were placed on a trade blacklist last week.
The agency is ""continually reviewing circumstances to determine whether additional actions are warranted,"" the person said. 
The United States last year issued a rule requiring licenses for sales of semiconductors to Huawei made overseas with U.S. chip-making equipment, expanding its reach to halt exports to the company.
Huawei was added to the Commerce Department's ""entity list"" in 2019 over national security and foreign policy concerns. 
The blacklisting restricted sales to Huawei from U.S. suppliers, but did not crack down on commercially available chips made abroad. In response, the United States expanded the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign-made goods based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations, for Huawei.
This week's letter was sent after Tianjin Phytium Information Technology and six other Chinese supercomputing entities were placed on the entity list for supporting military modernization efforts.

Cotton and McCaul want to not only restrict U.S. sales to Phytium, but to require a license for any company that uses American tools to make a Phytium-designed semiconductor chip.
Anything short, they said, ""would be a half measure masquerading as a forceful action.""

866,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 05:05PM ET</span>",Reuters website goes behind paywall in new strategy,"By Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - Reuters News on Thursday unveiled a new subscription website as part of a broad initiative to court business professionals.
In addition to targeting its current global readership, the newly revamped Reuters.com https://www.reuters.com is hoping to attract professional audiences prepared to pay $34.99 per month for a deeper level of coverage and data on industry verticals that include legal, sustainable business, healthcare and autos. 
Reuters.com will remain free for a preview period, but will require users to register after five stories. It is not immediately clear when it will begin charging.
The Thomson Reuters-owned news division now joins a crowded market of major news organizations which already charge for their content.
Among them, financial news rival Bloomberg.com charges $34.99 per month before discounts, while the Wall Street Journal, which in 1996 became the first to launch a paywall, charges $38.99.
In an emailed statement, Josh London, Chief Marketing Officer, Reuters and Head of Reuters Professional, called the launch ""the largest digital transformation at Reuters in a decade.""
He added: ""Professionals need direct access to industry knowledge, data and insights from expert sources, and Reuters is pleased to offer our trusted, impartial and accurate news coverage through a premium offering.""
Reuters President Michael Friedenberg and newly appointed Editor in Chief Alessandra Galloni have said the success of the digital and events business is one of their top priorities.
Ken Doctor, a veteran media analyst and founder of local news and information company Lookout Local Inc, characterized the introduction of the paywall as ""late, but not too late,"" noting that Bloomberg only started charging for its site in 2018.
""The critical question is to a business news consumer, what added value do I get from Reuters that I don't get from Bloomberg or Dow Jones?"" he added.
Reuters generates around half of its revenue from its biggest client, financial data specialist Refinitiv. 
Refinitiv was part of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) until 2018 when a majority stake was purchased by private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) LP in a deal valuing the business at about $20 billion. It was then sold to the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) Plc in a $27 billion all-stock deal that closed this year.
Reuters also licenses text, video, pictures, data and graphics to media companies, which, in many cases, offer the content for free to consumers, as well as to tech companies and corporations. And it generates advertising revenue from the website, which attracts around 41 million unique visitors monthly.
The digital operation is one prong of its plan to court professionals that also includes live events, newsletters, channels on streaming TV services  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Plex and on audio through Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the company has said.
Toronto-headquartered Thomson Reuters invested what several former executives have estimated at $20 million less than a decade ago to rebuild the website. It pulled the plug on the plan in 2013 as it was ""far away from commercial viability or strategic success,"" former Reuters CEO Andrew Rashbass told employees in an internal memo https://www.reuters.com/article/reuters-next-idINDEE98H0F120130918 at the time. 
A Reuters spokeswoman declined to comment on the investment figure.   

The new iteration of the digital strategy includes a deeper investment in areas such as legal news, where it has added journalists and launched new products, including daily newsletters. It will also offer live streams of Reuters events to subscribers.

Thus, we expect Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) to deliver solid returns in the coming months. Read on for details.Hybrid employee organizational structures, cloud services and Internet of Things (IoT) devices used by various businesses reveal the growth potential of 5G. To expand the country’s 5G base, President Biden has proposed $50 billion funding for the U.S. semiconductor industry as part of his $2 trillion infrastructure spending proposal. This follows the President’s executive order, passed two months ago, to review the nation’s semiconductor shortage.
Various companies have begun to manufacture 5G-supported devices to capitalize on this industry tailwind, leading to a shortage of semiconductor chips worldwide. In addition, U.S.-China trade tensions are forcing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor manufacturing and design company, to build factories in both countries. Consequently, the global 5G services market size is expected to grow at a CAGR of 46.2% over the next seven years to hit $664.75 billion by 2028.
In light of these developments, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS), Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO), and Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS) are expected to generate significant revenues in this quarter. Thus, we think it could be wise to invest in these stocks now.

Given this, we think it wise to bet on small-cap companies Winnebago (WGO), La-Z-Boy (LZB), and Hibbett (HIBB) given their immense growth potential. Read on and we’ll explain.During times of economic recovery, small-cap stocks tend to outperform their large-cap counterparts. As the U.S. continues to recover from COVID-19 pandemic economic disruption at a faster-than-expected pace, small-cap companies are preparing to capitalize on the growth opportunities. Also, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have been receiving substantial government support in the form of tax deferrals and subsidies. The $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package passed by the Biden administration is expected to boost consumer spending, which should contribute to boosted sales by these companies.
Given this backdrop, the Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB) has gained 12.7% and the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (SLY) has returned 19.7% so far this year. This compares to a 10.1% rise in the large-cap focused SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
So, we believe that investors who want to invest in stocks with immense growth potential and can tolerate some market volatility should bet on Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE:WGO), La-Z-Boy Incorporated (LZB), and  Hibbett Sports , Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Congress will hold hearings next month with the chief executives of major Wall Street banks as Democratic lawmakers step up scrutiny of the role lenders have played in helping struggling Americans recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee will hear testimony from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) ,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) ,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co ,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), according to a notice from the House of Representatives committee.
The virtual hearings scheduled for May 26 and 27 could determine how much legislative and political risk the biggest banks will face through 2022, Jaret Seiberg at Cowen Washington Research Group wrote on Thursday. 
""These hearings may offer more upside than risk. A strong performance from the bank executives may discourage progressive Democrats from scheduling more hearings or from introducing adverse legislation,"" he added. 
While the industry's image in Washington has improved since the financial crisis a decade ago, Democratic lawmakers have expressed skepticism that lenders are doing all they can to help Americans and small businesses hurt by the pandemic. 
They are likely to grill the CEOs on the industry's role in the small-business Paycheck Protection Program and ask them to address concerns, flagged by several congressional reports, that lenders dished out the cash to fraudsters and discriminated against some borrowers. 
Industry officials also expect lawmakers to focus on how mortgage lenders are helping homeowners, and whether they are doing enough to prevent a foreclosure crisis. Other Democratic goals, including tackling racial injustice and climate change, are also expected to feature in the discussion. 

After the banks posted bumper profits in this year's first quarter and as President Joe Biden floats the idea of raising taxes on the wealthy, the millionaire chief executives are also likely to be grilled on whether Wall Street and its rich executives pay enough to the government.
Representatives for the banks declined to comment.

Market dynamics are such that sectors with exciting growth prospects attract competition like bees to honey, and companies with considerable resources can deploy sufficient capital to gain great traction in new markets quickly.

Khan, who teaches at Columbia Law School, is highly respected by progressive antitrust thinkers, who have risen in prominence as they push for tougher antitrust laws or tougher enforcement of existing law.
She has argued, including in a 2019 article in the Columbia Law Review, that the government should consider breaking up tech companies which both operate a dominant platform, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and participate in that market.
Khan can expect tough questions from Senator Mike Lee, who is on the Commerce Committee and is the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. When word of her coming nomination leaked last month, Lee called the reports ""deeply concerning"" and said that ""her views on antitrust enforcement are also wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law."" 
The FTC works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and investigates allegations of deceptive advertising.
Khan was on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, which wrote a massive report last year that sharply criticized the major tech companies, Amazon Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) on Thursday unveiled the electric ""sibling"" of its flagship Mercedes-Benz S-Class luxury sedan, taking the fight to market-leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in the battle for market share as electric car sales take off.
The EQS is the first in a family of Mercedes-Benz cars built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform built from the ground up. It will go on sale in Europe and the United States in August, then in China in January.
Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the European Union almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles last year, accounting for more than 10% of overall sales.
""We set the bar very high,"" with this car, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Chief Executive Ola Källenius told reporters. ""Customers in this segment expect a blend of hi-tech innovation and modern luxury... and that's what we're trying to achieve with the EQS.""
Daimler has not revealed pricing yet for the EQS, saying that will come in the summer closer to the launch date. 
In interviews and conference calls on Thursday Källenius 
avoided making any comparisons with Tesla, whose market cap of more than $700 billion dwarfs all other carmakers. 
But with a range of up to 770 kilometres (478 miles) and a new display screen that will cover almost the entire dashboard - an optional feature - analysts see an effort to seize the initiative from Tesla, which had a head start over other carmakers and boasted a longer battery range and hallmark touchscreen infotainment system.
In a client note earlier this week,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) referred to the EQS as ""Mercedes' Tesla fighter"" and said the car ""will likely set the benchmark in terms of technical features, as well as design and quality,"" for both traditional carmakers and newer entrants like Tesla.
Källenius said he expects more than 50% of customers will pay extra to get the display screen, which Mercedes-Benz unveiled in January.
At 56 inches (142 cm) the new ""Hyperscreen"" - which in width dwarfs Tesla's vaunted 17-inch screen - will also feature in Mercedes-Benz's other new electric models.
Källenius said the company would not provide forecasts for how many EQS models it aims to sell, or what sort of profit margins he expected the vehicle to generate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee formally approved a report accusing Big Tech companies of buying or crushing smaller firms, Representative David Cicilline's office said in a statement on Thursday.
With the approval during a marathon, partisan hearing, the more than 400-page staff report will become an official committee report, and the blueprint for legislation to rein in the market power of the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
The report was approved by a 24-17 vote that split along party lines. The companies have denied any wrongdoing. 
The report first released in October - the first such congressional review of the tech industry - suggested extensive changes to antitrust law and described dozens of instances where it said the companies had misused their power.
""Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook each hold monopoly power over significant sectors of our economy. This monopoly moment must end,"" Cicilline said in a statement. ""I look forward to crafting legislation that addresses the significant concerns we have raised.""
The first bill has already been introduced. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers led by Cicilline and Senator Amy Klobuchar introduced legislation in March aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.
Also in the Senate, Klobuchar introduced a broader bill in February to strengthen antitrust enforcers' ability to stop mergers by lowering the bar for stopping deals and giving them more money for legal fights.
The Cicilline report, whose origins were bipartisan, contained a menu of potential changes in antitrust law.
Republicans have criticized Big Tech companies for allegedly censoring conservative speech, pointing to Facebook's and Twitter's freezing or banning former President Donald Trump's access to the platforms.
Despite their ire, most Republicans have not backed the report's proposed changes in antitrust law but instead discussed stripping social media companies of legal protections they are accorded under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law gives companies immunity over content posted on their sites by users.

Suggested legislation in the report ranged from the aggressive, such as potentially barring companies like Amazon.com from operating the markets in which they also compete, to the less controversial, like increasing the budgets of the agencies that enforce antitrust law - the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.
The report also urged Congress to allow antitrust enforcers more leeway in stopping companies from purchasing potential rivals, something that is now difficult.

The parties have been trading barbs for weeks over the company's high turnover in its executive suite and who should be sitting on its board. 
In its latest proposal, Indaba had suggested Benefitfocus appoint Ronald Mitchell, one of the two candidates nominated by the hedge fund on March 16, to its board, and in exchange offered to withdraw its other nomination and accept settlement terms.
Benefitfocus said on Thursday Indaba had misrepresented the terms of a privately negotiated proposal, in which Mitchell would be appointed to the software firm's board under terms consistent with market standards and intended to protect the interests of all shareholders.
""Many of these terms were made necessary because of Indaba's continued refusal to allow us to vet Mr. Mitchell, or even meet or interview him, until an agreement is reached to appoint him to the board,"" Benefitfocus said in a statement.
San Francisco-based Indaba had in February called on Benefitfocus, in which it holds a roughly 9.5% stake, to sell its business following years of poor returns, sluggish stock price during booming markets, and warned shareholders would lose confidence if nothing changes.

Taylor Dart is expecting new highs in silver and gives his reasons why.It’s been a solid start to Q1 for the precious metals space, with silver up (SLV) up more than 6% for the month, erasing most of its year-to-date gain. This rally in the metal has come at the same time as we’ve finally seen sentiment begin to cool off with readings below 30% bulls, and while the Silver/Gold ratio continues to hold up very well in the face of recent weakness. Generally, a violent correction in the metals space can be differentiated as healthy or dangerous based on how this simple ratio is acting. Given its recent strength, the odds suggest the pullback has merely been a shakeout, and new highs could be on deck before year-end. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
As shown in the chart above, the silver/gold ratio has had a tremendous year, continuing to make higher lows and making new highs in January. This powerful uptrend in this ratio with minimal giveback is a very healthy sign for the precious metals sector because it’s very rare that we see a new bear market in the metals complex while silver is leading. Instead, when a new bear market is on the horizon, silver typically breaks down and starts to underperform gold in an obvious manner.

The projects, which the state Public Service Commission said represent an $800 million investment, would maintain and improve reliability and allow several fossil fuel-fired power plants to retire.
The projects include transmission from New York neighborhoods Rainey to Corona, Gowanus to Greenwood and Goethals to Greenwood. Con Edison is a unit of New York energy company Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED).
""It is clear that New York State is in the middle of a fundamental change in the generation and delivery of electricity,” Commission Chair John Howard said in a statement. “Priority has shifted to ensuring renewable, clean sources are integrated into the grid while polluting sources are being phased out.""
The commission said work will commence immediately, with the first project, known as Rainey, operational by the start of summer 2023 and the Gowanus and Goethals projects operational by the start of summer 2025.
The commission said it will evaluate the allocation and sharing of these projects’ costs in the future because the transmission will provide climate benefits statewide.
The commission said the projects are needed for reliability in 2023 and 2025 and to address deficiencies in two of Con Edison’s transmission load areas because of the retirement or unavailability of older peaking power plants.

The plants being retired include Con Edison's 17.1-megawatt (MW) 59th Street GT1 and 74th Street gas turbine units 1 and 2 (37 MW) in Manhattan, Con Edison’s Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Ave unit 5 (16.3 MW) in Brooklyn, the Helix Ravenswood units 1, 10 and 11 (68.6 MW) in Queens,  NRG Energy Inc  (NYSE:NRG)'s Astoria gas turbines (240 MW) in Queens and NRG's Arthur Kill GT1 unit (20 MW) in Staten Island.

Investing.com – Hershey (NYSE:HSY) shares rose 1.6% in trading Thursday, buoyed with a buy rating from Goldman Sachs.
Goldman (NYSE:GS) analyst Jason English upgraded Hershey to buy and raised the target by $10, to $181. The new price forecast is about 12% higher than the stock’s current price.
According to English, the performance in 2020 was not a one-off and the pandemic’s impact was “only a modest positive.""
He believes 2020 was the start of outsized growth that should last three years as the confection industry leverages its pricing power to expand profitability at a time when input costs are not daunting.
“Mars appears to be leading the charge, presumably as it prioritizes pet and veterinarian verticals for growth. We expect Hershey to follow over time, continuing the long-standing industry practice of unified price moves,” the analyst wrote in the note.
Hershey’s consolidated net sales in 2020 rose 2% year-on-year to $8.14 billion. Net income was $1.27 billion, or $6.11 per share, an increase of 11.9%.
For 2021, the company expects performance to be in line with its long-term growth algorithm of 2% to 4% net sales growth and 6% to 8% earnings per share growth."

(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) on Thursday raised its 2021 adjusted profit target, as tight control on medical costs helped the largest U.S. health insurer handily beat first-quarter profit estimates, sending shares up more than 4%.
The industry bellwether's results lifted shares of rivals. Anthem Inc was up 3%,  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) up 1% and  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) up 3%. 
Health insurer medical costs have been fluctuating since the coronavirus outbreak as dollars saved on patients delaying care and procedures early in the pandemic was later offset by higher expenses related to testing, treatment and vaccination against COVID-19.
Graphic: UnitedHealth's medical costs trend below estimates during pandemic https://graphics.reuters.com/UNITEDHEALTH-RESULTS/azgvoxnrypd/chart.png
UnitedHealth benefited from a decline in COVID-19 costs during the latter half of the first quarter after a wave of infections and hospitalizations waned.
""To put this in perspective, February and March showed COVID-related care at about half the level experienced in January,"" Chief Financial Officer John Rex said during a post-earnings call. 
In April, the company began to see another rise in COVID-19 related care, though not yet approaching January levels, he added. 
UnitedHealth's medical loss ratio - the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services - was 80.9% for the quarter ended March 31, lower than the 82.9% consensus forecast by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
UnitedHealth's first quarterly earnings since new Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty took the reins in February will reset Wall Street expectations for all health insurers this quarter, some analysts said. 
UnitedHealth now projects 2021 adjusted earnings of $18.10 to $18.60 per share, up from its previous forecast of $17.75 to $18.25. 
The company said it expects to record a majority of its previously forecast $1.80 per share hit from COVID-19 costs in the back half of the year. 

Health insurers across the board will still likely remain relatively conservative around their expectations for how healthcare activity could play out over the rest of the year, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said.

902,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>","Vintage Wine Estates SPAC Comes With Discounts, VIP Treatment","By Christiana SciaudoneInvesting.com -- SPACs have been getting a lot of flack lately, but, if nothing else, this one comes with a discount on wine. 
Vintage Wine Estates, also known as VWE, is poised to close a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition corp.  Bespoke Capital Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:BSPE) in an almost $700 million deal. And for those willing to bet on the business, it's offering a passport for shareholders who will get discounts on purchases, as well as VIP treatment at its 14 estate wineries. Not a bad deal for the oenophiles among us.
The 20-year-old U.S. winemaker is an aggressive acquirer, having closed more than 20 deals in the past decade, with plans to spend some $350 million of its new funding on both new purchases and innovation. VWE, which sells more than 50 brands, largely in the above-$10 premium segment, has been profitable every year since its inception. 
""We are very different than many SPACS,"" said Paul Walsh, executive chairman of Bespoke and a former  Diageo  (LON:DGE) chief executive officer. Walsh, who spoke in a conference call alongside VWE CEO Pat Roney last week, will become non-executive chairman of the combined company. ""You've got a real management team, with a real track record selling real products for real cash, today. We're generating real cash now. You don't have to speculate what the multiple is in 2025, you can look at it today.""




The number of SPACs bringing companies to the market this year -- more than 300 -- has already surpassed last year's figure of 248, according to SPAC Research, which tracks the market. The surge has attracted the attention of regulators. 
""Concerns include risks from fees, conflicts, and sponsor compensation, from celebrity sponsorship and the potential for retail participation drawn by baseless hype, and the sheer amount of capital pouring into the SPACs, each of which is designed to hunt for a private target to take public,"" John Coates, acting director of corporation finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote in an April 8 statement.
Forward-looking information provided by SPAC targets ""can also be untested, speculative, misleading or even fraudulent,"" Coates said. 
That does not seem to be the case with VWE, which, while it has big plans, has seen average revenue exceeding 20% growth each year since 2010, the company said in a statement. 
Strong results have continued throughout the pandemic, which the company attributes to its three-pronged approach, with 33% of the business coming from B2B deals with the likes of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), 38% from traditional wholesale and 29% from direct-to-consumer, the company said in a presentation, citing data as of June 30.
""We're very well diversified, which is what allowed us to grow through the pandemic,"" Walsh said. Direct-to-consumer, in particular, has been highly successful and should continue to be.
Bespoke reviewed some 100 companies, and the maker of the Layer Cake brand operated in the most attractive segment, with 99% of their wines over $10, Walsh said. The premium and fine wine segments have demonstrated the greatest long-term growth at around 6% per year, VWE said. 
In addition, per capita consumption of wine in the U.S. is at 15.2 gallons per person versus 25 to over 50 gallons per person for France, Italy, and the U.K., leaving plenty of room for growth. And then there is a highly fragmented market of small wineries in the U.S. willing to sell.
The company will focus on acquisition opportunities within a two-hour flight of headquarters in Santa Rosa, Calif., including Oregon and Washington, and with a continued focus on the $10-and-up category. There are more than 10,000 wineries in the U.S., of which about 4,000 are independent -- and some 50% of those have indicated they might sell, the company said.
""There are a lot of wineries but a lot of them are very, very small,"" Walsh said. ""In a world where wholesalers are consolidating, retailers are consolidating, these small players are going to find it quite difficult. We offer a safe home for their treasured assets."" 
While the market might seem to be crowded with wine brands, Walsh points out that VWE is one of the largest wine companies in the U.S., and it only has a 1.5% share.
""For us to make 2-3 acquisitions per year, we're always going to have a very solid pipeline,"" CEO Roney said.  
VWE will also branch out, likely into hard cider, and low- and no-alcohol wines. A cannabis-infused beverage is waiting in the wings for federal legalization.
""We think we're off to the races,"" Walsh said.

(Reuters) -The White House said in a statement on Thursday that Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, was responsible for the SolarWinds hack, which led to the compromise of nine federal agencies and hundreds of private sector companies. 
Senior U.S. government officials had already said the Russian government was responsible for the sprawling cyber attack, but Thursday's announcement offers the first formal statement pinning the operation on a specific agency. 
The White House statement was paired with a series of sanctions against five Russian cybersecurity firms, which the Treasury Department said had been involved in supporting Russian cyber operations. 
While some national security experts say the SolarWinds hacking operation could be viewed as a traditional espionage activity that is not uncommon between government hackers, the Treasury Department in its statement said the ""scope and scale of this compromise combined with Russia’s history of carrying out reckless and disruptive cyber operations makes it a national security concern."" 
The National Security Agency, FBI and Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency also revealed on Thursday that the SVR was exploiting five known computer software vulnerabilities. 

The announcement came with links to a series of related software patches by the companies who make those products, including VMware (NYSE:VMW) and  Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT). 
""The vulnerabilities in today's release are part of the SVR's toolkit to target networks across the government and private sectors. We need to make SVR's job harder by taking them away,"" Rob Joyce, NSA director of cybersecurity, said.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>","Bank of America management offers optimistic outlook on economy, reserves","By Noor Zainab Hussain and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) squeaked by Wall Street's first-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, as its capital-markets business posted gains from recent volatility while a handful of special items weighed on results.
Like other major U.S. banks, Bank of America benefited from an improvement in the economic outlook that allowed it to reduce the amount of money it sets aside for potential loan losses. The rollout of vaccines to combat the coronavirus pandemic, combined with government stimulus efforts, have helped the financial industry not just survive but thrive.
That allowed Bank of America to release $2.7 billion from its reserves against loan losses, which boosted the bottom line. It also outlined some $800 million in unusual costs related to compensation, real estate and taxes.
Analysts and investors typically ignore all of those items to look at what ""core"" earnings are. On that basis, Bank of America's profit was just in line or slightly above what they were expecting, analysts said.
Although the results were messy, management offered an optimistic view for future profits as the economy peeks out from under pandemic stress.
""We see an accelerating recovery,"" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on a call with analysts.
Bank of America expects to continue releasing reserves as the economy improves this year, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said. That is based on a view that U.S. economic output will return to pre-pandemic levels and employment levels will improve, Donofrio said.
In addition to results, Bank of America announced a $25-billion share repurchase program – its first since the Federal Reserve lifted limits on buybacks and dividends due to the pandemic.
Shares of the second-largest U.S. bank fell 0.9% in early trading.
Gains in trading and underwriting primarily drove Bank of America's profits last quarter. Although its consumer banking posted big profit gains from reserve releases, its revenue was down because of low interest rates and slacking loan demand.
Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) posted similar trends this week.
Overall, Bank of America reported $7.6 billion, or 86 cents per share, in profits for the first quarter, more than double the $3.5 billion, or 40 cents per share in the year-ago period.
Excluding reserve releases and unusual costs, the figure was more like 67 cents for the most recent period, according to Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski.
Analysts had been expecting 66 cents per share, on average, according to Refinitiv.
Consumer banking, Bank of America's largest business, posted a 49% profit increase because of reserve releases, but revenue fell because of lower interest rates and loan balances.
Its global banking unit, which caters to institutions rather than individuals, benefited from higher investment banking fees. But it also reported odd charges and benefits that made its results murky.
Global markets generated a 39% adjusted profit rise, helped by gains across fixed income and equities trading, as well as underwriting fees. Its adjusted revenue also rose.
Bank of America's wealth management unit posted smaller gains, remaining a stable source of revenue and profit. 

""The results appear mostly positive,"" UBS analyst Saul Martinez said.

Investing.com -- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped almost 5% as two analysts threw their support behind the company, with one dumping on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Raymond James see strong sales ahead, with the latter pushing Nvidia to a strong buy from an outperform. Intel, on the other hand, has a bumpy road ahead, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said in a note, downgrading shares to underperform from market perform. Intel rose 0.6%.
Chips are in massive demand amid a global shortage, pushing prices up and delaying production of items requiring electronic components, from iPhones to automobiles. That's pushed chip stocks like Nvidia and Intel to record and near-record levels, respectively. But not all companies are equal. 
""In the short term, we think results will be more dependent on supply than demand given widespread shortages,"" Caso wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""In addition, we think improvement in enterprise, driven by a return to the office as well as the A10 launch, could drive better Datacenter growth in 2H, which is important for the stock.""
""Our longer-term conviction is driven by the fact that NVDA has more shots on goal than anyone else in our coverage,"" Caso wrote. 
Meanwhile, JPMorgan reiterated an overweight rating on Nvidia, largely on automobile opportunities. ""We believe that a significant part of NVIDIA’s overall success ($8B automotive revenue pipeline that will be unlocked over the next 6 years, with inflection starting in 2023/2024) is the company’s realization that leadership is driven by a combination of having the proper ecosystem (silicon, hardware, systems and software) and fostering strong industry relationships/partnerships,"" analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""The team has replicated this model across its core gaming and HPC and is driving a similar leadership profile in automotive."" 
Intel, however, isn't looking so good. 
""Our underperform rating reflects not just the risk that Intel won’t reach that goal, but also the pain they will likely endure in pursuit of that goal in terms of capex, lost market share, and a shifting landscape in datacenter that will make the industry less dependent on Intel,"" Caso said.
The analyst is also concerned about Intel's high dependence on the PC market, and a need to ramp up investments, which investors will have to pay for.
Both companies have met or beat earnings results over the past four quarters, with Intel reporting profit of $1.52 for the most recent period. Nvidia said its earnings per share came in at $3.10.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose more than 2% Thursday following a UBS (NYSE:UBS) survey that showed the iPhone maker’s product line remained resilient while also forecasting robust demand for its newer models.
The bank has a $142 price target Apple shares, which is nearly 6% higher than the current price.
UBS analyst David Vogt shared the data covering around 4,000 iPhone users across four geographies. The aim of the survey was to get a better understanding of the iPhone installed base and consumer involvement with different services offered by the company.
The survey said replacement cycle shortened slightly to 2.1 years from 2.2 last year, mainly led by consumers in China opting for 5G services.
Roughly one-third of the phones carry a costlier tag of $999 and above while 20% still have an iPhone 7 or an even older phone. Thus suggests a potential market comprising 80% of users going for an upgraded iPhone.
In another development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) on Thursday reported a net profit of $4.98 billion, beating analysts’ expectations. TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple and its numbers serve as sort of a barometer for demand for iPhones.

Both have been methodically expanding their product offerings and growing their digital presence. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) and PriceSmart, Inc. (PSMT) are two of the largest warehouse club operators in the United States. COST provides branded and private-label products, dry and packaged foods, and groceries, as well as apparel and small appliances. PSMT offers private label consumer products and provides other services, ranging from optical to automobile tires, to businesses and individuals.
While the pandemic-driven global recession affected brick-and-mortar retail stores deeply, businesses that have been able to meet the challenge by modifying their business models are emerging stronger. Furthermore, the mass vaccine rollout should improve the retail sales landscape markedly this year. This, along with the federal government’s new, jumbo recovery package, should boost consumer spending on products offered by warehouse companies like COST and PSMT.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s first-quarter profit beat Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as a continued rally in global financial markets and broad-based strength in the asset manager's businesses helped vault the firm's assets under management to a record $9.01 trillion.
""The broadness of our platform is really resonating with clients,"" BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, said in an interview.
Clients, who a few years ago came to BlackRock mainly for its index and fixed income actives business, are now looking to the firm for a range of needs including investing in alternatives, active equities, risk management and technology, Fink said.
The firm reported a record $172 billion in net inflows to its various funds during the quarter with strength in its iShares and alternative assets businesses.
""They are definitely widening the competitive gap against peers and they continue to take wallet share,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.
BlackRock's net income rose to $1.2 billion, or $7.77 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $1.03 billion, or $6.60 per share, a year earlier. The reading was above the Refinitiv IBES estimate of $7.64 per share.
Global financial markets, equities in particular, trended higher in the first quarter, building on sharp gains of the prior two quarters, as accommodative global central bank policy and improving growth prospects helped lift investors' risk appetite.
BlackRock's Fink, in a CNBC interview on Thursday, voiced optimism about financial markets as the economy continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
The S&P 500 Index rose 3.8% in the first quarter, its fifth straight quarterly gain. The index hit a new closing high on Wednesday.
""While all asset managers will benefit from rising equity markets this quarter, we believe BlackRock's ability to deliver outsized flow growth remains a key differentiator,"" Edward Jones' Sanders said.
BlackRock logged solid organic base fee growth of 14%, led by strength in active equities.
Revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which makes up most of BlackRock's earnings, rose to $3.47 billion in the quarter, from $2.9 billion a year earlier.
""Overall I thought it was a decent quarter with above peer metrics,"" CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said.
BlackRock's shares, which hit a record high on Wednesday ahead of the results, have risen 11% this year, compared with a 17% gain for a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States. 

BlackRock's shares were up about 1% in trading before the bell on Thursday.

Investing.com –  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) shares rose 2% on Thursday after the bank said it would sell its consumer banking operations in 13 countries to focus on its higher-margin wealth management business.
“As a result of the ongoing refresh of our strategy, we have decided that we are going to double down on wealth,” CEO Jane Fraser said.
“While the other 13 markets have excellent businesses, we don’t have the scale we need to compete.”
Citigroup will exit consumer businesses in Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The bank’s institutional client business in those countries will not be affected.
The remaining consumer and wealth management businesses will be run out of centers in Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and London.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at new record highs on Thursday, fueled by stronger-than-expected retail sales and jobless claims numbers.
Initial jobless claims fell to their lowest since the pandemic began, in a sign that the pace of layoffs, which remained disconcertingly high through the first quarter of this year, is finally beginning to slow down. Retail sales for March, meanwhile, surged nearly 10%, well above expectations, leaving spending on almost all categories of goods above where it was before the world first heard of Covid-19. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen to a new record high of 33,951 points, up 220 points on the day, or 0.7%. The S&P 500 was likewise at a new record high, with a gain of 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1%.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that ""a correction in retail sales after April seems likely,"" as spending patterns switch back increasingly to their pre-Covid status, ""but attention then will switch to spending on non-retail services, which will rocket as the economy reopens fully.""
Among the early movers, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 2.8%, still finding support after reports indicated that Cathie Wood's ARK Investment company bought some $250 million of the stock on its debut Wednesday for its suite of ETFs.  By contrast, battery maker Quantumscape (NYSE:QS) stock fell 6.3% to a 2021 low after short-seller Scorpion Research published a report on the company, accusing it of being a ""a pump and dump SPAC scam By Silicon Valley  celebrities that makes Theranos look like amateurs."" There was no immediate response from the company.
Activists of a different sort were at work on GlaxoSmithKline ADRs (NYSE:GSK), after the Financial Times reported that Paul Singer's Elliott Management is accumulating a stake in the underperforming pharmaceuticals and consumer health giant. The ADRs rose 5.1% to their highest in nearly three months.
Dell  (NYSE:DELL) stock rose 5.4% and VMware (NYSE:VMW) stock rose 0.9% after the PC maker unveiled plans to spin off its stake in the latter, using the proceeds of a special dividend from VMWare to pay down its $52 billion in debt.
Chipmakers were broadly higher again after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) warned overnight that the global chip shortage is likely to drag on into 2022. TSM stock was down 2.1%, despite raising its guidance due to the prolonged imbalance of supply and demand in its core area. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained 3.8%, helped by an upgrade from Raymond James, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 2.2%.
Elsewhere, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 3.4% on disappointment that it didn't move up estimates of when it will turn profitable again. The airline still says the third quarter is its target. Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) also fell after releasing their first-quarter earnings, which hinted at the same underlying weakness in loan demand that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s numbers had done on Wednesday. Not even a $25 billion stock buyback program was enough to stop BofA's stock falling 4.0%."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is concerned that time is running out for the United States to remove tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump on steel and aluminium, a senior EU trade official said on Thursday.
Citing U.S. national security grounds the Trump administration in 2018 imposed tariffs of 25% on EU steel and 10% on aluminium - measures that steelmakers such as Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Voestalpine have said they were affected by. 
The EU denied its exports pose any security threat and responded by placing its own tariffs on 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of U.S. products, including motorbikes, whisky and orange juice.
""I'm very worried that we are running out of time,"" said Sabine Weyand, director-general of the trade section of the European Commission. ""We had suggested and are suggesting still that we would also suspend tariffs for a period of six months to give us time to sort out the issues."" 
The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said the U.S. tariffs affect 6.4 billion euros of EU metal exports. It said in 2018 it would ""rebalance"" the remaining 3.6 billion euros after three years, or after a finding in its favour by the World Trade Organization.
Those three years expire in June and its challenge at the WTO is ongoing.
""What I'm worried about is that we are on an automatic track to have the second tranche of our rebalancing measures come into force on June 1,"" Weyand told an online conference organised by the European Policy Centre
She said a solution needed to be found before then, which had to put the two sides on a path to addressing the root cause of the problems, which is Chinese overcapacity.
The United States and the EU suspended tariffs for four months from March in another trade dispute, over subsidies provided to planemakers Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.

The carrier still sees a path to profitability by late summer after deep losses from the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in an earnings statement Thursday. A “surge” in demand already helped Delta stop burning cash in March, he said, a sign of improvement after a first quarter in which the company posted a bigger-than-expected loss.
“Travelers are gaining confidence and beginning to reclaim their lives,” Bastian said.
The steady outlook, which Delta debuted in January, bolsters indications of a broad recovery in air travel as worry about the spread of Covid-19 wanes. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. have said their planes are flying with an average 80% of seats filled, and Delta is among carriers that have begun to recall workers from temporary leave as demand increases.
Delta was little changed at $48.11 ahead of regular trading in New York. The shares rose 20% this year through Wednesday, the worst among the five largest U.S. airlines. Delta is the first major U.S. carriers to report first-quarter earnings.
The Atlanta-based airline posted an adjusted loss of $3.55 a share in the first quarter, worse than the $3.17 average deficit of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue, excluding sales from a Delta-owned refinery, tumbled 65% to $3.6 billion.
Delta generated positive cash flow of $4 million a day in March. The company maintained its forecast to break even on a cash-flow basis this quarter.
While leisure trips are leading the recovery, even long idle domestic business travel has picked up to about 20% of previous levels, Bastian said in an interview.
Large corporate customers are linking vaccination rates to a decision to fly again in a trend that will likely start this summer and build to a “meaningful improvement” by fall, he said. The return of international business passengers “is a little bit longer tail.”

The announcement comes a week after peer TuSimple revealed plans for an initial public offering (IPO), at a time when self-drive technology is yet to be commercialised.
""We are focused on our path to commercialization right now but the IPOs happening in the space right now are a great indication of the strength of the industry and the opportunity self-driving presents,"" a Cruise spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has created a $200 million fund to invest in timber-producing forest properties that will be managed to help remove carbon from the atmosphere while also generating a profit, it said on Thursday. 
Apple last year set out a goal to neutralize its own carbon emissions and those of its suppliers by 2030. It said 75% of the reduction would come from eliminating emissions through steps such as the use of solar energy and the remaining 25% would come from carbon removal efforts.
Apple and nonprofit Conservation International will be limited partners in the $200 million ""Restore Fund,"" as it is called, and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) will act as a general partner to manage it. Apple confirmed that it will be the biggest investor in the fund.
The fund will aim to generate a profit by investing in forest properties that will be managed to both produce commercial timber and boost carbon removal, with the goal of removing about 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.
""Our idea here is that if you can show it's profitable, and doing what we need to do in terms of climate risk reduction, then you can scale up investments in forest restoration and management, which is what's really needed,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told Reuters in an interview.
To help decide which projects to invest in and craft its carbon accounting standards, Apple said it will work with outside standards groups such as the Forest Stewardship Council and Verra, among others.
Jackson declined to say what the target returns for the fund would be, but said they will likely take into account current returns on financial investments in forests as a means of demonstrating that carbon removal can be profitable.

""Working forests do make money, because they produce products our economy needs,"" Jackson said. ""And so there's an opportunity here, just like with clean energy, to show there's a sustainable economy model that matches the sustainability of the forests. The opportunity here is for Apple to bring our rigor and, frankly, our work in carbon quantification to the problem.""

922,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Biden to bar U.S. banks from buying Russian government rouble debt in primary markets,"(Corrects headline to show ban applies to participating in primary market)
By Arshad Mohammed
(Reuters) - President Joe Biden will issue an executive order on Thursday authorizing the U.S. government to sanction any sector of the Russian economy and will use it to restrict Russia's ability to issue sovereign debt to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2020 U.S. election, senior Biden administration officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Biden would bar U.S. financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds from June 14. U.S. banks have been barred from taking part in the primary market for non-rouble sovereign bonds since 2019.
The latest step is part of a wider array of sanctions the White House plans to announce on Thursday to make Russia pay a price for ""malign"" actions such as election interference, cyber-hacking, the use of chemical weapons and reports that it offered Taliban militants bounties to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
Among the sanctions to be unveiled are the blacklisting of about 30 entities as well as orders expelling about 10 Russian officials from the United States, one person familiar with the matter said.
Russia denies meddling in U.S. elections, orchestrating a cyber hack that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp to penetrate U.S. government networks, and using a nerve agent to poison Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. It has also brushed off allegations of putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.
Biden on Tuesday spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin to raise concerns about these issues and the build up of Russian forces in Crimea and along the border with Ukraine, even as he proposed a summit between the two men.
Biden appears to be trying to strike a balance between defending U.S. national interests against Russia while making clear he would prefer to have a less volatile relationship and to cooperate on issues such as curbing Iran's nuclear program.
""The American people should not be complicit in the Russian government's malign activities by directly funding the Russian state at a time when the Russian government is attempting to undermine our sovereignty and threaten our allies and partners,"" said one official, echoing the administration's desire for a ""stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia.
""We don't think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory in the relationship,"" he said. ""However ... we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian government actions that seem to harm our sovereignty.""
""Our goal here is number one to demonstrate resolve by taking an impactful step,"" he added. ""The second goal is to ... be very clear in our signaling that we have the option to escalate in a far more forceful way if we so choose, and that really will be determined by Russia's actions.""
This official said the executive order authorized the U.S. government ""to target any sector of the Russian economy,"" adding ""we will not hesitate to expand the Russian sovereign debt sanction if Russia escalates further.""
The executive order on ""Blocking Property with Respect to Specified, Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation,"" was signed by Biden on Wednesday and will be made public on Thursday morning, U.S. officials said. 
The sovereign debt action, which will specifically cite the Russian central bank, national wealth fund, and finance ministry, extends a step the United States took in 2019, when it barred U.S. financial institutions from buying non-rouble-denominated debt directly from Russia in the primary market. 
Neither move, however, affects Russian sovereign debt traded in the secondary market, meaning that U.S. persons can continue to buy and sell such bonds there.
The first U.S. official said the Russian rouble-denominated sovereign debt market was valued at about $185 billion, about a quarter of which is held by foreign investors. U.S. investors make up about half of the foreign holdings, he said.
""Judging from history, removing U.S. investors as buyers in this market will likely cause a chilling effect that raises Russia's borrowing cost, along with capital fight and a weaker currency – all of which leads to slower growth and higher inflation,"" said this official. 
Dan Fried, a retired U.S. diplomat now at the Atlantic Council think tank, described the step outlined by the U.S. officials as ""significant"" and markedly stronger than former U.S. President Donald Trump's actions.

""We are signalling that we are prepared to do even more and there are steps that would be quite a bit stronger,"" he said, citing the possibility of ""restrictions on trading in the secondary market, which would be a huge deal.""

""We are in touch with them to review the dossiers that have been submitted by both vaccine manufacturers,"" WHO-Europe vaccination expert Siddhartha Datta told a virtual press conference. ""We will be hearing about a decision on the emergency use listing in April or early May, so please keep an eye on that.""
A WHO panel in final stages of review of the Chinese vaccines has said that a decision for at least one could come on April 26, while a second meeting has been planned for May 3, should more time be needed to make a decision on both shots.
Such an emergency WHO listing is a prerequisite for purchase by the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility designed to get shots to poorer countries. It also helps guide countries with less developed regulatory systems about a vaccine's safety and efficacy.
So far, the WHO has issued emergency listings for  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, as well as versions of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India and South Korea's AstraZeneca-SKBio.
CanSino's vaccine relies on a viral vector to deliver DNA to prompt an immune response, a technique similar to that used in both AstraZeneca's and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccines now being investigated for their association with very rare blood clots combined with low platelet counts. 

CanSino has said there have been no reports of blood clots.
Sinovac's vaccine, being used in places including Hong Kong and Brazil, relies on inactivated coronaviruses to generate an immune response, a technique used for decades including against polio.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is among the worst offenders in a new ranking of companies in Latin America that sell eggs from caged chickens, part of a new list of firms from Mexico to Argentina that aims to encourage more humane supply practices.
The new corporate ranking from Mercy for Animals (MFA), a U.S.-based animal welfare group, evaluated 34 of the region's largest egg sellers on their commitments to phase out supplies from caged chickens.
Besides Walmart's Mexican unit, which also operates in Central America, others flagged for failing to make or implement cage-free commitments include supermarket chain Soriana and conglomerate Femsa, which operates Oxxo convenience stores.
All three were also criticized for lacking transparency on their egg suppliers.
Walmart de Mexico declined to comment, while Soriana and Femsa did not respond to questions.
Cramming hens into so-called battery cages where they are unable to turn around or flap their wings is standard industry practice, said MFA Executive Director Leah Garces. 
She added that hens are unable to exercise their natural instinct to perch or lay eggs in nests, and the tips of their beaks are shaved off to minimize damage from pecking. 
""It's total, extreme animal suffering that's wrapped into each egg,"" she said in an interview.
MFA's Latin America ranking, based partly on company responses to a survey, also credits big-box retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and fast-food chain McDonalds for making progress on implementing cage-free supplies.
The ranking comes nearly a decade after the European Union banned eggs produced from caged chickens citing animal cruelty, along with several U.S. states.
Mexicans eat more eggs than any other nationality, or about 23 kg (51 lb) a year, according to the International Egg Commission. 

Colombia, Argentina and Peru are also among the top 10 egg-consuming countries.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>","Big business seeks unified, market-based approaches ahead of climate summit","By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
(Reuters) -Corporate executives and investors say they want world leaders at next week's climate summit to embrace a unified and market-based approach to slashing their carbon emissions.
The request reflects the business world's growing acceptance that the world needs to sharply reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as its fear that doing so too quickly could lead governments to set heavy-handed or fragmented rules that choke international trade and hurt profits.
The United States is hoping to reclaim its leadership in combating climate change when it hosts the April 22-23 Leaders Summit on Climate. 
Key to that effort will be pledging to cut U.S. emissions by at least half by 2030, as well as securing agreements from allies to do the same.
""Climate change is a global problem, and what companies are looking to avoid is a fragmented approach where the U.S., China and the E.U. each does its own thing, and you wind up with a myriad of different methodologies,"" said Tim Adams, chief executive of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based trade association.
He said he hopes U.S. President Joe Biden and the 40 other world leaders invited to the virtual summit will move toward adopting common, private-sector solutions to reaching their climate goals, such as setting up new carbon markets, or funding technologies like carbon-capture systems. 
Private investors have increasingly been supportive of ambitious climate action, pouring record amounts of cash into funds that pick investments using environmental and social criteria. 
That in turn has helped shift the rhetoric of industries that once minimized the risks of climate change.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil companies, for example, said last month it supported steps to reduce emissions such as putting a price on carbon and accelerating the development of carbon capture and other technologies.
API Senior Vice President Frank Macchiarola said that in developing a new U.S. carbon cutting target, the United States should balance environmental goals with maintaining U.S. competitiveness.
""Over the long-term, the world is going to demand more energy, not less, and any target should reflect that reality and account for the significant technological advancements that will be required to accelerate the pace of emissions reductions,"" Macchiarola said.
Labor groups like the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of U.S. labor unions, meanwhile, back steps to protect U.S. jobs like taxing goods made in countries that have less onerous emissions regulations. 
AFL-CIO spokesman Tim Schlittner said the group hopes the summit will produce ""a clear signal that carbon border adjustments are on the table to protect energy-intensive sectors."" 
INDUSTRY WISH LISTS
Automakers, whose vehicles make up a big chunk of global emissions, are under pressure to phase out petroleum-fueled internal combustion engines. Industry leaders General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have already declared ambitious plans to move toward selling only electric vehicles. 
But to ease the transition to electric vehicles, U.S. and European automakers say they want subsidies to expand charging infrastructure and encourage sales.
The National Mining Association, the U.S. industry trade group for miners, said it supports carbon capture technology to reduce the industry's climate footprint. It also wants leaders to understand that lithium, copper and other metals are needed to manufacture electric vehicles.
""We hope that the summit brings new attention to the mineral supply chains that underpin the deployment of advanced energy technologies, such as electric vehicles,"" said Ashley Burke, the NMA’s spokeswoman. 
The agriculture industry, meanwhile, is looking for market-based programs to help it cut its emissions, which stack up to around 25% of the global total.
Industry giants such as  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and Cargill Inc have launched programs encouraging farming techniques that keep carbon in the soil. 
Biden's Department of Agriculture is looking to expand such programs, and has suggested creating a ""carbon bank"" that could pay farmers for carbon capture on their farms. 

For their part, money managers and banks want policymakers to help standardize accounting rules for how companies report environmental and other sustainability-related risks, something that could help them avoid laggards on climate change.
""Our industry has an important role to play in supporting companies' transition to a more sustainable future, but to do so it is vital we have clear and consistent data on the climate-related risks faced by companies,"" said Chris Cummings, CEO of the Investment Association in London.

933,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>","As Suga heads to U.S., Japanese stocks with ties to China take a beating","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese firms with strong Chinese ties are seeing their shares fall ahead of a meeting of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and U.S. President Joe Biden, as investors fear pressure to align Japan more closely with Washington's tough stance on Beijing.
Shippers, retailers and manufacturers of various machines and components with significant dependence on Chinese demand could bear the brunt of further diplomatic tension in the form of trade restrictions or popular boycotts, analysts said.
Suga will on Friday become the first foreign leader to visit the White House since Biden took office in January, widely seen as an indication by both countries as a desire to revitalise their alliance to counter China's growing clout. 
""Suga may be asked to come in step with Washington's hard-line stance on China, which could worsen Sino-Japanese relations,"" Daiwa Securities' Chief Technical Analyst Eiji Kinouchi said.
Given Japan's proximity to China, both geographically and economically, any negative impact from worsening relations would be greater on Japan than on Western allies, Kinouchi said.
Japan has taken a softer approach to China, its largest trade partner, on issues as varied as trade and the origins of COVID-19 that have put the world's most populous country at loggerheads with the United States and its allies.
It stayed out of the West's coordinated sanctions on Chinese officials last month related to alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang, which China has denied.
A senior Biden administration official also said Taiwan and preserving the status quo across the Taiwan Strait would be part of the United States' upcoming talks with Japan.
""Suga will probably get more vaccines from the U.S. In return, he will likely be pressed to get tough on China. So shares of companies with high exposure to China are now capped,"" said Arihiro Nagata, general manager of global investment at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
RETALIATION FEARS
Hiromichi Shirakawa, vice chairman and chief economist for Japan at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said concerns about Suga's visit were weighing on the entire Japanese stock market. ""The Nikkei has been capped below 30,000 and that certainly reflect some such concerns.""
Investors fear any shift by Japan to a more hardline stance on contentious issues could prompt Chinese retaliation, official or otherwise, against Japanese interests, analysts said.
The stock price index of Japanese shippers, for whom Chinese demand is widely considered vital, has fallen 5.8% so far this week, versus a 0.4% fall in the broader Nikkei.
Some electronic components makers that had benefited from a global chip shortage have also fallen out of investors' favour.
TDK (OTC:TTDKY) Corp, which sells over half of its products to China, lost 6.6% this week. Among others with high Chinese exposure, Taiyo Yuden (OTC:TYOYY) Co Ltd fell 6.6% and Nitto Denko (OTC:NDEKY) Corp shed 2.6%.
Yaskawa Electric Corp's fairly upbeat earnings on Monday failed to prevent its stock from falling. Its figures showed China accounted for a quarter of its sales in the last financial year, versus 19% a year earlier.
In retail, the owner of household goods and clothing chain Muji, Ryohin Keikaku Co Ltd, suffered a backlash from Chinese netizens last month when it said it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of forced labour in Xinjiang. 
On Wednesday, it said a third-party auditor found no grave breaches of any rules at its Xinjiang organic cotton field. Its stock fell 4.8% on Thursday and is down as much this week.

Fast Retailing Co Ltd, owner of the Uniqlo casual clothing chain - which has a big presence on Chinese high streets - saw its stock fall heavily on Monday.
The China branch of the cotton trade body Better Cotton Initiative said last month it had not found signs of forced labour related to cotton production in Xinjiang.

(Reuters) -Coinbase Global Inc shares jumped 11% in early trading on Thursday, a day after the cryptocurrency exchange went public in a high-profile debut on the Nasdaq that briefly valued it at more than $100 billion.
The debut, done through a direct listing where no shares are sold ahead of the opening, marked another milestone for bitcoin and other digital assets and came amid a surge in the value of cryptocurrencies that has lured a clutch of mainstream, top-tier firms.
Cathie Wood's Ark funds bought $246 million worth of Coinbase shares on Wednesday, while one of her funds sold a $4.4 million stake in New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), according to the firm's daily trade summary.
""Obviously, the excitement is there because this really just strengthens the idea that, right now, you can invest not into cryptocurrencies per se, but in companies that are already in business in the cryptocurrency market,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
""At some point, there will be a normalization in the transaction levels (in cryptocurrencies) and that's exactly what traditional investors are looking to understand - are these levels normal? Probably not.""
Founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, San Francisco-based Coinbase has 56 million users globally and an estimated $223 billion assets on its platform, accounting for 11.3% of the crypto asset market share, regulatory filings showed.

Coinbase's valuation, which was just under $6 billion as recently as September, has surged in tandem with bitcoin's gains this year. The world's biggest cryptocurrency however, was down about 0.9% on Thursday after hitting a record high of $64,895.22 a day earlier.
At 6:42 a.m. ET, Coinbase shares were up 9.4% at $358.61, valuing the cryptocurrency exchange more than Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange put together.

U.S. Bancorp announced earnings per share of $1.45 on revenue of $5.47 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.9547 on revenue of $5.55 billion. Traders chose to ignore the revenues that came below expectations, buoyed by robust earnings reported by other U.S. banks as well like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Net income came at $2.28 billion, 94.7% higher than the $1.17 billion for the first quarter of 2020. Non-performing assets fell 7.4% from the January-March period.
Last week, JP Morgan had upgraded the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association, the fifth-largest commercial bank in the U.S. to ‘overweight’ from ‘neutral’. It raised the target for the stock to $60, a level that could be hit anytime soon given the strength in share prices today.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Legion Partners Asset Management on Wednesday said it is pushing ahead with a proxy contest to seat four directors on OneSpan (NASDAQ:OSPN)'s board after the cybersecurity firm rejected a settlement proposal from the activist investment firm.
Legion, which has been an investor in OneSpan since 2018, also said it now owns 6.91% of the company's stock, up from the 6.8% stake it owned when it first said in February that it was nominating directors.
The activist firm wants OneSpan to engage in a strategic review and consider selling its hardware business, its eSignature business or even the entire company. It has also criticized the company for taking only incremental steps to reverse its underperformance.
The firm, founded by Christopher Kiper and Ted White, said in a regulatory filing that it had sent an email to the board with a high-level proposal to avoid a proxy fight. It proposed adding three Legion nominees immediately and to push ahead with the strategic review.
The board responded that its unanimous view was to ""not proceed in discussing a settlement agreement based on the proposed terms."" 
A company spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Legion originally wrote to shareholders that it is now time to elect ""strong technology leaders to the Board who will seek to begin a comprehensive strategic review of the Company to determine the best path forward for the Company and all its stakeholders."" The investment firm originally criticized OneSpan for having failed to adequately correct the company's low share price and having made only incremental changes to the board.
The company earlier this month appointed Garry Capers, a cloud solutions executive at Deluxe (NYSE:DLX) Corporation, to its board.
OneSpan is currently valued at roughly $1 billion and has seen its share price climb 30% since January. It was trading at $26.86 on Wednesday.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, helped by a strong start to the new earnings season and ahead of a packed economic data slate.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 155 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 19 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 76 points, or 0.6%.
Earnings season got off with a bang on Wednesday.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported results that beat on both top and bottom lines, but Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the standout performer, boosted by record investment banking revenue and a jump in trading revenue.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has continued in similar vein early Thursday, with blowout numbers and the announcement of a $25 billion share buyback, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is also due to release before the bell.
Investors will also pore over financial results from the likes of food and beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), health care company UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) as well Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which has struggled, along with all the other travel stocks, during the periods of lockdown.
Also of interest Thursday will be  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN), after the cryptocurrency exchange saw volatile trading on its market debut Wednesday, eventually closing around 30% higher than its reference price, helped by Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment buying around $250 million of the stock.
The economic data slate is extremely busy Thursday, starting with the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which are expected to have fallen to 700,000, as the labor market recovers. 
Retail sales, due at the same time, are expected to have bounced a hefty 5.9% last month, while industrial production, due at 9:15 AM ET, is seen jumping 2.8% after a 2.2% drop in February. The Philly Fed and Empire State manufacturing surveys are also due later Thursday.
Oil prices drifted lower Thursday, consolidating near one-month highs after Wednesday’s strong gains as U.S. stockpiles data added to signs the demand outlook is improving.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration Wednesday, more than double the drop expected.
Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency upgraded their forecasts for world oil demand growth this year earlier this week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $62.83 a barrel after climbing 4.9% during the previous session, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $66.31 after gaining 4.6% Wednesday. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,746.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1966.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",Sustainable-bond issuance reaches record high in first quarter,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) -Sustainable-bond issuance surged to a record high in the first quarter as more countries and companies looked to tap growing demand from investors across the globe.
Environmental concerns have risen for many investors in recent years as the world steps up its transition to a low-carbon economy, while the COVID-19 pandemic has put a renewed focus on health and broader social inequality.
Aiming to use the money for everything from wind farms to vaccination programmes, the bonds are collectively taking an ever greater share of total issuance.
""An increasing political, regulatory and societal focus on sustainability, across developed markets in particular, means that the shift toward sustainable assets looks set to power ahead, in our view,"" said Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute.
According to Refinitiv data, the cumulative borrowing through green bonds, social bonds and sustainability bonds stood at $264 billion in the first quarter of this year, a record high.
Green bonds, where the money targets an environmentally friendly project, saw the highest issuance, $130 billion, followed by social bonds, at $91.3 billion and sustainability bonds at $43 billion, the data showed.
Social bonds look to raise money for projects with positive social outcomes, such as improving health or providing affordable housing. Sustainability bonds are a mixture of green and social bonds.
Green bonds, and to a lesser extent sustainability bonds, were entering a ""sweet spot of positive feedback"" said James Athey, fixed income investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Clients were increasingly demanding environmental, social and governance issues be taken into consideration by their money managers, and seeking products which attempt to influence issuer behaviours - and were willing to pay for the privilege.
""Where clients knowingly sign up to such mandate designs, they are often implicitly permitting portfolio managers to pay a `greenium' [green-based premium] for bonds that satisfy the relevant criteria,"" Athey said.
As a result of it often being cheaper, more issuers were looking to engage in green financing.
""Thus the virtuous cycle is complete,"" Athey said. ""This dynamic is highly likely to continue playing out over the coming years and as such we expect significant growth in these bond markets.""
Financial institutions such as development banks accounted for the lion's share of total green bond issuance in the first quarter, at 41%. Governments had a share of 21%.
The largest issue during the quarter was a 8.5 billion-euro issue from Italy, which saw demand totalling 80 billion euros. Next biggest was France with a 7 billion euro issue. The biggest corporate issue was from Ardagh Metal Packaging (NYSE:PKG), which raised $2.8 billion.
Over the course of the first quarter, 304 green bonds were issued, up from 212 during the last three months of 2020, itself a record at the time. Social bonds totalled 51, up from 48; while sustainability bonds jumped to 58 from 35. 
Leading the banking race to help issuers come to market was U.S. lender JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which helped raise $9.84 billion through green bonds alone, followed by BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) with $8.67 billion and Citi with $7.14 billion. 

French lender BNP took the top spot for social bond issuance with $7.32 billion, followed by Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) with $6.77 billion and British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) with $6.74 billion , the data showed.
For sustainability bonds, meanwhile, U.S. lenders made a clean sweep of the top three places, led by Citi with $3.68 billion, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with $3.66 billion and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) with $3.52 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Cathie Wood's Ark funds bought $246 million worth of Coinbase shares on the cryptocurrency exchange's Nasdaq debut on Wednesday and sold some Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, according to their daily fund trading summary.
A chunky $168 million of Coinbase shares were added to its flagship ARK Innovation fund, and the remainder went into its next generation and fintech innovation funds.
Notably, one of Wood's funds sold a $4.4 million stake in New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE).
Coinbase shares were up 11% in U.S. premarket trading on Thursday, after having risen 52% on their debut on Nasdaq, giving it a market capitalisation of close to $100 billion, well above ICE and other traditional exchange operators.
Ark also sold Tesla shares worth about $178 million, though the stock is still by far their biggest bet by weightage on three of their major funds.
The move comes nearly a month after long time Tesla-bull Wood said the electric car maker's share price could reach the $3,000 mark by 2025.
""What's interesting is their unwinding of some Tesla shares after their ludicrous call on Tesla,"" said Karim Moussalem, head of cash equity sales at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe in London. ""Selling some shares after that is a bit odd.""
The bet on Coinbase gives Ark more indirect exposure to bitcoin on top of their bets on Tesla, which recently invested in the world's biggest cryptocurrency and said it would accept it as a payment for its cars.
The celebrity fund manager gained prominence last year among retail investors and managed to attract a steady pile of cash into her red-hot funds. The ARK Innovation fund saw assets under management rise from $1.86 billion at the end of 2019 to nearly $22 billion as of March.
""Coinbase listing is a key milestone that arguably has created a lot of interest and hype, so it will be interesting to see how the entire cryptocurrency industry evolves over the coming months,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 06:50AM ET</span>",Canada faces calls for level playing field on airline aid as virus clouds summer travel,"By Allison Lampert and Steve Scherer
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada is facing industry calls to extend financial aid to smaller airlines, after offering a C$5.9 billion ($4.71 billion)life-line to Air Canada, as new COVID-19 variants cast early clouds ahead of the vital summer travel season.
The timing of Monday's deal, which saw the Canadian government take a 6% equity stake in Air Canada, was partly designed to secure ""access to air travel when it returns,"" as the country's vaccine rollout ramps up this summer, a source familiar with the discussions said.
But with the spread of new variants threatening to overtake the pace of vaccination, early hopes for a relaxation of Canada's strict travel requirements ahead of summer are fading.
Fears of a delayed recovery, along with the government deal with Air Canada, has upset the ""level playing field"" for air service with the airline's smaller rivals calling on the government for financial support.
""We want everyone to have access to the same programs,"" said John McKenna, chief executive of the Air Transport Association of Canada (ATAC), which represents smaller carriers.
On Wednesday, Air Canada joined rival WestJet Airlines in extending a three-month suspension of sun-destination flights to the Caribbean and Mexico originally slated to end on April 30, reflecting the government's current warnings against international travel. [L1N2M71SG]
The planned April reopening of a bubble in Atlantic Canada, which would allow travel among the region's four provinces without the need to self-isolate, was postponed this week until at least May 3 over COVID-19 concerns.
WestJet said its previously-planned schedule for Atlantic Canada remains unchanged. 
Canada's vaccine roll out has been slow, but it is ramping up now. By the end of June, some 44 million doses are expected, and everyone who wants to be fully inoculated will be by the end of September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised.
Canada's Liberal government, which will deliver its first budget in two years next week, has said talks with carriers like Onex Corp-owned WestJet are ongoing. 
""We hope that the other agreements come as soon as possible,"" the source familiar with the talks said, adding that ""different airlines have different needs"". 
WestJet spokeswoman Morgan Bell said the airline is optimistic that a successful vaccine roll-out will support summer travel and expects ""government policy will transition"" with mounting jabs.
Canada, with some of the world's toughest travel rules, has a mandate that its citizens and residents arriving from abroad self-isolate for 14 days.
Health Canada advised Canadians in a statement to avoid traveling outside the country ""for the foreseeable future.""
Calgary-based WestJet has asked the government to end an order requiring international arrivals to quarantine for up to three days in a hotel in favor of COVID-19 testing. 
The government must decide whether to renew the controversial hotel order, which expires on April 21.
McKenna also urged the government to relax restrictions on travel with neighboring United States.
""The government can come up with all the financial help they want,"" ATAC's McKenna said. ""But until those things are relaxed we can't do anything.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) aims to lend, invest and provide other financial services for up to $2.5 trillion of banking business to be done for companies and projects tackling climate change and social inequality over the next decade.
In a statement on Thursday, JPMorgan said green initiatives will account for $1 trillion of that total - the largest environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) financing target announced by a U.S. bank to date.
That could mean lending or investing in companies that develop clean-energy technology for the trucking, aviation or industrial manufacturing sectors, the bank's head of sustainability, Marisa Buchanan, told Reuters in an interview.
JPMorgan's announcement comes amid a flurry of billion- and trillion-dollar commitments by banks toward ESG initiatives - a sign that Wall Street is betting the solutions to climate change and inequality will come from corporations.
These targets are being issued as sustainable finance investors and industry insiders mull whether regulators should make it more expensive for banks to lend to fossil fuel companies. A recent U.K. survey found widespread support for a proposal that would impose tougher rules around the amount of capital banks need to hold if they lend to companies responsible for emitting high levels of greenhouse gases.
JPMorgan is among the leading U.S. lenders to fossil fuel companies, having provided $317 billion of lending and underwriting since 2016, according to a recent study by environmental activist group Rainforest Action network. 
Growing investor interest in ESG issues has pushed several global banks to set their own net-zero carbon emissions targets and to stop funding coal and Arctic drilling projects, in addition to setting targets like these.
But it can be tough to track banks' actual progress toward the pledges: most are relatively new and lenders do not release comprehensive lists of the projects, deals or other business they perform related to the goals.
JPMorgan pledged to share more details about its ESG initiatives, including its work establishing emission targets for companies in its financing portfolio, in its next climate report, due out this spring.
Thursday's announcement extends a similar, smaller-scale target the bank had in recent years, during which it led the $2.2 billion initial public offering of renewable energy company Shoals Technologies.
In his annual shareholder letter, JPMorgan's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon wrote that the solution to climate change ""is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels"" because some sectors do not have affordable, low-carbon energy sources to replace oil and natural gas. 

According to head of sustainability Buchanan, ""The only way that actually can happen is if the public and private sectors come together to invest in the development of new technologies.""

945,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",U.S. labor movement looks for path forward after Amazon defeat,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - Regina McDowell was not surprised that workers overwhelmingly rejected a union at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Alabama last week.
She spent 42 years working in a unionized electrical equipment factory in Indiana and was active in organizing drives — including traveling to the South to track down workers at their homes to make the pitch for her union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
“They’d sometimes shoo you off their property with a gun,” she said, adding that union dues were a sticking point for many.
“I think that gets them,” said the 63-year-old grandmother, “that it’s less money they’ll have.”
The landslide failure of the Amazon vote at the warehouse in Bessemer has sparked soul-searching in the labor movement over what went wrong and what unions need to do differently in the future to regain ground.
    ""Organizing in America is no longer a fair fight. Our labor laws are no longer an effective way to capture the will of American workers to form unions,"" said Tim Schlittner, communications director for the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation.
""The sentiment this reinforces is that there's an overdue and dramatic need for labor law reform in the United States.""
WORTH THE RISK?
Still, for many workers, labor experts reckon the decision whether to support a union campaign often boils down to a risk assessment.
“Once they know how strongly Amazon opposes them, and how much resources Amazon is willing to spend to defeat a union, then their fear sets in,” said Tom Kochan, a professor of industrial relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
Kochan has conducted surveys that show high, and even growing, support for unions among Americans. But when it comes to individual campaigns in a workplace, “the reality sets in -
when the employer campaigns so hard that you think you’re putting your job at risk.”
Changes in the economy have exacerbated the problem. Big companies like Amazon have operations dotting the country, making it easier for them to shift work. Compared to a steel mill or a car assembly plant, an e-commerce warehouse has fewer fixed investments in equipment, which also makes it easier to shift jobs.
“Why should I as an individual worker, earning $15 an hour, risk three years of a battle with my employer to get something done,” said Kochan, “and at the same time, risk losing my job?
The traditional view, shared by Kochan and many other labor experts, is that company measures to fight unionization, including tactics that would be illegal in other advanced countries such as requiring workers to attend meetings to hear anti-union arguments, need to be reined in.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed legislation last month that would expand protections for labor organizing and collective bargaining.
But the measure faces a difficult path in the Senate, where the two parties are evenly split and most legislation needs at least 60 backers to pass. A block of Republican senators from anti-union, ""right-to-work"" states is set to oppose the measure. 
DASHED OPTIMISM
There was optimism among activists in the final months of the Amazon campaign, as it drew high-profile endorsements and national and international media attention, including a speech by President Joe Biden criticizing Amazon for hindering union drives at its warehouses.
Biden, a Democrat, is widely viewed as the most pro-union president in modern times.
But none of that was enough to counteract the view of some workers at the facility that pay and conditions were relatively good on top of the everyday barriers that have combined over recent years to drive union membership in the United States to historic lows.
Only 6.3% of private-sector workers belong to unions, according to the U.S. Labor Department. The comparable rate is 15.8% in neighboring Canada.
One response in recent years has been new types of organizing, which sidestep many legal restrictions on formal union campaigns to gain collective bargaining agreements with employers.
The Southern Workers Assembly, for instance, is a group that organizes protests and conducts education campaigns aimed at promoting labor and other social causes. The group helped organize events in February across the country in support of the Amazon workers.
Michael Hicks, an economist at Ball (NYSE:BLL) State University in Indiana, said unions need to refurbish their image. Many workplace advances such as the 40-hour week were enacted decades ago. Recent years have seen waves of factory shutdowns where companies have blamed unions for making the operation uncompetitive.
“Here in the Midwest, every time a factory closed, it had a huge spillover to the rest of the community,” he added. “It caused restaurants and bars to close, so the loss of other jobs.”
Younger generations have little contact with unions, simply because the share of workers covered by contracts has diminished so greatly.
McDowell, the former electrical worker, has seen these forces play out in her hometown of Peru, Indiana. Her plant, owned by France’s Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) SE, closed last April after a battle by the local union to retain it. The company said it was a difficult decision to close but necessary to remain competitive. Part of the work moved to Mexico.
Many workers viewed the move as an effort to get out of a unionized operation, a charge the company has denied.
But it also has eroded the stature of the union in the eyes of some, said McDowell, who remains strongly pro-union. “There were people who felt the union should have done more” to save the factory, she said.

“But once the company said they were going to close it, what can we do? It’s their company.”

(Reuters) - With calls for police reform and protests across the United States, software engineer Bryant Young is hoping to use virtual reality (VR) to fight racism.
    ""Our America"" puts the viewer in the driver's seat as a Black father takes his son to school. Along the way, they are pulled over by the police, leading to life and death choices. 
    ""The audience has to go through these different scenarios, whether it's subtle or overt racism, and has to navigate these different conversations and interactions properly,"" explained 25-year-old Young.
When Young was 16 years old, his dad took him to buy his first car, according to the game's description on fund-raising site Kickstarter. As his dad was driving them home, police pulled them over. When Young reached to open the glove box for the registration, he said the officer was ready to pull out his gun, a frightening moment but one that did not result in violence.
    ""I am really focused on just trying to bring light to a situation that a lot of people are not aware of and give people a chance to experience what it's like to be Black in America,"" he said.
Recent days have seen protests over the killing of Daunte Wright by police after a routine traffic stop just miles from where George Floyd died last May. Floyd died in handcuffs with his neck pinned to the street under a police officer's knee. Both Wright and Floyd were Black.
    ""Our America"" caught the eye of 3D software company Unity Software Inc, which awarded Young a $25,000 grant.
    ""I think there's something incredibly important about the power of real-time 3D in immersive storytelling that we cannot find in other pieces of technology,"" said Jessica Lindl, Unity's vice president for social impact.
Video games have also helped share the experiences of other marginalized groups, such as refugees fleeing civil war.

LONDON (Reuters) -Deliveroo said a more-than doubling in first quarter orders during coronavirus lockdowns was an initial step in proving itself following the debacle of the food delivery company's London flotation last month. 
""We have a lot of work ahead of us to both grow the business over the long term, and prove ourselves to the markets,"" Chief Executive Will Shu said. ""It is day one of doing that.""
Growth accelerated for a fourth consecutive quarter, with group orders up 114% year-on-year to 71 million and gross transaction value (GTV) up 130% year-on-year to 1.65 billion pounds ($2.27 billion), the company said.
But it was difficult to know how much demand was driven by cafes and restaurants closing their doors in COVID-19 lockdowns. Deliveroo said it expected growth to slow as restrictions eased.
""We are mindful of the uncertain impact of the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions,"" Shu said in an interview. ""We wanted to be prudent when it comes to guidance.""
He said, however, that strong demand in markets such as Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, where lockdowns have been lifted, indicated what could happen in other countries. 
Deliveroo maintained guidance for full-year GTV growth of 30-40% and gross profit margins of 7.5-8.0%.
Rival Just Eat Takeaway.com said on Wednesday Britain had been a ""standout"" in the first quarter, and it was pulling away from competitors, namely Deliveroo and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats.
Shu, however, said Deliveroo was ""incredibly proud"" of its performance in Britain and Ireland. ""We feel great about our market position,"" he said.
Grocery delivery, in partnership with supermarkets Waitrose, Aldi, Coop, Morrisons and Sainsbury's, expanded at pace, he added, with GTV growing by more than 700% to represent more than 10% of UK GTV. 
IPO FLOP
Deliveroo's flotation was supposed to be London's debut of the decade, but the stock plunged 30% on the first day, wiping more than 2 billion pounds from the company's initial 7.6 billion pound valuation.
The shares were down 2% to 265 pence on Thursday morning, 31% below their IPO price of 390 pence.
Some of Britain's biggest investment companies shunned the listing, citing concerns about gig-economy working conditions.
Shu said the self-employed rider model had been upheld by courts in Britain, France and Italy.

""I'm not wedded to any particular model,"" he said. ""However I am wedded to the model that riders want.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were on course to extend a five-day run of record highs on Thursday, while Bitcoin took a breather after its latest surge and Russia’s markets tumbled at the prospect of the harshest U.S. sanctions in years.
For traders, it was hard keeping up. Europe's STOXX 600 opened with a new all-time high as a flurry of positive earnings offset growing worries about a third wave of COVID infections on the continent.
The U.S. dollar was at a four-week low ahead of March retail sales data with investors increasingly convinced that U.S. interest rates will stay low, whereas in Europe a deluge of debt issuance lifted German bond yields to four-week highs.
For those following markets elsewhere it was even more hectic. Turkey was waiting for its first central bank meeting under its new governor after the last one was sacked after hiking interest rates last month.
The Russian rouble had already fallen as much as 2% on reports the United States would announce sanctions later for alleged interference in U.S. elections and malicious cyber activity.
They were set to target both individuals and entities and could also include aggressive new measures targeting the country's sovereign debt, according to one source who spoke to Reuters.
""There has been a bit of whiplash for the rouble."" Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy said. ""Earlier in the week it looked like the U.S. was making overtures about a (Biden-Putin) summit and now it looks like they are going to slap on sanctions."" 
Graphic: Russia and Ukraine risk gauges have been rising https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjdrjnvr/Pasted%20image%201618412367931.png
Wall Street futures were pointing higher after a mixed finish on Wednesday despite gains for bulge-bracket banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) as they got U.S. earnings season off to a good start. 
The mood had been subdued in Asia overnight where the Nikkei ended little changed and Hong Kong and China's main bourses finished 0.5%-0.6% in the red. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management said in a note it was trimming its overall emerging markets exposure once again ""mostly driven by a less sanguine outlook on EM Asia.""
""China has now recovered enough that policymakers can afford to be more conservative and worry more about containing debt and property market risks,"" its global multi-asset strategist Patrik Schowitz wrote in a note. 
The bank had already recommended selling EM currencies earlier in the week.
There were no such worries for the cryptocurrencies. Despite a bumpy IPO for crypto firm Coinbase, the world's biggest and best-known Bitcoin was just shy of its record high at $62,614 having now doubled in value this year. 
Back in the bond markets, 10-year U.S. bond yields eased to 1.6165% in European trade, down from a 14-month peak of 1.776% reached in late March, reducing the dollar's yield attraction.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank would reduce its monthly bond purchases ""well before"" it raised interest rates.
""Risk sentiment is improving,"" dragging on bond yields and the dollar, said Osamu Takashima, chief currency strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar slipped for a fourth day to 108.90. The euro was flat at $1.1977 as was sterling at $1.3776. 
The Australian dollar hovered near three-week highs at $0.7716 after posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since Feb. 19 on Wednesday. Its New Zealand peer was upbeat at $0.7147, a level not seen since March 23.
In commodities, oil held near one-month highs after climbing nearly 5% on Wednesday as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said there were signs the massive overhang in global oil inventories was now being ""worked off"". 

Brent crude was up 2 cents at $66.60 a barrel. U.S. crude slipped 5 cents to $63.1. Gold was 0.4% higher at $1,741.8 an ounce.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>",Pay package looms large as Orcel takes helm at UniCredit,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Andrea Orcel will fulfil his dream of becoming a bank boss on Thursday when UniCredit investors back the veteran dealmaker as chief executive, but disquiet over his pay, among the highest for a banker in Europe, means his tenure begins on the defensive. 
Orcel only narrowly defeated a shareholder revolt over the terms and size of his up to 7.5 million euro ($9 million)remuneration package, Italian daily la Repubblica reported on its website late on Wednesday.
UniCredit declined to comment.
The package, which is double the pay of former CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, had drawn criticism from leading shareholder advisory firms which had recommended a ""no"" vote. They were particularly unhappy that the share bonus for the first year was not linked to performance and cannot be recouped in case of misconduct.
Results of the shareholder vote are expected later on Thursday after the bank holds its annual general meeting. Votes gathered by a proxy holder, however, showed that the remuneration policy passed with 55% of votes, according to la Repubblica.
That is just above the 50% plus one vote needed for the proposal to go through and compares with a 96% approval rate last year and the 87% investor backing for the remuneration policy Mustier adopted after he arrived in 2016. 
The French banker, who steered UniCredit through a tough restructuring, had cut his fixed pay by 40% to 1.2 million euros, waived his yearly bonuses through 2019 and pledged to leave without a severance cheque when the time came.
In 2020 he further cut his pay by 25% due to the pandemic, waiving also a 2.4 million euro bonus.
Investors accounting for 60% of the bank's ordinary share capital are represented at the general meeting, the bank said, so a 55% rate would mean just a third of UniCredit's overall capital supports Orcel's pay package.
Two top 30 UniCredit investors had told Reuters they would vote against.
The slate of directors put forward by the outgoing board, comprising Orcel as CEO and former Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan as president, got around 80% of votes, la Repubblica said.
In taking the job at UniCredit, Orcel is relinquishing more than 25 million euros in deferred pay from former employer UBS, whose investment banking arm he led until 2018.
UniCredit has said it will not compensate him in any way for that loss, after a row over pay prompted Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) to withdraw its offer to make Orcel its CEO back in 2019, leaving the Italian banker out of a job.

Orcel is suing Santander for 112 million euros. A public hearing in the dispute is scheduled in Madrid on May 19.

The stock traded at $361.98 at 4:16 a.m. in New York, up about 9% from their last close, but still lower than Wednesday’s opening price. After debuting at $381 in its direct listing on Nasdaq Wednesday, Coinbase climbed as high as $429.54 -- sending the exchange’s valuation soaring above $112 billion -- before quickly slipping back as Bitcoin fell from record highs.
Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF, Ark Fintech Innovation ETF and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF bought a combined 749,205 shares of Coinbase, according to data released by the funds in an email. Shares in the first -- Ark Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) -- also edged higher premarket.
Coinbase’s listing is seen pushing crypto even more into the mainstream of investing, exposing legions of potential buyers to digital tokens, which have grown into a $2 trillion industry in little more than a decade. Bitcoin, the original and biggest crypto coin, is valued at more than $1 trillion alone after a more than 800% surge in the past year.
At the closing price, Coinbase’s valuation on a fully diluted basis was about $86 billion. Given its size and visibility, Coinbase is likely to be popular with actively managed equity funds, particularly growth managers, essentially making a large swath of stock holders passive investors in crypto.
Growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies has spurred Bitcoin to a 120% rally since December, as well as lifting other tokens to record highs. That’s despite lingering concerns over their volatility and usefulness as a method of payment. Attention from regulators is poised to intensify as Coinbase becomes a public company."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Daimler's Spanish unit can be liable for damages sought by companies affected by the German carmaker's role in a truck cartel fined by EU antitrust regulators five years ago, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.
Should the court follow the non-binding opinion in the coming months, it could pave the way for companies to sue subsidiaries of other cartel members and other illegal price-fixing groups.
The European Commission in 2016 handed out a then record 2.9 billion euro fine to the cartel which included Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), Swedish company Volvo, Iveco, which is part of Italian truck and tractor maker CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), and DAF Trucks, owned by U.S. company Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR).
Daimler's fine was the biggest at 1.01 billion euros ($1.2 billion) while Volkswagen-owned MAN avoided a penalty for alerting the EU competition watchdog to the cartel.
Spanish company Sumal SL subsequently asked for 22,000 euros in damages from Mercedes Benz Trucks España SL, a Daimler subsidiary, saying the sum was the premium paid to the company for buying Daimler trucks. It said prices would have been lower without the cartel.
A Spanish court then asked the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), Europe's highest, for guidance.
""A national court can order a subsidiary company to pay compensation for the harm caused by the anti-competitive conduct of its parent company in a case where the Commission has imposed a fine solely on that parent company,"" Giovanni Pitruzzella, advocate general at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) said in a non-binding opinion.
""For that to be the case, the two companies must have operated on the market as a single undertaking and the subsidiary must have contributed to the achievement of the objective and the materialisation of the effects of that conduct,"" he said.
The court follows its advisers' recommendations in around four out of five cases. The Commission said the cartel, which ran for 14 years, fixed prices and coordinated the timing of introducing new emission technologies in 1997 and passing on the costs of those new technologies.

The case is C-882/19 Sumal.

The chip shortage is going to take ""a couple of years"" to abate, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told the Washington Post on Wednesday. 
TSMC's comments come after the firm reported a 19.4% rise in first-quarter profit, beating market expectations, on strong chip demand amid a global shift to home working.
TSMC, whose clients include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, had already flagged ""multiple years of growth opportunities"" as the COVID-19 pandemic fuelled demand for advanced chips to power devices such as smartphones and laptops.
Its business was boosted by the chip shortage that initially forced automakers to cut production, but is now also hurting manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and even appliances.
On Thursday, TSMC said it expects the chip shortage for its auto clients to be greatly reduced from the next quarter.
TSMC's net profit for January-March hit T$139.7 billion ($4.93 billion), versus the T$134.01 billion average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. 
Revenue rose 25.4% to a record $12.92 billion, in line with the company's earlier estimated range of $12.7 billion to $13 billion.
The firm forecast second-quarter revenue would be in a range of $12.9 billion to $13.2 billion, compared with $10.38 billion in the same period a year earlier. It also lifted its revenue growth forecast for 2021 to about 20%, versus an earlier forecast of a mid-teens percentage.
TSMC said this month it plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity at its plants, days after  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a $20 billion plan to expand its advanced chip making capacity.
Wei said the massive investment plan was driven by ""stronger engagement with more customers"" on the company's most advanced 5 nanometer node technology as well as its upcoming 3 nanometer node, which is scheduled to enter trial production later this year.
The company also increased capital spending on the production and development of advanced chips to about $30 billion this year, up from a range of $25 billion to $28 billion it forecast in January. 
Wei said TSMC is seeing its clients preparing for ""a higher level of inventory"" to ensure supply stability due to uncertainties from geopolitics and the pandemic. As a result, he said, the company's capacity will remain ""tight"" throughout the year. 
Analysts are bullish about the company's massive expansion plan, expecting global demand for advanced chips to surge as fifth-generation telecommunications (5G) technology and artificial intelligence applications are adopted more widely.
TSMC shares have risen about 16% so far this year and have more than doubled over the past one year, giving TSMC a market value of $558 billion, more than twice that of Intel's and higher than that of South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.

The stock rose 1.14% on Thursday, compared with 1.25% for the benchmark index.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>",Shell plays down risk of stranded oil and gas reserves,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Thursday the majority of its oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2050, playing down the risk of stranded assets as it prepares to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades.
The disclosure is still a rare admission by a major oil and gas company that some of its reserves may be worthless in a world shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in an effort to stem global warming.
The Anglo-Dutch company said in a document to investors summarising its climate strategy that around 75% of its proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030, with an additional 3% produced after 2040.
Since late 2019, Shell has wiped out over $20 billion from the value of its oil and gas reserves after lowering the outlook for commodity prices because of the energy transition and the impact on demand of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shell aims to cut its emissions from well-head to petrol station to net zero by 2050, and has set out intermediate targets, in one of the sector's most ambitious plans.
The company said it will focus on hydrogen, biofuels and offshore wind as well as carbon-sucking technologies and planting trees, but it has yet to outline exact plans for reaching the target.
Its annual spending is however set to stay focused on oil and gas in the coming years.
Shell, the world's largest oil and gas trader, said that it sells around 4.6% of energy consumed in the world and produces around 1.4% of total primary energy.
Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said the net-zero strategy is ""fully consistent"" with the more stringent U.N.-backed goal set in a 2015 Paris conference to limit global warming.
But climate activists have criticised plans to let oil and gas reserves dwindle while using carbon offsets.
The United Nations and research groups last year said that the world plans to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas in 2030 than would be consistent with the Paris goals.
The Anglo-Dutch company said it will put its energy transition strategy to a non-binding vote at its upcoming annual general meeting in May, an unprecedented move for oil and gas companies, said Adam Matthews, Director of Ethics & Engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, who has led investor engagement with Shell.
""With this latest important step in Shell's transition from an oil and gas producer to be an energy company, a multi-decadal transition is clearly underway,"" Matthews said in a statement.

""This is not the end of investor engagement.""

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, as investors digested a generally positive fresh round of corporate earnings, both in Europe and on Wall Street. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4%.
Global shares have surged in recent weeks led by expectations that successful rollouts of Covid-19 vaccines around the world and hefty stimulus packages, especially in the U.S., will unleash pent up demand, and the corporate sector is starting to offer up evidence to this effect.
Publicis (PA:PUBP) stock rose 3.4% after the world's third-largest advertising group returned to organic growth for the first time since the start of the pandemic, fueled by high demand for digital advertising in the United States.
ABB (SIX:ABBN) stock climbed 3.5% after the Swiss engineering firm lifted its revenue guidance for 2021 after an upbeat first quarter.
Recently floated Deliveroo (LON:ROO) stock slipped 0.7% despite the food delivery company saying its orders more than doubled in the quarter to end-March in its first trading update.
In Germany, meanwhile, shares in Vonovia  (DE:VNAn) rose 1.6% to their highest since early January after the country's highest court ruled that the Berlin state senate's attempt to cap rents on the apartments it owns was unconstitutional.
The banking sector, often seen as a proxy for the health of the wider economy, had started the ball rolling in the U.S. on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) posted a record first-quarter net profits as it capitalized on record levels of global dealmaking activity, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), the fourth-largest lender in the U.S., recorded bumper profits as it reduced bad loan provisions and got a grip on costs tied to its sales practices scandal.
On the economic data slate, German consumer prices rose 0.5% on the month in March, rising by less than the 0.7% level seen the previous month, while the French equivalent rose 0.6% on the month, up from a flat level in February.   
In the U.S., investors will study the latest weekly report on the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance, while March retail sales data are expected to show a strong uptick in consumer spending.
Oil prices drifted Thursday, consolidating near one-month highs after Wednesday’s strong gains as U.S. stockpiles data added to signs the demand outlook is improving.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration Wednesday, more than double the drop expected, while gasoline supplied to the market last week, an indicator of U.S. consumption of the fuel, increased to 8.9 million barrels per day, the highest since August.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely flat in Europe Thursday, remaining near four-week lows with traders seemingly buying into the idea that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at rock bottom levels for some time. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was flat at 91.657, after dipping to the lowest level since March 18 at 91.558 in the Asian session.
USD/JPY was flat at 108.92, after hitting a three-week low of 108.75 on Wednesday, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1976, after climbing as high as a four-week top of 1.1990, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3778, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7722.
Federal Reserve Jerome Powell continued Wednesday to hammer home the central bank’s mantra that the ultra easy monetary policies were going anywhere soon at a virtual event organized by the Economic Club of Washington. 
Powell said it is ""highly unlikely"" the central bank would lift rates before 2022 and reiterated that the pace of monthly bond purchases would remain steady until the economy has reached its goals. 
The Fed's ongoing $120 billion bond purchase program would likely be reined in well before a rake hike, Powell added.
“Despite the upside surprise to U.S. CPI ... the reaction in markets was well behaved and to some extent surprising – lower USD and lower UST yields,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This likely indicates that U.S. inflation and growth stories are in large part priced in, the market doesn’t expect the Fed to overreact.”
The U.S. consumer price index jumped 0.6% in March versus the previous month, the largest gain since August 2012, and rose 2.6% from a year earlier, well above the Fed’s 2.0% long-term target.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 1.63%, substantially below the 1.78% level seen at the end of March when expectations were running rife that rocketing inflation would prompt the Fed to act more quickly than had previously been envisaged.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 8.0822, with Sahap Kavcioglu, Turkey's fourth central bank chief in less than two years, set to oversee his first policy decision later Thursday after his shock appointment last month.
Turkey’s central bank is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate, now at 19%, unchanged. However, Kavcioglu is seen as being under pressure to reduce rates, particularly after the previous governor, Naci Agbal, was fired just two days after he had presided over a hike in its benchmark one-week repo rate of 200 basis points to combat inflation and protect the currency.
USD/RUB rose 1.6% to 77.112, with the ruble sinking on reports the U.S. will announce sanctions on Russia as soon as Thursday for alleged election interference and malicious cyber activity. That overshadowed the announcement that U.S. President Joe Biden will hold talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Russia's military buildup on the Ukrainian border has raised fears of a fresh invasion of Ukraine, seven years after Russia annexed Crimea and sponsored an armed revolt in the east of the country."

The first-quarter U.S. earnings season started in earnest on Wednesday, with the banking sector, often seen as a proxy for the health of the wider economy, to the fore.

JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM)  first quarter also beat expectations, although its bottom line was inflated by the one-off release of $5.2 billion in reserves.
Global shares have surged in recent weeks led by expectations that successful rollouts of Covid-19 vaccines around the world and hefty stimulus packages, especially in the U.S., will unleash pent up demand, benefiting the corporate sector.

ABB (SIX:ABBN) is also set to be in focus after the Swiss engineering firm lifted its revenue guidance for 2021 after an upbeat first quarter.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 01:46AM ET</span>",Climate scientists swap fieldwork for finance,"By Iain Withers, Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Environmental scientist Laura Garcia Velez cut her teeth on projects to help Ethiopian farmers insure crops for drought and connect remote Colombian communities to the electricity grid before working for conservation campaigners WWF. 
Now she's an analyst for Lombard Odier, charged with improving the $350 billion Swiss bank's green credentials.
""It's really important that finance recruits from science,"" said Velez, one of a growing number of campaigners and scientists who have switched to banking, which she hopes can play a role in ""greening the polluting industries"".
Activism and finance may seem an unlikely pairing of two implacable foes.
Yet banks, asset managers and private equity firms, faced with tough regulations to decarbonise portfolios and loan books, are competing to grab the people with the right green expertise, according to jobs data and Reuters interviews with finance firms, recruiters and universities. 
""Working in sustainability, it used to feel like you were trying to knock down walls,"" said NatWest's head of climate change James Close, a former director of climate change at the World Bank. 
""Now they are pulling us in from the streets through the front door.""
Many environmentalists, for their part, say the only way to save the planet is to force big businesses to radically reduce their carbon emissions, and they see the finance world that funds them as one of the best levers.
Some charities and campaigners argue, though, that ""greenwashing"" is rife in the finance industry. Many new recruits, they say, are used as a marketing tool and often lack the power to drive real change. 
DOUBLING PAY PACKETS
Nonetheless, the green rush is on.
The number of job ads for ""sustainability"" roles nearly doubled to more than 1,000 during the year to February, versus the previous 12 months, according to global finance recruitment specialist eFinancialCareers. Positions range from junior-level analysts to new director-level roles such as head of sustainability or climate change. GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PAFaLH
Green recruitment specialist Acre said its hires in finance had increased by more than a quarter year-on-year every year since 2017. The most senior posts now offer pay packages of well over 750,000 pounds ($1 million), up around three-fold over the period. 
LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) data shared with Reuters shows a steady increase in the number of finance jobs listed as requiring at least one ""green skill"", such as pollution prevention or ecosystem management, particularly in the United States. GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OtubTF
""There is a race for talent right now, there's no doubt about it,"" said Elree Winnett Seelig, Citi's global head of ESG for markets, adding that demand was particularly strong in fixed income.
Indeed banks, asset managers and private equity firms have been ramping up their climate teams in the past year, pushing salaries up by 30-50%, said Jon Williams (NYSE:WMB), partner in sustainability and climate change at PwC UK.
One of his team recently doubled their salary by jumping ship to an asset management firm, he added.
Environmental advocacy group workers who move to a bank are typically able to at least double their pay packets once bonuses are factored in, recruiters say. (Graphic: Finance firms ramp up search for green hires, https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/azgvoxwarpd/chart.png) 
'A DIFFERENT BREED'
Leading universities with specialist centres that combine climate science and finance say they have seen companies beat a path to their door to recruit graduates.
Charles Donovan, executive director of Imperial College London's Centre for Climate Finance and Investment, which is jointly run by climate science hub the Grantham Institute, said there had been an ""unbelievable"" rise in interest in its students from finance sector employers in the past 18 months.
Banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) are seeking prospective hires through climate-research partnerships, while some firms are offering scholarships, he added. 
While the London financial district may be pulling some talent away from government and advocacy roles, Donovan was unconcerned, saying many who targeted the financial sector were ""a different breed of students"" who recognised the value of expertise in areas like climate change to differentiate themselves from other graduates looking for jobs in finance. (Graphic: 'Green' skills growing across most industries, https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/FINANCE-TALENT/rlgpdzmkxpo/chart.png) 
CHASING HURRICANES
Some of the more established environmental experts who have moved across to finance say the rewards are not just financial.
Rob Bailey, director of climate resilience at consulting firm Marsh & McLennan's research unit, previously worked for Oxfam and international affairs think-tank Chatham House.
""I can deploy the knowledge in a different way and working with different stakeholders is quite invigorating,"" he said. 
Some specialists are also drawn by the challenging and often highly technical nature of the work.
For example quantitative analyst Velez, who moved to Lombard Odier last year, is building a tool that links assets to near real-time environmental and geospatial data tracking hurricane risk and pollution.
Swiss bank UBS, meanwhile, has recruited people for its Evidence Lab analyst team with experience across a range of disciplines including geomodelling and hydromodelling in recent years.
""We had to adopt new recruitment strategies and methods to find people with these skills who weren't looking for a job in financial services,"" said Barry Hurewitz, global head of UBS Evidence Lab Innovations. 
Finance firms across the board told Reuters they were expanding scientific and sustainability teams.
Asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR) said it has more than 10 staff with scientific backgrounds in its insurance-linked securities team, including people with PhDs in climatology. Its sustainable investing team has grown by four people to 22 in the last year and is planning further expansion.
Britain's biggest domestic bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY) has more than doubled the number of staff with core sustainability roles in a year, to over 40, while Zurich Insurance said it had expanded its team researching the modelling of wind, flood, cyber and climate risks, to seven from one in five years.
'PART OF THE MACHINE'
The demand for green expertise is partly being driven by tightening climate regulation on financial services firms in Britain, Europe and beyond.
Euro zone banks will be expected to take climate change into account when making loans or investing, for instance. Funds in the EU will have to disclose how sustainable their products are, while UK lenders could face tougher capital requirements for polluting assets held on their books.
Yet while companies say they are making progress, some charities say they are still playing catch-up.
""In my experience finance firms don't have a great depth of knowledge across the piste. Their skill sets are massively tilted towards the past,"" said Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace UK.
Better hiring must be matched by strategy changes at the top, according to the charities. While many large financial services firms have pledged to decarbonise their lending and portfolios in the coming years, most remain exposed to fossil fuels in some way, they say. 
""If you just have a bunch of sustainability officers who are kind of shoved off to the side and are effectively there to help with greenwashing, that's not going to really change the results very much,"" said Ben Cushing, campaign manager for financial advocacy at U.S.-based environmental group Sierra Club.

(Reuters) - Publicis, the world's third-largest advertising group, on Thursday beat market expectations as it returned to organic growth for the first time since before the pandemic, fuelled by high demand for digital advertising in the United States.
In the face of growing domination by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, the Paris-based group is striving to move from traditional print and TV ads to targeted digital campaigns steered by data.
In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun said the return to growth demonstrated that ""the acceleration towards digital channels, data, and commerce in general is a tidal wave accelerated by the crisis.""
Underlying sales in the United States, Publicis' biggest market where it generates more than half of its revenues, grew by 5.1% in the quarter, while Asia posted a growth of 5.7%.
The strong U.S. performance was driven by Publicis' digital business Sapient, which increased its revenues by 11%, while the data company Epsilon, acquired in 2019, bore fruit for a second consecutive quarter with nearly 5% growth.
On group level, underlying sales grew by 2.8% to 2.4 billion euros ($2.87 billion) in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year when the emerging COVID-19 crisis pummelled the sector and clients sliced advertising budgets to save cash.
Analysts had expected an organic decline of 2.0% for the quarter, according to a company-provided poll.
The key metric benefited from new business wins such as L'Oréal (PA:OREP)'s media business in China, Toyota in Australia, and Samsung (KS:005930) media in the United States, the company said.
Publicis, home to ad agencies such as Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, did not provide an earnings outlook for the full year but said it expected to report organic growth between 8% and 10% in the second quarter.

The issue is a key one for companies that have not been identified but that gave information to the Texas attorney general's office for its investigation and fear that their confidential data, like strategic business plans or discussions about negotiations, could be disclosed to Google executives.
The order issued by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas allows Google's in-house counsel to see information deemed ""confidential"" but they are then limited in advising on some competitive and other decision-making for two years regarding the companies whose data they see.
In-house counsel for Google is barred from seeing ""highly confidential"" information under the order unless it is given permission by the court or the affected company. 
The Texas lawsuit accuses Google of violating the law in how it dominates the process of placing ads online. It alleges Google quietly teams with its closest online advertising competitor,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and that it uses the excuse of protecting users' privacy to act unfairly. Publishers complain that one result has been lower revenues. 
Google denies any wrongdoing.
It is one of three big antitrust lawsuits filed against Google last year.

The protective order also requires people who receive confidential and highly confidential information to agree to allow electronic devices used in their work on the lawsuit to be searched if needed as part of a forensic investigation into a potential leak.

In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.11% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.04%.
China’s Shanghai Composite slid 1.14% while the Shenzhen Component fell 1.08%. Investors are also monitoring the selloff in  China Huarong Asset Management  Co. Ltd.

Data on China’s GDP, industrial production and fixed asset investment is due on Friday. The U.S. will also release data including industrial production and retail sales later in the day.
Coinbase slipped back below its opening price after soaring above a $112 billion valuation earlier in its debut on Wednesday. Fellow cryptocurrency Bitcoin also tumbled from its record high touched earlier in the week.
Treasuries also steadied after slipping during the previous session, even as the benchmark 10-year yield remained far from its highs at 1.64%.
With global stocks near record levels, investors are on the lookout for catalysts as companies report their first-quarter earnings.
However, investors also remain sensitive to any signs of a setback in the global economic recovery from COVID-19, including new waves of cases in countries such as India and the challenges in the global vaccine rollout. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s immunization panel’s review of Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine on Wednesday ended without a vote, in effect extending the halt on the use of the vaccine.

Luo Huining, the director at China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, was speaking at a ceremony to mark National Security Education Day, which authorities have organised to promote the sweeping legislation China imposed last year.
""We will give a lesson to all foreign forces which intend to use Hong Kong as a pawn,"" Luo said. 
The new law drew criticism from the West for curbing rights and freedoms in the former British colony, which was promised a high degree of autonomy upon its 1997 return to Chinese rule. Its supporters say it has restored order following mass anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.
China, the United States, Britain and the European Union have traded sanctions over the past year as the security law and measures taken to reduce democratic representation in the city's institutions exacerbated tensions.
Earlier this week, a letter signed by more than 100 British politicians asked Boris Johnson's government to expand a list of Chinese officials accused of ""gross human rights abuses"".
National Security Education Day will be marked with school activities, games and shows, and a parade by police and other services performing the Chinese military's ""goose step"" march.
In line with Beijing's increased assertiveness, the Chinese routine, in which troops keep their legs rigidly straight when lifting them off the ground and arms swing at a 90-degree angle in front of the chest, will replace British-style foot drills at a parade of police and other forces. 
Elsewhere, in schools and cultural centres, Hong Kongers were invited to build national security ""mosaic walls"" to instil, according to a government website, the idea that people should work together to protect their homeland.
Stickers and bookmarks reading ""Uphold National Security, Safeguard our Home"" have been delivered to schools and kindergartens.

In February, Hong Kong unveiled national security education guidelines that include teaching students as young as six about colluding with foreign forces, terrorism, secession and subversion - the four main crimes in the new law.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee will hold an April 22 hearing on President Joe Biden's three nominees to serve on the U.S. Postal Board of Governors, the panel announced Wednesday.
The announcement comes after the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in March outlined a proposed 10-year strategic plan that would slow current first-class delivery standards and raise some prices to stem $160 billion in forecasted red ink over the next decade. 
The plan has drawn criticism from many U.S. lawmakers including some calling for the board to fire Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and others who have urged Biden to remove the existing board members.
DeJoy, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, was named head of the Postal Service last year. After heavy criticism, DeJoy suspended operational changes in August ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Democrats said the service cuts were an attempt to boost Trump’s re-election chances. DeJoy denied that and in testimony before Congress noted USPS delivered more than 135 million ballots ahead of the 2020 elections and ""went to extraordinary lengths"" to get ballots delivered.
Biden nominated Anton Hajjar, former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union; Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a non-partisan non-profit dedicated to expanding vote-by-mail systems and former elections official in Denver; and Ron Stroman, a former deputy postmaster general.
The six current board members and DeJoy are all white men and the board's lack of diversity has also come under criticism.
USPS officials told Reuters last month they were optimistic Congress will pass financial reforms providing the money-losing agency with as much as $60 billion in relief. DeJoy has warned without changes USPS would need a ""government bailout.""
Representative Carolyn Maloney, who chairs the committee overseeing USPS, has circulated draft legislation that would eliminate a requirement USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits. It also would require postal employees to enroll in government-retiree health plan Medicare. 
USPS reported net losses of $86.7 billion since 2007. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree health care and pension liabilities, a requirement labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses.

DeJoy's revamp plan would revise existing one-to-three-day service standards for first-class mail letters to one to five days. USPS said 61% of current first-class mail volume would stay at its current standard.

Activist groups say the restrictions - outlined in voting rights bills already passed in Georgia and being weighed in, among others, Texas and Arizona - are specifically targeting Black people and other racial minorities.
""We all should feel a responsibility to defend the right to vote and oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot,"" the companies said in a letter published as a two-page advertisement https://nyti.ms/3e0fvnL in Wednesday's New York Times.
The statement was the initiative of former  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault and Merck & Co CEO Ken Frazier. 
""It was important for companies to assert some of the core principles of our democracy and the most fundamental is the right to vote,"" Chenault said in an interview with Reuters. 
The two executives pushed for companies to take a stance on a Zoom call with about 100 CEOs, investors, lawyers and corporate directors on Saturday. 
Republican lawmakers have criticized CEOs for speaking out on the issue. Chenault said the group that sponsored the letter, which includes the Black Economic Alliance, was not going to be ""prescriptive"" about how companies should voice their opposition to specific pieces of legislation.
Republicans across the country are using former President Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity.
Opponents of the moves say they are intended to disenfranchise citizens who tend not to vote Republican.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, the top executives of more than three dozen Michigan-based companies, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford proactively opposed Republican-backed legislation that could restrict voting there.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) were not among the signatories of the Wednesday letter, but have put out individual statements calling the voting curbs in Georgia ""unacceptable"".

Delta declined to comment on Wednesday's letter. Coca-Cola said it had not seen the letter but was open to hearing the perspective of the Black Economic Alliance.
""We’re continuing dialogue,"" Chenault said.

The move comes as the top Australian building materials maker is looking to exit the United States, in a retreat from its global expansion strategy that led to a hefty writedown in 2020.
Boral's $1.8 billion acquisition of rival Headwaters in 2016 made the combined entity the largest supplier of fly ash in U.S. markets. However, since then, it has led to an impairment charge and earnings downgrades amid a soft housing market and a push towards cleaner forms of energy generation. 
""We... remain confident in the long term demand dynamics for the industry, including significant incremental demand growth potential from the U.S. government's proposed new infrastructure program"", Zlatko Todorcevski, chief executive officer, said in a statement.
Todorcevski was brought on-board by Boral in July last year, with a mandate to review the U.S. business. 
New opportunities for supply exist from harvesting landfills and imports, he added, which is expected to more than offset the decline in fresh fly ash supply as the U.S. transitions away from coal fired power generation. 
Boral said it has appointed advisors for the assessment and will provide an update at its full year results announcement in August, or earlier.

(Reuters) - Three of e-commerce platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)'s seven top executives will be leaving the company in the coming months, chief executive officer and founder of Canada's most valuable company Tobi Lutke said in a blog post on Wednesday.
The company's chief talent officer, chief legal officer and chief technology officer will all transition out of their roles, Lutke said, adding that they have been ""spectacular and deserve to take a bow.""
""Each one of them has their individual reasons but what was unanimous with all three was that this was the best for them and the best for Shopify,"" he said.
The trio follow the departure of Craig Miller, chief product officer, in September. Lutke took on the role in addition to CEO.
Shopify, which provides infrastructure for online stores, has seen its valuation soar in the last year as many businesses went virtual during COVID-19 lockdowns. It has a market cap valuation of C$182.7 billion ($146 billion), above Canada's top lender Royal Bank of Canada.
It is Canada's biggest homegrown tech success story, founded in 2006 and supporting over 1 million businesses globally, according to the company.
""We have a phenomenally strong bench of leaders who will now step up into larger roles,"" Lutke said, but did not name replacements.
Shopify said in February revenue growth would slow this year as vaccine rollouts encourage people to return to stores and warned it does not expect 2020's near doubling of gross merchandise volume, an industry metric to measure transaction volumes, to repeat this year.
Chief talent officer, Brittany Forsyth, was the 22nd employee hired at Shopify and has been with the company for 11 years. She said on Twitter that post-Shopify she would be focusing on Backbone Angels, an all-female collective of angel investors she co-founded in March.
Shopify shares fell 5.1% while the benchmark Canadian share index ended marginally down.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",Ford details new production cuts due to global chip shortage,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co on Wednesday outlined another series of plant shutdowns due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, with five facilities in the United States and one in Turkey affected.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker did not outline how many vehicles would be lost in the latest actions, and reiterated it intends to provide an update on the financial impact of the chip shortage with its quarterly earnings on April 28, suggesting the hit could be bigger than initially forecast. 
Ford said in March it expected the semiconductor shortage to cost between $1 billion and $2.5 billion. While the company has prioritized chips for its highest-profit vehicles, it has been forced at times to idle production of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup, and it has parked some of those trucks for final assembly later when enough chips are in hand. 
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company this month announced production cuts during the weeks of April 19 and 26 at plants in Chicago, Flat Rock, Michigan, and Kansas City, as well as implementing a reduced schedule at its Ohio Assembly Plant, the latest in a string of chip-related curtailments.
It also set downtime for its Louisville, Kentucky, truck plant the weeks of April 26 and May 3, and its van plant in Golcuk, Turkey, from May 8 to May 31. However, Ford hopes to offset some of the losses in Turkey by pulling forward downtime scheduled later in the year.
Semiconductors are used extensively in cars, including to monitor engine performance, manage steering or automatic windows, and in sensors used in parking and entertainment systems.
Ford said in addition to the chip shortage, other factors driving the shutdowns included the previously reported fire at Renesas Electronics Corp's chip-making factory in Japan and prior severe winter storms in Texas.
Industry research firm AutoForecast Solutions estimated lost production of almost 408,000 vehicles for Ford due to the shortage, with Wednesday's actions accounting for more than 91,300 of that total.
Also on Wednesday, Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co announced downtime in April for its plants in Smyrna, Tennessee; Canton, Mississippi, and Aguascalientes, Mexico, due to the shortage.
Japan's Honda Motor Co said it may cut production at some of its North American plants the week of April 19 due to the chip shortage and other factors, calling the situation ""fluid."" German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) idled production of its Tiguan crossover vehicle at its Puebla, Mexico, plant on Wednesday and Thursday.
Industry officials have previously said the shortage would be worse in the second quarter than the first. Ford's larger U.S. rival, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), previously said it expected the financial impact of the chip shortage to shave as much as $2 billion from profit. 
It was not clear if chip supplies will recover in the third quarter and whether automakers can make up all the lost production later this year.

Many North American automakers canceled chip orders after plants were shut for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, while demand surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. 
That has now left carmakers competing for chips.

Because solar is one of the most popular renewable energy sources, shares of companies in the sector have been surging over the past year. Furthermore, President Biden’s interest in the electrification of vehicles over the next few years is motivating various solar companies to find efficient ways to charge electric vehicles with solar power.
Given the current industry tailwinds, Wall Street is placing huge bets on the solar industry. This has driven a rally in solar stocks, as evidenced by Invesco Solar Portfolio ETF’s (TAN) 210.4% returns over the past year versus S&P 500’s 50% gains.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Wednesday, as the Fed's Beige Book report stoked inflation jitters somewhat offsetting intraday optimism following earnings from Wall Street banks that topped estimates.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, after hitting a record intraday high of 4,151.97, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.16%, or 54 points, but had hit a record of 33,911.25, and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.99%.
Many districts reported moderate price increases, with some saying prices rose more robustly, according to the Fed's Beige Book report. ""Contacts generally expect continued price increases in the near term.""
Still, many are betting that bullish quarterly earnings will sustain bullish bets on the broader market.    
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported results that beat on both top and bottom lines.
Goldman Sachs was the standout performer as first-quarter earnings of $18.60 a share came in well above estimates of $10.19 a share, led by record investment banking revenue and a jump in trading revenue.
Goldman Sachs' Q1 performance was ""very strong,"" and showed ""remarkable revenue generation,"" UBS said.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), meanwhile, reported earnings that topped estimates, but a 16% decline in sales and softer guidance pressured its shares to fall 12%.
“The co. highlighted continued positive trends in 1Q QTD. Still, its 1Q sales guidance of 40% is below the cons. of 46%,” UBS said.
Beyond earnings,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) delivered a positive update on its vaccine, easing some of the concern following the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine setback on Tuesday.
Moderna said late-Tuesday that new data show its vaccine is more than 90% effective six months after the second shot, sending its shares nearly 7% higher.
Energy, meanwhile, followed oil prices higher as data showed U.S. crude inventories fell more than expected, stoking optimism that energy demand remains firm.
U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 6 million barrels, well above the 2.9 million barrel decline expected.
Technology stuttered following its run higher as rising bond yields, which had weighed on growth stocks, appears to be running out of steam.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the so-called Fab 5, were lower.
In other news,  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) ended up 31% higher after making its public market debut through a direct listing at $381 per share, up from the reference price of $250.  
Coinbase's current business model has come under security amid concerns that increased competition will eventually cut into the company's high trading fees, which make up more than 90% of revenue.
But Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has suggested the company is investing in other business streams to generate more stable revenue that could eventually make up about half of total revenue, easing the reliance on trading fees.  "
987,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>",Oil Prices up Most in a Month After Big U.S. Crude Draw,"By Liz Moyer and Barani Krishnan
Investing.com - Oil prices rose about 5% on Wednesday, their largest gain in a month, after weekly U.S. government data showed a surprisingly large drop in crude stockpiles ostensibly caused by anemic production from the Permian shale basin that once flooded the market. 
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for U.S. crude, settled up $2.97 cents, or 4.9%, at $59.64 per barrel. 
London-traded Brent, the global benchmark for crude, settled up $2.91, or 4.6%, at $66.58.  
WTI broke from weeks of being boxed in at between $57 and $60 while Brent unshackled itself from a $61 to $63 range after bullish inventory numbers for the week ended April 9 released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The EIA said crude stockpiles dropped 5.899 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 2.889 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories rose 309,000 barrels last week the EIA said, compared with expectations for a 786,000-barrel build.
Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped 2.083 million barrels in the week against expectations for a build of 971,000 barrels, the EIA data showed.
Gasoline production actually increased last week to 9.6 million bpd on the average, according to the EIA.
Traffic in key U.S. urban areas, including New York, have been hitting peaks over the past week as many of the country’s 50 states pressed on with economic reopenings from the pandemic, helped by a dynamic federal vaccine program.
While that explained the higher consumption of fuels such as gasoline and diesel, the staggering slump in crude stockpiles remained an enigma, given that U.S. crude exports also fell sharply by a net of nearly 6.0 million barrels for the week ended April 9.
That led some to think the only conceivable explanation to be the slide in Permian production, which has been struggling to recover since year's industry-wide shutdown that took out many of the rigs on the one-time prolific shale oil basin. The Permian is about 250 miles wide and 300 miles long, spanning parts of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico and includes the highly-productive Delaware and Midland sub-basins.
“A year ago, U.S. crude production, as a whole, was a record 13.1 million barrels daily but now, despite an upward adjustment of 100,000 last week, we are barely at above 11 million barrels a day, and that shows the spigots at the Permian aren’t fully open,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge Again Capital. “This is despite the number of oil rigs on the ground having almost doubled from the lows of the pandemic. “
The U.S. oil rig count, a measure of future production, stood at 337 last week versus a mid-August low of 172."
988,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>",Coinbase valued at $83 billion in choppy Nasdaq debut,"By Echo Wang
(Reuters) -Shares in Coinbase Global Inc had a choppy Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, with the cryptocurrency exchange's valuation swinging from as high as $112 billion to as low as $83 billion. 
Coinbase's stock market debut, done through a direct listing where no shares are sold ahead of the opening, marks another milestone in the development of bitcoin and other digital assets. 
It comes amid a surge in the value of cryptocurrencies which has lured a clutch of mainstream, top-tier firms dive into the space.
Coinbase's stock opened at $381 per share, up 52.4% from a reference price of $250 per share set on Tuesday though only 10.9% above the $343.58 volume-weighted average price Coinbase's shares were trading at privately in the first quarter of 2021. 
The stock reversed gains to trade at around $318 at 3:02pm eastern time. At $318, Coinbase has a fully diluted valuation, which includes unvested stock options and restricted stocks, of $83 billion and a market capitalization of $63.3 billion.
By comparison, New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc has a market cap of around $66 billion. 
Founded in 2012, the San Francisco-based firm boasts 56 million users globally and an estimated $223 billion assets on its platform, accounting for 11.3% of crypto asset market share, regulatory filings showed.
""We're just very grateful to be able to bring transparency to the crypto economy, the ecosystem that we've all been building over the last 10 years,"" Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said in an interview. 
""It just brings this level of recognition that this is an industry that is here, that is growing, and that (is not just) in the corners.""
Coinbase was valued at just under $6 billion as recently as September, but has surged in line with bitcoin's gains this year. 
The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency hit a record of over $63,000 on Tuesday and has more than doubled in value this year as banks and companies warmed to the emerging asset. 
BEHOLDEN TO BITCOIN?
The company's most recent financial results underscore how revenues have surged in lock-step with the rally in bitcoin trading volumes and price.
In the first quarter of the year, as bitcoin more than doubled in price, Coinbase estimated revenue of over $1.8 billion and net income between $730 million and $800 million, versus revenue of $1.3 billion for the entire 2020.
""The correlation to bitcoin will be very high after the stock stabilizes after listing,"" said Larry Cermak, director of research at crypto website The Block.
""When the price of bitcoin goes down, it's inevitable that Coinbase's revenue and inherently the price of the stock will decline as well.""

Regulatory risks also loom, others said, as Coinbase increases the number of digital assets users can trade on its platform.
Coinbase last year suspended trading in major digital currency XRP after U.S. regulators charged associated blockchain firm Ripple with a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Ripple has denied the charges.

Investing -- Earnings season got off with a bang on Wednesday, driven by better-than-expected results from three of the biggest U.S. banks.
Stocks soared on the news but later gave back their gains. Bitcoin surged above $64,000 as  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) made its public debut on Nasdaq. The tech and industrial sectors hit all-time highs.
In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve released its Beige Book, a periodic report about local business conditions in its 12 member districts. Investors looked to it for inflation trends as the economy across the country continues to reopen.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a virtual conference on Wednesday that the central bank was unlikely to raise interest rates soon, and had a three-part test to decide when that time does come. He added that now was not the time to prioritize the deficit. 
It’s just the start of earnings season, so reports continue to pour out Thursday and Friday. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow. 
1. Chip earnings in focus
Chip stocks have been under the microscope as a worldwide shortage has forced manufacturers to shut down temporarily. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has promised to spend $20 billion to build two new factories in the coming years. 
Rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reports earnings on Thursday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of 92.6 cents on revenue of $12.79 billion.
2. Banks continue to make a splash
More bank earnings come out after three big ones beat expectations on Wednesday. Banks with significant capital markets and investment banking activities are benefiting from the booming market and wave of IPOs.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) to report earnings per share of 65.5 cents on revenue of $21.85 billion and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) to report EPS of $2.52 on revenue of $18.67 billion.
3. Airlines start to stage a come back
Travel-related stocks such as cruise operators and airlines have roared back after languishing during last year’s lockdowns. But they still have quite a bit of ground to make up, and that struggle continues to show up in their earnings. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) will be the latest to report on Thursday. Analysts expect a loss of $2.84 a share and revenue of just over $4 billion.

So, we think Wood favorites Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), and Zillow (Z), which could witness a pullback in the near term, are best avoided now.Renowned investor Cathie Wood has made her name by betting against market trends. With more than $50 billion in assets under management (AUM), Wood can afford to sustain short-term losses in pursuit of big long-term gains. In contrarian investing, it often takes considerable time for an investment to deliver a desired return on investment. However, retail investors with limited access to capital might be forced to exit their positions in the short run and thus register losses on such bets.
With the U.S. economy making a faster-than-anticipated recovery, some of the most profitable stocks that gained on account of the COVID-19 pandemic have been witnessing a decline in revenues and earnings. Their share prices are declining too. While major billion-dollar businesses have witnessed a short-term pullback amid the impending economic recovery, they are expected to recover once markets stabilize post-pandemic. However, we think investors with limited funds should avoid investing in such stocks in April.
Thus, retail investors with relatively low risk tolerance should avoid Cathie Wood’s top picks  Shopify Inc . (SHOP),  Spotify Technology  S.A. (SPOT) and Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG), Inc. (Z), given these stocks’ weak near-term prospects of these stocks.

(Reuters) - Will people break their lockdown snacking habit once the pandemic eases? 
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc's results on Thursday will give investors a glimpse of how widespread vaccinations impacted snack sales at the soda giant.
The company's snacks as well as its healthier options such as Off the Eaten Path have seen brisk sales during the pandemic, helping offset a weak market for sodas in some international markets due to fewer social events and limited openings of theaters and restaurants. 
""We would expect the majority of investor focus to be less around the quarter and more likely pacing for the rest of the year,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira said. 
Rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) - which is more reliant on a return to normalcy due to its heavy dependence on soda sales, especially to theaters, restaurants and social events - will report on April 19.
""A lot of people are really underestimating the potential for millions of people working from home ... This increases number of food occasion at home, especially breakfast and snacking, which is right in PepsiCo's wheelhouse,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. 
THE CONTEXT
An intense vaccination drive, a gradual reopening of the economies and an eagerness to return to pre-pandemic lifestyle raise questions on whether the current snacking trend will continue. 
Prices are rising for raw materials, transportation and other input costs and investors will look at PepsiCo's plans to tackle these expenses. Some like Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc are already considering price hikes.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and South Korean joint-venture partner LG Chem Ltd will announce a second U.S. battery cell manufacturing plant on Friday, revealing plans for a $2.3 billion factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, three people familiar with the matter said.
The plant will use a different, more cost-effective battery chemistry than the one the companies will offer from the joint-venture plant they are building in Lordstown, Ohio, the sources said on Wednesday. 
The battery will be for the Cadillac Lyriq electric crossover vehicle that GM will begin building at its nearby Spring Hill assembly plant next year, the sources said.
The timing of the Tennessee battery plant's opening is unclear, but there will be a period when the battery is supplied for the Lyriq by another LG facility until the Tennessee plant opens and it will not come from Lordstown, one of the sources said. 
GM would not confirm the details and declined further comment, and a spokesman for LG did not have an immediate comment. A Tennessee economic development spokeswoman also declined to comment.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker previously said it was exploring the feasibility of another U.S. battery cell plant with LG's battery unit, LG Energy Solution, via its Ultium Cells LLC joint venture.
Sources previously told Reuters that GM and LG Chem were in advanced talks with Tennessee officials, and that the plant there would be similar in scope to the $2.3 billion Lordstown plant. 
GM said in October it would invest $2 billion in Spring Hill to build EVs. The Detroit automaker said last year it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years.
Sources previously said GM would need more battery plants beyond the Tennessee one to meet aggressive EV targets. GM has set a target in January of halting sales of light-duty gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.
LG Energy said last month it planned to invest more than $4.5 billion in U.S. battery production over the next four years, including plans to build at least two new plants.

LG had been embroiled in a high-profile dispute with rival South Korean firm SK Innovation in the United States after LG alleged SK stole trade secrets, but the companies settled that and other disputes with SK agreeing to pay $1.8 billion to LG.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish conglomerate Acciona is stepping up preparations for a stock market listing of its renewable energy unit and has hired banks to lead the deal which is expected to value the business at more than 8 billion euros ($9.6 billion), three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have been appointed as global coordinators for the deal, the sources said, a key step on the path to listing. 
Shareholders gave their blessing on Monday to Acciona's plan to spin off the renewable energy generation and supply business which brings in most of its money, and sell at least a 25% stake in it.
Acciona, Citi and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
Renewable energy has become an increasingly popular sector for investors worldwide as governments and corporations try to wean themselves off fossil fuels and stem climate change.
With wind farms in the United States, Australia, Spain, Chile and Mexico, Acciona plans to plough proceeds from the sale into nearly doubling generation capacity to 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2025. It will also use the money to pay down debt. 
Chief Executive Jose Manuel Entrecanales, whose family controls around 55% of the parent company, has said he wanted to do the deal in the first half of this year. 
Entrecanales has declined to say how much money Acciona hopes to raise, but the people familiar with the matter said it was looking for a valuation of 10 times the unit's 2020 core earnings of 831 million euros.
A third person familiar with the matter said the deal could value the business at more than 10 billion euros.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 01:15PM ET</span>","As bank earnings roll in, a mixed picture for loans","By Dan Burns
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank and often heralded as a bellwether for the economy, on Wednesday reported an eye-popping increase in its profit for the first quarter.
Absent from the results, however, was firm evidence that consumers and Main Street businesses are itching for more credit, after a year of pandemic-induced hibernation, to fuel further growth in the economy.
Indeed, the bank credit picture as the first quarter ended was decidedly mixed, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data, with some indications that consumer credit demand is coming back to life but demand for bread-and-butter business loans remains lacking.
U.S. consumer credit - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/BANKS/xklpyydddpg/chart.png
CONSUMER CREDIT
The Fed's most recent data on consumer credit overall dates from February, which saw the strongest growth - nearly $27.6 billion - in three years. At more than $4.2 trillion overall, it has more or less climbed back to its pre-pandemic record level from February 2020.
Credit card balances are ticking higher - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/BANKS/jbyvrwkqgpe/chart.png
CREDIT CARDS
The Fed offers a weekly snapshot of U.S. commercial banks' balance sheets, and for most of the last year that showed consumers had been doing one thing with their credit cards: paying them off. 
Outstanding balances on bank-sponsored credit cards tumbled by roughly $115 billion between March 2020 and February 2021.
Since then, though, balances have ticked up by about $10 billion and are their highest since early December. 
Auto loans have been a source of strength - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/BANKS/qmypmlkbbvr/chart.png
AUTO LOANS
Car loans have been a surprising source of strength during the pandemic. Even as consumers slashed credit card spending, they did shell out for big ticket items like cars and trucks. U.S. vehicle sales recovered quite quickly starting late last spring, and auto loans from U.S. banks are at a record high.
Demand for commercial & industrial loans is weak - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/BANKS/jznpnakxmvl/chart.png
BUSINESS LOAN DEMAND
It has been a very different picture for bread-and-butter business loans. The Fed's most recent quarterly survey of bank loan officers, from January, showed only slight improvement in the business loan demand outlook as 2021 began.
Commercial & Industrial bank loans - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/BANKS/ygdpzlddepw/chart.png
C&I LOANS
That soft demand outlook may stem from the fact that businesses loaded up on loans roughly a year ago as the pandemic began, and with little to spend it on since are now flush with cash.
Early in the pandemic, the top 25 U.S. banks saw an explosion in their commercial and industrial loan books as larger companies tapped their lines of credit to ensure they had cash as the crisis unfolded.
Roughly a month or so after that, the C&I demand boom hit smaller banks as companies took out loans under the Payroll Protection Program that was part of the initial wave of pandemic relief measures enacted by Congress last year.
Since then, however, C&I loan levels have drifted steadily lower and are now their lowest in a year.
Wall Street vs Main Street - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/BANKS/bdwpkbejavm/chart.png
WALL STREET WINS
Still, there's been no shortage of credit provided overall by U.S. banks in the last year. It's just that most of it went to Wall Street rather than Main Street.

Total bank credit, at more than $15.2 trillion at the end of March, rose by more than $1 trillion in the last year. Wall Street's share of that - as represented by the percentage of securities out of total credit - shot up by around 5 percentage points in the last year and now accounts for roughly a third of all bank lending. That's another record for Wall Street.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. hearing on China competition told research funding falling behind,"By David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. investment in research and development has reached its lowest level decades while that in the rest of the world has soared, the head of a U.S. Senate committee warned at a hearing on proposed subsidies to the tech industry to help the United States better compete with China. 
Senate Commerce committee chair Maria Cantwell told the committee on Wednesday the proposed ""Endless Frontier Act"" had been the stimulus for a big debate about America's competitiveness.
Federal investment in research and development is at its lowest in 45 years when measured against GDP, Cantwell said.
""This comes as international competition is increasing, and other nations are ready to challenge our position on the world's innovation stage.""
The ranking member of the committee, Republican Senator Roger Wicker, said it appeared the intent of the legislation was to help America compete with China, but that the United States would not beat China by copying its ""top-down program"" of research and investment and government subsidies. 
""Strategic investments in technologies and supply chains are important, but we will not win by simply throwing money at the problem,"" Wicker said. ""We could actually end up doing harm if recipients of funding through this concept lack the capacity and capability to conduct R&D activities that are actually useful."" 
The Endless Frontier Act was first proposed in 2020 calling for $110 billion over five years to advance U.S. technology efforts, co-sponsored by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator Todd Young.
INVESTMENT PLAN
Schumer also wants to move legislation on boosting U.S. semiconductor production. Both proposals could total $200 billion, congressional aides said.
President Joe Biden has proposed a sweeping infrastructure investment plan that could provide funds for semiconductors, though it is unclear just how the various funding initiatives will be ironed out between the administration and Congress. 
Biden has also sought solutions to a chip shortage that has squeezed U.S. automakers competing against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Several U.S. tech industry groups on Wednesday wrote to Congress and White House officials urging them to not set aside new semiconductor manufacturing capacity for older chips as part of appropriations for the CHIPS for America Act, another plan to boost U.S. semiconductor supply chains.
The letter signals a growing rift between the two U.S. industries, with tech companies arguing that reserved capacity for legacy chips used by automakers would be market distorting. 

""The competition among the rest of America's chip-consuming industries for this artificially tightened chip supply will translate into higher costs for companies and their customers, including American taxpayers,"" the letter from the tech lobbies, including the Information Technology Industry Council, said.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",Analysis: Hot or cold war? Investors try to second guess Russia's military manoeuvres,"By Tom Arnold, Natalia Zinets and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Fund managers are trimming exposure to Russia and Ukraine on fears that years of tensions could finally erupt into outright war, bringing economic ruin for Ukraine and more sanctions on Russia.
But with largest build up of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and uncompromising rhetoric from the Kremlin, some investors feel market positioning is still not cautious enough.
""People are very sanguine,"" said Tim Ash, senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""I've covered Ukraine for 33 years, including 2014, and it looks pretty serious. I'm surprised the market reaction is not perhaps a bit more aggressive really."" 
Concerns about an escalation, including the immediate threat of sanctions, were partly assuaged after a phone call on Tuesday between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in which Biden proposed a summit meeting between the pair and stressed U.S. commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity. The Kremlin said it would study Biden's proposal.
Aberdeen Standard Investments, with around $640 billion in assets under management, reduced some rouble exposure before the latest escalation, but remains exposed to Russia and Ukraine bonds.
""It is not great news to see that escalation but I think the stakes on both sides are quite high to not go into a full blown conflict,"" said Viktor Szabo, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""We know that occupying and rebuilding Donbass would come at an extremely high cost for Russia, in terms of financials, in terms of lives and in terms of sanctions.""
So far assets don't appear to be pricing in full-blown war, despite some sell-off in recent weeks as tensions ratcheted up.
Russia's rouble on Wednesday scaled two week highs, while dollar-denominated sovereign bonds recovered from a near 12-month trough as investors bet Tuesday's phone call might keep sanctions off the table for now.
Ukraine's international bonds and GDP warrants, which hand investors a payment if economic growth surpasses certain thresholds, also rallied to two week highs after languishing near five-month lows.
The cost of insuring the pair's sovereign debt, as measured by five-year credit default swaps, are a long way off the highs of early 2015, the last time serious fighting flared between the two nations.

ECONOMY WORRIES
Some investors have pared risk. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said last week it had moved to market-weight from over-weight on Russian local bonds and the Russian rouble.
""I have started to build a short position (on Russia),"" said Trium Capital portfolio manager Peter Kisler.
""I'm expecting the situation to get worse before it gets better."" 
Jupiter Asset Management exited its holdings of Ukraine's GDP warrants a couple of weeks ago when negative headlines first began to emerge, said Reza Karim, assistant fund manager, EM Debt, Jupiter Asset Management.
The volume of local bond holdings held by foreign portfolio investors has been declining since late March.
Ukraine is vulnerable to any conflict escalation with an economy much smaller than Russia's, as well as weaker reserves, more feeble fiscal and current account positions and larger debt.
The tensions with Russia and a recent spike in COVID-19 infections threaten Ukraine's economic recovery from the pandemic and prospects for GDP warrant holders. 
In its first payout to the holders of the warrants, included as part of the government's 2015 debt restructuring, Ukraine is due to pay about $40 million in May based on 2019 GDP growth of 3.2%.
Kyiv's Ministry of Finance said planned domestic borrowing for 2021 was on track and it did not see liquidity risks for making any payments, including obligations under the warrants.
""The domestic story in Ukraine, barring the political risk aspect of it, is actually pretty decent,"" said Jupiter's Karim.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) last week said it saw value in Ukraine's international 2024 and 2026 bonds, calling recent dips in GDP warrants a ""buying opportunity"".
For Russia, the risk revolves around sanctions, a familiar headache for investors in Moscow's assets. 
Many asset managers, such as Jupiter and BlueBay, have built up defensive positions in recent months as the prospect has risen of penalties from the Biden administration in retaliation for alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and cyber hacks. Moscow denies interfering.
An invasion of Ukraine would raise the threat still further, with everything from financing curbs on major Russian businesses to restrictions on sovereign rouble-denominated debt potential targets, say analysts.
U.S. investors have already been banned from buying new dollar-denominated Russian debt since 2014.
The share of foreign investors among holders of the OFZ treasury bonds has fallen this year to near five-year lows.
And while domestic borrowing may become trickier under further sanctions, Russia's longer-term economic growth may be most at risk.
""It's a slow-grind weakening of the macro story in terms of growth and living standards,"" said BlueBay's Ash.
""Even with oil prices around $60-70 a barrel and a strong balance sheet, Russia's potential growth is probably less than 2% because foreigners and Russians don't invest, presumably due to concerns around geopolitics.""

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - While the blank-check deals market reached new heights this week with Grab Holdings' record $40 billion merger, some lawyers and regulatory experts said the exuberance was unlikely to last as the U.S. securities watchdog steps up scrutiny of such deals. 
Southeast Asia's largest ride-hailing and food delivery firm on Tuesday clinched a merger with special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, Altimeter Growth Corp, paving the way for a U.S. listing and the biggest-ever blank-check company deal. 
The blockbuster merger underscores Wall Street's mania for the deals in which listed shells take private companies public, with a record $100 billion raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States this year. 
Amid growing worries the market is in a bubble that will hurt investors when it bursts, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been trying to rein-in deals by issuing public warnings and more closely scrutinizing deal filings. 
""The SEC seems to be banging every drum and waving every light it can find to make it clear to investors and companies that there's a lot of risk in SPACs,"" said Ty Gellasch, head of Washington-based think tank Healthy Markets. ""It seems like the SPAC mania is likely to peak very, very soon,"" he added.
The latest SEC action came on Monday in the form of new accounting guidance which suggested warrants issued by SPACs should be accounted for as liabilities instead of equity instruments. That will cause a headache for some SPACs that have to review and re-state their financials.
BurgerFi International Inc., which went public through a SPAC in December, postponed its earnings on Tuesday, saying it needed more time to assess the impact of the new SEC guidance. 
Although it is unlikely to deter companies from going public, the guidance ""validates the concern of some that the SEC has a persistent hostility towards SPACs,"" said Douglas Ellenoff, partner at law firm Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP.
Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years, SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company and take it public, allowing targets to sidestep the more onerous paperwork and regulatory checks faced by traditional initial public offerings. 
The boom has been fueled by easy monetary conditions as central banks pump cash into pandemic-hit economies, strong trading debuts, and a preference among start-ups for an easier and more private route to the public market. 
Investor advocates have warned for months, however, that many SPACs are wildly overvalued and that targets may be trying to evade regulatory scrutiny. That has led the SEC's new Democratic leadership to begin examining SPAC disclosures for misleading information and to warn of concerns over deal fees, conflicts and sponsor compensation.
Last week, the SEC's acting corporate finance director John Coates said he wasn't pro or anti SPAC, but that ""new issues with both standard and innovative SPAC structures keep surfacing."" 
The agency has also opened an inquiry into how Wall Street underwriters are managing the risks involved, seeking data on internal controls, and its enforcement unit is probing electric vehicle makers that went public via SPACs.
""The SEC is trying to be proactive here and not just react to what is likely to be an inevitable disaster,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner with law firm Moses & Singer. ""The Grab announcement shows that regulatory efforts to tamper down 'irrational exuberance' almost always lag behind investment trends.""
Still, with 434 SPACs boasting nearly $139 billion in cash looking for targets, according to information provider SPAC Research, lawyers were skeptical that the SEC's recent efforts would deflate the market in the near-term. 
Alan Annex, co-chair of Greenberg Traurig's global corporate practice, said the accounting changes were an easy fix for new SPACs and companies were still looking for deals.

""Within the next two weeks this accounting change will all be sorted.""

1012,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>","Goldman, JPMorgan Traders Show the Reddit Crowd How It’s Done","(Bloomberg) -- A quarter that began with retail investors declaring the end of the status quo on Wall Street just ended with big banks tallying surprisingly massive hauls.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) -- two of the most gilded names in finance -- kicked off bank earnings season with revenue windfalls from trading and dealmaking, defying warnings from within the industry that good times couldn’t last. The boon was thanks in part to the burgeoning optimism of little investors who tried to stage a trading revolution in January.
Goldman Sachs earned more from trading in the first three months of the year than it had in any quarter in the past decade, while JPMorgan saw such revenue climb 25%. Stock underwriters at both firms posted the most revenue ever after helping a flood of blank-check companies -- often known by their acronym SPAC -- tap investors to build war chests for future takeovers.
“Wow,” Susan Roth Katzke, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, said in a note to clients about earnings at Goldman Sachs, which leans more heavily on Wall Street operations than rivals. “Impressive all around.”
Goldman Sachs’s stock jumped 4.7% as of 11:30 a.m. in New York. JPMorgan’s slipped 0.3%, undermined by concern over weak demand for loans.
Strong Trading
For months, executives and analysts have been cautioning that last year’s pandemic-fueled market turmoil and demand for cash that propelled trading and dealmaking were easing, and that earnings in 2021 would be characterized by tough comparisons to those year-earlier periods.
Instead, traders seem to have had a Goldilocks moment as the year began.
In January, retail investors organized on forums such as Reddit drove up  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). and other so-called meme stocks that had been beaten down by mainstream finance, making day trading an international sport. Volumes stayed elevated across markets even as volatility began receding by the end of the quarter, according to Goldman’s earnings presentation.
In all, Goldman’s traders boosted revenue 47% to $7.58 billion -- more than $2 billion higher than what analysts had projected. Goldman’s dealmakers were busy too, more than doubling investment-banking fees, excluding corporate lending.
At JPMorgan, the firm’s stock-trading revenue jumped 47% to $3.29 billion, topping even the highest analyst estimate gathered by Bloomberg. Investment-banking fees soared 57% to $2.99 billion.
Still, JPMorgan and Goldman’s results might not translate to jubilee across Wall Street. Both firms warned that they saw lower revenues from their businesses of trading currencies -- an area where  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). dominates. Citigroup and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). are expected to post quarterly results on Thursday.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reports Friday.
For those minting profits, the question again is whether that will last. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon wasn’t making promises.
“The first quarter was an extraordinary quarter,” he told analysts on a call. “I don’t think the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter, the third quarter, the fourth quarter. But I will say activity levels continue to be elevated.”

However, the company still faces several headwinds. Federal legalization of cannabis is not yet a reality in the United States. We think that this, along with the company’s overvaluation amid heated competition in the cannabis space, could cause the stock to suffer a pull back soon. Let’s discuss.San Diego, Calif.-based Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR) owns and manages specialized properties leased to state-licensed operators for their regulated medical-use cannabis facilities. IIPR’s stock has gained 161.4% over the past year, driven by a surge of interest in cannabis stocks.
However, over the past three months, it has gained only 1.9%. The stock is currently trading at $190.64, 14.2% below its 52-week high of $222.08.
Since the anticipated repeal of a federal ban on marijuana is expected to be a time-consuming process, IIPR could face hurdles on its growth path. Also, the burgeoning cannabis industry has become crowded with new operators that are battling for market share. Amid this environment, IIPR is trading at a high valuation, which makes it vulnerable to a pullback in the near term.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: NMC sues Dubai bank in $6 billion UAE debt row - sources,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates' largest private healthcare provider NMC is suing a Dubai bank in Abu Dhabi courts, three sources said and a court document showed, in a dispute that could complicate the company's multibillion-dollar debt restructuring and potentially delay payouts to creditors.
The healthcare company ran into trouble last year after the disclosure of more than $4 billion in hidden debt.
Its UAE operating businesses were placed into administration in the courts of Abu Dhabi’s international financial centre ADGM. Claims from creditors to date amount to $6.4 billion, the company has said. 
The legal action by NMC's administrator against Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) comes after DIB filed lawsuits in neighbouring Dubai. The lawsuits pit UAE's different legal systems against one another and risk complicating the restructuring.
""So which court takes priority now?"" one of the sources said. ""The problem is that none of this has ever been done before.” The sources declined to be identified because of the commercial sensitivity of the matter.
NMC's lawsuit seeks to give its administrators, Alvarez & Marsal, power over securities claimed by DIB and possibly use them to pay other creditors, the sources and the court document seen by Reuters showed. 
Pending a full account of the receivables to the administrators and payment by DIB of the proceeds, ""the joint administrators shall be entitled to withhold any distribution or payment that would otherwise be due to DIB from the estate of the companies, or other property in the hands of the joint administrators,"" the court document said.
That could leave DIB, which has an exposure of over $400 million to NMC, out of pocket. NMC had secured loans from DIB using collateral known as insurance receivables, which relate to payments by insurance companies for medical treatment.
DIB has already sought rights over those securities in cases filed in neighbouring Dubai, three sources close to the matter said.
ADGM told Reuters it does not comment on ongoing court proceedings. Alvarez & Marsal, which has been appointed as administrator of NMC, declined to comment. DIB did not respond to a request for comment. 
LEGAL TANGLE
The UAE's legal system has both onshore and offshore jurisdictions. The onshore courts use UAE law, while the Abu Dhabi Global Markets courts and the courts of the financial free zone Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are modelled on the English judicial system.
""You have a situation where you have facilities granted by banks secured by security - for example assignment of receivables - governed by the UAE, onshore law ... and then you have the companies redomiciling in ADGM, in an English style process,"" said one of the sources, speaking anonymously for commercial sensitivities. 
Courts in the Dubai International Financial Centre and Abu Dhabi onshore courts have recognised Alvarez & Marsal's role as administrator for NMC.
It is planning to submit a request to have the administration recognised in Dubai onshore courts, it said in an update last week.
The administrator has said this process would help to protect and maximise NMC's assets for the benefit of creditors.

The Dubai and UAE federal governments did not immediately comment.

(Reuters) - The Office of the Illinois State Treasurer is calling on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shareholders to reject Chief Executive Alex Gorsky's $29.6 million pay package because it shields him from the U.S. healthcare company's opioid litigation costs.
J&J is attracting investor scrutiny because it excluded from its calculation of stock awards to its top executives some $9 billion in costs related to lawsuits claiming it helped fuel the U.S. opioid crisis and that traces of asbestos in its talc baby powder caused cancer, Reuters reported last month.
Including the opioid and talc-related legal costs would have weighed on Gorsky's compensation, which totaled $29.6 million in 2020, up 17% from the previous year.
The Office of the Illinois State Treasurer, which manages a $38 billion fund that includes state and local funds and retirement plans, said in a letter to other J&J investors on Wednesday that was reviewed by Reuters that the company was protecting executives ""from the financial penalty of opioid-related lawsuits"" without explaining why.
""Executives should be accountable for all consequences of corporate conduct,"" the treasurer's office said in the letter.
J&J did not respond to a request for comment. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this month, the company said excluding litigation costs from pay is consistent with its past practices and motivates the right executive behaviors. 
A nonbinding resolution on the pay packages will be up for a vote at the company's annual general meeting on April 22.
The state treasurer's office said that it is ""mindful"" of the important role that J&J has played in developing a vaccine to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A U.S. health advisory panel on Wednesday is set to review six reported cases of rare blood clots in women who received J&J's COVID-19 vaccine one day after federal regulators paused the use of the shot to assess the issue.
The state treasurer's office, which has a $10 million stake in J&J, is a member of the Investors for Opioid and Pharmaceutical Accountability (IOPA) coalition, which has 61 members with $4.2 trillion in assets under management. IOPA wrote to J&J's board in January asking it to review its pay practices in light of the opioid litigation and agreed-to settlements.

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis have both recommended that investors reject Gorsky's pay plan.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 11:20AM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs profit soars on global deals frenzy, trading boom","By Anirban Sen, Matt Scuffham and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) surged past Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit on Wednesday, as the U.S. investment banking giant capitalized on record levels of global dealmaking and a coronavirus-driven boom in equity trading.
An unprecedented boom in private firms merging with listed shell companies to go public helped Goldman earn handsome fees from such deals, resulting in a 73% jump in revenue from investment banking to $3.77 billion.
Revenue from equities trading jumped 68% to $3.69 billion as heightened trading by ordinary investors fed stock market volatility.
""Overall, it's quite stunning,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski.
Total revenue more than doubled to $17.7 billion in the quarter, while financial advisory revenue came in at $1.1 billion.
The investment bank also comfortably held on to its top ranking on the league tables for worldwide M&A advisory. The league tables by Refinitiv rank financial services firms on the amount of M&A fees they generate.
As global investment banking fees hit an all-time record of $39.4 billion in the March quarter, according to Refinitiv data, some analysts turned skeptical about how long the bumper capital markets environment will last.
""Questions about the sustainability of revenues remains an open question despite strong results this quarter,"" said KBW's Brian Kleinhanzl.
Goldman's trading performance was equally impressive. Revenue from the segment jumped 47% to its highest since 2010 and was in line with the broader gains for trading desks across Wall Street.
Goldman said debt underwriting was helped by strong leveraged finance and asset-backed activity, while equity underwriting was boosted by a red-hot IPO market. 
Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) said its quarterly earnings jumped almost 400%, as the largest U.S. bank released more than $5 billion in reserves and was aided by a big jump in investment banking and trading.
BLOWOUT QUARTER
Goldman's profit also benefited from favorable comparisons to last year when it set aside more funds to cover potential corporate loan losses due to the pandemic and marked down the value of some assets.
Unlike rivals such as JPMorgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman has a relatively smaller consumer business, which has limited its exposure to loan defaults and allowed it to focus on its core strength in investment banking and trading.
Even so, the bank has stuck with its plan to expand its consumer loans and credit card businesses.
Consumer banking revenue rose 32% in the quarter. The business is tiny compared to other large revenue generators at the firm, with consumer and wealth management representing just 10% of the total in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, Goldman's asset management arm received a huge boost from investments in private equities and gains from public equity investments.
Net earnings applicable to common shareholders rose to $6.7 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Earnings per share rose to $18.60 from $3.11 a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $10.22 per share, according to Refinitiv estimates. 

Goldman shares were up 1.6% in premarket trading. The bank's most comparable peer  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will round off the earnings season for big banks on Friday.

1021,By StockNews,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 11:01AM ET</span>",3 Cannabis Stocks Wall Street Predicts Will Rally By at Least 25%,"The rapid pace of legalization at the state level and meaningful progress on cannabis decriminalization at the federal level make Wall Street optimistic about the upside potential of several fundamentally sound stocks in this space. Three examples of these stocks that analysts believe are well positioned to rally by at least 25% over the next 12 months are: Trulieve Cannabis (OTC:TCNNF), Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF), and KushCo Holdings (OTC:KSHB). Read on.
Once deemed as illicit, cannabis consumption is now well on its way to the mainstream. More than a dozen states have already legalized marijuana for recreational use. And last month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation passed by state lawmakers to legalize recreational marijuana in New York. The legislation will expand New York’s existing medical, adult-use marijuana and cannabinoid hemp programs and formulate licensing for cannabis producers.
The Virginia legislature recently passed a bill to legalize simple possession of marijuana and limited home growth, effective July 1, 2021. This makes it the first state in the South and the 17th state overall to legalize recreational cannabis. Although under federal government guidelines cannabis is still considered a controlled substance. But changing societal attitudes towards it, particularly due to its medicinal benefits, have buttressed the widespread legalization push.
This, along with the advocacy of federal decriminalization by governors of many states, makes Wall Street analysts optimistic about the industry’s prospects. Based on consensus price targets, Trulieve Cannabis Corp. (TCNNF), Cresco Labs Inc. (CRLBF), and KushCo Holdings, Inc. (KSHB) are expected to rally at least 25% over the next 12 months.

However, amid a potentially rapid economic recovery, a new set of stocks has been emerging as potential growth stocks. Corning (GLW),  Weyerhaeuser  (WY), Tempur Sealy (NYSE:TPX), and Louisiana (LPX) possess solid growth attributes, and we think investors seeking to capitalize on those attributes should consider buying these names. Read on.Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a great year for growth stocks, particularly from the technology space. While the overvaluation of technology growth stocks led to a sell-off earlier this year given the emergence of opportunities to capitalize on the economic recovery, growth investing is by no means completely unattractive now.
Together with continued progress on the coronavirus vaccination front, President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Recovery Package and accommodative central bank monetary policy are priming the pump for a fast-paced U.S. economic recovery. This is is positioning many non-tech companies to grow significantly in the coming quarters. These stocks are the potential post-pandemic winners.
A renewed interest in growth stocks in the wake of the sell-off is evident in the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 8.2% gains over the past month versus the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 0.9% returns. We think this trend makes a favorable investment case for Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY), Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (TPX), and Louisiana–Pacific Corporation (LPX) all of which possess solid growth attributes.

Investing.com -- Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) popped 2.6% because we really, really need a happy ending.
BofA Securities reiterated a buy rating and $223 price target on the stock as theme park attendance seems to be improving, StreetInsider reported. 
While second quarter results are unlikely to be a catalyst, ""commentary on theme park reopenings, pent up consumer demand and capacity, as well as initial signs of traction on the international rollout of Star, movies, television, and advertising should be significant catalysts,"" analyst Jessica Ehrlich wrote in a note.
Disney's parks were closed for months -- those in California are reopening at the end of this month -- leading to a 53% year-over-year drop in revenue for the segment in the quarter ended Jan. 2. Overall sales for the quarter fell 22%. Shares hit an all-time high earlier this year as vaccines rolled out and people scratched the travel itch.
Initial indicators suggest travel from outside the state is robust, Ehrlich said.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 10:10AM ET</span>",Hopes rise for Britain's summer getaway season,"By Sarah Young and Laurence Frost
LONDON (Reuters) - Hopes that the great British getaway would be possible this summer grew on Wednesday, with easyJet (LON:EZJ) predicting that most of Europe would be open for travel and British Airways confident on routes to the U.S., despite ongoing uncertainty. 
Europe's travel industry, battered by the pandemic, is counting on British holidaymakers to lead a tourism rebound this summer. After one of the world's fastest vaccination programmes, Britons could be permitted to travel from late May. 
But over the last month, a third wave of coronavirus infections in continental Europe has cast doubts on the bumper return of travel.
The British government disappointed airlines and consumers last Friday when it failed to say when travel could restart and which countries would be on its green list of low-risk destinations.
But easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren shrugged off concerns on Wednesday, telling reporters that he believed most of Europe would be open for Britons by May 17, the earliest date the government has said travel can restart.
""I would expect that almost all major European countries, that by the time it comes to travel reopening, that most countries in Europe should be in that category,"" he said of Britain's green list.
Meanwhile, British Airways Chief Executive Sean Doyle said there was an ""immediate opportunity"" to open up routes to the United States, given the fast pace of vaccine roll outs in both countries.
The two countries ""more or less mirroring each other"" on vaccinations means they should be able to ""lead the way"" in terms of opening up"", he said during CAPA Live, an online industry event.
But Britain's aviation minister Robert Courts said on Wednesday that while the government did want to unlock travel, he could not offer airlines more clarity yet. 
""It wouldn't be right for me to speculate as to which countries in which areas of the world are likely to be on which list,"" he told a parliamentary committee. ""It's too early to say at the moment.""
The government would give more details in early May, he said. 
Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye was also more circumspect, predicting a ""patchy"" re-opening of travel with long-haul journeys more likely. 
""There is less chance of being able to fly to Europe in the next few months than there is of flying to the US or Israel or the Caribbean or Singapore,"" he told a separate industry event. 
Europe's vaccination rollout has lagged the UK's and the resurgence of cases in some countries is being driven by what Britain regards as ""variants of concern"" in terms of the risk they pose to vaccine efficacy. 
The UK government's requirement for two COVID-19 tests to allow travel to green list countries, which includes the more costly ""gold standard"" PCR test that helps identify variants of concern, gave Lundgren confidence that Europe would be open. 
While easyJet opposes testing for low risk green-list countries, Lundgren says if the government sticks with its two test plan, ""I wouldn't see reason why you wouldn't have the majority of the countries of Europe in there.""
Airlines have worried that the tests which can cost more than 100 pounds ($137.52), or more than some of easyJet's ticket prices, would deter travellers, although the government has said it is trying to reduce the cost. 
British Airways said on Wednesday its customers could now book a cheaper 60 pound PCR test with provider Randox.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German fashion e-tailer About You, which is widely reported to be preparing for a Frankfurt listing, said on Wednesday it cracked 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in revenue last year after launching in more than a dozen European markets.
Revenue grew 57% to 1.17 billion euros in the year to February, while in the last quarter the company turned its first profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization since its launch in 2014.
Though the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online, About You co-founder Tarek Mueller said a drop in socialising had led consumers, particularly among the younger generation, to spend less on clothes. 
Despite that, ""we managed to grow massively,"" he said. ""We seized our opportunity in the crisis.""
The Hamburg-based group more than doubled revenue in Europe outside Germany, Austria and Switzerland to 464 million euros after launching in 13 countries from Estonia to Ireland.
It is also developing an enterprise product that enables retailers and brands to set up and run their own online shops, competing with e-commerce solutions from established players SAP and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). 
Sales in this business-to-business segment grew by 61% last year.
Mueller declined to comment on reports that the company plans to float on the Frankfurt stock exchange, which has had a busy spring featuring debuts by telco Vantage Towers and used car dealing platform AUTO1. 
About You's main owners are mail-order group Otto and Danish tycoon Anders Holch Povlsen's investment company Heartland, which has previously backed consumer plays including Zalando, Asos and Klarna.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday after strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and signs of economic recovery implicit in other earnings reports bolstered sentiment.
Goldman and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) both blew past expectations for profit in the three months through June, but their stocks diverged amid concern that JPMorgan's, at least, relied heavily one-off factors. Goldman stock rose 2.7% while JPMorgan stock fell 1.3%.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock also inched down as both its numbers and JPMorgan's hinted at relatively weak demand for retail banking services such as auto and consumer loans. Data released earlier also showed that mortgage applications fell for the 9th week in 10 last week, although the weekly decline slowed to only 3.9%.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 119 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.1%. All three indices go into the new earnings season at or near to record highs, on expectations of a strong rebound in the economy this year and continued policy support.  
Attention was focused on the market debut of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which is going public through a direct listing at a reference price of $250. The stock was informally bid at anything up to $1000 on some brokerage platforms ahead of trading, but most interest was reported around$ $500-$600. The reference price alone would value Coinbase more highly than the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) and almost as much as Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE).
The listing had mixed effects on other stocks that have been viewed as indirect proxies for cryptocurrencies. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock fell 5.8% and is now down over 30% from its January peak, while Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA), which converted $1.5 billion of its treasury balance into Bitcoin earlier this year, was up 0.5% at a two-month high.
Not all the earnings news was positive - Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), touted for much of last year as a turnaround stock, fell over 14% after reporting a double-digit decline in fiscal fourth-quarter sales, with all the company’s stores shut during the pandemic.
 Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) also extended Tuesday's losses in reaction to the news that founder Katrina Lake will step down as CEO in August. The stock fell 3.4%.  
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock gained another 3.9% while BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 0.6% to a new all-time high as the makers of Covid-19 vaccines continued to profit from the misfortunes of rivals. The European Commission said it has opened talks with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech for another 1.8 billion doses of their vaccine.

The video-game retailer said it’s redeeming $216.4 million of senior notes, according to a Tuesday statement. The poster child for Redditors looking to squeeze short sellers earlier this year also retired $73.2 million in debt last month. The stock jumped as much as 5.7% premarket on light trading volume.
The early redemption is the latest step in a strategy to turn GameStop into an e-commerce marketplace to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., replacing its current brick-and-mortar focus.
Cohen, who’s set to become GameStop’s next chairman, has replaced key company executives with e-commerce veterans from Amazon and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), a retailer he previously led. The Grapevine, Texas-based company is also looking to replace current Chief Executive Officer George Sherman, according to a Reuters report.
If Wednesday’s rebound holds, it will snap a seven-day losing streak, the longest since November 2017. The company’s announcement for plans to offer as much as $1 billion in additional shares kickstarted the selloff last week, but could provide extra cash on hand to build out its offerings in the long run.
GameStop’s initial gain stood out from peers that have captivated retail investors as the majority of meme stocks were mixed. While movie-theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. edged higher, cannabis stock Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Inc. and animal-health company Zomedica Corp. dipped.
GameStop has suffered with the video-game industry’s shift to online distribution. With gamers turning their focus to downloads, the need to go to a physical store will tend to diminish, analysts said. The company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings last month.
Still, its shares are up more than 600% this year and have a nearly $10 billion valuation.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",From Harvard to Nasdaq listing: Grab CEO's ride to world's biggest SPAC deal,"By Anshuman Daga and Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The CEO of Grab, a popular app to book taxis, order food and make payments in Southeast Asia, has always been determined to win -- from making his firm the best-funded regional start-up to defeating behemoth Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER).
On Tuesday, Anthony Tan set another record when Grab Holdings agreed to list on Nasdaq through a $39.6 billion merger deal with a blank-check company, Altimeter Growth Corp.
The transaction will be the world's largest merger involving a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The accompanying $4 billion fundraising from global investors is also set to be the biggest ever U.S. equity offering by a Southeast Asian company. 
""Anthony focuses on what to do, and executes it well,"" said Chua Kee Lock, chief executive officer of Singapore-based venture capital firm Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX), an early investor in Grab.
The deals validate the 39-year-old co-founder's strategy to go hyper local and expand further in a region whose digital economy is estimated to triple to $309 billion by 2025.
""This might be a precedent set not necessarily just from the point of view of start-ups themselves but from global investors starting to have their eyes open to the Southeast Asian opportunity,"" said Usman Akhtar, who leads Bain & Co.'s Southeast Asia private equity practice.
Tan and co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, who are unrelated, created Grab from a Harvard Business School venture competition plan in 2011. They launched a taxi app in Malaysia in June 2012 and then took it regional.
And while the charismatic Tan is the scion of one of Malaysia's wealthiest families, he decided to strike it out as an entrepreneur.
""He is a very determined character and does not give up easily,"" said Chua.
That resolve came in handy in Grab's costly five-year battle with Uber, when Tan told employees that when ""a local champion stays true to their beliefs and strengths, they can prevail.""
Uber exited the region in 2018 by selling its business to Grab and in return took a stake in the company.
The deal also laid the foundation for Grab's food delivery business, which has become its largest segment as stay-at-home customers ordered food and groceries online last year.
But the COVID-19 pandemic also plunged Grab into its biggest crisis after demand for ride-hailing services tanked, forcing it to lay off about 5% of its staff. 
Tan sought advice from his investors, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Satya Nadella. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) CEO Masayoshi Son, whom Tan calls his personal mentor, also helped in Grab's decision to pivot into deliveries and expand its payments business.
""Anthony always had in mind a significant business that could include services beyond ride-hailing,"" said Frank Cespedes, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, who supervised the Tans' team in the business plan competition.
Those who have worked with Tan say he is passionate about Grab and has tremendous energy. Last year, when people mostly worked from home in Singapore, Tan often spent 15 hours a day at his standing desk, sometimes exercising with dumbbells.
He often jokes that he and his wife need to stay active to manage their three toddlers. They are expecting another child.
SUPERMAN AND IRON MAN
While Grab is still loss-making like many early-stage high-growth tech companies, Tan said the firm, which has more than 7,000 employees, started thinking about a listing nearly a year ago. 
Only this year, it seriously considered going public via a merger with a SPAC after receiving many offers.
Sources familiar with the matter said the IPO process was code named ""Iron Man"" while the SPAC route was dubbed ""Superman.""
""Superman is a good guy and he would go all out to serve society,"" Tan told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
Grab's funding comes as rivals including Gojek and Sea are also bulking up. 
""Other founders, other entrepreneurs and the region will be able to attract even more capital, because now we've shown that investors can make money, can exit,"" said Tan.
Tech companies view the region of 650 million people as a big opportunity, but the markets' diversity has tripped up some global firms.
Much of Grab's success has been due to Tan's relentless drive to localise. It accepted cash when Uber only allowed card payments. Grab also moved early to offer motorcycle taxi rides in traffic-clogged countries of Vietnam and Indonesia.
After shifting its headquarters to Singapore, Grab gained access to some of the world's biggest investors and talent.

""Grab's sharp focus allows them to go very deep into the eco-system and be relevant across a person's everyday life,"" said Keith Magnus, Asia co-chairman at boutique investment bank Evercore, which was among Grab's advisers on the SPAC deal.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen drifting Wednesday, with investors cautious as the new earnings season starts in earnest, starting with the banking sector.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
The broad-based S&P 500 index closed at a record high on Tuesday, rising 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%, or 68 points, but had been down more than 100 points intraday, and the Nasdaq Composite ended up 1.1%
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) started the ball rolling, posting strong gains in both revenues and earnings, although its stock is down 1% in premarket trading. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) also set to release first-quarter earnings before the bell.
Investors will also be looking out for trading trends, outlooks for economic recovery as more areas open up, and any commentary on additional Archegos fallout.
First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 25% in the quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data, which would be the biggest quarterly gain since 2018. The relative gains are made easier by the collapse of most companies' business in March last year as the pandemic exploded.
Also of interest Wednesday will be the stock market debut of Coinbase Global, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, which received a reference price of $250 per share on Tuesday. The company said last week that it expects to report a first-quarter profit of up to $800 million.
The economic data slate includes March import prices, which will be of extra interest after consumer prices rose 0.6% on Tuesday, the largest gain since August 2012, while the Fed's Beige Book is expected to showcase improving economic conditions around the country.  
There are also a number of Fed speakers due to discuss the economic outlook on Wednesday, including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is set to speak at an Economic Club of Washington.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by the International Energy Agency joining OPEC in raising its forecasts for global oil demand this year, by an average of 230,000 barrels a day from its March forecasts. 
This added to the positive tone generated by Tuesday’s industry data showed U.S. oil inventories declined more than expected last week, a drop of 3.6 million barrels in the week, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
Official inventory figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $61.15 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.6% to $64.66. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,742.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1954.

Investing.com - Wall Street's biggest banks set a blistering start to the first-quarter earnings season, with both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs thriving against a backdrop of extraordinarily buoyant capital markets.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported record revenue and earnings for the quarter, with equities markets revenue in particular rising over 68% from a year ago.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) also reported earnings per share nearly 50% ahead of expectations for the three months through March - albeit thanks largely to one-off factors and extraordinary conditions in capital markets.
Revenue was nearly 10% ahead of expectations at $33.12 billion, but the bank's cost-income ratio ticked higher to 58% from 55% in the final quarter of 2020.
Goldman stock rose 1.8% in premarket trading by 8:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), while JPMorgan stock fell 0.6%, reflecting disappointment at the comparatively soft performance of its Main Street lending operations.
JPMorgan's numbers were juiced by the release of some $5.2 billion in reserves against possible loan losses that the bank had built at the start of the pandemic. The bank made $1.1 billion of fresh write-offs in the quarter.
CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement that the bank's remaining credit reserves of $26 billion ""are appropriate and prudent, all things considered,” and stressed that the release of previous reserves should not be regarded as a recurring factor.
The corporate and investment bank arm flourished, as expected, against a backdrop of buoyant financial markets and a boom in the formation of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies. Overall revenue at the division was up 46% from a year earlier at $14.6 billion. Equity markets revenue was up 47% at $3.3 billion, while fixed-income revenue was up 15% at $5.8 billion.
Investment banking revenue was $2.9 billion, up $2 billion, as investment banking fees rose 57%.
The consumer bank, by contrast, put in a weaker performance, with home lending stagnating on the quarter and modest declines in consumer and auto loans, against a backdrop of steadily rising interest rates.
JPMorgan shares are up 21% from the beginning of the year, still down 4.69% from its 52 week high of $161.68 set on March 18. They are outperforming the S&P Global 100 which is up 8.82% from the start of the year.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are also set to report before the opening bell.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",How the pandemic helped Walmart battle Amazon Marketplace for sellers,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Between 2009 and 2014, Walmart’s Marketplace business, where outside merchants hawk everything from baby blankets to power tools, counted no more than six sellers, and was described by one expert as “in limbo.”
But what was treated as an afterthought for years has emerged as an important leg in the world’s biggest retailer’s long-term strategy to take on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc, which it is battling for advertising and ecommerce dollars.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Marketplace grew to an estimated 70,000 sellers in 2020, fueled by a surge in online shopping due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a series of investments in technology and vendor relationships reported here for the first time. 
That is expected to rise 146% by the end of 2022, according to projections by data firm Marketplace Pulse that have not yet been published.
The rapid growth is starting to stress the system, some merchants said, a growing number of whom worry that if the pace picks up, Walmart risks damaging its reputation as a haven for quality sellers. Reuters spoke with vendors from Walmart.com and Amazon, analytics companies that help merchants sell on both marketplaces, industry experts, consultants and executives.
""A year or two ago, every brand on Walmart.com would be trustworthy but now it's getting very similar to Amazon and that's a huge risk,"" said Cal Chan, who sells supplements and skincare products on both Walmart and Amazon. ""Amazon let everyone under the sun in - that helped them grow, but now they're trying to clean up the riff-raff and it's very hard to close Pandora (OTC:PANDY)'s Box.""
Amazon disputed the characterization by merchants and said it has a thorough vetting process designed to help honest sellers set up accounts quickly. The company employs more than 8,000 people to remove counterfeit products, false listings and identify intellectual property theft. In 2019, Amazon stopped over 2.5 million suspected bad actors from opening Amazon selling accounts, and blocked more than 6 billion suspected bad listings, an Amazon spokesman said in an email.
Walmart has distinguished itself as a safer, less crowded marketplace than rivals like Amazon, making it easier for merchants to stand out and sell products. But it is now expected to see a surge of new vendors after it said last month it will open its online store to international merchants, which are less accountable to U.S. consumer protection laws. Walmart has already added over 130 new Chinese sellers, Marketplace Pulse said.

The retailer said it is actively courting foreign vendors including from ecommerce giant Flipkart, which is bigger than Amazon in India and in which Walmart holds a 77% stake. It vowed to maintain quality control.
“We do not plan to lower our bar or change our vetting standards, our monitoring or management of sellers,"" Jeff Clementz, Vice President of Walmart Marketplace, said. “We are aiming to attract the best from around the world.” 
Walmart said its sourcing teams in other countries have begun vetting potential sellers by their reviews, licensing permissions, reputations and items.
The business of providing a storefront for outside sellers is, as one analyst called it, a “secret weapon” for Amazon and a major growth engine that has caught the attention of  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and big tech rivals Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which are eager to expand similar businesses.
Sales generated by Amazon’s third-party vendors totaled $189 billion last year in the United States, or nearly 60% of the company’s total U.S. retail ecommerce sales, according to eMarketer data from Insider Intelligence.
Amazon, which declined to verify these numbers, dwarfs Walmart's marketplace and is estimated to have more than 3 million sellers on its U.S. third-party store at the end of 2022, and 7.5 million globally, according to Marketplace Pulse.
But the lure of Walmart's over 5,000 stores and clubs - more important than ever as pick-up and delivery hubs take off due to the pandemic - is a big attraction for many vendors.
“Walmart has something Amazon can’t match: brick-and-mortar stores. If you do well on Walmart.com, there’s potential you can get into a regular Walmart,” said Bradley Sutton, who works at third-party seller consulting firm Helium 10.
""It's like the Holy Grail for vendors. That’s way bigger than Amazon.""

'STRATEGIC PRIORITY'
Marketplace’s elevation to what Clementz in June called a “strategic priority” tracks Walmart’s reinvention from digital also-ran to the No. 2 spot behind Amazon.
The transformation began with the 2016 addition of serial entrepreneur Marc Lore to lead Walmart’s U.S. ecommerce business. That year, it agreed to spend $3.3 billion on Lore’s less than three-year-old Jet.com.
“This company, over time, is going to look like more of an ecommerce company,” Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at the time.
By early October 2016, 17 days after joining Walmart, Lore laid out a strategy that included a plan to not only lure hipper, urban, millennial shoppers to Jet.com and Walmart.com, but also to make both sites attractive to smaller merchants. 
Lore eyed an opportunity to lure sellers of “more premium-type brands that don’t typically want to sell on marketplaces” of rivals.
(Graphic: Walmart Marketplace vendors seen rising sharply - https://graphics.reuters.com/WALMART-MARKETPLACE/xegvbxywwvq/chart.png)
Some vendors described a rigorous process to get on Walmart Marketplace that can take weeks and includes submitting bank account information, sales records and social security details.
When Clementz, previously COO of Walmart.com, was put in charge of Marketplace, the first order of business for the veteran of PayPal and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was to improve “glitchy,” complicated software for listing products and simplify the process of connecting analytics and delivery firms for vendors, said sellers.
Walmart spruced up its advertising platform, rolled out software to protect sellers' intellectual property, launched a delivery and logistics service, and introduced its version of Amazon Prime, called Walmart+, a membership program that “100% boosts sales,” according to fitness equipment merchant Michael Lebhar.
Hoping to address complaints from sellers, Walmart hired “strategic account managers” who cater to top vendors. On Tuesday, Walmart emailed vendors to apply for ""a chance to win the opportunity to sell"" U.S.-made products in stores.
To sweeten the pot, Walmart has also undercut Amazon on the commission it takes on sales of some items. Walmart takes a 3%-20% cut of items sold versus Amazon’s rate of 6%-45%, depending on the type of product.
The month Walmart opened its market to international sellers, new vendors were told they would not have to pay a commission at all for a limited time.
But concessions like this generate concern among some sellers.
“This is alarming and will end up with Walmart having similar counterfeit or quality issues like Amazon is having,” said Ryan Ebel, 30, a third-party seller from Las Vegas.
Lore, who left the company at the end of January and remains an advisor, said he is “not worried” about Walmart's expansion to foreign sellers.

“The magic is finding that white line, the right balance between adding more assortment but not going down a path of letting anybody on the platform,” he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair on Wednesday had another setback in its fight against state aid for rival airlines after Europe's second-highest court again backed EU competition regulators' approval of support for SAS and Finnair.
Europe's biggest budget airline has filed 16 lawsuits against the European Commission for allowing state aid to individual airlines such as Lufthansa, KLM, Austrian Airlines and TAP, as well as national schemes that mainly benefit flag carriers.
The EU competition watchdog has to date cleared more than 3 trillion euros ($3.6 trillion) to help virus-hit companies across the 27-country bloc. The airline industry has been among the hardest hit due to lockdowns and travel restrictions.
The Luxembourg-based General Court said aid granted to SAS and Finnair complied with the bloc's state aid rules. 
Its judgments echoed its Feb. 17 ruling upholding state aid granted to rivals including Air France and SAS.
""Given that SAS's market share is much higher than that of its closest competitor in those two member states, the aid does not amount to unlawful discrimination,"" the Court said.
Judges said the Finnair state loan guarantee was necessary in order to remedy the serious disturbance in the Finnish economy in view of the importance of the carrier for that economy.
Ryanair said in a statement that it would appeal.
""Today's judgments set the process of liberalisation in air transport back by 30 years,"" the company said in a statement.
The cases are T-378/20 Ryanair v Commission and T-388/20 Ryanair v Commission.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Coinbase listing marks latest step in crypto's march to the mainstream,"By Tom Wilson and Anna Irrera
LONDON (Reuters) -Coinbase Global Inc, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset. 
The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company, with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year, versus $5.8 billion in September.
It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies, an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance, according to interviews with investors, analysts and executives. 
""The listing is significant in that it marks the growth of the industry and its acceptance into mainstream business,"" said William Cong, an associate professor of finance at Cornell University’s SC Johnson College of Business.
Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, hit a record of over $63,000 on Tuesday. It has more than doubled this year as large investors, banks from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and household name companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc warm to the emerging asset.
Coinbase's direct listing - which means it has not sold any shares ahead of its market debut - is likely to accelerate that process, those interviewed by Reuters said, by boosting awareness of digital assets among investors. 
""This is a very positive thing for bitcoin in itself, as it proves the bridge that has been built from an esoteric, left-of-field arena, full of cowboys, to mainstream finance,"" said Charles Hayter of data firm CryptoCompare. 
Still, some institutional investors voiced caution over long-term prospects for Coinbase and the crypto sector.
Swiss asset manager Unigestion said it was wary of the hype around cryptocurrencies, and as a result would not be buying Coinbase stock.
""We think there is a lot of frenzy and exuberance in everything that looks like crypto,"" said Olivier Marciot, a portfolio manager at Unigestion, which oversees assets worth $22.6 billion.
""Hedge funds and retail will probably be the early birds in these new stocks - probably buying into them pretty heavily - which shouldn't be a clear indication of how they will be in the longer term."" 
BEHOLDEN TO BITCOIN?
Others experts said risks included Coinbase's exposure to a highly volatile asset that is still subject to patchy regulation.
Founded in 2012, Coinbase boasts 56 million users globally and an estimated $223 billion assets on its platform, accounting for 11.3% crypto asset market share, according to regulatory filings. 
The company's most recent financial results underscore how revenues have surged in lock-step with the rally in bitcoin trading volumes and price. 
In the first quarter of the year, as bitcoin more than doubled in price, Coinbase estimated revenue of over $1.8 billion and net income between $730 million to $800 million, versus revenue of $1.3 billion for the entire 2020. 
""The correlation to bitcoin will be very high after the stock stabilizes after listing,"" said Larry Cermak, director of research at crypto website The Block. 
""When price of bitcoin goes down, it's inevitable that Coinbase's revenue and inherently price of the stock will decline as well."" 
Regulatory risks also loom, others said, as Coinbase increases the number of digital assets users can trade on its platform. 
Coinbase last year suspended trading in major digital currency XRP after U.S. regulators charged associated blockchain firm Ripple with an $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. Ripple has denied the charges.

""Given the expansion of assets covered by Coinbase it's almost inevitable that other listings will come into question,"" said Colin Platt, chief operating officer of crypto platform Unifty. 
Coinbase declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - If there is a key mantra for companies right now, it has to be ""diversity and inclusion.""
With issues of race, gender and sexuality coming to the forefront of American life, the nation’s board rooms are scrambling to assemble talent pipelines that look more like the nation as a whole.
Burger chain  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK) is enjoying a nice head start in this particular race.
The New York City-founded staple recently received a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for its LGBTQ-friendly workplace. Advocacy even finds its way onto the menu, with items like the “Pride Shake.”
Reuters recently sat down with Shake Shack’s president and chief financial officer, Tara Comonte, a native of Scotland, to chat about the right recipe for mixing business and social principles.
Edited excerpts are below.
Q: Shake Shack has been named a “Best Place To Work” for LGBTQ employees for many years running – how did that become part of the company DNA?
A: It has always been a people-first organization, ever since it was born as a hot-dog cart in NYC. [Founder] Danny Meyer and (CEO) Randy Garutti have a set of principles they refer to as “Enlightened Hospitality,” and that involves taking care of our team first. 
Everything stems from that.
Q: Did this focus on company culture stem from your time in investment banking, which was not positive for you?
A: I always say to people, ""You learn just as much from the experiences you didn’t love, or the bosses who weren’t great, as you do from the ones which were fantastic."" Investment banking just wasn’t a culture I enjoyed or thrived in. 
It was incredibly hierarchical, where the proxy for success was being at your desk early in the morning or late at night.
I have also spent way too many meetings in rooms lacking in diversity, trying to sell products that looked nothing like the room. One example is I was working for this big global beauty brand, in a room full of 12 men debating a mascara ad. 
I remember thinking, ""This is the most bizarre conversation ever. No one in this room is even a target for this product.""
Q: How does being an employee-first company affect talent attraction and retention?
A: The war for talent is only getting more competitive. People have to want to work and stay with you. So we have to provide an environment where each party in the relationship gives their best: The individual gives their best for the company, and the company gives their best to the individual. 
That’s why we’re “all in” on diversity and inclusion and equality.
Q: Since not everyone agrees on LGBTQ issues, have you experienced any pushback?
A: We’re not trying to judge anyone, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. You’re not going to get everyone on the same page all the time. But we’re going to be who we’re going to be. 
Our North Star is that we need to do the right thing, as a business and a brand and leaders in the community. We need to have conviction in our beliefs, and do our best to educate and be inclusive.
Q: You have been open about discussing ""Imposter Syndrome"" – as a woman in the C-suite, what has your experience been like?
A: Imposter Syndrome is real, and unfortunately women have a lot more of it than men. That being said, women need to have confidence in their own worth. 
I had a conversation like that recently, when a female colleague was quiet in a meeting. I said, ""Remember, you earned your seat at that table, and we want your point of view. You have a valuable perspective that needs to be heard.""
The more you see women at the boardroom table, having voices and leadership roles and bringing great ideas, the easier it is for women coming up. 
Q: Diversity and inclusion has become a key theme over the past year, so what advice do you have for other companies?
A: Build a team that reflects the marketplace you’re trying to address, and the community you’re trying to engage. That will drive understanding and empathy and creativity, and the more successful you are going to be.

Make sure every single employee has an equal opportunity to go as far as they want to go. If you don’t, you will lose your star performers, because people won’t want to hang around.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased, after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.
With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve's accommodative stance, European shares opened 0.1% higher.
Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe, after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use in the country after six women developed rare blood clots.
Led by Hong Kong's Hang Seng, most Asia-Pacific share indexes also climbed.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields continued their decline, marking a fresh three-week low.
S&P 500 futures pointed to a further 0.1% rise after the S&P 500 closed at record highs on Tuesday.
Japan bucked the trend, with the Nikkei falling 0.4% as a rising number of coronavirus cases raised doubts about its economic recovery with 100 days to go until Tokyo is scheduled to host the Olympics.
MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 50 countries advanced 0.2% to a record high.
The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.6% in March, the biggest increase since August 2012, as rising vaccinations and fiscal stimulus unleashed pent-up demand, data showed on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.5%. 
In the 12 months through March, the CPI surged 2.6%. That was the largest gain since August 2018 and followed a 1.7% increase in February. 
But the data are unlikely to change Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's view that higher inflation in the coming months will be transitory. Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day at the Economic Club of Washington.
The ""not too high"" inflation reading and a relatively successful 30-year U.S. bond auction on Tuesday were the immediate reasons equity markets gained, said François Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""People are now waiting for earning season, which should give us more visibility on the outlook and whether the significant market performance we've seen is logical and sustainable,"" he said.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) are among U.S. companies reporting on Wednesday.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s equity strategists expects S&P 500 earnings to come in 7.5% above consensus, well above the historical average of 4% but lower than in the previous three quarters.
WEAKER DOLLAR
For bond markets, the question is whether the benchmark yield can break below 1.6% from as low as 1.611% on Wednesday, Westpac strategists wrote in a client note. ""That has been an important technical level, which if broken could see a quick move to 1.5%,"" they said.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had surged to a 14-month high of 1.776% on March 30 on bets that massive fiscal stimulus would speed up a U.S. recovery, stoking faster inflation than Fed policymakers anticipated and prompting it to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
But yields have eased this month, in part owing to the Fed's insistence that labour market slack will prevent the economy from overheating.
A spate of strong auction results, including Tuesday's, has also helped to tame yields. 
Euro zone bond yields, which had been rising in line with U.S. Treasury yields on hopes for a strong economic recovery later this year and increased inflation, on Wednesday dropped 1 to 3 basis points. 
The U.S. dollar eased along with Treasury yields, slipping to a three-week low against major peers. 
Gold, a traditional inflation hedge, was flat at $1,743.01 per ounce.
Bitcoin hit a record above $64,500, extending its 2021 rally on the day Coinbase shares are due to list in the United States.

In oil markets, Brent crude futures rose 1.2% to $64.43 a barrel. U.S. crude futures added 1.3% to $60.95.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.2%, with technology stocks leading gains with a 1.0% rise after their U.S. peers rallied overnight.
SAP jumped 4.2% as it nudged its outlook for 2021 revenue higher after reporting first-quarter results that showed a rise in cloud sales.
LVMH gained 3% to hit a record high after sales bounced back far more quickly than expected in early 2021 as Chinese and U.S. shoppers made the most of easing COVID-19 restrictions.
Other luxury stocks including Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Richemont and Hermes added between 1.2% and 1.7%.
""Strong brand desirability and pricing power are enabling LVMH group brands to reinforce its leadership position in the global luxury goods market, consistently,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said.
Later in the day, all eyes will turn to U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) that are set to publish their quarterly reports.
European stocks have notched all-time highs in the recent days on hopes of a strong quarterly reporting season, as well as a rapid recovery in the global economy despite a resurgent COVID-19 pandemic.
Earnings for companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to jump 55.7% in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data, more than the 47.4% rise forecast a week earlier.
""Markets seem to be erring on the side of taking positive views rather than negative,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at SpredEx. ""Investors pretty much seem focussed on optimism around post-COVID recovery.""
There were worries about the pace of vaccination, as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use following cases of rare blood clots.
Britain's biggest retailer Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) fell 2.7% after reporting a 20% drop in full-year pretax profit.

Shares in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) dropped 1.3% to a fresh five-month low as it continued to unwind positions in several companies related to last month's meltdown of Archegos Capital, according to traders.

LVMH shares were up by 2.7% in early session trading, hitting new record levels, and also lifting up the shares of rival luxury goods companies such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Hermes.
Late on Tuesday, LVMH posted first-quarter revenues that even exceeded 2019 levels, before the pandemic.
Its like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of currency changes and its acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, rose by 30% year-on-year in the three months to March to 14 billion euros ($16.75 billion).
""LVMH noted that Q1 was a 'good start to the year', but to us this is much better than 'good' and will once again stand as an absolute outperformance vs the rest of the sector,"" wrote JP Morgan in a research note.

Financed largely by debt, Norwegian Air grew rapidly, serving routes across Europe and flying to North and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East before the COVID-19 pandemic plunged the airline into crisis.
""We want to take a conservative approach at a time when the pandemic and travel restrictions continue to create unpredictability in the travel sector,"" Chief Executive Jacob Schram said in a statement on Wednesday.
Courts in Oslo and Dublin have recently given their approval for Norwegian to sharply cut its debt by converting it to stock, but the rulings were conditional on the airline raising at least 4.5 billion crowns in additional funds.
The survival plan brings an end to Norwegian's long-haul business, leaving a slimmed-down carrier focusing on Nordic and European routes, but the ongoing spread of the virus continues to hamper the industry.
""We must take this uncertainty into account in our forward planning strategy. At the same time, we have also taken into consideration feedback from investors, as well as dialogue with our board,"" Schram said.
Norwegian said certain investors had agreed to inject 2.86 billion crowns via a share issue, and that current creditors were expected to buy new perpetual bonds worth at least 1.8 billion.
Norway's government has separately said it is willing to invest 1.5 billion crowns in hybrid capital.
Norwegian Air faces increased competition at home, not only from SAS and Wideroe, but also new start-up Flyr which is expected to launch its first flight in Norway by mid-year.
Norse Atlantic Airways, was also recently set up by a group of industry veterans, including Norwegian Air founder and former CEO Bjoern Kjos, to offer long-haul services.
Norwegian's debt will be cut to between 16 billion and 20 billion crowns, the company said, 62 billion to 65 billion crowns less than end-2019 levels. 
Norwegian is advised by Seabury Securities and DNB Markets.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Toshiba board planned to oust CEO before $20 billion buyout offer - sources,"By Makiko Yamazaki, Noriyuki Hirata and Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s board planned to oust troubled CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani before CVC Capital Partners launched a $20 billion buyout bid last week, informing him a day before the offer was announced that it would replace him, people familiar with the matter said. 
Two members of Toshiba Corp's nomination committee, including board chairman Osamu Nagayama, met Kurumatani, himself a former CVC executive, and told him they intended to look for a new chief executive, three of the people said. 
Kurumatani then told them of the European private equity firm's plan to take Toshiba private, the three people said. A day later, the Japanese conglomerate announced it had received the offer, two of them said.
The events of the meeting show how Kurumatani's tenure was undone by his flagging popularity even before the offer was announced. It marked the culmination of deepening discord between Kurumatani and activist shareholders, who had raised concern over what they said were governance issues. 
The plan to remove him appears to have accelerated after the April 6 meeting at Toshiba's headquarters next to Tokyo Bay. On Wednesday, Toshiba said the onetime Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group banker was stepping down after some three years at the helm. 
Support for him both within the company and among investors had eroded, a person briefed on the matter said. All of the sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
""A survey of managers at Toshiba showed low support for Kurumatani,"" the person who was briefed said. There was ""deep distrust"" of him among shareholders, the person said.
Toshiba said on Wednesday that Kurumatani was stepping down. It said he was doing so to ""recharge"" and after achieving his plan to revive the conglomerate that had been weakened by an accounting scandal.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Kurumatani for comment on this story. Nagayama declined to comment. Toshiba said it could not comment on speculation. A representative for CVC Japan declined to comment.
ESCALATING CHALLENGE
Joining Toshiba in 2018 from CVC's Japan unit with a pledge to reshape a sprawling, 150-year-old enterprise, Kurumatani was a rare outsider in the storied corporation, where managers typically toil for decades before reaching the executive suite.
The challenge against him escalated last month when activist investors won an emergency shareholders meeting vote to establish an independent probe into whether management had previously pressured shareholder over shareholder votes.
An earlier, internal probe by Toshiba had found no fault.
That vote convinced the board Kurumatani was unlikely to win backing at the next annual shareholders' meeting, a second person who briefed on the matter said. At the last shareholders' meeting he won only 57% of the vote, a stinging rebuke in a country where management is rarely challenged.
His departure could dent CVC's chances of taking control of Toshiba, a move that would have closed down attempts to shine a light on management decisions. 
Toshiba executives are lobbying against the CVC offer with government officials, who will have to approve any deal because the company builds nuclear reactor manufacturers and defence equipment, according to the person briefed on the matter.
""It's a deal nobody wants. Toshiba has various businesses linked to national defence and foreign ownership could result in client exodus,"" a person familiar with the board's thinking said.
CVC plans to stick with its takeover bid, Japanese media reported Wednesday, offering a 30% premium over Toshiba's current share price. Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management has slammed that as too low, while U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management has called on Toshiba to solicit other bids. 
For now, company chairman Satoshi Tsunakawa, 65, who joined Toshiba in 1979, will manage the company, including having to deal with CVC and other potential bidders. Those could include U.S. investment firm KKR and Canada'a Brookfield Asset Management Inc according to a Financial Times report.
""We have a shortage of internal candidates for the top post but it will be difficult bring in an outsider after getting rid of Kurumatani,"" a source familiar with internal discussions at Toshiba said.

The move was also supported by falling bond yields in the U.S., where inflation concerns eased after March's CPI data overshot expectations by an insignificant amount. 
The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.6% in March, the biggest increase since August 2012, but the market had seemingly positioned for a strong figure as rising vaccinations and fiscal stimulus released pent-up demand. 
This CPI number is unlikely to change Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's view that higher inflation in coming months will be transitory. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped as low as 1.61%, partly as a result of that, and partly because of other news that put a dampener on economic reopening trades.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has delayed the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine outside the U.S. after the U.S. federal health agencies recommended pausing the use of the drug due to blood clotting worries.
This is the second vaccine, after AstraZeneca’s, to have such issues, and may further delay the EU's vaccination program, which may in turn delay a return to economic normality. Germany, which has still vaccinated less than 25% of its population, extended its lockdown by another three weeks on Monday.
In the corporate sector, LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock climbed 2.8% to a record high after the world's biggest luxury goods company posted a strong start to 2021 as Chinese and U.S. shoppers returned in droves.

Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday after industry data showed U.S. oil inventories declined more than expected last week, a sign of growing demand in the largest oil consumer in the world.

EasyJet said on Wednesday that most countries were planning to resume flying at scale in May, and it expected a ramp up from late May. It said that overall in its April to end of June quarter it would fly up to 20% of 2019 capacity levels. 
The return to flying at scale will help boost the airline's finances which have been squeezed during the pandemic. It flew just 14% of 2019 capacity in the October to end of March period. 
For the six months ended in March, the airline said it expected to report a loss before tax in the range of 690 million pounds ($950.41 million) to 730 million pounds, after it made stronger cost reductions than analysts had forecasted. 
EasyJet said it has 2.9 billion pounds of liquidity and was well-positioned to capitalise on a recovery in flying. 
""We maintain significant flexibility to ramp capacity up or down quickly depending upon the unwinding of travel restrictions and expected demand across our European network,"" said easyJet in its statement. 

Uncertainty remains about when travel can properly resume. The UK government's plan for kicking off a summer getaway season disappointed the industry last week after it failed to include a start date for travel or list which countries which would be open for travel.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 02:17AM ET</span>",Buying diamonds in lockdown? WhatsApp can be your best friend,"By Claudia Cristoferi and Silvia Aloisi
MILAN (Reuters) - As Italy entered a new coronavirus lockdown and shut shops in March, Genoa-based jeweller Gismondi 1754 turned to messaging service WhatsApp to sell a 300,000 euro diamond ring to a wealthy Swiss client. 
At the same time, sales assistants at luxury puffer jacket brand Moncler were arranging gourmet dinner deliveries to customers homes so they could dine in style while watching a video streaming of the brand's latest collection.
The pandemic has forced luxury goods companies to use social media, video and virtual showrooms to woo their wealthy customers in Europe and keep them shopping at a time when tourists, especially from China, have been absent for more than a year. 
Retailers reopened in Britain and most of Italy on Monday, but they remain shut in France and access is restricted in Germany, where in Berlin, for example, a negative COVID test is required to go into most shops.
Senior executives in the industry said this trend of selling outside the traditional store network, while not replacing the need for physical shops, is here to stay. 
""We are learning that we can also have a high level of service with a low level of physical contact,"" Moncler's boss Remo Ruffini told Reuters. ""Distant sales are a new frontier, something in the middle between e-commerce and a traditional store."" 
Analysts say that lockdowns and ""staycationing"" mean that wealthy Europeans have money to spend that they are not splurging on fancy hotels or  Michelin  (PA:MICP) starred restaurants. 
Designer brands are keen to capture some of that cash. 
High-end labels such as Hermes, which used to be more reticent to sell online, have had to fully embrace e-commerce. Online revenues for the industry have doubled to nearly 20% of sales in the past year alone, based on analyst estimates. Boston Consulting Group expects that percentage to rise to 25% by 2023. 
KEEPING IN TOUCH
Luxury labels have also invested in transforming store assistants into personal shoppers who pamper their VICs - very important clients - by sending them products at home and keep in touch regularly. Most brands now stream products on social media and show customers specific product videos. 
Before the pandemic, Gismondi would not have sold a 300,000 euros, 10-carat diamond ring without showing it to the client in person. ""I was on the phone chatting with the lady who is buying it, and it came up that this was the dream of a lifetime for her,"" Massimo Gismondi, chief executive of the jewellery group, said.
From that moment, an exchange started with the lady via WhatsApp and video-calls to find the perfect design for the ring that will be delivered to her home. 
""People are craving for leisure, for returning to savour life and spending,"" Gismondi told Reuters.
French luxury group LVMH's star label Louis Vuitton in addition to online sales has started taking its shops to wealthy clients' doorsteps in the United States.
The ""LV by Appointment"" campaign essentially brings a tailor-made shop on wheels to the customer, curated with a personalised selection of pieces - from leather goods to watches and perfumes - for those who opt for the service.
LVMH, the first to report results for the first quarter, set a very bullish tone for the industry. Revenues bounced back strongly, with its fashion and leather goods division surging 52% - double analysts' forecasts. Sales in Europe remained in negative territory, but the 9% decline was a major improvement from the minus 24% seen in the fourth quarter. 
Luxury brands have had a strong recovery in China since shops began to reopen there last spring. But in Europe and the United States finding new ways to connect with customers has helped them to mitigate last year's sales declines. 
Analysts say that improving sales in those two regions should also help revenues this year. Sales in Europe and the United States accounted for 60% of the total in 2019, and should come in at just under 50% by 2025, consultancy Bain said. 
RELATIONSHIPS 
Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), said in February that the group's revenues from ""distant sales"" - or sales outside its global store network - had risen sharply last year. The group had trained 400 sales assistants in 16 countries for this purpose, he said. 
One source at an Italian luxury fashion label said typically a brand's marketing department will provide a list of clients to contact, based on what they have bought over the previous year.
The sales assistants then phone customers, show them the latest arrivals via video chat and send them clothes or shoes to try on.
""You create a strong relationship between the sales people and the customer,"" Prada (OTC:PRDSY)'s CEO Patrizio Bertelli told Reuters.
""We have gone from the shop assistant that simply shows you a product to someone who also does a bit of marketing, knows customers, their taste and their habits, reaches out to them and sends them stuff home."" 
A Milan-based PR executive who spends on average 40,000 euros ($47,552.00) a year in Prada's stores said that since last year Prada has regularly sent her videos about its clothes.
""If there is something I like they send it home. They know my size and if in doubt they send more than one size. I buy what I like and I send back the rest,"" she said. 
Over the past year, cashmere sweater label Brunello Cucinelli has been organising video calls with 30-40 customers at once to keep them engaged. 
""It allows us to have a dialogue with a number of people which, if we had to arrange a physical appointment, would take us perhaps 3-4 years,"" the brand's co-CEO, Luca Lisandroni, told Reuters. He also said that brands should not become too insistent in trying to sell their wares. 
""Some people like being contacted and stimulated, others don't want to be solicited too much,"" he said.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",A $9 million boss? UniCredit investors to decide how much Orcel is worth,"By Valentina Za, Maria Pia Quaglia and Simon Jessop
MILAN (Reuters) - Investors are due to approve Andrea Orcel's appointment as chief executive of UniCredit on Thursday, but the issue that scuppered his first attempt to run a major bank is overshadowing his second: pay.
Orcel, 57, will join UniCredit just over two years after Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) withdrew an offer to make him its CEO after a disagreement over his pay package that ignited a 112 million euro ($134 million) legal dispute.
Though only a fraction of the $30 million-plus bonuses Orcel got as a Merrill Lynch banker earlier in his career, UniCredit's offer of up to 7.5 million euros ($9 million) a year puts him ahead of British bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY)' new CEO Charlie Nunn and of most European peers, analysts said.
UniCredit has said the package does not include any compensation for the more than 25 millions euros in deferred pay from former employer UBS Orcel is losing by taking a new job.
But the share bonus of up to 5 million euros, which is twice the fixed pay, has not been linked to performance or subjected to claw-back clauses for the first year.
The guaranteed bonus and a generally much higher pay package than his austere predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier had opted for have irked some of UniCredit investors and prompted leading shareholder advisers to call for a ""no"" vote on the matter.
Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis both back Orcel's appointment but they have recommended rejecting UniCredit's remuneration policy due to the ""problematic pay package of the new CEO.""
""The package is out of tune with the current setting, that calls for sobriety, and the previous CEO's pay,"" Italian proxy adviser Frontis Governance founder Sergio Carbonara said.
Frontis also advised shareholders to vote against the pay policy and Carbonara said he expected it would be rejected.
Speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, two top 30 UniCredit investors told Reuters their funds would vote against the remuneration package.
A spokesman for UniCredit said it would be Orcel's decision what to do if his pay package was not approved.
'A DISTRACTION'
""They should have judged the market appetite for this type of a reward better,"" Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), said.
""It's a little bit of a distraction ... they're inviting questions they could have easily avoided.""
A report by Italian market regulator Consob last week showed that the share of institutional votes rejecting companies' remuneration policies has increased in the last few years.
""Investors' dissent on companies' pay policy is on the rise,"" said Alessandro Zattoni, an Italian academic who chairs the International Corporate Governance Society.
Not all UniCredit investors begrudge Orcel his pay. The historic Fondazione Cariverona banking foundation has said the ""important and brave"" choices UniCredit faces to revive its profits call for the best talents available.
Also Turin-based Fondazione CRT, another UniCredit shareholder, intends to support the package. 
""The 'Cristiano Ronaldo' of finance deserves a champion's pay,"" individual shareholder Gianluca Fiorentini wrote in questions to the bank ahead of the AGM. ""Only time will tell if that's money well spent.""
A rejection of Orcel's proposed pay package would leave in place the current policy - meaning a fixed pay of 2.1 million euros and twice as much in variable remuneration.
UniCredit's former CEO Mustier, who left in February after falling out with the board over strategy, never actually earned that sum.
The French banker, who arrived in 2016 to steer UniCredit through a restructuring, cut his fixed pay by 40%, waived his yearly bonuses and pledged to leave without a severance cheque when the time came - as he outlined in slides during his first investor day.
UniCredit is now proposing doubling the cap on the severance payment to 15 million euros from 7.2 million under the new policy designed to attract global talent.
""They would say that in order to get a very skilful individual they need to put something on the table, but I could retort also that from Orcel's point of view this is a second chance for him in his career,"" Hermes' Alloatti said.
Orcel, who once declared in an interview he dreamt of running a bank one day, has been out of a job for the past two years after decades at the forefront of European banking, lastly as head of UBS' investment banking arm.

""He was never CEO of a listed bank ... it is a chance for him,"" Alloatti said. ($1 = 0.8385 euros)

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Wednesday, largely continuing the positive global trend on the back of falling bond yields as U.S. inflation concerns eased, although other concerns over Covid-19 remain.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.6%. 
Wall Street ended mostly higher Tuesday, with the broad-based S&P 500 index posting another record close, and Asian stock markets have largely followed suit as key U.S. Treasury yields fell to a fresh three-week low after data showed U.S. inflation was not spiralling out of control.
The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.6% in March, the biggest increase since August 2012, but the market had seemingly positioned for a higher figure as rising vaccinations and fiscal stimulus released pent-up demand. 
This CPI number is unlikely to change Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's view that higher inflation in coming months will be transitory, and thus the central bank’s monetary policy can still remain ultra easy, to the benefit of global stock markets. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped as low as 1.61%, partly as a result of that, and partly because of other news that put a dampener on economic reopening trades.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has delayed the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine outside the U.S. after the U.S. federal health agencies recommended pausing the use of the drug due to blood clotting worries.
This is the second vaccine, after AstraZeneca’s, to have such issues, and may further delay the EU's vaccination program, which may in turn delay a return to economic normality. Germany, which has still vaccinated less than 25% of its population, extended its lockdown by another three weeks on Monday.
In the corporate sector, luxury stocks will be in focus after Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) and LVMH  (PA:LVMH) both reported a strong start to the year after the close on Monday. 
Dutch mapping company TomTom (AS:TOM2) said its net loss for its first quarter narrowed significantly, but most eyes will be on the start of the earnings season on Wall Street, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reporting before the bell. 
Bank stocks have risen sharply so far this year, and analysts are expecting strong investment banking results to cement these gains.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday after industry data showed U.S. oil inventories declined more than expected last week, a sign of growing demand in the largest oil consumer in the world.
Crude stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week ended April 9, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute, compared with forecasts for a decline of about 2.2 million barrels prepared by Investing.com.
Official inventory figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries lifted its forecast for world oil demand growth this year on Tuesday, expecting the pandemic to subside as vaccination programs ramp up and thus travel curbs to be eased.

The U.S. Commerce Department said the seven Chinese entities were ""involved with building supercomputers used by China's military actors, its destabilizing military modernisation efforts, and/or weapons of mass destruction programs.""
Companies or others listed on the U.S. Entity List are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.

""Our companies, whether producers or exporters, must accord with our country's rules. Of course the United States has new rules, and our companies will pay attention and accord with the key criteria of the U.S. rules,"" she told reporters.
The U.S. move came amid its rising tensions with China over Taiwan. China has never renounced the use of force to bring the democratically ruled island under its control.
It also came amid a global shortage of semiconductors that has thrust Taiwan centre-stage into the technology supply-chain. 
On Tuesday, Taiwan's Alchip Technologies Ltd said it had stopped production for all products related to Tianjin Phytium Information Technology, which is on the new U.S. list.
Alchip, which said 39% of its revenue last year came from Phytium, added that it was collecting ""detailed documents for our U.S. counsel to determine if the products are subject to EAR (Export Administration Regulations)"".
A U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security ""permit will be obtained for Phytium's products if necessary"", it added.
Its shares tumbled 9.9% on Wednesday, bringing losses to more than a third of their value since the Commerce Department's announcement last week. 
Separately, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has suspended new orders from Phytium.
TSMC said it could not confirm the report, and declined further comment.

TSMC shares were down 0.5% on Wednesday, outperforming a 1.1% fall in the broader Taiwanese stock market.

The higher-than-expected numbers seemed to have little impact, however, given that the distortions surrounding the slump in price pressures in 2020. Some investors also remained confident that recovery will continue as central banks and government spending continue to provide support.
“A lot of growth and inflation has already been priced into the market... it’s almost as if you need to exceed those expectations in order to see a more pronounced reaction from markets,” John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland told Bloomberg.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 09:05PM ET</span>",Biden administration proceeding with $23 billion weapon sales to UAE,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has told Congress it is proceeding with more than $23 billion in weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates, including advanced F-35 aircraft, armed drones and other equipment, congressional aides said on Tuesday.
A State Department spokesperson said the administration would move forward with the proposed sales to the UAE, ""even as we continue reviewing details and consulting with Emirati officials"" related to the use of the weapons.
The Democratic president's administration had paused the deals agreed to by former Republican President Donald Trump in order to review them. The sales to the Gulf nation were finalized right before Trump left office.
The Trump administration told Congress in November it had approved the U.S. sale to the UAE as a side deal to the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered agreement in September in which the UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel.
In the last months of the Trump administration, Israel reached deals with the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco as part of the accords.
The $23.37 billion package contained products from General Atomics,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, including 50 F-35 Lighting II aircraft, up to 18 MQ-9B Unmanned Aerial Systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions.
YEMEN CONFLICT
Some U.S. lawmakers have criticized the UAE for its involvement in the war in Yemen, a conflict considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, and worried that the weapons transfers might violate U.S. guarantees that Israel will retain a military advantage in the region.
Israel said it did not object to the sales.
A legislative effort to stop the sales failed in December, as Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress backed his plans.
The Trump administration then finalized the massive sale to the UAE on Jan. 20, about an hour before Biden was sworn in as president.
The Biden administration announced the review in late January and the UAE said then it had anticipated the review and welcomed joint efforts to de-escalate tensions and for renewed regional dialogue.
The State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday the estimated delivery dates on the UAE sales, if implemented, were for after 2025 or later.
The government anticipated ""a robust and sustained dialogue with the UAE"" to ensure a stronger security partnership, the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
""We will also continue to reinforce with the UAE and all recipients of U.S. defense articles and services that U.S.-origin defense equipment must be adequately secured and used in a manner that respects human rights and fully complies with the laws of armed conflict,"" the statement said.
The Biden administration is also reviewing its policy for military sales to Saudi Arabia, including some Trump-era weapons deals, in light of the Saudi involvement in Yemen and other human rights concerns.

It has not released the results of that review. In February, U.S. officials told Reuters the administration was considering cancelling past deals that posed human rights concerns and limiting future sales to ""defensive"" weapons.

Schwab meant to send $82.56 to Kelyn Spadoni's Fidelity Brokerage Services account in February, but a computer glitch caused it to erroneously transfer more than $1.2 million, according to the lawsuit.
Schwab tried to get the money back, but repeated calls and texts to Spadoni, who lives in a suburb of New Orleans, were not returned, the brokerage said in the lawsuit.
""We are fully cooperating with authorities in an effort to resolve this issue,"" Schwab said in a statement on Tuesday. Fidelity declined comment. 
After receiving the money in her account, Spadoni transferred a quarter of the money to another account, after which she bought a house and a car using the funds, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Captain Jason Rivarde said in an interview on Tuesday.
""Obviously you are not planning to give the money back if you spent it,"" he said.
When Spadoni signed up with Schwab in January, the agreement she signed included a section that said any overpayment of funds must be returned, said the lawsuit, filed March 30. 
Schwab filed a complaint on April 6, said Rivarde. Spadoni was arrested on April 7 and charged with bank fraud, illegal transmission of monetary funds and theft greater than $25,000. She was released from jail on April 8 after posting a $150,000 bond, Rivarde said. 
Most of the money has been recovered.
A message by Reuters to a number listed as belonging to Spadoni was not immediately returned. Attempts by other media outlets to reach Spadoni also went unanswered. Rivarde said he did not have contact information for Spadoni or any attorney associated with her.
Some media reports likened the case to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s botched Revlon Inc payment, when the bank mistakenly sent a group of Revlon lenders $504 million. A judge in February said the asset managers could keep the funds because they were paid the money they were owed, and there was a ""strong presumption"" they were free to use it.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed at another record high on Tuesday and the Nasdaq composite index jumped, as investors shook off concerns about the halt in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine rollout and strong U.S. inflation.
The drugmaker's shares hit a one-month low before recovering some losses to close down 1.3%, as calls for pausing the use of its COVID-19 vaccine after six women developed rare blood clots dealt a fresh setback to efforts to tackle the pandemic.
The news came as U.S. data showed the consumer price index (CPI) in March rose by the most in more than 8-1/2 years, kicking off what the majority of economists expect will be a brief period of higher inflation.
U.S. futures initially dropped on the J&J news, but pared losses after the CPI data. Solid demand for Tuesday's U.S. Treasuries issue pushed down yields further, highlighting investors' lack of concern about any imminent bump in interest rates.
Instead, in one of the year's quietest sessions, high-flying technology names that flourished during coronavirus-induced lockdowns last year attracted renewed buying that boosted Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). The trio gained between 0.6% and 2.4%.
The wider technology sector rose 1%, and the NYSE FANG+TM Index climbed 1.7% to a record 12th straight higher close.
The S&P 500 finished at record highs on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week. 
""While (the J&J news) may cause some short-term volatility, investors have been pretty steadfast in their faith in a full economic recovery,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director at investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 68.13 points, or 0.2%, to 33,677.27; the S&P 500 gained 13.6 points, or 0.33%, at 4,141.59; and the Nasdaq Composite added 146.10 points, or 1.05%, at 13,996.10.
The volatility index, reflecting the lack of market jitters, hit a fresh 14-month closing low of 16.65.
""This year, 20 had proved to be a bit of a floor, but what we've seen from the start of this month is the VIX broke down through that level and established its trading range at mid-teens, which is notable for the broader risk environment as we enter earnings season,"" said Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
First-quarter earnings season begins in earnest on Wednesday, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reporting.
Analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to have jumped 25% from a year earlier, driven by strength in consumer discretionary and financial companies, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings gained 15% and 1.9% respectively as bitcoin prices soared 5.6%, a day ahead of the listing of Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.
The volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.3 billion shares, versus the 11.4 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq on Tuesday set a reference price of $250 per share for Coinbase Global Inc, projecting a value for the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange at $49.19 billion ahead of its landmark stock market debut on Wednesday.
The reference price is not an offering price for investors to purchase shares, but rather a benchmark for performance when the stock starts trading the exchange on Wednesday. 
Coinbase shares are set to start trading under the ""COIN"" symbol. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the Nasdaq from broker-dealers.
The reference price is below the $343.58 volume-weighted average price Coinbase's shares were trading at privately in the first quarter of this year. 
If shares trade hands at or above the reference price, Coinbase would be valued at more than six times the $8 billion the company was worth in its last private fundraising round in 2018.
By comparison, the market capitalization of New York Stock Exchange-parent company Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) is around $66 billion.
Coinbase has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering. This means the company will not raise any money and existing investors are not bound by lock-up restrictions on when they can divest their holdings following the market debut. 
The option to go public is much less common than a traditional IPO but is gaining traction. Previous high-profile direct listings include  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) in 2018, Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc in 2019 and Roblox Corp in 2021.
Founded in 2012, Coinbase is one of the best-known cryptocurrency platforms globally and has more than 56 million users who trade various virtual coins, including bitcoin, ethereum and XRP.

Bitcoin hit a record of $62,741 on Tuesday, extending its 2021 rally to new heights a day before the Coinbase listing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas-based SolarWinds Corp said the sprawling breach stemming from the compromise of its flagship software product has cost the company at least $18 million in the first three months of 2021.
In preliminary results made public on Tuesday, the company said it spent between $18 million and $19 million in the first quarter of 2021 to investigate and remediate what it described as ""the Cyber Incident.""
SolarWinds has been working since December to deal with the fallout of a series of intrusions blamed on Russian hackers across the U.S. government and scores of private companies. In many cases, the hackers compromised their targets by piggybacking on a subverted version of SolarWinds Orion, a widely used network management tool.
SolarWinds has hired cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Inc and professional services firm KPMG to help it investigate the intrusions. The company said its costs were likely to grow.
""We expect to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Cyber Incident in future periods,"" it said in a note. 

Solarwinds shares gained 2.1% in Tuesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Also, with rising Treasury yields and anticipated inflationary pressures, it makes sense for investors to buy high-yield stocks. So, against this backdrop, we think  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO), Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY), and Schweitzer-Mauduit (SWM) could be solid picks now.The United States saw a rising number of smokers in 2020 because of COVID-19-pandemic-led stress and depression. In recent years, the number of smokers has declined by 3-4% per year. To mitigate the health implications amid the rising demand, tobacco companies have been researching and launching next-generation, low-risk tobacco products, including moist snuff or e-vapors. As the harmful effects of smoking are reduced in the future by these next-generation products, the number of smokers is expected to rise globally. The global tobacco market size is likely to expand at a CAGR of 1.8% over the next seven years to generate $1.07 trillion in revenue by 2028.
Also, tobacco companies are collaborating with others to secure U.S. Food and Drug Association’s (FDA) approvals for their product pipelines. As a result, the next-generation tobacco products are likely to generate significant revenues for these companies. Furthermore, to attract investors, many tobacco companies are increasing their dividend yields.
Thus, we think high-yield tobacco companies Altria Group, Inc. (MO), Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB) (IMBBY), and  Schweitzer-Mauduit International , Inc. (NYSE:SWM) are ideal investment bets now.

(Reuters) - The company that manufactures Tasers says it has implemented design features and training recommendations to reduce the chances that law enforcement officers would confuse the electroshock weapon for a handgun when using force.
But after a police officer shot and killed a Black man in Minnesota on Sunday when, according to authorities, she mistakenly drew her gun instead of her Taser, experts said it is clear that problems persist with Taser training and the weapon's design.
At least 18 officers have made such errors in the past two decades, sometimes with deadly outcomes, according to data collected by John Peters, a former police officer who served as an expert witness in a prominent ""weapon confusion"" case involving a 2009 fatal shooting in California. 
Daunte Wright, 20, died in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center after what the city's police chief on Monday called an apparent ""accidental discharge"" by an officer who drew her gun instead of her Taser during a struggle following a traffic stop.
Officer Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, and Police Chief Tim Gannon both resigned on Tuesday. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and the department has not yet said what caused Potter to draw the wrong weapon.
Civil rights advocates have balked at the notion that Wright's death was accidental. In interviews, experts in police use of force said they did not have enough information about Sunday's shooting to assess what went wrong.
Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said the design of Tasers remains a major issue.
""What we're seeing is that in these incidents police officers often act in ways that are inconsistent with their law enforcement training,"" Stinson said. ""These devices look and feel like handguns, and that's the core problem.""
Arizona-based Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) Inc, which makes Tasers, said in an email that its efforts to minimize confusion have included giving the weapons a different grip and making them heavier than firearms. Tasers are also available in yellow to contrast with a black gun, the company added.
'MOTOR MEMORY'
For many experts, the biggest issue when it comes to weapon confusion is inadequate training on Tasers.
""On average a recruit will draw their firearm about 5,000 times in the police academy, but maybe at most draw their Taser 10 times,"" said Peters, president of the Nevada-based Institute for the Prevention of In-Custody Deaths.
As a result, in stressful situations a officer's ""motor memory"" can kick in ""and you go for your gun,"" Peters said.
Peters testified as an expert witness at the trial of former Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) police officer Johannes Mehserle, who fatally shot a man named Oscar Grant in 2009 in Oakland, California. Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two years in prison. Mehserle is one of just two U.S. police officers to be criminally charged after confusing a handgun for a Taser, Peters said.
Mike Leonesio, a former police officer and former master Taser instructor, said there is no research proving the Taser's color makes a difference in the heat of a stressful encounter.
""In training I've done, often officers don't even remember drawing their weapon or what it looked like,"" said Leonesio, who advocated more training to avoid such mix-ups.
Axon recommends that officers carry a Taser in a separate holster from their gun and on an officer's non-dominant side, with the gun positioned on the dominant side. Ultimately, each policing agency develops its own policy.
The Brooklyn Center police manual states that officers must position Tasers ""in a reaction-side holster on the side opposite the duty weapon."" It also says officers need to be trained at least annually, and the training should include ""performing reaction-hand draws or cross-draws to reduce the possibility of accidentally drawing and firing a firearm.""
    The police department did not respond to questions from Reuters about the positioning of Potter's device, her overall training history or how many hours of Taser training she underwent annually.
The manual says an officer should give a verbal warning before using a Taser. On body camera footage released from Sunday's incident, Potter can be heard shouting ""Taser, Taser, Taser!"" before shooting Wright with her gun and exclaiming, ""Holy shit, I just shot him.""
Paige Fernandez, a policing policy advocate with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the issue over whether Potter mistook her gun for her Taser is a distraction from the overarching issue of systematic racism within police forces. Fernandez said she believed such racism played a role in Wright's death.

""Policing as an institution is the problem,"" Fernandez said.

Investing.com - U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week, but product gasoline inventories increased for a second-straight week to add further uncertainty on the outlook for product demand at time when a vaccine setback has clouded optimism over the reopening.       
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for U.S. crude prices, rose $0.69 a barrel on the news, after settling up $0.48 at $60.18 a barrel.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels for the week ended April 8, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute. That compared with a draw of 2.6 million barrels reported by the API for the previous week.
The API also showed that gasoline inventories increased by about 5.6 million last week, compared with a 4.5 million build in the prior week, and distillate stocks fell by about 3.0 million barrels. 
Oil prices ended higher on the day, but upside was kept in check by concerns that a setback for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine will delay the economic reopening, slowing the recovery in energy demand.

(Reuters) -Apple Inc on Tuesday called for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require companies to disclose far-reading emissions information such as how customers use their products, according to a tweet from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vice President Lisa Jackson.
The comments by the iPhone maker mark the most specific prescription to date from a large public company about what disclosures are needed, said Veena Ramani, senior program director for Ceres, a Boston-based climate advocacy group.
The SEC last month said it will seek input on how companies might report on their greenhouse gas emissions and other climate factors.
Investors have poured money into funds that use environmental, social and governance factors to pick stocks, but a lack of common standards has made it hard to compare issuers' operations. 
Jackson, a former U.S. environmental regulator, in her tweet included a statement that Apple ""believes that the SEC should issue rules to require that companies disclose third-party-audited emissions information to the public, covering all scopes of emissions, direct and indirect, and the value chain.""
An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the phrasing referred to so-called Scope 3 emissions like those resulting from the use of a company's products by other parties. While that can be simple for technology or finance companies to provide, calls to publish the data can be controversial for other industries.
In reporting its Scope 3 emissions in January for the first time, oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp wrote that the data ""is less certain and less consistent because it includes the indirect emissions resulting from the consumption and use of a company’s products occurring outside of its control.""

Various other business leaders have previously called for mandatory climate disclosures including Larry Fink, CEO of top investor BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). In February, BlackRock also urged heavy polluters to disclose their Scope 3 emissions to investors, like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures has also recommended. 
In addition, Apple was among hundreds of companies that on Tuesday pressured the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at record highs on Tuesday, shrugging off a vaccine setback as reopening stocks cut some losses and tech rallied ahead of the start of quarterly earnings season.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.33%, to a close at a record high of 4,141.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%, or 68 points, but had been down more than 100 points intraday, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.05%.
U.S. health authorities halted the use of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Covid-19 vaccine after reports that recipients experienced rare blood clotting within 6 to 13 days after receiving the single-shot inoculation.
The Food and Drug Administration said the probe into the blood clots is expected to last for ""a matter of days."" The U.S. drug watchdog confirmed that they haven't seen the blood clots from recipients of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines.
President Joe Biden, however, said the U.S. has enough vaccine ""for every single solitary American,"" despite the setback. 
Reopening stocks – those tied to the progress of the economic reopening – like cruise lines, hotels and airlines recovered some their losses 
Weaker guidance from American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) soured the sentiment on the broader sector somewhat as the airline forecast wider-than-expected losses for Q1.
The vaccine rollout is pivotal to ensuring the consumer, the backbone of the U.S. economy, feels safe and confident to return to spending.
""The data that I've seen points to consumer balance sheets being in the best shape, they've been in for many years,"" Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance, said in a recent interview with Investing.com. ""I don’t think there is a risk that the consumer is going to disappoint,"" Diton added.
Technology helped to push the broader market to record highs as investors continue to back megacap growth in the run up to quarterly earnings later this month.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed in the green. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) slipped to close lower on the day.
A fall in U.S. bond yields, which trade inversely to prices, also supported investor sentiment on growth stocks despite the latest data showing an uptick in inflation.
The U.S. consumer price index rose by 0.6% in March, topping economists' expectations for a 0.5% increase, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Tuesday.
""One strong month is just a rebound, but we expect further outsized gains as the economy reopens,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
Major Wall Street banks were lower ahead of quarterly earnings from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) due Wednesday.
Still, there are some on Wall Street urging caution.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>","Chinese, U.S. luxury lovers power rebound at LVMH","By Silvia Aloisi and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - Sales at French luxury goods group LVMH bounced back far more quickly than expected in early 2021, carried by demand for Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior products as Chinese and U.S. shoppers made the most of an easing of COVID-19 restrictions. 
A freeze in international tourism triggered by the pandemic added to the pain of store closures for the luxury industry last year, and the crisis had raised concern that consumers might lose their appetite and spending power for high-end wares. 
LVMH, the sector's biggest company and owner of more than 70 brands ranging from Moet & Chandon champagne to Guerlain cosmetics, on Tuesday posted first-quarter revenues that even exceeded 2019 levels, before the pandemic. 
Its like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of currency changes and its acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, rose by 30% year-on-year in the three months to March to 14 billion euros ($16.70 billion).
That was nearly double an analyst consensus forecast for 17% growth cited by UBS. Compared with pre-pandemic levels and the first quarter of 2019, like-for-like sales were up 8%. 
Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 86% from year-ago levels, and in the United States, which is rolling out a massive stimulus programme, revenues rose 23%.
That contrasted with a 9% drop in Europe in the period, where economies are also expected to recover this year, but some countries, including France and Italy, have brought in new lockdowns to control rising infection rates. 
Across much of Asia, stores have been open since last spring. Luxury customers have begun buying more pricey goods online too, which helped Vuitton for instance, though LVMH said this remained a minor factor overall. 
""Nothing replaces store visits, you can just improve it with a visit before online,"" finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told a conference call with analysts. 
NO MORE ACQUISITIONS?
LVMH's revenues had dropped by 16% last year, and its airports duty free business is still struggling. 
But its fashion and leather goods division, which houses Vuitton, Dior and brands such as Fendi and which accounts for nearly half of LVMH's revenues, recorded a 52% increase in like-for-like sales, again way above analysts forecasts of a 27% rise. 
The watches and jewellery division's sales rose by 138% when including acquisitions and exchange rate effects, benefiting from the consolidation of Tiffany. 
LVMH completed the $15.8 billion acquisition in early January after a legal battle. 
Asked about more potential purchases in the luxury goods sector, including brands such as Armani, Guiony brushed off suggestions LVMH was ready to pounce again and said the group was focused on integrating Tiffany.

As a result, a dependence on companies that provide remote services is gradually reducing. This, coupled with rising Treasury yields, is causing a pullback by these stocks. As this trend is expected to continue, we think it could be wise to now avoid stay-at-home stocks  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), Fastly (NYSE:FSLY), and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON). Let’s take a closer look at these names.Stay-at-home stocks have paid investors handsomely over the last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dependence on these companies by businesses and individuals seeking to stay afloat and connected has helped their stock prices skyrocket.
However, rapid progress on the coronavirus vaccination front has led to much subdued performance by these stocks so far this year. That’s because the demand for solutions offered by these companies is gradually declining with vaccinated people spending less time in their homes. According to data collected by Bloomberg, more than 797 million doses of vaccines have been administered around the world, at a rate of roughly 18 million doses per day. The United States alone has so far administered around 190 million doses, vaccinating almost 29.6% of its entire population.
Investors’ positive sentiment regarding the steps back toward normal driven by the vaccinations is causing a pullback in remote-working stocks, as evidenced by Direxion Work From Home ETF’s (WFH) 6.2% loss over the past two months. Another major reason for this pullback is the rapid rise in Treasury yields. Equity markets typically do not respond favorably to rising Treasury yields. Hence, we think stay-at-home companies Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM), Teladoc Health, Inc. (TDOC), Fastly, Inc. (FSLY), and Peloton Interactive, Inc. (PTON) are now best avoided.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON)'s offer to sell assets in five EU countries and takeover target Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW)'s reinsurance arm may not be enough to address EU competition concerns, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Aon is looking to the acquisition to create the world's largest insurance broker ahead of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC) as the industry grapples with rising claims and new challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. 
Last Friday, the London-headquartered company submitted concessions to the European Union's competition watchdog, which did not disclose details in line with its policy. The watchdog often requires acquiring companies to make concessions that will strengthen rivals before giving its go-ahead.
Aon has proposed selling Willis Re, its biggest concession, and Willis' German retirement benefits and consulting business. It has also offered to sell Willis' insurance broking activities in France, including French unit Gras Savoye, as well as in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, one of the people said.
In addition, Aon is offering to sell Willis' entire property and casualty business portfolio servicing large multinationals in those four countries and other European assets to service these clients, as well as its financial and professional lines, the person said.
""The remedy does not reflect market reality. It leaves out multinationals in other countries,"" the person said.
""It would help a lot if Willis UK is divested because a lot of specialities sit there. Aon needs to divest Willis' global network. The remedy here is about Europe, it doesn't address needs outside Europe,"" the person said.
Willis' UK cyber business, UK financial and professional lines, its global aviation business and space business are also part of the concessions package, while Willis brokers in Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands could be transferred to the buyer of the assets.

The European Commission has given rivals and customers until Friday to respond to the proposal. It is schedule to decide on the deal by July 12.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 12:46PM ET</span>","Greensill review will address questions over lobbying, says Johnson","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday an independent review would have ""carte blanche"" to look into lobbying, especially former Prime Minister David Cameron's work for Greensill Capital.
The role Cameron played in trying to lobby ministers on behalf of the failed finance company has raised questions about government access, particularly by former ministers who take up paid employment with private firms.
It has also fuelled accusations that Johnson's government operates a so-called ""chumocracy"" where contracts are handed to friends - a charge denied by the government, which says that Cameron's lobbying did not result in his desired aim.
Johnson's spokesman said the review would not have legal powers - something the main opposition Labour Party said added to the impression that the review was ""a Conservative cover up"".
Cameron has said he had not broken any lobbying rules, but that he accepted his communication with government should be completely formal. The former prime minister has indicated he will take part in the review.
Asked what he made of the behaviour of his former boss Cameron, Johnson told reporters: ""That's a matter for Nigel,"" referring to Nigel Boardman, a partner at law firm Slaughter and May, who will lead the investigation into Greensill. 
He said Boardman would have ""pretty much carte blanche to ask anybody whatever he needs to find out"".
The review was prompted after the Financial Times and Sunday Times newspapers reported that Cameron contacted ministers on behalf of Greensill, including sending text messages to finance minister Rishi Sunak and arranging a drink between Australian banker Lex Greensill and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.
Greensill was brought in as an adviser to the government while Cameron was prime minister from 2010 to 2016. After leaving office, Cameron became an adviser to Greensill's now-insolvent company.
The ties between government and Greensill were also illustrated by the Cabinet Office saying the government's former procurement chief was allowed to take a part-time role advising the company's board in September 2015 while employed as a public official, or civil servant. 
On Sunday, Cameron said in a statement he did not break any codes of conduct or government rules and that ultimately the outcome of the discussions on Greensill's proposals on a loan were not taken up.

But he added: ""As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation.""

Roblox, which is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles, saw its stock jump nearly 9% to a record high of $81.69 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. It was last up 7%.
The San Mateo, California, company's shares have now climbed 80% since its Wall Street debut on March 10. Roblox's $44 billion market capitalization dwarfs Hasbro's $14 billion value, while its annual sales are about a fifth of the century-old company's.
Hasbro said its Nerf blasters, which fire projectiles made of plastic foam, would be available in U.S. stores in the fall, each with a code entitling the customer to a ""virtual blaster"" for their online Roblox avatar. 
Hasbro, which also said it created a Roblox version of its Monopoly game, saw its stock increase by 1.2% to $98.23 a share on the Nasdaq.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>",United Airlines unveils plan to fund more sustainable jet fuel made from trash,"By Tracy Rucinski and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -United Airlines said on Tuesday it has partnered with global firms including  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) in an ""Eco-Skies Alliance"" to finance use this year of about 3.4 million gallons of low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel derived from trash.
Though tiny compared with the 4.3 billion gallons of jet fuel that United consumed in 2019 prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount triples the roughly 1 million gallons of sustainable fuel it has used each year since 2016.
Airlines have used sustainable fuel since 2008 as part of efforts to reduce outright emissions, but so far this represents barely 1% of the fuel used worldwide, industry groups say.
Chicago-based United named 11 of more than a dozen global partners for the plan but did not disclose the cost, or how much each would contribute. 
Air transport accounts for 2%-3% of greenhouse gas emissions, the French aerospace association said on Tuesday. Environmental groups argue the sector's overall contribution is higher.
Partners include companies with corporate or cargo deals with United, like Nike, Siemens, Palantir and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
United said the project gives customers a way to help reduce the environmental impact of flying beyond buying carbon offsets and could help create more of a market for sustainable aviation fuels.
""We'll see how it develops,"" Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters. ""I think there's a huge appetite for it.""
The airline industry has focused more broadly on the purchase of carbon offsets to reduce the environmental impact of flying, pending the arrival of new technology to meet the sector's goal of halving net emissions by 2050 versus 2005.
Environmental critics say offsets do not directly address climate goals and mask the problem of ongoing jet emissions.
United, which along with some other carriers has said it wants to cut net emissions more aggressively by 100% by 2050, has criticized offsets and announced a recent investment in ""carbon-capture"" technology. It has invested in a sustainable aviation fuel producer called Fulcrum BioEnergy.
""While we know that aircraft are never going to be completely decarbonized, we are not going to use offsets as the way to get to 100% green,"" Kirby said.
Airline association IATA says life cycle greenhouse emissions from sustainable fuel can be at least 80% lower than normal fuel and are the only medium-term option for curbing emissions growth, since airlines cannot yet switch to electric planes.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has said it plans to replace 10% of its jet fuel, currently refined from fossil fuel, with sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030.
While using waste avoids taking land from food production, environmental groups like Transport & Environment say such supplies are limited and face competition from other sectors.

People staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic have turned to games for entertainment, helping drive a 35% surge in video game spending in February to about $4.6 billion, according to research firm NPD.
Epic Games said in a statement that it had received an additional investment of $200 million from minority shareholder  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp, while it also raised funds from investors such as Appaloosa, Baillie Gifford, and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc.
The latest funding comes as Epic and Apple are set to fight in court following the video games maker's attempt last year to avoid a 30% App Store fee by launching its own in-app payment system, a move that prompted Apple to ban Fortnite from its store.
Apple said last week it planned to argue that it faces abundant competition in the market for video game transactions to defend itself against antitrust allegations by Epic Games.
Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney will remain the controlling shareholder of the company after the latest investments.
""Their investment will help accelerate our work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite, Rocket League and Fall Guys, while empowering game developers and creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic Games Store,"" Sweeney said.
Epic launched free-to-play battle-royal videogame ""Fortnite"" in 2017 and since then has amassed a huge following among young gamers. 
The company has more than 160 million users on its PC store, according to its website. 
Epic last year received a $250 million investment from Sony, and it raised $1.25 billion in funding in 2018 from investors including KKR.

The company's orders appear to be turning a corner after the coronavirus crisis caused airline customers to cancel hundreds of jets on orders last year, resulting in one of the worst performances for Boeing ever.
Boeing's net orders turned positive for the first time in 14 months in February as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts boosted the confidence of its customers. (https://reut.rs/2OKrLjD)
The plane manufacturer said it booked March gross orders of 196 aircraft, all of them for its 737 family of jets. Net of cancellations and conversions, Boeing had 40 jet orders for its 737 planes last month.
Boeing said its March gross orders include previously announced 100 737 MAX orders for Southwest and 24 737 MAX orders for private investment firm 777 Partners and 11 orders for P8 military aircraft.
Turkish Airlines canceled 10 737 MAX airplane orders in March and converted 40 737 MAX jet orders to options.
China's CDB Financial scrapped 16 737 MAX orders last month and China Aircraft Leasing canceled 26 737 MAX orders.
 Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) and United Airlines respectively recontracted nine and 25 737 MAX orders last month for earlier delivery positions.
Nineteen 737 MAX orders were canceled by unidentified customers in March.
Boeing's gross orders for the first quarter were 282 airplanes. Net of cancellations and conversions, orders stood at 69 aircraft in the quarter. Adjusted for stricter accounting standards, Boeing's net orders were 76 airplanes in the first quarter ended March.
Boeing's official backlog rose to 4054 aircraft orders in March from 4041 orders in February.

The company delivered a total of 77 airplanes in the first quarter, up from 50 aircraft a year earlier. Boeing resumed 787 jet deliveries in late March after halting them for four months due to production defects.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has signaled support for legislation to extend by seven months a ban on illegal copycat versions of fentanyl, the powerful synthetic painkiller that has helped fuel the nation's opioid epidemic.
Without action from Congress, the temporary ban on all variants of fentanyl - a drug 100 times more potent than morphine - would expire on May 6. The department said in a statement late on Monday it intends to ""work with Congress to seek a clean, seven-month extension to prevent this important law enforcement tool from lapsing.""
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration since 2018 has sought to crack down on the proliferation of chemical look-alikes of fentanyl, known as ""analogues,"" by classifying them as so-called Schedule 1 drugs, meaning like heroin they are highly addictive and have no medical use.
Fentanyl has been linked to large numbers of deaths as the United States battles a decades-old opioid epidemic. Many of the fentanyl analogues that have flooded America's streets were manufactured in China or Mexico.
The DEA under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump lobbied Congress to make permanent a temporary ban on all fentanyl chemical copycats, both to deter their importation and to make it easier for prosecutors to bring drug-trafficking cases.
Before the class-wide ban, the DEA and the Food and Drug Administration were required to undertake a rigorous scientific study of each individual new variant of fentanyl found on the streets before it could be added to Schedule 1.
Congress has balked at making the ban permanent amid concerns voiced by criminal justice advocates and some researchers that such action could make it harder for scientists to win approval for studying the substances and could lead to mass incarceration of low-level drug dealers and addicts.

The Justice Department's statement acknowledged these concerns, saying it intends to ""address legitimate concerns related to mandatory minimums (prison terms) and researcher access to these substances.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Grab Holdings, the largest ride-hailing and food delivery firm in Southeast Asia, clinched a merger on Tuesday with special-purpose acquisition company Altimeter Growth Corp securing a valuation of nearly $40 billion and paving the way for a coveted U.S. listing.
The merger, the biggest blank-check company deal ever, underscores the frenzy on Wall Street as shell firms have raised $99 billion in the United States so far this year after a record $83 billion in 2020.
As part of Singapore-based Grab's agreement with the SPAC backed by Altimeter Capital, investors such as Temasek Holdings, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity International, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala and Malaysia's Permodalan Nasional Bhd will participate in a $4 billion private investment in public equity offering.
Funds managed by Altimeter Capital will lead the investment with $750 million.
""Institutional investors looking for Asian consumer internet exposure are keen to diversify their allocation beyond a handful of companies,"" said Varun Mittal, head of emerging markets fintech business at consultancy EY.
Grab said its decision to become a public company was driven by a strong financial performance last year.
The transactions validate Grab's co-founder Anthony Tan's strategy of aggressively tapping growth in new sectors and ramping up market share by pumping billions of dollars to localise its services and invest in high-growth economies.
Tan told Reuters the funds will be used to double down on the last-mile delivery network and to bulk up its financial services business, such as digital bank and mobile payments.
The 39-year-old launched Grab as a taxi app in Malaysia in June 2012 with fellow Harvard Business School alumni Tan Hooi Ling, and then quickly took it regional.
The deals for Grab, which was valued at just over $16 billion last year, are a big win for its early backers such as SoftBank Group Corp and China's Didi Chuxing.
Reuters earlier reported that Grab would announce the deal on Tuesday.
Altimeter Growth and Grab will become fully-owned subsidiaries of a new holding company, which is expected to be valued at $39.6 billion on an initial proforma equity basis.
""Southeast Asia is one of the fastest growing digital economies in the world, with a population approximately twice the size of the United States. Yet online penetration for food delivery, on-demand mobility and electronic transactions are a fraction of the U.S. and China,"" said Brad Gerstner, founder and chief executive officer of Silicon Valley-based Altimeter.
The transactions will provide Grab with about $4.5 billion in cash proceeds.
The deals, which have been approved by the boards of both Grab and Altimeter Growth, are aimed to close by July.
""Grab is now synonymous with Southeast Asia’s exciting growth story,"" said Greg Moon, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers.
Grab attracted global attention in 2018 when it acquired Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s Southeast Asia business after a costly five-year battle in return for a stake in itself.
Reuters reported in January that Grab, which has so far raised about $12 billion, was exploring a U.S. listing. [L1N2JT0HC]
""For us, it was about depth, it is highly liquid, it is large with global names, global investors,"" Tan said on why Grab choose the U.S. markets for a listing.
Grab's agreed transaction will surpass electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors' $24 billion deal struck with a SPAC in February.
BATTLEGROUND INDONESIA
With operations in eight countries and over 400 cities, Grab is Southeast Asia's most valuable start-up.
Leveraging its ride-hailing business, it has moved into food and grocery deliveries, courier services, digital payments, and is now making a push into insurance and lending in a region of 650 million people.
The listing will give Grab extra firepower in its main market of Indonesia, where local rival Gojek is close to sealing a merger with the country's leading e-commerce business, Tokopedia.
Grab is also facing more competition from cash-rich, U.S.-listed Sea. Both Grab and Sea won digital bank licences in Singapore last year.
Grab, whose net revenue surged 70% last year, has yet to turn profitable. The food delivery segment became its biggest business as more consumers shift to online food delivery after the pandemic.

Grab reported adjusted net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2020 and forecasts this to rise to $4.5 billion in 2023. It expects to turn positive on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization basis in 2023.
Evercore was the lead financial advisor to Grab on the deal and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were co-advisors.

Investing.com – FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares will benefit from an uptick in economic activity, according to KeyBanc analyst Todd Fowler, who upgraded the stock to overweight with a price target of $350.
The price target is almost 20% from the stock’s current price. FedEx shares dipped 0.3% on Tuesday.
Last month, analysts at three brokerages -- Robert W. Baird, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Berenberg Bank –reiterated their buy ratings on FedEx stock. Robert W. Baird has a price target of $312 and Berenberg $325 with Goldman Sachs’s $365 being the highest of the three, a 25% premium to the stock’s current price.
Fowler sees a rational pricing environment and share opportunity as  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) takes a more measured approach to volume growth, the combination of which support an improved ground outlook.
“Further, we are encouraged by indications of resilient airfreight dynamics with demand improving against limited incremental capacity which may sustain Express load factors and margins intermediately. Lastly, we view broader improvements in industrial production and economic activity as increasingly favorable for B2B demand,"" he wrote.
The analyst pointed out that air cargo capacity remains constrained and ground yields were strengthening while business-to-consumer shipments in e-commerce support improved density."

Its revenue has increased at a CAGR of 51.4% over the past three years. 
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of people have been shifting away from traditional linear TV toward a wide range of streaming ecosystems, thus helping ROKU grow in terms of number of active accounts.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday after news that the U.S. will suspend the distribution of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Covid-19 vaccine wrongfooted the reopening trades that have dominated in recent weeks. 
""We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,"" the Food and Drug Administration said in a joint statement with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Twitter. The move comes after six patients - all of them women aged between 18 and 48, developed blood clots on the brain within two weeks of taking the vaccine. The problem is similar to the one that has dogged AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s Covid-19 drug, although the incidence appears to be lower: the six cases identified compare to over 6.8 million shots of the J&J drug already distributed.
J&J said it will proactively stop the rollout of the drug in Europe. J&J stock fell 2.4%, dragging down popular 'reopening'-themed stocks such as airlines and cruise operators. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was the worst affected, falling 5.1%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock fell 3.6%. Both airlines have chosen to tap relatively expensive debt markets in recent weeks to get them through what they expect to be the last of the Covid-19-related lockdowns, rather than depend on cheaper funding from the government that comes with more strings attached. Carnival  (NYSE:CCL) stock meanwhile fell 2.6% 
Some of the biggest gainers from the news were rival vaccine makers, which now have an opportunity to grab market share from J&J.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 8.9%, while BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 7.2%.
The news overshadowed a slightly higher-than-expected inflation print for March. The CPI rose 2.6% year-on-year as the collapse of oil prices a year ago created a distorted base effect. The monthly rise in prices, at 0.3%, was however also stronger than expected and the biggest such rise since September. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 180 points, or 0.5%, at 33,565 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% but the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.8%.
""US inflation is on the rise and has a lot further to go. We see 4% in the next few months with rising corporate pricing power and the strong housing market likely to keep it close to 3% for much longer than the market is anticipating,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING, via Twitter.
Elsewhere,  Altimeter Growth  Corp (NASDAQ:AGC)., the special purpose acquisition company that has agreed to take southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab public at a valuation of $40 billon, fell some 4.7% after initially rising on the reports. "
1122,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 09:30AM ET</span>","AI chip maker SambaNova raises $676 million, valued at over $5 billion","By Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) - SambaNova Systems, a Silicon Valley startup that makes semiconductors for artificial intelligence related computation work, said on Tuesday it raised $676 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 2.
The latest injection took SambaNova’s total funding to more than $1 billion, valuing the company at more than $5 billion, it said. 
The funding round is the third biggest venture capital deal in chips the last two decades, according to data firm PitchBook. While Silicon Valley has focused its fire power on software, social media, and internet investments over the past decade, there has been a shift in recent years to back more challenging technology, including semiconductors. PitchBook’s data shows global venture capitalists invested $7.4 billion in 2020, a 20-year record.
SambaNova does not sell its chips, manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TMSC), instead using them to build servers and AI software it then leases to companies for a subscription fee. 
“We provide the services to customers so that they don't have to actually hire and build entire teams of machine learning experts in order to actually be able to run these machines,” said Rodrigo Liang, SambaNova co-founder and CEO. 
Liang said SambaNova developed its own chip architecture rather than use one of the major architectures such as ARM or x86, used in smartphones and laptop computers.
The company avoided the impacts of a global chip production shortfall by investing to secure production capacity with TMSC when it heard “rumblings of a shortage” early last year, he said. 
SambaNova was co-founded by Liang and Stanford University professors Kunle Olukotun and Chris Ré in 2017. Olukotun is the leader of the Stanford Hydra Chip Multiprocessor research
project and Ré is an associate professor in the Stanford AI Lab. 

The latest funding round included new investors Temasek and Government of Singapore Investment Corp., along with existing investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Capital, GV, formerly known as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures, and Walden International.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Renewable fuels company Neste and terminal operator NuStar Energy have expanded a California project to increase their distribution of low-carbon aviation fuel, the companies said Tuesday.
Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel say the fuel is a way for the aviation industry to lower its carbon emissions to meet global efforts in fighting climate change. U.S. airlines and industry groups have been pushing the federal government to back a subsidy for the fuel to increase production.
Trucks at the NuStar-operated Selby Terminal near San Francisco can now load with sustainable aviation fuel supplied by Finland-based Neste, the companies said. The first gallons supplied through the expansion were picked up at the terminal and have been delivered to the nearby Monterey Regional Airport. 
The location of the Selby terminal will allow Neste to supply sustainable aviation fuel to a growing number of airports across the western United States, the companies said in the announcement.
""We must act now to reduce emissions from air travel in order to preserve the many benefits flying brings to our lives and the economy,"" said Chris Cooper, vice president for renewable aviation for Neste in North America. 
This is the latest collaboration between Neste and NuStar, based in San Antonio, Texas, around sustainable aviation fuel. In 2020, Neste supplied the fuel to San Francisco International Airport from the Selby Terminal using an existing pipeline.
The companies said they want to make the terminal into a hub for low-emission renewable fuels, including renewable diesel.

Neste has supplied about 220 million gallons of renewable diesel in California through the NuStar Selby Terminal over the last decade. Renewable diesel can power trucks and construction equipment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is allowing owner Sanjeev Gupta to explore refinancing options for Liberty Steel before offering any potential government support, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this month he was hopeful the government could find a solution for Liberty Steel after its biggest lender Greensill Capital went into insolvency last month. 
""I think it's absolutely necessary to have steel here in the UK, it has a future,"" Kwarteng told a parliamentary hearing. ""But we can't strip Liberty Steel in this instance now from the wider group under which it sits.""
""Mr Gupta's assurances that he can refinance his business needs to be examined and he should be allowed time to find the actual refinancing to keep his businesses afloat,"" Kwarteng said.
""What I won't rush into is giving any guarantees."" 
Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in Britain, said last week it was working to provide additional working capital facilities and that it had resumed partial production at one of its plants in England. 
But the government rejected a request for an emergency loan of 170 million pounds ($233 million) for Gupta's conglomerate GFG Alliance citing its global spread of operations and opaque structure.
Kwarteng reiterated on Tuesday that Britain was not prepared to provide cash to GFG.
In an insolvency filing last month, Greensill said GFG, which is its largest client, had warned in February it would ""collapse into insolvency"" if the supply chain finance firm stopped providing it with working capital.
Gupta has urged creditors not to pull the plug, saying he had garnered interest from financiers willing to refinance billions of dollars in debt owed to Greensill, but he has not provided details of any specific offers.

Switzerland's second-biggest bank has been reeling from the collapses of Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management, with a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.75 billion) charge hitting its balance sheet after Archegos failed to meet margin commitments.
The matters have prompted the bank to overhaul its asset management unit, responsible for $10 billion of supply chain finance funds which invested in bonds issued by Greensill, and to replace its head of investment banking, as well as its head of compliance and risk.
""To regain shareholder trust in light of the substantial financial and reputational damage that the company is facing as a result of the aforementioned matters, shareholders would be better served by a change in leadership of the risk committee,"" Glass Lewis said in a report issuing recommendations to shareholders on Tuesday.
""While we note that the supply chain finance funds and US-based hedge fund matters...have only emerged in recent weeks and that investigations are likely still in preliminary stages, we believe that these issues cast significant doubt on the efficacy of the board's oversight of the Company's risk and control framework,"" Glass Lewis added.

“We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,” the Food and Drug Administration said in a tweet.
J&J stock was down 2.6% by 8 AM ET in response.
It’s a big setback for the company and a troubling one for the country's vaccination campaign. The fact that J&J's vaccine only needs a single shot, rather than the two required by  Pfizer 's  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna’s, means that it's a faster way to immunize more people.

Volkswagen has so far incurred more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in costs as a result of the scandal.
Tuesday's case was brought by a customer who purchased a used VW Golf with a loan from VW Bank, a subsidiary of the carmaker. After the diesel scandal emerged, she returned the car, which used the EA 189 engine at the heart of the test cheating crisis, and claimed damages.

Investing.com – Shares of  Altimeter Growth  (NASDAQ:AGC) rose by more than 10% in Tuesday’s premarket after Grab said it would merge with the blank check firm in a $40 billion deal, the largest merger yet involving a special purpose acquisition company.  
The Singapore-headquartered ride hailing firm will receive $4.5 billion through the so-called ‘PIPE’ mechanism (private investment in public equity).
A SPAC is a blank-check shell company that uses proceeds from an IPO to take private firms public. It is usually set up by high profile people with relevant industry experience and that’s what gets it the valuation since as such it doesn’t have running operations at the time of going public.
The listing of a SPAC is a quicker process and involves less scrutiny. Once listed, a SPAC’s promoters hunt for the right acquisition target to deploy the IPO proceeds.
Grab is a popular ride hailing taxi service in southeast Asia, and is backed by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Didi Chuxing. 
The company is also into online food delivery and digital wallet payments. Grab expects its total addressable market to grow to more than $180 billion by 2025 from approximately $52 billion in 2020."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management belies CVC Capital's $20 billion proposal to take Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp private is ""far below fair value"" and has urged the Japanese conglomerate to seek other offers. 
An investor in Toshiba since 2016, the fund said that a price of more than 6,200 yen ($56.54) per share for Toshiba would be appropriate, rather than the reported offer of 5,000 yen per share.
While Oasis understands that the bid was unsolicited and should be given due consideration for the benefit of all shareholders, the activist investor wrote to Toshiba's board chairman, Osamu Nagayama, to voice its concerns.
""If the company is open to bids, we believe there would be other bidders interested in acquiring Toshiba,"" Oasis said in the letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday. 
U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management has also asked Toshiba to seek multiple offers, but Oasis is the first to present what it considers a fair price. 
Toshiba shares have been hovering well below CVC's likely offer price after hitting a four-year high last week, with the stock closing at 4,595 yen on Tuesday. 
Oasis does not disclose the size of its stake while Farallon is Toshiba's third-largest shareholder with a holding of about 6%, said a source close to the matter. 
Known for its overtures to Japanese companies to boost returns, Oasis recently helped to drive the sale of baseball stadium owner Tokyo Dome Corp to developer Mitsui Fudosan (OTC:MTSFY) in a $1.2 billion deal. 
The Oasis letter to Toshiba also proposed that the company should set up a special committee to discuss the CVC offer as soon as possible, adding that Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani be excluded from the process because he is a former senior CVC executive.

Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Tuesday said there had been block trades of 72 billion yen of Toshiba shares on Friday, representing about 3.4% of the company's market value.

The partnership comes as SAP, under the leadership of CEO Christian Klein, seeks to shift its user base more quickly into the cloud and, in financial services, stay relevant at a time of digital disruption.
""What we want to deliver is a financial services industry speedboat,"" Luka Mucic, SAP's chief financial officer, told a news briefing.
As a minority shareholder in the venture, SAP will not consolidate its results, said Mucic. He added that SAP still expected to reap net benefits from licensing its core database and cloud platform technology to the company.
Forming an alliance rather than investing cash to develop a premium financial services offering reflects SAP's strategic priorities. Spread across 25 industry verticals, SAP says it is playing to win in some sectors but is also open to partnerships in others.
Dediq is an eight-year-old private portfolio investor that has built up a portfolio of seven companies. Two of its companies have been publicly disclosed: Senacor is an information technology services firm and Convista is an SAP-focused consultancy.
""Our approach is to do entrepreneurial investments with evergreen capital,"" said Managing Partner Matthias Tomann, outlining Dediq's long-term approach.
Mucic forecast that the joint venture would generate revenue in the high triple-digit-millions euros or more within five years of being founded. Pending anti-trust approvals, the joint venture should go live in the second half of this year.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",Biden's chip dreams face reality check of supply chain complexity,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To understand President Joe Biden's challenge in taming a semiconductor shortage bedeviling automakers and other industries, consider a chip supplied by a U.S. firm for Hyundai Motor Co's new electric vehicle, the IONIQ 5.
Production of the chip, a camera image sensor designed by On Semiconductor, begins at a factory in Italy, where raw silicon wafers are imprinted with complex circuitry. 
The wafers are then sent first to Taiwan for packaging and testing, then to Singapore for storage, then on to China for assembly into a camera unit, and finally to a Hyundai component supplier in Korea before reaching Hyundai's auto factories.
A shortage of that image sensor has led to the idling of Hyundai Motor's plant in South Korea, making it the latest automaker to suffer from global supply woes that crippled production at most automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motors Co and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
And the winding journey of the image sensor shows just how complicated it will be for the chip industry to both ramp up capacity to address the current shortage and re-invigorate U.S. chip manufacturing. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3dW8nbN
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday convened semiconductor industry executives in Washington to discuss solutions to the chip crisis, the latest move in a broader effort to bolster the domestic chip industry. He's also proposed $50 billion to support chip manufacturing and research as part of his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, which he said would help the United States win the global competition with China. 
Much of that money will likely go towards the construction of multi-billion-dollar advanced chip plants by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (KS:005930) and TSMC. But industry executives say addressing the broader supply chain is crucial, and the Biden administration faces complicated choices on which elements of it to subsidize.
“Trying to reconstruct an entire supply chain from upstream to downstream in a single given location just isn’t a possibility,"" David Somo, senior vice president at ON Semiconductor, told Reuters. ""It would be prohibitively expensive.""
The United States now only accounts for about 12% of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity, down from 37% in 1990. More than 80% of global chip production now happens in Asia, according to industry data.
1,000 STEPS, 70 BORDERS
Producing a single computer chip can involve more than 1,000 steps, 70 separate border crossings and a host of specialized companies, most of them in Asia and largely unknown to the public.
The process starts with plate-size discs of raw silicon. At chip factories known as 'fabs,' circuits are etched into the silicon and built up on its surface through a series of complicated chemical processes.
The next step - packaging - offers a good illustration of the supply chain challenges.
Wafers emerge from fabs with hundreds or even thousands of fingernail-sized chips on each disc. They must be cut up into individual chips and put into a package. 
Traditionally that meant placing each chip onto a “lead frame” and soldering it to a circuit board. The entire assembly would then be packaged in a resin case to protect it. 
That process is very labor intensive, leading chip companies to outsource it decades ago to countries including Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and China.
The packaging step itself has its own supply chain: South Korea's Haesung DS, for example, makes packaging components for automotive chips, exporting them to Malaysia or Thailand for customers including Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) and NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI). These companies, or in some cases a sub-contractor, then assemble and package chips for automotive suppliers like Bosch and Continental, which in turn supply final products to automakers. 
“If they (the Biden administration) are going to be successful with this, they are going to have to help rebuild the package industry here in the United States,"" said Dick Otte, CEO of Promex, a California-based chip packaging firm.
""Otherwise it is a waste of time. It is like building a car and not having a body to put on it."" 
But newer chip packaging processes are far less labor intensive, leading some U.S. chipmakers to believe they can be brought back from abroad.
In October, Minnesota-based chip foundry, SkyWater Technology took over a facility in Florida where it plans to build out advanced packaging lines.
“There's kind of an industry-wide agreement that all this needs to happen here,” Thomas Sonderman, chief executive, SkyWater Technology, said.
FASTER TURNAROUND
Rebuilding the U.S. packaging industry would not only insulate chip companies and their customers from political risk, it could also help them break free of the long cycles involved in creating new chips, said Tony Levi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Southern California.
By doing more work locally, U.S. chip firms could create smaller manufacturing runs of chips more frequently, speeding innovation and potentially creating the capability to more quickly adjust to demand.
Levi said that Arizona, Texas and New York – where Intel, TSMC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries all have existing or planned facilities – would be suited to cluster supply chain elements like packaging.  
“What the U.S. is very good at is close collaboration between system design, product design and the manufacturing itself,” Levi said.
Still, it remains to be seen how the Biden Administration will balance the demands of the many sub-sectors of the chip industry. 
Numerous firms, many of them overseas, provide critical foundry materials including wafers and gases. The sophisticated tools used for advanced chip production are mostly made in the United States, but that's not the case for factory components such as the robotic systems that whisk chips among the various process steps.
On top of that, some in the industry argue that the U.S. needs to support not only new cutting-edge fabs, but older technology too. It's the more mature chips that are in severe shortage, noted Tyson Tuttle, CEO of Austin-based silicon design firm, Silicon Labs.
""We have a mismatch of capital in the semiconductor industry,"" he said, with too much of the money going to the most advanced technologies.
E. Jan Vardaman, President at TechSearch International Inc, said the chip packaging industry has been under severe price pressure, leading to smaller margins than chip factories and chip design firms. ""From a financial and economics point of view, it does not make sense for them to make a big investment."" 

""Simply throwing money at this does not solve the problem. It is a more complex problem.""

Investing.com -- The U.S. is to suspend the distribution of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Covid-19 vaccine due to fears of linkages to rare blood clotting problems, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. 
Officials at both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have subsequently confirmed that they have recommended the pause in the use of J&J's vaccine, due to ""abundance of caution.""
At 7:25 AM ET (1225 GM), J&J stock fell 2.8% premarket.
The news is a setback for the U.S.'s national vaccination campaign, which had factored the availability of J&J's drug into its ambitions to have the entire U.S. adult population eligible for vaccination already this month.
Over seven million shots of the J&J vaccine have been distributed so far in the U.S. According to the NYT, there have been six cases of people developing blood clots on the brain within two weeks of receiving the shot. All those affected have been women between the ages of 18 and 48, it noted.
This news follows similar issues with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s Covid-19 vaccine, which resulted in a number of countries in Europe as well as Canada and Australia pausing the use of the U.K.-Swedish drugmaker's shot. The medical authorities in the U.K. and Europe found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets after studying the data, but decided that the overall benefit was still worth the risk.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, with negative news on the Covid-19 front weighing ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report which could guide near term market sentiment.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 50 points, or 0.4%. All three contracts slid lower after the New York Times reported that U.S. authorities are set to call for a pause on distributing Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine, amid worries about blood clotting issues. A similar problem has plagued AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s drug.
This cautious trading comes ahead of the release of the March reading for the consumer price index, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to rise by 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year. 
Stock markets have climbed to record levels of late, helped by expectations of a strong U.S. economic recovery. But concerns are increasing that the combination of unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus and pent up demand will lead to rampant inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policies more quickly than earlier anticipated.
Fed officials have been at pains to point out that they see any bump up in inflation as temporary and remain committed to supporting the economic recovery until the jobs picture looks better, but a hefty CPI jump would raise the pressure, especially after Friday’s sharp rise in producer prices.
“With commodity prices and import prices continuing to surge and ISM manufacturing and services prices paid both at their highest level since 2008 there are increasing pipeline price pressures,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The bond market also traded in a subdued fashion Tuesday after a successful 10-year Treasury auction, with the benchmark yield edging slightly higher to trade near 1.69%, still well below the one-year high of around 1.78% seen at the end of March. 
Corporate news is set to pick up later in the week, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) set to report quarterly results on Wednesday.
Ahead of this, Grab is likely to be in focus after the Asian ride-hailing and food delivery firm announced its intention to merge with Altimeter leading to a U.S. public listing, valuing the company at nearly $40 billion, the largest ever SPAC deal.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by robust Chinese trade data, indicating continued economic recovery in the world’s largest crude importer, and tensions in the Middle East after the Yemen-based Houthi movement said it fired missiles on Saudi oil sites.
Attention Tuesday will also be on U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is set to release its monthly report on the oil market.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $59.95 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $63.61.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>",Britain to use Brexit 'flexibility' to make City of London more attractive,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will use its freedom from European Union rules to regulate markets flexibly and make the City of London even more attractive to global investors, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday.
Britain's financial sector has been largely cut off from the bloc since full Brexit on Dec. 31, with no sign of increased direct access any time soon as the EU builds up capital market autonomy in stock and derivatives trading.
Nausicaa Delfas, who heads up the FCA's international division, said Britain's financial market has entered a ""new phase"", but would remain open to the world and built on ""robust"" standards.
""Our new found position allows the FCA to have a new, more nimble approach to domestic policymaking. We can focus on using this new flexibility for the global markets that we host in the UK,"" Delfas told a City & Financial conference.
""The departure from the EU presents us with opportunities to do things differently, and that is an opportunity we will grasp."" 
The FCA has begun easing curbs inherited from the EU on ""dark"" or anonymous, off-exchange trading in blocks of shares.
EU firms with operations have applied for a permanent UK licence, but Delfas cautioned that authorisation would only be granted if there are good relations with their home regulators.
Britain and the EU has agreed a new framework for regulatory cooperation but it only makes provision for informal, non-binding talks twice a year.
Many financial firms in London have opened hubs in the EU to avoid disruption from the lack of direct City access to the bloc, creating tension between regulators over sufficient staffing at the new EU and existing UK operations.

Delfas said the FCA continues to expect firms to discuss any transfer of functions and staff from the UK that have not been previously agreed.

(Reuters) - European shares hovered just below all-time highs on Tuesday as investors awaited data that is expected to show a pickup in U.S. inflation on the back of a swift global economic recovery.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.3% and the export-heavy German stock index gained 0.4%, as data also showed China's exports grew at a robust pace in March and import growth surged to its highest in four years.
European retail, travel-related and auto stocks were among the biggest gainers by 1000 GMT.
The benchmark STOXX 600 has surged to record highs this month after coming under pressure in March from rising bond yields, as central banks globally maintained an accommodative stance on monetary policy despite fears of a jump in inflation.
Data due at 1230 GMT is likely to show the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) edged up 0.5% in March following a 0.4% gain in the previous month.
""Markets have become complacent about the inflation question, justifying it as the Street becoming more 'comfortable' with rising inflation,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""We will see how 'comfortable' markets really are if the CPI prints are much higher than expected. I suspect bond yields will jump along with the dollar in that event.""
The European STOXX 600 has also lagged a recovery in its U.S. counterpart due to a slow vaccination roll-out and a new wave of coronavirus infections on the continent.
Bank of France governor and European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Tuesday that France could return to pre-COVID-19 normal economic growth levels by the middle of 2022.
The French bourse was up 0.4% after hitting its highest in a decade last week.
Attention this week will be on the start of the first-quarter corporate earnings season, with major U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) due to report results on Wednesday.
European earnings will kick into higher gear later in April and analysts expect a 47.4% jump in earnings for STOXX 600 companies, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Much of the support is likely to come from consumer cyclicals and industrial firms.
Britain's biggest sportswear retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports jumped 3% as it forecast profit growth for this year and announced plans to ramp up warehouse capacity to fulfil online orders and minimise disruptions from Brexit.

Swedish IT solutions provider Dustin rose 3.5% after it said it would buy Centralpoint, a seller of hardware and software in the Benelux region, for 425 million euros ($505.6 million).

LONDON (Reuters) - Investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recommended selling emerging market currencies on Tuesday, completing a 180-degree pivot from the start of the year when it was backing them to have a good run.
After forecasts of a strong run for emerging currencies at the start of the year, many big banks have since turned more bearish as rising U.S. rates, COVID-19 worries and idiosyncratic risks besetting Turkey and Russia weigh on sentiment.
MSCI's index of emerging market currencies was down around 2% from levels hit two months ago.
""We take another step down in our EM risk allocation, moving EM FX to UW (underweight)"" the bank's analysts said in a research note. 
Analysts cited the likelihood of an extended period of underperformance in emerging markets' growth versus developed markets such as the United States, renewed ""idiosyncratic risks in large EMs"" as well as rising COVID cases and slower vaccination rollouts in developing economies.
""Having cut CNY (Chinese yuan) and RUB (Russian rouble) overweights last week, and CEE exposure before that, our GBI-EM Model Portfolio is now underweight EM FX,"" the bank said. 
Last month,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded its view on emerging market currencies and bonds for the second time in two weeks, predicting EM FX would fall 4%-5%.
Citi said last week a charging U.S. economy and poor yuan asset performance could be a ""perfect storm"" for EM assets and said it was establishing a neutral stance in the rouble and the South African rand.
The rouble, hammered by fears about tensions with Ukraine, is not far from a five-month low against the dollar, while the Turkish lira has been battered since the country's central bank governor was replaced last month. 
Brazil's real has slid around 9% against the dollar this year as concerns about politics have surfaced while the country battles one of the world's highest COVID-19 infection rates.

Such risks were ""resulting in ever fewer candidates we would like to be long in EM currencies, against an environment of rising rates where EM growth will be lagging,"" JPMorgan said.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Global stocks ticked up on Tuesday as robust China trade data boosted confidence for a rebound in its domestic demand, with market players awaiting U.S. data expected to show a pick-up in inflation. 
China's exports in dollar terms rose by over 30% in March from a year earlier, while imports jumped 38%, their fastest pace in four years, suggesting a post-pandemic recovery in its domestic spending.
The broad Euro STOXX 600 gained 0.3% to near record highs, with export-heavy German shares up 0.2%. Indexes in Paris and London shares fell 0.1%. 
Investors were focused on U.S. inflation data for March, due at 1230 GMT. Markets expect a forecast pick-up in inflation to accelerate recent moves by equity investors to rotate towards cyclical stocks. 
""The question for the next few months is not whether inflation will pick up, but how far inflation is going to pick up,"" said Hugh Gimber, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
""We do see scope for further increases in Treasury yields over the course of 2021. We'd expect that to drive a continuation of the rotation that we've seen over the past six months or so towards more cyclical sectors.""
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries was up at 1.6908%, holding below a 14-month high of 1.776% reached on March 30. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down. 
Wall Street futures gauges were flat. 
Earlier, Asian stocks had gained support on the strong China trade data, though MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up its gains - as did China's blue-chip index, CSI300.
""China is benefiting because of its surging 'first, first out' recovery but the global economy is also accelerating and picking up and that will diminish some of China's export performance in the quarters ahead,"" said John Woods,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Asia Pacific chief investment officer. 
""SIGNIFICANT REBOUND""
In currency markets, the dollar rose from near a three-week low against other major currencies on Tuesday, buoyed by a bump in Treasury yields.
The dollar has eased back along with U.S. yields this month after surging to multi-month peaks as markets expect that major fiscal stimulus, coupled with continued monetary easing, will spur faster U.S. economic growth and higher inflation.
Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said Monday the U.S. economy could see a significant rebound this year due to looser money and fiscal policy but the country's job market still faced weakness. 

He said with inflation still below the central bank's 2% target rate the current ""highly accommodative"" monetary policy stance remained appropriate.
Brent crude oil futures were up 37 cents, or 0.5%, at $63.63 a barrel by 0744 GMT. U.S. crude oil futures gained 27 cents, or 0.5%, to $59.58 a barrel.

This takes the total distribution so far to $4.8 billion, the bank said, following an earlier payout of $3.1 billion.
The bank said it has so far collected $2 billion from receivables redeemed when the four supply chain finance funds (SCFFs) were suspended on March 1.
This, along with the cash position in the SCFFs and the earlier payout, comes to $5.4 billion - equivalent to more than half of the total assets under management when the funds were suspended,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.
Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency. 
The bank has since suspended the funds' managers and changed the head of its asset management unit.
""We remain acutely aware of the uncertainty that the wind-down process creates for those of our clients who are invested in the funds,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement.

""We are doing everything that we can to provide them with clarity, to work through issues as they arise and, ultimately, to return cash to them.""
The bank said it was in contact with Greensill's administrators and would continue to work towards recovering money. It would provide a further update on the progress made by the end of April 2021.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's state prosecutor said on Tuesday it had charged six people from the United States and Britain with defrauding Danish tax authorities of more than 1.1 billion crowns ($176 million) in a sham trading scheme.
The charges against three U.S. and three British citizens are connected to the so-called ""cum-ex"" trading schemes, in which the Danish state has lost more than 12.7 billion crowns in total.
In January, Denmark charged two UK citizens, bringing the total number of people charged to eight.
They are suspected of running a scheme that involved submitting applications to the Danish Treasury on behalf of investors and companies from around the world to receive dividend tax refunds, the prosecutor said.
The defendants face up to eight years imprisonment for ""gross fraud"" if found guilty, although the prosecutor said the maximum penalty could be raised to 12 years under a special section of the law. 
All eight are at large.
""We do not expect them to voluntarily show up for criminal proceedings in which they risk being sentenced to so many years' imprisonment. So we are working on all conceivable options to ensure that the defendants will be present for the upcoming trial,"" prosecutor Per Fiig said in a statement.
The defendants were charged with running the scheme via Germany's North Channel Bank in 2014 and 2015, the prosecutor said. 
In 2019, the bank paid a fine of 110 million crowns by a Danish court for its involvement in the dividend stripping scheme. 
The cum-ex trading scheme is also being investigated by authorities in Germany, Belgium and Britain. Last year, two Britons were convicted in Germany's biggest fraud trial in at least 75 years.
The dividend schemes typically involved the trading of company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to suggest numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
The name ""cum-ex"" is Latin for ""with-without"", illustrating the apparent vanishing of dividend payments.
The Danish Tax Agency has also launched civil cases against U.S. pension plans to recoup the money it has lost.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a muted fashion Tuesday ahead of key U.S. inflation numbers, with the U.K. underperforming after the release of patchy growth data.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%.
Britain's economy grew by 0.4% in February from January as companies prepared for the lifting of a third coronavirus lockdown, below the expected growth of 0.6%. 
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year, its biggest slump in more than three centuries and a more severe fall than in most European economies, as the country’s huge services sector was battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.K. numbers followed robust trade data out of China, which were boosted by weak comparative numbers from a year ago.
Chinese exports grew 30.6% year-on-year in March, while import growth surged to the highest level in four years, jumping 38.1% year-on-year last month.
The closely-watched German ZEW economic sentiment release is due later Tuesday, but most eyes will be on the release of the U.S. consumer price index for March, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). This is expected to show inflation increasing by 0.5% on the month, or 2.5% year-over-year, up from 1.7% in February.
Federal Reserve officials have said repeatedly that they are prepared to look through periods of inflation climbing above its 2% threshold without changing their accommodative policy stance, as they see these episodes as being temporary in nature.
However, the last time the annual headline CPI number was at 2.5% was in January 2020, before the Covid pandemic, and a figure significantly above this will certainly put the pressure on the Fed.
In corporate news, Givaudan (SIX:GIVN) stock rose 2.9% after the Swiss company confirmed its mid-term targets after like-for-like sales rose 7.7% in the first quarter, helped by strong demand for its fragrance and beauty products. 
Dustin (ST:DUST) stock rose 5.7% after the Swedish IT solutions provider said it would buy software developer Centralpoint for 425 million euros ($505 million).
 Hays  (LON:HAYS) stock rose 3.6% after the U.K. recruitment firm said it expects to beat market forecasts for its 2021 operating profit on the back of a strong third quarter, while JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports (LON:JD) stock rose 0.6% after the retailer released a positive outlook.
Oil prices edged higher, helped by the robust Chinese trade data, indicating continued economic recovery in the world’s largest crude importer.
Attention Tuesday will also be on U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, with EIA supply data set to follow a day later. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is also due to release its monthly report on the oil market.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $60.05 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $63.69.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>",China's revamp of Ant dents investor appetite for IPO revival,"By Ross Kerber and John McCrank
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -China's regulatory-imposed revamp of Jack Ma's Ant Group, transforming the hot fintech into a financial holding company, appears to have dented some investor appetite for any plans to revive what would have been the world's biggest IPO.
The overhaul comes two days after affiliate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, which owns around a one-third stake in Ant, was hit with a record $2.75 billion antitrust penalty as China tightens controls on its internet giants.
Several Hong Kong and U.S.-based investors, and others who watch China's markets, said the developments seemed to limit the prospects of Ant, lowering its expected profitability and valuation. 
""I think there's still a lot of questions about what a post-restructured Ant looks like,"" said Daniel Kern, chief investment officer of TFC Financial Management in Boston, whose firm has about $3 million of Alibaba stock through the funds of other firms. 
New York-listed shares in Alibaba rose 9.2% on Monday and Hong Kong shares were up 3% on Tuesday as investors saw the steps as removing a key source of uncertainty for the company and relief they were not more onerous.
Last year, Ant's valuation was touted at $315 billion for its IPO, which was pulled just before its November listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Even before news of the revamp, sources told Reuters some global investors valued Ant around $200 billion based on its 2020 performance.
Leland Miller, CEO of U.S.-based consultancy China Beige Book, is among those who expects Ant's IPO plans to be resuscitated at some point, but said he doubted authorities are in a hurry.
One Hong Kong-based investor, whose investment in Ant's botched 2020 IPO was refunded, expects its listing to be a couple of years away.
Ant declined to comment on its IPO plans and possible changes in valuation.
William Huston, founder and director of institutional services at independent investment advisory firm Bay Street Capital Holdings said Ant as a bank or financial company IPO was a different investment thesis than Ant as a fintech company.
Huston reduced the firm's positions in Alibaba last year from 8% of the portfolio to less than 1%.
""We were initially taking that position early on, thinking Ant would eventually IPO,"" said Huston. ""It is a significantly different opportunity now. There is no hurry to jump into investing in a bank.""
'VALUE KNEECAPPING' 
TFC's Kern said while Ant might have been more profitable under its previous structure in which it helped banks make consumer loans, its role could have also created greater risks for the economy and regulators were correct to step in.
Now, new rules would seem to constrain Ant and rivals, said Kevin Carter, founder of the Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce ETF. 
""There is no doubt a significant kind of kneecapping of the value of all of those businesses has occurred,"" Carter said, though he added all have good long-term potential.
Not all investors were so cautious. 
Dan Hanson, chief investment officer of Ivy Investments, said Ant was widely seen as a likely focus for Chinese officials. 
""However onerous this restructuring might look, ultimately it's making Ant more investable. Regulatory scrutiny on Ant was a major overhang, and this deal looks like it's putting that to rest,"" he said.
Begun as Alibaba's payments arm, Ant's businesses now includes wealth management and consumer lending, and its Alipay app handles more transactions a year than Mastercard (NYSE:MA) or Visa (NYSE:V).
Alibaba was regarded as a tech firm in 2018 when it raised funds from investors including Warburg Pincus and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc. Those private equity firms were not immediately available for comment.
""It's pretty clear now, fintech can't be tech with no financial regulations,"" Liqian Ren, a quantitative investment specialist at WisdomTree Asset Management.

Besides the revamp, some investors are also concerned about higher levels of capital Ant would need to hold as a financial company, and its impact on valuation. 
""An additional capital requirement will dampen the return on equity and return on asset potential ... and this certainty impacts its value,"" said Hong Kong-based Sam Lecornu, CEO of Stonehorn Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), which owns Alibaba shares and also invested in Ant's IPO. ""But doesn't take away the exceptional platform that it is.""

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>","European CEOs, lawmakers add to pressure on Biden to hike climate target","By Kate Abnett
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European politicians, companies and trade unions on Tuesday called on the United States to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% this decade, adding to mounting pressure on the Biden administration ahead of a climate summit next week.
The world's biggest economy is expected to unveil its emissions-cutting target at a U.S.-hosted virtual gathering of global leaders on April 22 - a move that could spur other large emitters to make the steep emissions cuts needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.
""We, European political decision makers, CEOs, business organisations, trade unions and think tanks, call the United States to fulfil its ambitions by adopting a climate goal of reducing by at least 50% GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels,"" 107 European signatories said in a joint statement.
Signatories included around 20 EU lawmakers and 50 chief executives, including Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s Alan Jope, H&M's Helena Helmersson plus Matt Brittin, head of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s EMEA Business & Operations.
They called for greater transatlantic cooperation as the EU pursues its own plan to eliminate net emissions by 2050 and cut them at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels - commitments that have so far outstripped the ambition of other large economies.
Hitting those goals will require mammoth investments in renewable energy, carbon-cutting industrial technologies and zero-emission transport.
The current U.S. pledge, made under former President Barack Obama, is for emissions in 2025 to be 26%-28% below 2005 levels. 
Environmental groups have urged Washington to reduce emissions by 50% at the very least this decade, from 2005 levels. Analysts have said a 57%-63% cut would put the country on track for net-zero emissions by 2050 - the goal scientists say the world must meet to cap global warming at safe levels.

Pascal Canfin, the French member of European Parliament who led the letter, said a strong signal from Washington could unlock bold action from other countries. India, the world's third-biggest emitter after the United States and China, is among those under pressure to make more ambitious commitments.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, weighed on by some patchy growth data out of the U.K. but generally cautious ahead of key U.S. inflation numbers.
At 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%. 
U.K. GDP grew just 0.4% in March, below the expected 0.6%, and still down 7.8% on the year, marking a slow recovery from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. 
This followed robust trade data out of China, suggesting the recovery in the world's second largest economy will continue to gather momentum as it emerges from the Covid-19-led slump.
Chinese exports grew 30.6% year-on-year in March, while import growth surged to the highest level in four years, jumping 38.1% year-on-year last month.
Europe also sees the release of the closely-watched German ZEW economic sentiment data later Tuesday, but most eyes Tuesday will be on the release of the U.S. consumer price index for March, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).

Back in Europe, the death toll across the continent from the Covid-19 virus passed the grim milestone of one million people on Monday.
In corporate news, Givaudan (SIX:GIVN) is likely to be in the spotlight after the Swiss company confirmed its mid-term targets after like-for-like sales rose 7.7% in the first quarter, helped by strong demand for its fragrance and beauty products. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) will also be in focus after the airline manufacturer announced a shake-up on Monday, with both its defense and technology chiefs set to step down and a new chief operating officer to be appointed.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by the robust Chinese trade data, indicating continued economic recovery in the world’s largest crude importer,  and tensions in the Middle East after the Yemen-based Houthi movement said it fired missiles on Saudi oil sites.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>","'Deeds, not words': mining firms reshape boardrooms as investors demand sustainability","By Helen Reid
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Under fire after a string of high-profile disasters, mining firms are shaking up their boardrooms in response to criticism that they are failing to meet their own environmental, social, and governance standards.
Shareholders are demanding change from an industry whose reputation has been battered by deadly collapses of mine waste storage facilities in Brazil, and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s destruction of sacred rock shelters in Australia.
Companies are responding with changes to the structure and skillset of their senior management - a shift investors and governance experts say is sorely needed to mitigate risk in an inherently hazardous industry.
""The level of understanding and capability at board level is insufficient at the moment in the mining sector, and it doesn't yet in our view support the transition of these companies to best practice,"" Andy Jones, metals and mining lead at investment manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), said. 
Brazil's Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) - keen to show its dedication to safety and sustainability after two tailings dam failures in less than four years - recently announced the biggest shakeup in its board since it was privatized in 1997.
Seven of the 13 members of the new board set for approval this month have extensive experience in ESG and sustainability-related issues, up from five previously. The company has also added requirements for nominees to have experience in community relations.
AngloGold Ashanti last year appointed as a non-executive director a mining governance adviser to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Kojo Busia, after the board identified the need to increase its efficacy in ESG oversight, it told Reuters. 
Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) also bolstered its ESG credentials with the appointment of World Bank executive director Anne Kabagambe to its board in November, highlighting her experience in international development.
Some miners have also begun tying executives' and directors' bonuses directly to measurable ESG outcomes. Rio Tinto has connected 15% of executives' annual bonuses to ESG metrics for the first time.
Bonuses for the director of Vale's executive board for safety are calculated based only on health, safety, and sustainability indicators.
But companies must also improve internal reporting and foster a culture of openness if the industry is to prevent a repeat of past mistakes, governance experts say.
""The remuneration is obviously key in terms of setting incentives, but that on its own doesn't work unless the board is getting the quality of information and there is a spirit of independent thought and challenge,"" said Joanna Hewitt, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie in London who advises companies on corporate governance. 
For boards to exercise proper oversight, directors need access to information that bypasses management, Daniel Smith, a governance advisor with CGI Glass Lewis, told Reuters last November.
To achieve that, a specialist heritage advisor reporting directly to the board could be appointed, or a board could have an ESG subcommittee responsible for stakeholder management, including of traditional owners, he said.
To help investors track their progress, mining companies must publish more data on issues like community engagement, water and air quality, and rehabilitation and closure plans, said Charlotte Valeur, founder of governance advisory firm Global Governance Group.
As a result of investor pressure, more mining companies are reporting so-called scope 3 emissions data, a measure of downstream CO2 emissions by metal consumers. Data transparency is key, says Valeur. 

""It has to be deeds, not words,"" she said. ""What it's easy to do is have some fluff - but what we want is hard numbers.""

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 01:00AM ET</span>",Givaudan first-quarter sales rise 7.7% driven by fragrances,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss fragrance and flavour maker Givaudan confirmed its mid-term targets after like-for-like sales rose 7.7% in the first quarter, helped by strong demand for its fragrance and beauty products.
During the pandemic, Givaudan has been benefiting from strong demand for household items like soap, detergent or snacks it makes ingredients for, while its business with foods for out-of-home consumption and perfumes took a hit last year. 
Sales at its fragrance and beauty business rose 9.9%, helped by a recovery in its perfume and active beauty business, while its taste and wellbeing unit was up by 5.8%, Givaudan said in a statement on Tuesday.
High-growth markets in Latin America and Asia Pacific were the main drivers, Givaudan said.
""We have seen continued strong demand across the parts of our business which are less impacted by the COVID‑19 pandemic and improving conditions in the parts of our portfolio which have been more affected,"" Chief Executive Gilles Andrier said in the statement.
Sales linked to out-of-home consumption were still affected by the pandemic, but ""to a lesser extent compared to 2020, as restrictions in relation to out of home food and beverage consumption started to be lifted in certain markets,"" Givaudan said. 
For the five-year period to 2025, Givaudan confirmed its target for like-for-like organic sales growth of 4-5% on average per year.

Givaudan competes with Germany's Symrise that reports first-quarter sales on April 28.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 12:20AM ET</span>",Reuters names Alessandra Galloni as its next editor-in-chief,"(Reuters) - Reuters News has named one of its top editors, Alessandra Galloni, as its next editor-in-chief, the first woman to lead the globe-spanning news agency in its 170-year history.
A native of Rome, Galloni, 47, will replace Stephen J. Adler, who is retiring this month after leading the newsroom for the past decade. Under his leadership, Reuters has received hundreds of journalism awards, including seven Pulitzer Prizes, the industry’s highest honor.
A speaker of four languages, and with broad experience covering business and political news at Reuters and previously at the Wall Street Journal, Galloni takes the helm as the news agency faces an array of challenges. Some of these are common to all news media. Others are specific to the organization’s complexity: With a worldwide staff of some 2,450 journalists, Reuters serves a range of divergent customers and is also a unit in a much larger information-services business.
Since 2008, Reuters has been part of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, a corporation with more-lucrative and faster-growing segments than news. Its chief executive, Steve Hasker, who joined Thomson Reuters last year, has focused on aggressively expanding the corporation’s three largest businesses: providing information, software and services to lawyers, corporations and the tax and accounting profession. Hasker’s strategy has helped boost Thomson Reuters stock to all-time highs.
Reuters News comprises about 10% of Thomson Reuters’ total $5.9 billion in revenues. Unlike many news organizations, Reuters is profitable. But it is also a drag on the parent company’s revenue growth and profit margin, analysts say, and the executive who runs the news business, Reuters President Michael Friedenberg, is pushing to increase sales and boost profitability. Looking forward, Thomson Reuters’ chief financial officer last month forecast that sales at its “Big Three” businesses are expected to grow 6% to 7% in 2023, while its news division and printing business “are expected to dilute organic revenue growth by about 1% to 2%.”
Gary Bisbee, an analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), said he expects Reuters News “will continue to be a drag on the growth of the company,” but added that as other divisions of Thomson Reuters grow faster, that drag would diminish over time.
Thomson Reuters is hoping for a turn-around in the Reuters Events business, which it acquired in October 2019. Almost all in-person conferences last year were canceled or postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the business has pivoted to a hybrid events strategy for 2021 with both in-person and virtual conferences, and expects its revenues to improve.
While some in the industry have speculated that Thomson Reuters might want to sell the news division, three analysts said they don’t expect a sale. Douglas McCabe, a media analyst with Enders Analysis in London, said Reuters is “a tremendously powerful part of” the Thomson Reuters brand, and that “the mighty Reuters newsroom behind you and all the really specialized business assets is a great combination.”
In a statement, CEO Hasker said: “Thomson Reuters is committed to the future of Reuters News. It is an important part of the company and is valued across our customer base. The last year has proven beyond question the value of independent, global, unbiased journalism.”
This year saw the closing of a deal in which the former Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters -- now called Refinitiv -- was sold to the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) Plc in a $27 billion all-stock deal. Under the terms, Reuters News is guaranteed annual payments of at least $336 million to provide news and editorial content to Refinitiv until 2048. That stream of revenue is envied by many in the media industry.
Galloni has told colleagues that one of her critical tasks would be maintaining a good relationship with Refinitiv, as it is Reuters’ biggest customer, accounting for slightly more than half of the news agency’s $628 million in revenues last year. 
The important relationship has been a source of some tension, senior editors say. As part of the contract with Refinitiv, Reuters is required to meet strict performance targets for the news coverage that Refinitiv clients receive, which Reuters has exceeded so far. Thomson Reuters, for its part, noted in its latest annual report that the exclusive deal, while lucrative, limits Reuters’ ability to sell to other customers in the growing financial-services industry. A Refinitiv spokesman declined to comment.
Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said the new editor will nevertheless have to find new sources of revenue. “Reuters is in an unusual position because the pledge from Refinitiv frees Reuters News up to be more aggressive in creating new news products to serve new markets,” he said. “I think there’s still a lot of low-hanging fruit for Reuters because of the strength of the brand and the size of the staff.”
NEW WEBSITE
Reuters’ primary competitors include Bloomberg News, the Associated Press, French news agency AFP and visual content provider Getty Images. In addition to its events business, Reuters has been seeking other growth opportunities. Prominent among these is the upcoming launch of a revamped website that is expected to target professionals and eventually begin charging for content.
McCabe said convincing consumers to pay for content is challenging because “Reuters is a brand that a lot of people recognize but don’t intuitively go to.” But he is more optimistic that targeting professionals could succeed for Reuters. “All the evidence says to me that these are the subscription models that really work,” he said.
CEO Hasker has told colleagues that he wants to make Reuters more integral to the company’s other divisions. To that end, the newsroom recently added to its legal reporting staff.
Adler spearheaded a number of moves to modernize Reuters, which gained fame in its early days for using carrier pigeons to relay scoops. In the past decade, the newsroom created teams of investigative, data and graphics journalists, and is using artificial intelligence to speed the delivery of certain breaking financial news.
Hasker has said he is eager to continue modernizing the newsroom by getting it to embrace new technologies more aggressively. He and Friedenberg considered a wide range of journalists to succeed Adler, both inside and outside the news agency, according to people familiar with the matter.
Among them were two top Reuters editors, Gina Chua and Simon Robinson. The external candidates included David Walmsley, editor in chief of Canada’s The Globe and Mail, and Kevin Delaney, former co-chief executive and editor-in-chief of Quartz Media Inc.
Galloni, based in London, is known internally as a charismatic presence with a keen interest in business news. She has told colleagues that her priorities would include boosting the Reuters digital and events businesses.
She takes the helm after serving as a global managing editor of Reuters, overseeing journalists in 200 locations around the world. At the beginning of her career, she worked at the Reuters Italian-language news service. She received degrees from Harvard University and the London School of Economics. She returned to Reuters in 2013 following about 13 years at The Wall Street Journal, where she specialized in economics and business coverage as a reporter and editor in London, Paris and Rome.
""For 170 years, Reuters has set the standard for independent, trusted and global reporting,"" Galloni said in the Reuters announcement on her appointment, which takes effect on April 19. ""It is an honor to lead a world-class newsroom full of talented, dedicated and inspiring journalists."" 

The hunt for the new Reuters editor came as other major media are dealing with succession in the newsroom. Both the Washington Post, where executive editor Marty Baron retired in February, and the Los Angeles Times, where Norman Pearlstine stepped down as executive editor in December, are currently seeking their replacements.

March's trade data released earlier in the day was better-than-expected, with exports growing 49% year-on-year, imports growing 38.1% year-on-year and the trade balance at USD116.35 billion.
The country will release further data, including first-quarter GDP, industrial production and fixed asset investment data, on Friday.
On the China-U.S. relations front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will reportedly decline to name China as a currency manipulator in her first semiannual foreign exchange report, currently not finalized and due on Thursday. The move also allows the two countries to avoid a fresh round of tensions.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.44%, after the city dangled the prospects of relaxed restrictive measures for those who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 on Monday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.04%, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.16% and in Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.01%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s Beige Book will be released on Wednesday, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also speak at an Economic Club of Washington event on the same day. The U.S. will release retail sales as well as industrial production data Thursday.
The figures come as U.S. companies start releasing their first-quarter results throughout the week.
Meanwhile, companies vying for a tightly constrained global supply of semiconductors that has idled automakers globally were assured by U.S. President Joe Biden that both the Republican and Democratic parties will support government funding to address the shortage.
Concerns remain, however, on whether global stocks can retain their gains amid spiking numbers of COVID-19 cases in countries such as India and a vaccine rollout that has hit a bump in the road in several areas.
Investors also digested bond yields rising slightly after the U.S. Treasury’s auctions of three- and 10-year notes on Tuesday attracted decent demand. The Treasury will auction 30-year notes later in the day.
Some investors remained concerned about the potential for rising inflation and borrowing costs, however.
“The real test is going to be when inflation starts to move higher... that’s when rates will have to reprice either for a sooner Fed exit, or a later exit but a faster path,” TD Securities global head of rates strategy Priya Misra told Bloomberg."

The guidance suggests that many SPACs may potentially have to refile their financial statements to account for the warrants as a liability. 
Last week, an official with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had said the agency was reviewing filings and seeking clearer disclosures for SPACs, and detailed concerns around fees, conflicts and sponsor compensation.
SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to sidestep a traditional initial public offering.
The announcement is the latest move by SEC to clamp down on Wall Street's biggest gold rush in recent years, with SPACs raising a record $170 billion so far this year and surpassing last year's total of $157 billion, Refinitiv data showed.

Last month, Reuters had reported that SEC opened an inquiry into Wall Street's blank-check acquisition frenzy and is seeking information on how underwriters are managing the risks involved.

Hawley, who accuses the biggest social media companies of stifling conservative voices, also criticized other sectors, like pharmaceuticals, which he said were too concentrated and held too much market power.
His new bill would effectively ban Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) from any deals and would attempt to stop their platforms from favoring their own products over those of rivals.
Hawley's bill tackles some of the same problems as an antitrust bill introduced by Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar in February, and contains some similar measures. 
Asked about Klobuchar's bill, Hawley said, ""I'm willing to work with her and anybody of any party and any background. I like a lot of what Senator Klobuchar has proposed.""
He described his bill as ""significantly tougher.""
In the House of Representatives, Representative David Cicilline has said he plans to introduce a series of antitrust bills.

Hawley was also asked if he would support tech critic Lina Khan, a progressive who has been nominated to be a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, which works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law. Hawley said he was ""very impressed"" by her but added, ""I have not made a final decision.""

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>",New Zealand introduces climate change law for financial firms in world first,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand has become the first country to introduce a law that will require banks, insurers and investment managers to report the impacts of climate change on their business, minister for climate change James Shaw said on Tuesday.
All banks with total assets of more than NZ$1 billion ($703 million), insurers with more than NZ$1 billion in total assets under management, and all equity and debt issuers listed on the country's stock exchange will have to make disclosures. 
""We simply cannot get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 unless the financial sector knows what impact their investments are having on the climate,"" Shaw said in a statement.
""This law will bring climate risks and resilience into the heart of financial and business decision making.""
The bill, which has been introduced to the country's parliament and is expected to receive its first reading this week, requires financial firms to explain how they would manage climate-related risks and opportunities.
Around 200 of the country's biggest companies and several foreign firms that meet the NZ$1 billion threshold will come under the legislation.
Disclosures will be required for financial years beginning next year once the law is passed, meaning that the first reports will be made by companies in 2023.
The New Zealand government last September said it would make the financial sector report on climate risks and those unable to disclose would have to explain their reasons.
The New Zealand government has introduced several policies to lower emissions during its second term including promising to make its pubic sector carbon-neutral by 2025 and buy only zero-emissions public transport buses from the middle of this decade.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who returned to power last October delivering the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century, had called climate change the ""nuclear free moment of our generation.""

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 06:30PM ET</span>",Turkey's Halkbank urges end of U.S. prosecution alleging Iran sanctions violations,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for Halkbank told a U.S. appeals court on Monday that the state-owned Turkish lender was immune from U.S. prosecution and that an indictment accusing it of helping Iran evade American sanctions should be thrown out.
In arguments before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, Halkbank's lawyer Simon Latcovich said the U.S. government had no basis to assert criminal jurisdiction over the bank, and that the bank was ""synonymous"" with Turkey for purposes of immunity.
Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges over its alleged use of money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.
Prosecutors accused the bank of converting oil revenue into gold and then cash to benefit Iranian interests, and documenting fake food shipments to justify transfers of oil proceeds.
They also said Halkbank helped Iran secretly transfer $20 billion of restricted funds, with at least $1 billion laundered through the U.S. financial system.
The case has complicated U.S.-Turkish relations, with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan urging Halkbank's innocence in a 2018 memo to former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Latcovich argued on Monday that the bank was immune from prosecution under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
But U.S. prosecutor Sidhardha Kamaraju said that act applies only to civil cases, and urged the appeals court to reject what he called a ""dramatic extension"" of sovereign immunity.
Halkbank is appealing an Oct. 1 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman allowing the prosecution.
Berman has overseen several related cases, including the conviction of former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla and a guilty plea by Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab.
The appeals court did not say when it will rule.

The case is U.S. v Halkbank, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-3499.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 05:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: GameStop initiates search for new CEO - sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) is looking for a new chief executive to replace George Sherman as it pivots from a brick-and-mortar video game retailer to an e-commerce firm, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
It would be the biggest shakeup at GameStop since Ryan Cohen, the co-founder and former chief executive of online pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc, joined its board in January and began laying the groundwork for a shift in culture and strategy, people familiar with his work at GameStop said.
Its stock is up almost 4,000% from a year ago, after it became the poster child of day traders betting on so-called meme stocks.
GameStop's board is working with an executive headhunter on the CEO search, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
Several GameStop board directors are involved in the search and have spoken with potential candidates from the gaming industry, as well as the e-commerce and technology sectors, the sources said.
A GameStop spokesman declined to comment. 
GameStop shares ended trading on Monday down 11% at $141.04, giving the company a market value of about $10 billion. The stock hit a record high of $483 in late January.
The CEO replacement is the latest in a string of changes pursued by Cohen since he joined GameStop's board.
Former Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell and Chief Customer Officer Frank Hamlin are among the senior executives who have left the company in recent weeks.
Sherman, who has been CEO since April 2019, has been credited internally with slashing costs and steering GameStop through the COVID-19 pandemic that led many retailers to go out of business.
But Sherman's 25 years of experience have been largely with brick-and-mortar retailers, such as  Advance Auto Parts  (NYSE:AAP) Inc and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), and his experience is seen as less relevant to the digital transformation, two of the sources said.
Cohen, who last week was named GameStop's board chairman, is seeking to make the company the online destination of choice for video game fans, just as Chewy won over pet lovers. 
He pushed for a number of hires at GameStop, including Elliott Wilke as chief growth officer, Jenna Owens as chief operating officer and Matt Francis as chief technology officer. All three previously worked at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Cohen also brought on people from Chewy, including Andrea Wolfe as vice president of brand development, Neda Pacifico as senior vice president of e-commerce and Kelli Durkin as senior vice president of customer care. 
GameStop last week increased the value of new stock it may sell from $100 million to $1 billion, as it moves to capitalize on a surge in its shares from the retail trader-driven rally in January.
That rally has fizzled in recent days. Many Wall Street analysts remain skeptical about the company's ability to reinvent itself. Of seven analysts covering GameStop, five currently recommend selling the stock and only two rate it as ""hold.""

""We remain very concerned about the long term prospects for (GameStop's) video game business, especially once hardware sales temper as the installed base matures,"" Ascendiant analyst Edward Woo wrote in a note on Monday.

However, EV bubble concerns have led shares of AYRO to decline over the past couple of months. So, will regulatory and industry tailwinds allow AYRO to regain its momentum soon? Read more to find out.Ayro, Inc. (AYRO) is a relatively new player in the electric vehicle (EV) space. The company administered a reverse merger with DropCar, Inc. on May 29 last year, combining shares through a five-for-one reverse stock split and stock dividend offering. Shares of AYRO have gained 175.1% over the past year, and 91.8% over the past six months.
As a B2B company, AYROP’s EVs have been highly demanded from businesses nationwide given the rising need for robust delivery systems. The company plans to produce and deliver 20,000 light-duty trucks and electric delivery vehicles over the next three years in partnership with Karma Automotive’s Innovation and Customization Center. In this regard, AYRO has expanded its Austin manufacturing facility to build approximately 600 vehicles per month.
While the company’s operations look good on paper, AYRO is a relatively unknown name in a highly competitive industry. Many well-known companies, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nikola Corporation (NKLA), have diversified portfolios of electric trucks, with extensive pre-orders. With limited earnings growth potential in a highly crowded industry, AYRO’s stock is relatively overvalued. Because of an ongoing sector rotation by investors away from overvalued stocks, shares of AYRO have declined 7.2% year-to-date, and 19.8% over the past month.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average ended lower on Monday, with investors waiting for cues from the upcoming corporate earnings season and a key inflation report later this week.
The indexes had closed at record highs on Friday, after rallying for days on a pullback in the benchmark 10-year bond yield from 14-month highs.
With U.S. consumer price data for March due to be published Tuesday, this could drive Treasury yields higher. Big Wall Street names are due to kick off earnings season on Wednesday, giving new catalysts to buy or sell stocks in a record-high market.
""Investors are now going to pay close attention to earnings season, because this is the time where they are expecting guidance from companies, where valuations start to matter again,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""There's this nervousness that we're going to see that we can't just buy everything, as that was the trade for the last few months.""
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday the U.S. economy was at an ""inflection point"" with expectations for faster growth in the months ahead, but he warned that a hasty reopening could lead to a continued increase in coronavirus cases.
S&P 500 earnings are expected to have jumped 25% in the quarter from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. That would be the biggest quarterly gain since 2018, when tax cuts under former President Donald Trump boosted profit growth.
Banks are among the first to report earnings for the opening quarter of 2021, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) due on Wednesday.
The financials index and consumer discretionary sector both hit record highs on Monday, on confidence in both areas as the U.S. economy reopens.
""The optimism is improving now that these banks are going to return to normal, with buybacks and dividends, and because of the outlook for Treasury yields, they are going to have a better outlook going forward,"" said OANDA's Moya.
Among the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes, communication services and energy shares were the steepest decliners.
Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.2 points, or 0.16%, to 33,745.4, the S&P 500 lost 0.81 points, or 0.02%, to 4,127.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 50.19 points, or 0.36%, to 13,850.00.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rose 3.7% after Canaccord Genuity upgraded the electric-car maker's shares to ""buy,"" saying the company could become ""the brand"" in energy storage.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp jumped 5.6% after saying Monday it would make a server processor chip that would directly challenge  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). The chipmaker also signposted above-guidance first-quarter sales.
 Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) Inc shares surged 16% after  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it would buy the artificial intelligence and speech technology company for $19.7 billion.
In one of the year's quietest sessions, volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.0 billion shares, versus the 11.6 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

The President proposes to impose a tax hike on corporations to fund his infrastructure plan over the next 15 years.
The infrastructure plan contains provision for the construction and home building industries, given rising market demand and lean inventories. Because the United States is expected to focus on upgrading its infrastructure, the construction materials market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.7% over the next four years to reach $1.12 trillion by 2025.
Therefore, we think it wise to invest in infrastructure stocks Owens Corning (NYSE:GLW) (OC), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX), Quanex Building Products Corporation (NX), and BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (BXC). These stocks are well positioned to generate significant returns in the coming months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Brooklyn man pleaded not guilty on Monday to insider trading charges, after prosecutors accused him of using information from a Bloomberg News reporter about certain deals to trade.
Jason Peltz, 38, entered his plea through his lawyer before U.S. Magistrate Judge Roanne Mann in Brooklyn.
On March 23, a federal grand jury indicted Peltz for trading on ""material nonpublic information"" obtained from a company insider and a financial reporter.
Peltz has been charged with securities fraud, money laundering and tax evasion, among other offenses, according to the indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York. 
The indictment does not name the financial reporter or the media outlet, but Reuters and other media outlets have identified him as Ed Hammond, a deals reporter with Bloomberg in New York, based on a review of articles mentioned in the indictment.
Hammond has not been accused of wrongdoing. 
Bloomberg News declined to comment on Monday. ""Ed Hammond is a very accomplished reporter,"" Bloomberg said in an April 1 email. ""We're not aware of any facts to suggest any wrongdoing on his part.""
The case casts a light on the workings of the world of corporate mergers and acquisitions, where a cadre of bankers, lawyers and other advisers - as well as executives - know about talks. Information often leaks, studies have shown. 
The alleged scheme ran from November 2015 to October 2020, according to the indictment. 
Among the trades Peltz allegedly executed, the indictment said, was the purchase of securities and options in chemical manufacturer Ferro (NYSE:FOE) Corp based on information, obtained from a friend, that Ferro had received a takeover offer.
After Peltz began placing the trades with the help of unidentified co-conspirators between Feb. 22 and March 11, 2016, Peltz had ""numerous contacts"" with Hammond over the phone and in person, the indictment alleged.
Bloomberg published an article by Hammond about the approach to Ferro on March 15, 2016, and Ferro's stock rose 4.7% that day. 
Ferro did not respond to a request for comment.
Apart from the Ferro transaction, Peltz was accused of having frequent conversations with Hammond over several months, during which he obtained material nonpublic information about articles Hammond was working on regarding other companies.

Each article mentioned in the indictment cited multiple sources and involved two or more reporters.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed just below a record high Monday, but struggled for direction as investors awaited guidance from the start of quarterly earnings season this week. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.02%, to end the day just below its closing record of 4,128.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.16%, or 54 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.36%.
Cyclical corners of the market - barring energy - were in the ascendency, led by real estate, consumer discretionary and financials, with the latter coming under the spotlight as major banks report quarterly earnings this week.
Major Wall Street banks reporting include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Wall Street's outlook on quarterly earnings appears bullish, with cyclicals backed to show strong quarterly results.
""We anticipate S&P 500 Index earnings per share will grow by more than 30% this year with cyclical sectors such as industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, and financials leading the way,"" Wells Fargo said.
Energy stocks slipped on a retreat in oil prices from session highs as investors weighed up the progress on vaccinations against ongoing Covid-19 restrictions that threaten energy demand.  
Technology started the week on the backfoot stifled by weakness in chip stocks and mixed trading among the Fab 5.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was higher.
Microsoft said it will buy speech-recognition firm  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) for $19.7 billion in a bid to boost its foray into healthcare.
""The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors at a time in which hospitals and doctors are embracing next generation AI capabilities from thought leaders such as Nuance,"" Wedbush said in a note.
In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was down almost 2% just days after the company urged 16 airline customers to ground its 737 Max jets, citing electrical issues. The issues, however, are not expected to cause major disruptions.
""Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note Friday.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped more than 3% after receiving an upgrade from Canaccord, citing a bullish outlook for the company's battery storage business.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said a man who created a mayonnaise-ketchup blend he called ""Metchup"" cannot sue Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co for selling a similar condiment called ""Mayochup,"" but ordered reconsideration of whether to cancel his trademark registration.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said there was little chance consumers would confuse Mayochup, sold in groceries nationwide under the Heinz brand, with Metchup, sold in the lobby of Dennis Perry's nine-room Star Motel in Lacombe, Louisiana, next to his used-car lot.
But the three-judge court said Kraft Heinz had not met its ""heavy burden"" to show Perry abandoned his Metchup trademark, citing Perry's testimony that he hoped to improve Metchup's packaging and sell millions of bottles.
Perry's efforts could be ""seen as a foundering business venture rather than a trademark trap,"" Circuit Judge James Graves wrote.
Metchup blended Walmart-branded mayonnaise and ketchup, or mustard and ketchup, depending on the batch. Perry produced 60 bottles and sold at least 34.
Lawyers for Perry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said the company was pleased Perry's complaint had been dismissed. The appeals court returned the case to a New Orleans federal judge.
Perry sued Kraft Heinz following the September 2018 U.S. launch of Mayochup, after learning the company used a mock-up ""Metchup"" bottle in an internet campaign to name its new condiment.
Fans submitted at least 95 names including ""Metchup,"" ""Best Sauce Ever,"" ""Saucy McSauceFace"" and ""It's Fry Sauce You Monsters,"" while Kraft Heinz's marketing team proposed ""Ketchonnaise"" and ""Tomayo.""
Kraft Heinz never sold products with these names, and someone else had applied for a ""Ketchonnaise"" mark.
Mayochup was an effort to reinvigorate Kraft Heinz's product portfolio, which includes Oscar Mayer and Jell-O, as more consumers turn to healthier and less-processed products.
The Chicago-based company, in which Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has a 26.6% stake, has improved results recently as the COVID-19 pandemic caused people to buy more packaged foods.
The case is Perry v H.J. Heinz Co Brands Inc et al, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-30418.

1172,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 03:33PM ET</span>","Coinbase, Consumer Prices, Chip Stocks: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Earnings season kicks off in high gear this week, and Wall Street is hanging on what executives describe as the outlook for the next few months.
These words could be a factor on the market, depending on what they say. Stocks let off a little steam on Monday ahead of the earnings reports.
The major indexes have advanced to record highs as the reopening trade fuels optimism that the worst of the pandemic is over. Looking back on the last year is not as instructive as what the immediate future says, some analysts said Monday. 
Last year’s lockdowns and business interruptions are hopefully not going to be repeated, but the comparisons are also distorted to more normal times.
The Federal Reserve has said it doesn’t expect any bump in inflation to be anything but temporary and remains committed to supporting the economic recovery until the jobs picture looks better. 
There isn’t much in the way of data or announcements expected Tuesday ahead of the opening of earnings “season” on Wednesday. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Coinbase goes public this week
Bitcoin has soared into the stratosphere over the last few months, and that puts renewed focus on anything related to cryptocurrency. The most popular crypto was up to $59,850 as of midday Monday, a bit below its all-time high above $60,000. 
On Wednesday, the crypto trading platform Coinbase is going public through a direct listing on Nasdaq. The shares might offer investors who want to get on board the crypto craze a chance to invest in the space without plunking down a massive amount. 
2. Consumer prices seen picking up
The consumer price index for March is expected to be up 0.5% from the prior month. The data comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). CPI is expected to be up 2.5% over last year’s March.
3. Chip makers in the spotlight
On Monday, Reuters reported that American chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is lined up to make a core processor that could rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), the world’s biggest maker of central processors for data center servers. This news comes amid a global shortage of other types of chips used in everyday items such as cars.
The chief executives from a variety of companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Intel and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) met Monday in a White House virtual summit to address the global shortage, which has forced manufacturing shutdowns. President Joe Biden talked about protecting the chip supply chain, saying the U.S. must invest aggressively in chip manufacturing.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman risk group examines 2021 market events for lessons - sources,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) executives are examining how well the bank navigated several major market events this year that caused extreme volatility, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The review will include a market-wide fire sale of stocks triggered by Archegos Capital Management's default on margin calls at banks including Goldman, the sources said.
The meltdown of Archegos, a New York investment fund run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, has sent shock waves across Wall Street and drawn regulatory scrutiny in three continents. 
Goldman Sachs is also looking more broadly at how it handled recent market events, with a particular lens on compliance and best practices, the sources said.
That could include what happened during the Reddit-fueled trading frenzy in equity markets, including shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to end pandemic-related capital relief for banks, which caused issues in fixed-income markets. Also this year, there was chaos in energy markets in mid-February after a deep freeze in Texas sent the cost of fuel and power sky-high.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Although Goldman did not earn or lose a significant amount of money on Archegos' default and its CEO has said the bank's controls worked well, the surge of volatility across several markets this year prompted management to take a closer look at its risks and hedges, the sources said.
Reviews of this nature are routine at large Wall Street banks, especially when they face scrutiny from regulators and politicians. The GameStop and Archegos events have prompted financial regulators to say they are taking a closer look at what caused the volatility.
The Fed considers it a ""risk-management breakdown"" at firms that handled Archegos' trades, Chairman Jerome Powell told CBS's ""60 Minutes"", https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-jerome-powell-60-minutes-2021-04-11 which aired on Sunday, pledging that the regulator will not let it happen again. 
Goldman's chief executive, David Solomon, said last week that the bank's risk controls on Archegos ""worked well.""
As part of its review, the bank's compliance department examined its decision to begin doing business with Archegos in late 2020 and noted it required the family office to increase the collateral it was required to post early this year, one of the sources said.
That helped Goldman avoid losses on positions that rivals including Japanese bank  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc and Switzerland's  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG are now facing.
Goldman and several banks avoided doing business with Archegos in its early days because Hwang's prior firm reached a $44 million insider trading settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012. They warmed up to the client last year after enough time had passed and it was clear that rivals were doing business with Hwang again.

However, Archegos had six prime brokers handling its trades, with different levels of leverage and margin requirements on a handful of concentrated bets. When some of its positions went belly-up in late March, the banks had to seize collateral and sold billions of dollars' worth of stock to cover Archegos' positions.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 02:11PM ET</span>",GM marketing spend will return to normal levels post pandemic,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co's marketing and promotional spending will return to normal levels after the COVID-19 pandemic caused that budget to drop last year, the U.S. automaker's top marketing officer said on Monday.
""What we went through in the pandemic was certainly severe and we should be moving back up to our normalized levels,"" GM Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl said in an online appearance at a Reuters Events conference. 
Wahl declined to discuss how much GM will spend this year, but GM cut its advertising and promotional spending last year by about $1 billion to $2.7 billion according to the Detroit company's annual report.
The pandemic forced the shutdown of the U.S. auto sector for two months last year, and the subsequent global chip shortage has led to further idling of plants, causing vehicle inventories to shrink. That has led to higher prices for both new and used cars, dealers said at the conference.
""The inventories are working for us,"" AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) executive vice president Marc Cannon said, adding that pricing has risen as supply has shrunk. 
Cannon, who heads customer service at the largest public U.S. dealer, also cited a ""whole new attitude"" for consumers as they accept the higher prices and they are willing to make compromises or wait longer for vehicles.
 CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) Chief Executive Bill Nash said digital sales are a growing business with about 75% of its customers doing some of the deal online, but the used-car dealer is finding consumers coming back to the stores as the pandemic eases.
Meanwhile, Wahl said GM is engaging with online influencers in a new way, launching vehicles in a more entertaining way and working to personalize communications. ""We're looking at really changing the way that we spend,"" she said.
In a separate appearance at the conference, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's chief customer experience officer, Elena Ford, said the No. 2 U.S. automaker has pushed to deepen relationships with its retail and commercial customers post COVID-19.
""As people venture back out, we have a real opportunity to re-imagine the entire experience our customers have,"" she said.
Sonic Automotive (NYSE:SAH) Inc President Jeff Dyke and other dealers said the key will be using technology and better online tools to offer both the in-dealer and online shopping experience consumers want.
""Customers want individualized experiences and technology is going to lead to that,"" Dyke said. 

GM's Wahl also said the No. 1 U.S. automaker will offer a third-party app that delivers in-vehicle navigation capability to about 900,000 vehicles that lack the feature. 
The Maps+ app, from Mapbox, will begin the rollout on certain 2018 and newer models on April 30 to customers with select connected services plans, GM said.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said on Monday it would buy artificial intelligence and speech technology firm  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) Inc for about $16 billion, as it builds out its cloud strategy for healthcare and enterprise customers. 
The deal comes after the companies partnered in 2019 to automate clinical administrative work such as documentation and as Microsoft tries to extend its leadership in vertical cloud solutions in major industries including healthcare. 
""This acquisition brings our technology directly into the physician and patient loop, which is central to all healthcare delivery. The acquisition will also expand our leadership in cross-industry enterprise AI and biometric security,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call. 
Nuance, known for pioneering speech technology and helping launch Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s assistant Siri, has been doubling down on healthcare and enterprise AI. The company has spun off and sold a number of less profitable business units. 

""Nuance has been in the midst of an unprecedented strategic turnaround the last few years under the leadership of CEO Mark Benjamin and we believe the company represents a unique asset on the healthcare front for"" Microsoft, Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush wrote in a note on Monday. ""We also believe Microsoft can further integrate Nuance's advanced speech technology throughout its consumer and enterprise ecosystem over the coming years to leverage this M&A move."" 
With operations in 28 countries, the Burlington, Massachusetts-based company reported $1.5 billion in revenue in fiscal-year 2020.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Nvidia to directly challenge Intel with Arm-based 'Grace' server chip,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp on Monday said it plans to make a server processor chip based on technology from the United Kingdom's Arm Ltd, putting it in the most direct competition yet with rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and adding a layer of complexity to the antitrust review of Nvidia's $40 billion deal to buy Arm.
Intel is the world's biggest maker of central processors for data center servers but has increasingly seen competition from Arm-based chips. With its ""Grace"" server processor, Nvidia will be the largest chip company so far to challenge Intel in its key market.
Nvidia shares rose 2.6% and Intel shares dropped 4% in midday trading after the news. Intel shares have risen more than 30% this year as its new chief Pat Gelsinger outlined its strategy to overcome years of manufacturing woes.
Arm's technology powers the chips in most smartphones, but for the last several years has been making its way into data centers, with companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ampere Computing designing chips for servers with it.
Nvidia's entry into the market could hasten Arm's inroads into data centers. Nvidia's chips have traditionally been used as ""accelerators"" alongside existing central processors from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc or others, offloading some computing work from them and speeding up the overall computing system.
By making its own central processor, Nvidia is taking on Intel and AMD directly for the first time. In a keynote speech announcing the chip, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang called the new server chip the ""final piece of the puzzle"" that will join Nvidia's graphics and networking chips to form the ""basic building block of the modern data center.” 
Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia said the ""Grace"" server processor, which will be released in 2023, is designed to handle tasks like training artificial intelligence algorithms. Once known for its graphics chips to improve the play of video games, Nvidia has focused heavily on artificial intelligence computing in recent years, helping its market capitalization exceed Intel's to become the largest U.S. semiconductor firm.
Nvidia also said that the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre will make a new supercomputer dubbed ""Alps"" using the new ""Grace"" processors and built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co. The computing system, which Huang said will be 10 times faster than the world's current best supercomputer, will be used for tasks such as weather forecasting and physics research.
Nvidia officials said that the company's accelerator chips will continue to support central processors from Intel and AMD even as it dives into the market itself. Huang said that Nvidia will alternate its focus, concentrating on making accelerator chips that work with Arm-processors one year, and then chips that work with AMD and Intel chips in the next year. 
Nvidia did not disclose which Arm technology it would use for the chips but said they would use computing cores Arm's ""Neoverse"" family of server chip technology that will be released in the future. Huang said it was ""off-the-shelf"" technology from Arm.
Nvidia said in September that it will buy Arm for $40 billion.
Nvidia's rivals have expressed concerns that the company will use its potential ownership of Arm to get early access to Arm's technologies as they become more prevalent in the data center market.

Arm said that Nvidia has had the same access to its intellectual property as the rest of Arm's customer base and did not get early access to its technology.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is monitoring the implosion of New York fund Archegos Capital and analyzing why some banks suffered billions of dollars in losses, but the incident does not raise broader systemic risk worries, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said.
Archegos, a family office run by ex-Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, along with major banks that financed the fund's trades, lost billions of dollars last month as its leveraged bets on media stocks quickly soured.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Nomura bore the brunt of the pain, losing $4.7 billion and $2 billion respectively. 
""This is an event that we're monitoring very carefully and working with regulators here and around the world to understand carefully,"" Powell told CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Sunday. 
While Powell said the incident did not raise concerns over systemic risks to the institutions or the financial system, it was ""concerning"" the banks suffered such big losses at the hands of one client in a relatively well-understood business.
""We're going to understand that and get to the bottom of it. What we try to do is make sure that the banks understand the risks that they're running and have systems in place to manage them. This would appear to be a significant shortfall - a failure on that front,"" said Powell.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",How to think like a breadwinner,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While men have traditionally held the title of ""breadwinner,"" times are changing. These days, moms are the sole or primary provider for their households more than 40% of the time.
Jennifer Barrett, the chief education officer for popular investing site Acorns, wrote about her experiences in this role in her new book ""Think Like a Breadwinner,"" which highlights how women can shift their financial lives into a higher gear.
Q: For women who want to take their financial lives to the next level, what advice would you have?
A: It starts with income, because that will be the springboard for all your wealth-building efforts. You want to be making the most you can in your role at any given time, and that does mean asking for it. Women traditionally are paid and promoted less, so it's important that we advocate for ourselves.
Step two is to use every paycheck as an opportunity to become less dependent on your next paycheck. The ultimate goal is not just earning more, but building wealth. So with every check that comes in, put some into savings and investments, so that money is working for you and you're not working for your money.
Q: Millions of women have been leaving the workforce during the pandemic. Are you worried about that trend?
A: We're in an extraordinary time here. This crisis has really increased the burden on working parents, because now they have to be childcare providers and home educators on top of their jobs. That has pushed them to the breaking point.
As schools reopen and childcare options increase, a lot of women will go back to the workforce. And what this pandemic has done is shine a light on issues that have always been there, like women doing most of the household work. I'm encouraged by the fact that we are now having conversations about that.
Q: You talk a lot about self-criticism and self-doubt – do you find that is more prevalent among women than men?
A: When parents talk to daughters about money, they talk about budgeting and spending. When they talk to their sons, they talk about investing to build wealth. So if women are not getting that message, it's not surprising they feel anxious about investing.
That's why women need to get comfortable talking to each other about wealth. Ironically, women are more successful investors than men, so there is a big disconnect between our actual performance, and how we perceive ourselves.
Q: Can being a female breadwinner bring up any relationship issues?
A: Both my husband and I grew up in families where fathers were the primary breadwinners, so we didn't have a roadmap for any of this. One thing I can say from my own experience, is that one of the most important things you can do is communicate openly with your partner about expectations and assumptions.
For instance, my own expectations about motherhood came right up against my responsibilities as a breadwinner. I tried to do everything and got completely burned out. I had difficult letting go of some caregiving, because I thought it would mean I was a bad mom. That was really rough emotionally, but I'm on the other side of that now. It's not about the quantity of time with your kids, it's the quality.
Q: Having been through this breadwinning journey, any final takeaways?

A: If you are maximizing your earning potential, if you are saving and investing from every paycheck, if you are building your credit so you get the best rates on mortgages, you are setting yourself up to support the life you want without having to worry about being dependent on someone else.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed 3% on Monday after Canaccord Genuity raised its rating on the electric car maker to ""buy"" and compared its brand to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer upgraded Tesla to ""buy"" from ""hold"" and increased his price target to $1,071, the second highest among 37 analysts tracked by Refinitiv. 
The company run by Elon Musk last traded at $697.
""TSLA is rapidly creating an Apple-esque ecosystem of energy products, harmonized in electrification, to become The Brand in energy storage,"" Dorsheimer wrote in a client note focused on Tesla's battery technology and residential energy products.
He compared the brand Tesla has built around its battery technology to Apple's wildly successful ""Think Different"" marketing campaign launched in the 1990s.
The latest bump in Tesla's stock leaves it down about 1% for the year as investors await its quarterly results due in two weeks.
Last week, Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries amid strong demand in China, beating analysts' expectations.
Tesla's stock remains up over 500% in the past 12 months, and its $668 billion market capitalization makes it by far the most valuable carmaker, even though its production is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
When it reports its March quarter results on April 26, analysts, on average, expect a 70% jump in revenue to $10.2 billion, and net income of $504 million, up from $16 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv.

On Sunday, cryptocurrency exchange Binance Holdings Ltd said https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901927/Trade-Stock-Tokens-on-Binance it was giving its clients access to the stock market with the launch of tokens representing Tesla shares, priced in Binance USD, a ""regulated stablecoin"" pegged to the dollar.

Investing.com -- Home improvement and do-it-yourself trends prompted by the pandemic are here to stay, Loop Capital said. 
The firm raised price targets on Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) to Street-highs in both cases as a result, according to Seeking Alpha. Both are trading near records after already having solid returns throughout the pandemic.

Investing.com – Video games may be at the heart of their business but shares of Roblox and GameStop (NYSE:GME) were reacting to different scripts in Monday's trade – the former getting a thumbs up all around and stakeholders being told to dump the latter.
Roblox shares rose more than 5%, extending their recent gains on top of several analysts rating it a buy. GameStop fell 10%.
On-platform bookings remained strong through March and M Science expects it to deliver a Q1 beat, according to a note issued Thursday.
Last week, BofA initiated Roblox coverage with a buy and a $78 target, just $2 away from its current price. Stifle raised the target for the stock last month to $85.
Cathie Wood’s ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) owns the stock. Roblox has more than 32 million daily average users on its online platform that allows them to program games and play those created by other users. Roblox is free to play, but there are in-game purchases available.
But the day wasn’t proving to be a great one for GameStop, the darling of the Reddit gang, after Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo downgraded the stock to sell from hold. He set a new price target of $10 from $12 earlier, saying the company’s fiscal year 2021 outlook is ""hazy.""
Reuters reported that GameStop had begun a search for a new chief executive, which would be one of several top executive changes in the last few weeks as the company changes to an e-commerce strategy.
Price targets for GameStop and its actual share price haven’t had a great correlation last few months, what with an almost 4000% rise in a year in the stock price of the video game retailer. The stock has been at the heart of the battle between Reddit followers, ‘WallStreetBets’ on one hand and the big institutional guys on the other.  With a mix of egos and big money, analysts argue that the stock’s drive carries no fundamentals, amply reflecting in Woo’s target.

Both Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have been advancing faster than ever due to the world’s accelerating shift from analog to digital lifestyles in recent months. But, putting the regulatory scrutiny they are both currently facing to the side for a moment, let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.The popular acronym “FAANG” refers to the big five tech giants: Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL). The companies dominate their markets and have achieved stellar financial performance over the years. While AMZN’s ecommerce platform exploded amid the pandemic due to an increase in online buying, GOOGL’s cloud computing continues to witness elevated use amid the current and ongoing digital revolution.
While much of the global economy reeled from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, AMZN and GOOGL have witnessed formidable business ascendance. A surge in online shopping and cloud computing activities have contributed to double-digit gains for these two companies. And despite their growing regulatory distractions, we think AMZN and GOOGL should continue to reap long-term results from their technological innovation.
AMZN has gained 65.1% over the past year, while GOOGL has returned 88.2% over the same period. Also, in terms of year-to-date performance, GOOGL surpassed AMZN’s 3.5% returns by gaining 29.6%. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

The approval comes at a critical time for Cineworld, as it has started reopening its theatres in the United States and is gearing up to welcome back moviegoers in the UK next month. 
The industry saw huge losses last year, with the global health crisis shuttering theatres and disrupting film production in addition to accelerating a shift to online streaming platforms.
However, 2021 looks more promising, with ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" having made $69.5 million in the domestic box office so far. The James Bond movie ""No Time to Die"" and Marvel's latest superhero film ""Black Widow"" are also set to debut in theatres this year.

Investing.com -- The jury may still be out on who is winning the chicken sandwich wars, but McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) version appears to be pretty popular.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) reiterated a buy rating on the stock after foot traffic and other web data show the Feb. 24 launch of its new crispy chicken sandwich will lead to better-than-expected sales. Extended European lockdowns, however, may offset the embrace of the new sandwich in the U.S. Shares are little changed as the broader market remains lower.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>","Analysis-With quick fixes, Biden's agencies reverse Trump's Wall Street-friendly rules","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's interim regulators are wasting no time unraveling Wall Street-friendly measures introduced under former Republican President Donald Trump, using quick-fix legal tactics. 
They have spiked or stalled more than a dozen contentious Trump-era measures that critics said eroded consumer protections, weakened enforcement, and curbed investors' ability to push for environmental, social and governance (ESG) changes. 
Rather than embarking on the lengthy process of rewriting the rules, the agencies have in many instances used speedy legal tools, according to lawyers, consumer groups, and a review by Reuters. These include delaying unfinished rules, issuing informal guidance, rescinding old policy statements or issuing new ones, and choosing not to enforce existing rules. 
The swift changes https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden-financial-regulators/factbox-how-bidens-agencies-are-picking-apart-trumps-wall-street-friendly-measures-idUKL1N2LR2FG have set off alarm bells in the financial industry, which is having to adapt quickly to the tougher new regime, and set the stage for potential legal challenges down the road, said lobbyists and lawyers. 
""The interim Democratic leadership for these agencies are moving very quickly to tackle the deregulatory policy shifts that occurred under Trump,"" said Quyen Truong, partner at law practice Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.
""The agencies' use of guidance and reversal of policy statements demands a quick turnaround of compliance for firms."" 
During the previous administration, Trump-appointed regulators eased dozens of rules they said were outdated and hurt jobs, drawing ire from Democrats who said the changes saved Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing risks and hurting consumers. 
With a slim majority in Congress, Democratic lawmakers will struggle to repeal those rules, while delays https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-cabinet/biden-plans-to-appoint-interim-agency-heads-during-confirmation-process-idUSKBN29I047 to the presidential transition has left many nominees still awaiting confirmation nearly three months in. 
That has put the onus on interim officials to start executing Biden's agenda to help Americans recover from the pandemic and to tackle social injustice and climate change. 
Acting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Allison Lee, for example, has been very active. She has returned power to senior enforcement staff, who had it stripped from them in 2017, to open probes without seeking senior approvals, and has reversed a 2019 policy that critics said made it too easy for companies that broke the rules to continue with business as usual. 
She has also begun to reverse the Trump administration's assault on ESG investing with a new effort https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-climate-change-analysis/analysis-why-bidens-securities-regulator-faces-climate-crackdown-challenges-idUSKBN2B919L to police misleading ESG disclosures.
The SEC said every decision was made with a view to ensuring ""seamless leadership"" in its mission to protect investors.
Likewise, the Department of Labor last month said it would not enforce https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-labor-esg/u-s-labor-department-will-not-enforce-trump-era-investment-rules-idUSKBN2B22GD two rules finalized in the last months of the Trump administration which curbed investments and shareholder votes based on ESG factors. The agency did not respond to a request for comment. 
And acting Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director Dave Uejio has not disappointed progressives who hoped he would fix policies they said undermined fair lending. 
""We are taking a close look at previous policies that hampered the Bureau's effectiveness and simultaneously working nonstop through supervision and enforcement to ensure financial institutions are treating consumers fairly,"" Uejio said. 
He has revoked policies that had undermined the agency's ability to punish companies for ""abusive"" behavior, and which had curtailed the supervisory department's power to tell companies what to do. 
This month, Uejio delayed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cfpb-debt-collection/u-s-consumer-watchdog-seeks-delay-on-pair-of-debt-collection-rules-idUSKBN2BU2WD new debt collection rules which consumer groups said would do more harm than good, while Reuters has reported https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-consumers-credit-scores/fixing-the-credit-catch-22-how-biden-wants-to-make-credit-scores-fairer-idUSL1N2LT061 that the CFPB is exploring overhauling the country's credit reporting system. 
Uejio said he plans to focus on more COVID-19 relief and racial equity measures. 
""We've already seen financial agencies, most notably the consumer watchdog, take the hatchet to some of the worst Trump-era policies,"" said Ed Mierzwinski of consumer advocacy group PIRG.
PUSHBACK
Republicans, though, say the changes create legal uncertainty and could cause companies to pull back from lending. U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Congressional panel that oversees financial agencies, said in a statement that the changes would ""slow economic growth.""
And hastily reversing rules and policies without going through a formal review process could risk litigation, said Brian Johnson, a partner at Alston & Bird and formerly CFPB deputy director. 

Still, lawyers said they were advising clients to adapt quickly, as permanent appointees were unlikely to change course.
""Consumers cannot wait for help,"" said Uejio. ""They need us now.

Investing.com -- We're giving our loved ones (or ourselves) diamonds and pearls, prompting Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) to increase guidance. Shares are rallying more than 9%.
Fiscal 2022 first quarter sales are expected at between $1.57 billion and $1.6 billion, up from $1.42 billion and $1.46 billion announced less than a month ago. For the full year, revenue is estimated at between $6 billion and $6.14 billion, from $5.8 billion and $6 billion, the company said in a statement. 
Signet has already seen profit and sales make a comeback since the pandemic devastated demand and results starting in March 2020. The company racked up losses for the two subsequent quarters to turn a $4.15 per share profit for the quarter ended in January. The jeweler cites stimulus, tax refunds and vaccine-driven euphoria for the solid results.
And while supply chain issues have rattled various industries, Signet says it has mitigated short-term inventory delays.      
Shares have rallied over the past 12 months to return to their highest in about three years. Analysts don't seem to have much faith, however, with two saying hold and two saying sell. The stock has nary a single buy rating, according to data compiled by Investing.com.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>","Uber, PayPal, Walgreens launch $11 million vaccine rides fund","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Walgreens Inc on Monday said they launched an $11 million fund to provide free ride-hail trips to U.S. COVID-19 vaccination sites for people who lack access to transportation.
The Vaccine Access Fund will be managed by U.S. non-profit Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which will identify communities that need free rides as well as local partners to help with the program, the companies added. 
Consumers can support the effort by donating to the fund through PayPal or in the Uber app, they said, adding they were also looking forward to welcoming other corporate donors.
In a joint letter to U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the companies said their cooperation came in response to calls by the administration for companies to get involved in the pandemic response.
""The Vaccine Access Fund will draw on the innovative tools developed by our respective firms to expand vaccine access and build upon the Biden-Harris administration's efforts,"" the companies said in the letter seen by Reuters.
The fund is separate from Uber's promise to provide 10 million free or discounted rides to vaccination sites globally, an effort that is both public-spirited and self-interested as it is trying to get more drivers and passengers back on the road. 

Lack of transportation is a major hurdle to healthcare equity and vaccine access, and studies show fewer options for medical care in low-income and Black communities that are frequently poorly served by public transit and have lower car ownership rates.

With rapid advancements in the development of these vehicles, the lidar market’s prospects look strong. So, we think shares of prominent LIDAR system developers Luminar Technologies (LAZR), Velodyne Lidar (VLDR), Aeva Technologies (AEVA), and Ouster (OUST) are valuable additions to one’s watchlist. Let’s evaluate these names more closely.In recent months, self-driven cars have become the “it” product in the tech world. Thanks to breakthroughs in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI), more automakers are now focusing on developing and marketing climate-friendly, automated products. As autonomous vehicles (AV) position themselves to disrupt the automobile industry, LIDAR, the core technology used in self-driving cars, has become one of the hottest areas in which to invest.
LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses laser light pulses to map surroundings at the speed of light. Originally introduced by NASA, the technology is now used increasingly to control speed, braking, and safety systems in vehicles to accommodate sudden changes in traffic conditions and to avoid collisions.
As the AV revolution intensifies going forward, the lidar market is expected to expand more rapidly. Against this backdrop, many LIDAR technology developers are going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to raise their market profiles, seeking industry leadership. We believe Luminar Technologies, Inc. (LAZR), Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (VLDR), Aeva Technologies, Inc. (AEVA) and Ouster, Inc. (OUST) are uniquely positioned to cash in on the AV revolution.

1203,By StockNews,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 11:02AM ET</span>",3 Recent IPOs Down More Than 25% YTD,"2020 has been a red-hot year for the IPO market, with a record number of companies going public. With a disconnect between the stock markets and the real economy as the backdrop, companies such as Unity Software (U), QuantumScape (QS), and Qualtrics International (XM) were able to go public with tremendous valuations absent strong growth trajectories. But, as the economy and the stock market stabilize this year, we think these stocks could witness significant pullbacks. Let’s discuss.Despite a worldwide pandemic, surging stock markets paved the way for a record number of companies to go public last year. A total of 407 companies went public through IPOs last year, up more than 107.1% year-over-year, according to a Statista report. Global IPO activity rose 42% from the year-ago, representing 1,591 listings that raised $331 billion. Listings in the United States raised approximately $127 billion, up 118% year-over-year. Special Purpose Acquisition deals (SPACs) also increased in 2020, with 247 companies going public through reverse mergers, representing a 320% rise year-over-year. The IPO market capitalized on the skyrocketing stock markets last year. However, investor exuberance has generally driven these IPO stocks to significant overvaluation over the past year.
The reopening of economic activities and an anticipated fast-paced recovery by the U.S. economy have re-introduced some stability in the markets over the past couple of months as investors resumed a more fundamental approach toward investing. Furthermore, with most companies shrugging off pandemic-led business disruptions to generate robust profits, the overvalued IPOs last year are losing momentum, given their generally weak financials and bleak growth prospects.
Companies such as Unity Software, Inc. (U), QuantumScape Corporation (QS), and Qualtrics International Inc. (XM), which made stellar stock market debuts last year, have declined more than 25% year-to-date because investors are shifting now to quality bargains. So, given their unfavorable revenue and earnings growth potential, we believe these stocks are best avoided now.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Legion Partners Asset Management LLC has nominated seven directors to sit on specialty retailer Genesco (NYSE:GCO) Inc's eight-person board, according to a letter made public in a filing on Monday.
Legion, run by Christopher Kiper, wants Genesco to consider selling non-core assets and buy back shares. It owns a 5.6% stake in the retailer, which has a market capitalization of $727.8 million. Genesco's stock price inched up 1.3% to $49.29. 
""We will review the letter from Legion, along with their proposed director candidates, and respond in due course,"" Genesco said in a statement.
With Legion's board nominees, ""Genesco will be able to produce $7.50 in earnings per share (""EPS"") by fiscal 2023 and see its stock double from current levels,"" Kiper and Legion Managing Director Ted White wrote in a letter to other shareholders. The pair said they wish to keep Genesco's CEO, Mimi Vaughn, saying their nominees want to partner with her and ""draw on her institutional knowledge to implement a strategic plan."" 
Legion blamed Genesco's ""poor performance"" on its plan to operate as ""a retail conglomerate holding company and think of itself as a private equity investment platform,"" the letter said, citing its decision to enter the hat business, buy a European footwear retailer and spend $34 million on a licensing business.
Legion has previously launched campaigns at other retailers including  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY), and this year it teamed up with several other activists to take control of department store Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) board.
This is the second time that Legion has tangled with Genesco. The hedge fund's seven board nominees include Marjorie Bowen, who served as an independent director from 2018-2019.
Genesco said it disagrees with many of the hedge fund's points and is surprised at the board nomination decision after ""not responding to our repeated requests for their input and ideas or sharing their proposed candidates in advance.""

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped almost 4% Monday after Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said the electric vehicle maker holds a lead of several years, setting a price target of $1,071.
The new price target is 50% higher than its current price.
Even as competition mounts from the likes of Germany’s Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) Japan’s  Honda  (NYSE:HMC) and China’s Geely (OTC:GELYY), Dorsheimer said that the Elon Musk company holds a “several-year lead” in the sector while it continues to expand aggressively into storage.
As far as supply challenges are concerned, the analyst expects the situation to ease next year as factories at Giga Nevada, Texas, and Berlin come onstream.
“We believe, large capital investments to increase battery production capacity will begin to pay off in 2022, as Giga Texas and Berlin 4680 cell production starts. Cell suppliers Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) and LG are also working with Tesla to produce the 4680 cell, Panasonic specifically plans to start production late 2021 at the partner facility Giga Nevada,” the analyst added.
Tesla shares are prone to sharp movements, partly owing to tweets of its maverick founder, and are a favorite of Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest. Recently she set a price target for the stock at $3,000 by 2025."

Vaccinated employees will be able to volunteer to join groups of 100 or fewer people to work from its San Francisco headquarters and other offices, including Palo Alto and Irvine, the cloud-based software maker said on Monday.
It added that the offices would be equipped with onsite COVID-19 testing that would be mandated twice a week.
As the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gathers pace, the debate around the use of vaccine passports has intensified, with rights experts warning that a push for identity proofs and digital certificates risks excluding poorer and more vulnerable groups. (https://reut.rs/3s8sg4I)
Many tech companies, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, have started to reopen their office buildings months after the COVID-19 pandemic forced firms to adapt to working from home.
Some firms in other sectors have made vaccinations mandatory at the workplace.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holding Ltd said last week it would require all its crew and passengers to be vaccinated before it starts cruises again, hoping the move along with other safety measures will be enough for U.S. health authorities to lift a ban on sailings in July.

Shares got a boost as Raymond James upgraded the taco maker to a buy-equivalent from neutral with a price target of $1,800 and an eye on strong quarterly results to come. 
Meanwhile, Chipotle Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung told CNBC on Friday after the close that digital sales are staying strong even as dining rooms fill back up. And last week, the company got price target bumps from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Truist Securities. 
Chipotle's had a banner year, more than doubling since its pandemic-driven dip in March 2020 amid strong profit and sales. Chipotle's digital sales jumped 174% in 2020 versus the previous year. It's trading close to a record, and is up some 10% in 2021. 
""We now see significant upside to 1Q21 expectations,"" Raymond James said, according to StreetInsider. ""Chipotle is also among the highest quality growth stories in our universe supported by several tangible comp drivers (menu innovation, leveraging loyalty), accelerating unit growth (7-8% in '22 bolstered by Chipotlane rollout still in very early stages), and an ironclad financial position (strong FCF and debt-free B/S).""
Hartung said some 80% of digital sales are hanging on strong, and dining rooms are regaining about 60% of pre-pandemic traffic
""We’re very optimistic about where we go from here,” Hartung said.
Chipotle has added quesadillas to its online menu, and offers debt-free college degrees for employees.

The plan contains $174 billion in funding to promote EVs. Here are three stocks that could emerge as big winners from the plan: TM, HMC, and VWAGY (OTC:VWAGY).Last week, President Joe Biden unveiled his infrastructure package - The American Jobs Plan. The plan includes many elements, such as spending to repair and rebuild roads, bridges, and water systems, upgrading the electric grid, and Increasing broadband internet access in rural areas. 
The plan also allocates $174 billion in rebates and discounts for electric vehicle (EV) purchases and to increase the number of public chargers. The plan is targeting 500,000 public chargers by 2030 which is a significant leap from 72,000 today. It also seeks to electrify the federal fleet of vehicles and buses.
If the American Jobs Plan makes it through Congress, then it’s likely to pull forward the demand for EVs and accelerate the adoption curve. The quicker timeline for EV adoption hurts startups who still have to build out production capacity and distribution channels. In contrast, it will increase the chances of success of automakers like Honda Motors (HMC), Toyota Motors (TM), and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY).

Investing.com – Aphria (TSX:APHA) shares fell more than 13% after disappointing earnings outweighed any euphoria generated by its decision to combine with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) to create the world's largest global cannabis company.
Compared with the same quarter a year ago, lockdowns took a toll on its revenue, margins and bottom line.
Net revenue for the three months ended February 28 was C$153.6 million ($122.5 million), an increase of 6.4% from C$144.4 million in the same period last year. But that fell short of the expected C$162.4 million. The company suffered what it called a “transitory reduction in demand during the quarter.”  
Its adjusted cannabis gross margin fell to 39.2% from 42.7% from the February quarter a year ago. The company reported a net loss of C$360,996, or C$1.14, against expectations for a loss of around 4 cents.
The average retail selling price of medical cannabis, before excise tax, decreased to C$6.69 per gram in the quarter, compared to C$6.96 per gram in the prior quarter.
The company said the decline was a result of specific pricing programs offered to assist patients in need who have been negatively affected by the pandemic, along with other promotional programs.
The company’s proposed merger with Tilray will be put to vote on April 16.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets edged lower in early trade on Monday, pulling back from record-high weekly closes on Friday as the market braces for the onslaught of first-quarter earnings. 
The market shrugged off comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell broadcast at the weekend, in which he saw the U.S. economy at an 'inflection point' ahead of a sharp pickup in economic activity and - more importantly from the Fed's perspective - hiring. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was down in parallel and the Nasdaq Composite was underperforming slightly with a drop of 0.3%.
Prominent among early movers was  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) stock, which rose 18% after an announcement that it has agreed to be bought by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for $19.7 billion, including debt. The acquisition of the voice recognition software specialist will be Microsoft's biggest in five years. Microsoft stock was up 0.1%.
 Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA)  rose 7.8% after it told investors that it doesn’t expect any further material impacts from Chinese antitrust regulators, in the wake of the $2.8 billion fine levied on the company at the weekend.
The fine was the result of an investigation into the abuse of its dominant market position, and had been seen as a broader proxy for relations between the Communist Party and Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Under Chinese law, the fine could have been over twice as large. The actual outturn was at the bottom end of analysts' expectations.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 2.7% after saying that gross bookings for its ride-hailing services in March were at their highest since the pandemic began, while also indicating continued strength in its delivery business. Neither business is profitable yet.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile rose 2.4% on the back of an upbeat report by Canaccord Genuity that talked up the prospects of the company’s energy storage capabilities in the context of a grid that is coming to depend on more variable and unpredictable sources of power.
Elsewhere, Aphria (TSX:APHA) stock fell 11% to its lowest since early February after announcing a net loss of C$361 million for its fiscal third quarter. It blamed the development on a bunch of one-off costs, including its agreement to merge with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), and an accounting charge that reflected the higher costs of stock-based compensation.

Investing.com – Uber (NYSE:UBER) shares were up a trifle short of 4% in Monday’s premarket as record numbers of people used its ride-hailing services last month.
Uber said its mobility segment posted its best month since March 2020, with gross bookings - running at an annualized rate of $30 billion. Average daily gross bookings were up 9% month-on-month.
Its delivery unit reached a record annualized run rate of $52 billion in gross bookings in March, growing more than 150% from the previous year. Uber's revenue is mainly commission taken as percentage of gross bookings.
Last month, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a ‘buy’ on Uber, setting a price target of $60. That price point is 4% from the stock’s Friday close.
“As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability,” Uber said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The cab aggregator said it is on track to reach quarterly adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2021.
Uber last week said it will spend $250 million to get drivers back on the road. The money will go toward bonuses for drivers, guaranteed pay and on-boarding new drivers. The plan comes as states begin to pull back some of their pandemic restrictions and roll out vaccines.
The ride-hailing service was among those hit hardest by lockdowns that governments in several countries imposed to curb the spread of th/e pandemic. As vaccine rollout happens, offices open up and more people get vaccinated, there are expectations that more people will use its services to travel and indulge themselves to beat the blues. The same phenomenon is expected to put pressure on its delivery business, as increasing numbers of its restaurant partners are allowed to open their doors again."

Investing.com –  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares popped in Monday’s premarket as a $2.8 billion fine by the Chinese regulators on Saturday lifted the cloud of uncertainty that had been hovering over the internet company.  
The fine was only 4% of Alibaba's domestic sales, rather than the 10% maximum allowed by law. Analysts interpreted as a broader sign of detente between regulators and a company whose financial power threatened to give it growing political clout. 
“Despite the record fine amount, we think this should lift a major overhang on BABA and shift the market’s focus back to fundamentals,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote Sunday.
Chinese regulators opened an anti-monopoly probe into Alibaba in December on complaints that the company’s practices forced merchants to list their products on one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than being able to choose both.
China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said the practice stifles competition and “infringes on the businesses of merchants on the platforms and the legitimate rights and interests of consumers.”
It’s been a tough period for Alibaba founder Jack Ma ever since his comments in October, critical of the country’s financial regulator, appeared. He was forced to call off the IPO of Ant Group a day before it was to open. Once listed, the firm he founded would have been amongst the most valuable companies in the world.  
Separately, Ant Group announced on Monday it will transform itself into a financial holding company, to be regulated by the central bank."

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>","At Brazil's Petrobras, a 'Spartan' military man takes the reins","By Gram Slattery and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - For many investors, the appointment of former army general Joaquim Silva e Luna as the new chief executive of Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras was unexpected - and unwelcome.
President Jair Bolsonaro announced the 71-year-old Luna would take the helm of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post in February. 
Luna - set to be elected at a Monday shareholder meeting to the Petrobras board of directors, and then as CEO - has no experience in the oil sector. 
His last posting, as head of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam on the Paraguay border, is a far cry from running one of the southern hemisphere's largest companies. 
Petrobras shares fell sharply when Luna's predecessor, Roberto Castello Branco, was forced out after the group hiked domestic fuel prices several times in February, angering Bolsonaro.
They have since recovered from their lows but remain down some 17% so far this year, with the dismissal sparking widespread fears of increased government interference in the company.
Yet Luna and those around him insist market jitters are overblown. Luna has pledged to keep politicians from filling key Petrobras positions with underqualified allies, a serious problem under previous administrations. 
""Political appointments aren't part of my management plans,"" said Luna. ""I've already dealt with political requests, I didn't accept and it wasn't easy.""
A native of Brazil's northeastern Pernambuco state and a career soldier, Luna served as Brazil's defense minister in 2018. He is the first military man to run Petrobras since the 1980s.
Since Bolsonaro announced his appointment, Luna has talked informally with Castello Branco and other experts in the Brazilian oil and gas sector, he told Reuters in recent weeks. 
His friends say he has a history of aggressive cost-cutting, not unlike his predecessor, who won market plaudits for selling off billions of dollars in non-core assets in a bid to reduce the oil company's hefty debt load.
Luna is known for his ""Spartan"" ways, said José Carlos Aleluia, a board member at Itaipu. He eschews elaborate business dinners, wakes up early and is one of the first people into the office, according to Aleluia. 
""If he has a social life, he doesn't mix it with work,"" Aleluia said.
DISDAIN FOR EXCESS
Luna's ascetic attitude is also reflected in a disdain for excess and redundancy, said Carlos Marun, a Brazilian congressman who sits on Itaipu's board.
Among his initiatives at Itaipu, Luna closed the dam's offices in the city of Curitiba and radically downsized its footprint in the federal capital Brasilia.
""He once told me, 'If I buy a pair of pants, I throw another one out. If I buy shoes, I throw a pair out',"" Marun said.
Among the most eagerly awaited decisions will be how he handles domestic fuel pricing, the issue that led to Castello Branco's ousting.
From 2011 to 2014, Petrobras lost about $40 billion selling fuel beneath international parity at the government's behest.
In interviews, Luna said the company's new pricing policy has not been finalized, but will be determined by the government.
He said it would be crucial for officials - rather than the company - to pick up the tab for below-market fuel prices. Still, he said, Petrobras had to think about society as a whole, rather than just shareholders, when setting prices.
""One has to look for an equilibrium,"" he said.
Luna and those around him say he puts a high value on technical expertise and often changes his mind when presented with compelling evidence.
Within the company, one of his first challenges will be overcoming widespread skepticism about his lack of industry experience, as well as rapid turnover of senior management. 

Several executives and board members have quit in recent weeks or have said publicly they plan to follow Castello Branco out the door.

Bloomberg said the deal could be announced today. According to the report, Microsoft could value Nuance at $56 per share, a premium of 23% to Nuance’s closing price of $45.58 on Friday.
Nuance, the name behind the technology used in Apple’s Siri, has a market cap of almost $13 billion.
Microsoft has been working with Nuance for two years on AI software that helps clinicians capture patient discussions and integrate them into electronic health records. Using the speech technology company’s products, this data is then integrated into Microsoft Teams chat app for telehealth appointments.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's Telesat is racing to launch a low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite constellation to provide high-speed global broadband from space, pitting the satellite communications firm founded in 1969 against two trailblazing billionaires, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
Musk, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO who was only a year old when Telesat launched its first satellite, is putting the so-called Starlink LEO into orbit with his company SpaceX, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Bezos founded, is planning a LEO called Project Kuiper. Bezos also owns Blue Origin, which builds rockets.
Despite the competition, Dan Goldberg, Telesat's chief executive officer, voices confidence when he calls Telesat's LEO constellation ""the Holy Grail"" for his shareholders - ""a sustainable competitive advantage in global broadband delivery.""
Telesat's LEO has a much lighter price tag than SpaceX and Amazon's, and the company has been in satellite services decades longer. In addition, instead of focusing on the consumer market like SpaceX and Amazon, Telesat seeks deep-pocketed business clients.
Goldberg said he was literally losing sleep six years ago when he realized the company's business model was in peril as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and video streaming took off and fiber optics guaranteed lightning-fast internet connectivity. 
Telesat's 15 geostationary (GEO) satellites provide services mainly to TV broadcasters, internet service providers and government networks, all of whom were growing increasingly worried about the latency, or time delay, of bouncing signals off orbiters more than 35,000 km (22,200 miles) above earth. 
Then in 2015 on a flight home from a Paris industry conference where latency was a constant theme, Goldberg wrote down his initial ideas for a LEO constellation on an Air Canada napkin. 
Those ideas eventually led to Telesat's LEO constellation, dubbed Lightspeed, which will orbit about 35 times closer to earth than GEO satellites, and will provide internet connectivity at a speed akin to fiber optics.
Telesat's first launch is planned in early 2023, while there are already some 1,200 of Musk's Starlink satellites in orbit.
""Starlink is going to be in service much sooner ... and that gives SpaceX the opportunity to win customers,"" said Caleb Henry, a senior analyst at Quilty Analytics.
Starlink's ""first mover"" advantage is at most 24 months and ""no one's going to lock this whole market up in that amount of time,"" Goldberg said.
Telesat in 2019 signed a launch deal with Bezos' aerospace company Blue Origin. Discussions are ongoing with three others, said David Wendling, Telesat's chief technical officer. 
They are Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Europe's ArianeGroup , and Musk's SpaceX, which launches the Starlink satellites. Wendling said a decision would be taken in a matter of months.
Telesat aims to launch its first batch of 298 satellites being built by Thales Alenia Space in early 2023, with partial service in higher latitudes later that same year, and full global service in 2024.
'SWEET SPOT'
The Lightspeed constellation is estimated to cost half as much as the $10 billion SpaceX and Amazon projects.
""We think we're in the sweet spot,"" Goldberg said. ""When we look at some of these other constellations, we don't get it.""
Analyst Henry said Telesat's focus on business clients is the right one.
""You have two heavyweight players, SpaceX and Amazon, that are already pledging to spend $10 billion on satellite constellations optimized for the consumer market,"" he said. ""If Telesat can spend half that amount creating a high-performance system for businesses, then yeah, they stand to be very competitive.""
Telesat's industry experience may also provide an edge.
""We've worked with many of these customers for decades ... That's going to give us a real advantage,"" Goldberg said.
Telesat ""is a satellite operator, has been a satellite operator, and has both the advantage of expertise and experience in that business,"" said Carissa Christensen, chief executive officer of the research firm BryceTech, adding, however, that she sees only two to three LEO constellations surviving. 
Telesat is nailing down financing - one-third equity and two-thirds debt - and will become publicly traded on the Nasdaq sometime this summer, and it could also list on the Toronto exchange after that. Currently, Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Loral Space & Communications Inc are the company's main shareholders.
France and Canada's export credit agencies, BPI and EDC respectively, are expected to be the main lenders, Goldberg said. Quebec's provincial government is lending C$400 million ($317 million), and Canada's federal government has promised C$600 million to be a preferred customer. The company also posted C$246 million in net income in 2020.
Executing the LEO plan is what keeps Goldberg up at night now, he said.

""When we decided to go down this path, the two richest people in the universe weren't focused on their own LEO constellations.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging lower at the open Monday, retreating from last week’s record levels ahead of the start of the first-quarter reporting season.
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 36 points, or 0.3%.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs again Friday, helped by buying in tech and banking stocks, with these two indices climbing over 2% last week while the Nasdaq Composite rallied more than 3% over the same period.
Stock markets have been on a tear, helped by expectations of a strong U.S. economic recovery on the back of accommodative monetary policies,  unprecedented stimulus and a successful vaccination program.
The U.S. economy is at an ""inflection point"" with expectations that growth and hiring will pick up speed in the months ahead, but also risks if a hasty reopening leads to a continued increase in coronavirus cases, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, in an interview Sunday.
He added that it’s highly unlikely that the central bank would raise interest rates this year, adding that a coming upswing in inflation readings is likely to be transitory. This followed Friday’s strong rise in producer prices, jumping 1% last month, a two-month high, and ahead of Tuesday’s consumer price index release.
This week marks the start of the first-quarter earnings season on Wall Street, with most analysts expecting strong results given expectations for faster economic growth.
The banking sector will lead the way, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) all set to report results this week. These banks are expected to show strong performance from trading and deals activity, boosted by the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, frenzy.
Other stocks likely to be in focus later include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has been linked with AI software group Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), and diagnostics company Luminex (NASDAQ:LMNX), which agreed to be bought by Italy’s DiaSorin (MI:DIAS) for $1.8 billion.
Also of interest will be the passage of the major infrastructure bill through Congress, with President Joe Biden set to meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers later Monday to try to generate support for his $2 trillion package.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday after the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen said they attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia with drones. There has been no confirmation from Saudi Arabia, and the extent of the damage, if any, is uncertain. 
Meanwhile, talks between Iran and world powers on resuscitating a 2015 nuclear accord are set to continue this week, which could result in the member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel being allowed once more to supply crude to the global market.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $59.98 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $63.70.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>","U.S., European consumers warm up to electric vehicles, but remain wary of price: survey","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - European and U.S. buyers are warming up to the idea of purchasing a battery-powered vehicle, but continue to have concerns over the price of the technology, a survey showed, underscoring the need for government subsidies to reach EV sales and environmental goals.
The share of consumers eyeing the purchase of a fully electric vehicle has grown significantly, according to an annual survey by OC&C Strategy Consultants, released on Monday exclusively to Reuters. It surveyed more than 7,500 global consumers between December and January. OC&C did not receive external funding for the study, its lead author Felicity Latcham said. The shift in attitudes comes at a crucial time for the auto industry, which is releasing a growing number of electric models in a race to comply with stricter CO2 emission targets and catch up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has captured the EV market. In the UK, France and Italy, more than half of consumers said they would consider a battery-powered vehicle as their next purchase, while in Germany and the U.S. nearly half of respondents said so, the survey showed. That represents a marked increase from last year, particularly in the UK and the U.S., where willingness to buy electric increased 81 and 61 percent, respectively. But consumers remain wary about the price of battery-powered cars, which are generally more expensive than their combustion engine counterparts.  While concerns over EV range and charging infrastructure have decreased compared to last year, the overall cost of EVs represents the largest barrier to consumers considering a battery-powered car, according to the survey.  Of the consumers likely to buy an EV, 69% said they would not pay more than a $500 premium compared to a gasoline-powered car - an unlikely scenario without government subsidies. Countries with purchase incentives have seen a faster uptick in EV sales and European countries have introduced several generous incentives. 
Boosting EV ownership is also at the heart of the U.S. administration's infrastructure plan, which would provide $100 billion in additional EV rebates and $15 billion to build 500,000 new charging stations.

LONDON (Reuters) -Global stock markets slid off record highs on Monday as investors waited to see whether U.S. earnings would justify sky-high valuations, while a rally in bonds could be tested by what should be strong readings for U.S. inflation and retail sales this week.
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, was down 0.25% after the start of European trading, off Friday's record high. The gauge's price-to-earnings ratio is at its highest level since early 2010. 
Stocks hit record highs across the world last week on optimism that vaccination programmes and the easing of lockdowns to combat COVID-19 would bode well for an economic rebound.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) noted that despite the S&P 500 making new all-time highs, small cap stocks represented by the Russell 2000 small cap index have underperformed the S&P 500 by 8% since peaking on March 12. 
""In my view, the breakdown of small caps and cyclicals is a potential early warning sign that the actual reopening of the economy will be more difficult than dreaming about it,"" said Michael Wilson, the bank's chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer. 
""Small caps and cyclicals have been stellar outperformers over the past year. In essence, they were discounting the recovery and reopening that we are about to experience. However, now we must actually do it and with that comes execution risk and potential surprises that aren’t priced.""
Nasdaq futures were down 0.1% on Monday. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. 
European shares eased off record highs as investors held off from making big bets before earnings season. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2% by 1003 GMT. (EU)
Britain's domestically focused FTSE mid 250 index held 0.2% below a record high as shops, pubs, gyms and hairdressers re-opened after three months of lockdown.
The UK's more export-oriented FTSE 100 fell 0.3%, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both traded flat. Italy's FTSE MIB gained nearly half a percent.
The VIX volatility index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", ticked slightly higher to 17.48, having hit its lowest level since March 2020 on Friday.
""Renewed bouts of elevated volatility are likely over the coming months, in our view,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""Investors can take advantage of this backdrop, however. Low volatility at present reduces the cost of locking in downside protection.""

Shares in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd surged 16% after China imposed a record 18 billion-yuan ($2.75 billion) fine on the e-commerce giant.
The share surge reflected relief that a key source of uncertainty for the company had been removed and that the fine and steps ordered were not more onerous. 
Over a third of the stock is held by U.S. investors, and it makes up more than 8% of the MSCI EM index.
U.S. growth and tech stocks saw something of a revival last week as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields retreated to 1.65%, from a 14-month top of 1.776%.
""Low inflation and dovish central banks should limit the rise in bond yields during the recovery,"" said Andrew Pease, global head of investment strategy at Russell Investments.
Over the weekend, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the economy was about to start growing faster, though the coronavirus remained a threat.
Data out this week is expected to show U.S. inflation jumped in March. Retail sales are seen surging, perhaps even with a double-digit gain. The U.S. Treasury is also set to test demand with offers of $100 billion in debt this week. 
U.S. banks open first-quarter earnings season with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) scheduled to report on Wednesday.
Analysts expect profits for S&P 500 firms to show a 25% jump from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data. That would be the strongest performance for the quarter since 2018.

(Reuters) - Bill Reith felt the blast of February's freak cold snap in Texas almost immediately - from inside his office in northern Indiana.
As head of the largest recreational vehicle division of REV Group (NYSE:REVG) Inc, a Milwaukee-based producer of specialty vehicles, he watched helplessly as the power grid in Texas buckled under some of the coldest temperatures seen in the state in decades, hobbling shipments of a mundane, but vital, commodity used in every one of his company's RVs: foam.
Petrochemical plants of all types shut down in Texas because of the power cuts, including the only five in North America that produce propylene oxide - a critical raw material for the foam that goes into seat cushions and other RV components.
The disruptions are expected to linger into May and are slowing and even halting operations for U.S. manufacturers.
Chemical plants in Texas were shut for a few days, but it will take weeks to get them fully functional again as workers fix burst pipes and clean materials from clogged equipment. And that delay is being felt in the wider U.S. economy.
Automakers  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd have cited shortages of plastic components and petrochemicals - as well as semiconductors - for recent North American production shutdowns, while the  Container Store  Group (NYSE:TCS) Inc, which sells many plastic products, has warned the shortages could hit its profit margins.
RV producers have also highlighted the challenge.
""It hasn't created enough disruption to stop production, but it has caused delays,"" said Bob Martin, chief executive of  Thor Industries  (NYSE:THO) Inc. On a visit to the Elkhart, Indiana-based company's newly acquired operation in Alabama last week, Martin said he saw 100 motor homes that couldn't be shipped because workers were still waiting for the arrival of the plush driver chairs that needed to be installed.
He expects, however, that the delays will ease in the coming weeks. ""By later this spring, we'll be in good shape,"" Martin said.
The Texas shutdowns swiftly pushed up prices for some key raw materials just as markets and Federal Reserve policymakers were refocusing their attention on inflation amid widespread supply chain disruptions that have nothing to do with weather in the Lone Star State.
NEWEST HURDLE
Manufacturers in recent years have sought to limit the stock of materials they keep on hand, part of the push to the ""just-in-time"" strategy that is meant to make the production system more efficient. One upshot of that is that when a storm or other sudden disruption hits, there's little opportunity to grab buffer stocks.
""It was almost instantaneous,"" said Reith, of the impact of the freeze on supplies and prices. ""Plants shut down, they announced force majeure, and everyone was put on allocation,"" describing the legal move producers take when they can't deliver on contracts and start limiting shipments.
Reith said he was only getting half the furniture he needed for three weeks after the Texas disruptions and is only receiving about 80% now. Reith said he's also seeing shortages on the foam used to insulate walls and doors on RVs.
His division - REV Recreation Group - hasn't curbed production yet, but instead has been pushing RVs through its factories and waiting to install furniture at the last step. It takes about six to eight weeks for an RV to be built in Reith's factories, depending on the size and complexity of the vehicle.
""What we're doing is continuing to build, so when furniture arrives, we're installing it at the end of the process,"" he said, adding that the production crunch would come later this month if supplies don't quickly recover.
Finding enough fiberglass is also a problem. The product, which REV Recreation Group uses to mold the nose cones and rear ends of its motorhomes, was in short supply even before the Texas cold blast. ""This just exacerbated it,"" Reith said. 
So far, prices of that material have gone up nearly 15% as a result of the Texas storm.
The shortfalls come at a tough time for the RV industry, which employs nearly 94,000 workers in the United States in its network of manufacturers and suppliers, and was already stretched thin by the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the past year, RV manufacturers have struggled to produce enough vehicles as stuck-at-home Americans sought ways to travel without having to enter hotels and other public accommodations. The industry is still predicting record sales this year despite the latest supply disruptions. Foam shortages are just a new hurdle.
RV manufacturers don't report how much product is sitting outside factories waiting for foam or other missing parts. But the build-up is visible as parking lots around factories quickly fill up.
Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII), the industry's largest parts supplier, said his Elkhart, Indiana-based company is scrambling to find substitutes for hard-to-get materials. Lippert has sharply increased imports of RV furniture, for instance.
And in some cases, LCI has shifted to using different materials. Lippert said the company has at times substituted woven fiber for foam in the 4,000 mattresses it makes each day.

The other response, he said, is to raise prices. ""Everybody is doing it,"" Lippert said, ""all through the supply chain.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp is facing a call from a leading shareholder to seek other offers from potential suitors following a $20 billion buyout bid from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, according to a statement.
U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management said the Japanese conglomerate should evaluate ""the privatisation proposal in a sincere manner through a fair process that includes a proactive market check and formation of an independent special committee,"" according to the statement. 
Farallon, Toshiba's third-largest shareholder with a stake of around 6% according to a source, is the first large investor to publicly comment on CVC's unsolicited offer of 5,000 yen ($45.68) per share, a 30% premium on its earlier value.
Taking Toshiba private would improve its governance and capital allocation by ""further aligning the interests of shareholders and management,"" Farallon said.
Investors say a deal of this size would lure other potential suitors. Two sources familiar with the matter said Toshiba has been approached by other suitors in the past.
When a change-of-control is likely to occur in the United States, the target is required to seek and achieve the highest price reasonably available from any and all parties, said Nicholas Benes, a corporate governance expert and representative director of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan.
The board's duty would shift to ""obtaining the highest price for shareholders"" using an auction process, he said. ""However, Japan does not have this legal principle. This can leave the standard for board decisions unclear, leading to less value for shareholders.""

The U.S. president wants to raise corporate income tax to 28% and set a 21% minimum levy on global corporate earnings. The ambitious package is set to face resistance in Congress, before a potentially revised version goes into effect next year.
Goldman strategists including David Kostin estimate that in the unlikely scenario that no tax reforms are adopted, the S&P 500’s annual earnings per share will grow by 12% to $203 next year. However, full adoption of the Biden proposals would cut growth to just 5% or $190.
“Legislation will be heavily negotiated,” the strategists write, adding their current estimate for a 9% earnings per share growth assumes that taxes will rise.
The president plans to meet with a bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers on Monday as part of his pitch to support initiatives that he said would address inequality, strengthen the U.S. economy and rebuild the country’s infrastructure. Centrist Democrats like West Virginia’s senator Joe Manchin have said that the current tax proposal goes too far.
While global stocks have rallied on the expectation that economies will rebound as vaccinations against the coronavirus progress, cash-starved governments are under pressure to raise corporate taxes following an unprecedented spending spree to cushion the blow from the steepest recession in living memory.
The Biden administration has floated a proposal for a new international tax code that would hit as many as 100 global corporate giants with a levy on their revenue. A push by European Union members to tax more of the income on the countries where tech giants do business had been stalled, amid a pushback from Donald Trump’s administration.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>","Alibaba shrugs off $2.75 billion antitrust fine, shares rally","By Josh Horwitz and Yilei Sun
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Alibaba does not expect any material impact from the antitrust crackdown in China that will push it to overhaul how it deals with merchants, its CEO said on Monday, after regulators fined the e-commerce giant $2.75 billion for abusing market dominance.
Shares in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings Ltd rose as much as 9% in Hong Kong trade as a key source of uncertainty for the company was removed, and on relief the fine and steps ordered were not more onerous.
Alibaba has come under intense scrutiny since billionaire founder Jack Ma's public criticism of the Chinese regulatory system in October.
As part of ""comprehensive rectifications"" sought by regulators, Alibaba will make it easier for merchants to do business with it, Chief Executive Daniel Zhang told an online conference for media and analysts. 
Beijing wants Alibaba to stop requiring merchants to chose between doing business with it and rival platforms, a practice known as ‘merchant exclusivity’, which critics say helped it become China’s largest e-commerce operation.
Alibaba executives said despite Saturday's record 18 billion yuan ($2.75 billion) fine and measures ordered by regulators, they remain confident in the government's overall support of the company.
""They are affirming our business model,"" said Alibaba executive vice chairman Joe Tsai. ""We feel comfortable that there's nothing wrong with our fundamental business model as a platform company.""
SHARES BOUNCE
The company stock was up about 8% in the afternoon trade in Hong Kong, adding $48.5 billion to its market value and putting it on course to post its biggest single-day gain in nearly three months.
""Now the penalty is determined, the market's uncertainty about Alibaba will be reduced,"" Everbright Sun Hung Kai analyst Kenny Ng said. 
""Alibaba's stock price has lagged behind the overall emerging economy stocks for some time in the past. The implementation of this penalty is expected to allow Alibaba's stock price to regain market attention."" 
Aside from imposing the fine, among the highest ever antitrust penalties globally, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) ordered Alibaba to make ""thorough rectifications"" to strengthen internal compliance and protect consumer rights.
""The required corrective measures will likely limit Alibaba's revenue growth as a further expansion in market share will be constrained,"" said Lina Choi, Senior Vice President at Moody’s Investors Service. 
""Investments to retain merchants and upgrade products and services will also reduce its profit margins."" 
SAMR said it had determined Alibaba, which is also listed in New York, had prevented its merchants from using other online e-commerce platforms since 2015.
The practice, which the SAMR has previously spelt out as illegal, violates China's antimonopoly law by hindering the free circulation of goods and infringing on the business interests of merchants, the regulator said.
The probe comes as China bolsters SAMR with extra staff and a wider jurisdiction amid a crackdown on technology conglomerates, signalling a new era after years of laissez-faire approach. 
The agency has taken aim recently at China's large tech giants in particular, mirroring increased scrutiny of the sector in the United States and Europe.
EXCLUSIVITY ISSUES
Alibaba said it accepted the penalty and ""will ensure its compliance with determination"". 
Speaking with analysts on Monday, Tsai said that other than a review of the company's mergers and acquisitions, which the company's peers also face, it does not expect further investigation from the antitrust regulator.
""We are pleased we can put this matter behind us,"" he said.
Tsai added the company ""doesn't rely on exclusivity"" to retain its merchants, adding such exclusivity arrangements in the past only covered a small number of Tmall flagship stores.
Alibaba and its peers remain under review for mergers and acquisitions from the market regulator, Tsai told the briefing, adding he was not aware of any other anti-monopoly-related investigations.
The fine is more than double the $975 million paid in China by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, in 2015 for anticompetitive practices.
""The $2.75 billion fine against Alibaba should be viewed for what it is - a meaningful but affordable price to pay to start the process of reconciliation with the Beijing regime,"" said Franklin Chu, president of Sage Capital in Rye, New York.

""Alibaba remains an appealing and convenient way to invest in the rapidly growing Chinese economy,"" he said. ""Given the power of its various core business, the stock is undervalued by most conventional measures.""

The company will sell new shares to fund product development, and some existing investors also will offer stock, Darktrace said in a statement Monday. Darktrace and shareholders plan to sell at least 20% of the company’s equity, and the stock will trade on the London Stock Exchange’s premium market and be eligible for FTSE’s benchmark stock indexes, according to the statement.
IPO proceeds in London total $9.9 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, on par with 2019 and closing in on the 2020 total of $11.6 billion. Deliveroo, which raised 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) in its listing March 31, has slumped 35% since it began trading, hit by investor concerns about its gig-economy business model and its dual-class share structure.
Darktrace has been putting the pieces in place since at least late 2019 for a public offering. The company was founded in 2013 by veterans of U.S. and British intelligence agencies and mathematicians from the University of Cambridge. Its technology uses artificial intelligence to learn how organizations work and employees communicate to detect irregularities and wall off cyberattacks to prevent them from spreading.
It’s one of the companies that received early funding and advice from British entrepreneur Mike Lynch’s Invoke Capital. Lynch, the founder of Autonomy Corp., is awaiting a verdict on a trial involving Autonomy’s more-than $10 billion sale to Hewlett-Packard Co. a decade ago. HP (NYSE:HPQ) wrote down the vast majority of the deal in 2012 and has alleged that Lynch and his chief financial officer orchestrated an accounting fraud to make Autonomy more attractive in the sale, which both men have denied.
Lynch serves on Darktrace’s science and technology committee. A number of its executives also have Autonomy pedigree, including Chief Executive Officer Poppy Gustafsson and Chief Strategy Officer Nicole Eagan.
Invoke is represented on Darktrace’s nine-member board by Phil Pearson, Vanessa Colomar and Andrew Kanter. A number of members also have ties to other Invoke-backed companies, including Chairman Robert Webb, who serves in the same capacity at AI platform Luminance, and Gordon Hurst, who’s also on the board of fraud-detection business Featurespace.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) International Ltd., Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG and KKR Capital Markets Partners LLP will arrange the sale if it goes ahead, with Needham & Co. and Piper Sandler & Co. as joint bookrunners.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>",Once 'green' plug-in hybrid cars suddenly look like dinosaurs in Europe,"By Nick Carey and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Remember when plug-in hybrid cars were the go-to technology for the climate-conscious driver? Turns out, they're not good for the environment, according to some experts, and they could be phased out by carmakers in the face of tougher European rules.
EU policy plans for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), which contain an electric battery and a combustion engine, could mean the ""transition"" technology has a shorter lifespan than envisaged by some leading automakers.
Draft green finance regulations would ban manufacturers from labelling them as ""sustainable investments"" beyond 2025, potentially deterring investors. Meanwhile planned rules on emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxides could increase the cost of producing these cars. 
The aim of such reforms is to speed the transit to fully-electric vehicles and meet climate goals. Yet they would mark a shift from existing EU policies, such as CO2 standards, which have treated hybrids on a par with all-electric cars and helped spur the auto industry to invest tens of billions of euros in the technology.
Some carmakers had envisaged selling hybrids until at least the end of this decade as a bridge to fully battery electric vehicles (BEVs) - although their shift away from the technology looks to be underway.
An analysis of car production plans in Europe through to 2028 compiled for Reuters by AutoForecast Solutions (AFS), which tracks industry production plans, shows only 28 PHEV models versus 86 BEV models. That is a turnaround for an industry where PHEV models on the market have outnumbered BEV models every year since 2015, often significantly. 
Now some carmakers fear the EU could prematurely cut short that transition. They warn upcoming rules could make it hard to sell PHEVs in European markets in just a few years' time, despite consumer concerns about the range of fully electric cars and a lack of charging infrastructure.
""It's crazy to do this by 2025 because effectively you kill demand today,"" said Adrian Hallmark, CEO of British luxury carmaker Bentley, a unit of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), referring to proposals to not classify PHEVs as sustainable investments. He plans to sell PHEVs until 2030 before going all-electric.
""For most people, a battery electric car is not yet practical,"" he told Reuters.
A European Commission official declined to comment on the green finance rules specifically, but said its policies were ""technology neutral"", adding that PHEVs were ""a transition technology towards zero-emission mobility"". To reach an overall climate neutrality target in 2050, nearly all cars on the roads must be zero emissions by that time, the Commission added.
The rules, which are still being drafted, come against the backdrop of a shift in the position of some leading environmental groups which are pushing to dispel PHEVs' green credentials and do away with their subsidies. 
One study, from the International Council on Clean Transportation last September, said PHEVs' fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are up to four times the level they are approved for because people do not charge them often enough. 
Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at European NGO Transport & Environment, said its own research showed that when driven in combustion-engine mode, hybrids' CO2 emissions were higher than conventional cars' - they're heavier than combustion-only cars so used more fuel. 
""From the perspective of environment and climate, today's plug-in hybrid technology is worse than what it is replacing.""
This is a change in the group's position from as recently as 2018, when it saw PHEVs as a transition technology.
'GREAT CONSUMER PRODUCT'
Carmakers say hybrids, used properly with electric as the primary power source and combustion as a back-up, emit far less than conventional cars. They add that PHEVs are a popular transitional choice for consumers who want greener travel.
PHEV sales in the EU more than trebled to 507,000 vehicles in 2020, almost as many as the nearly 539,000 all-electric vehicles sold. 
Gauging carmakers' investments on PHEVs is hard because they only announce broad ""electrification"" plans. Consultancy AlixPartners estimates carmakers and suppliers will invest $200 billion in electrification from 2020 to 2024.
German engineering specialists FEV estimates fitting a battery, motor and electronics to a combustion engine car to make a PHEV costs up to 4,000 euros ($4,700) per vehicle.
European automakers are dividing over whether to fight for PHEVs, or spend their financial and political capital accelerating the leap to fully electric vehicles and pushing for better charging infrastructure across the continent.
Stephan Neugebauer, chairman of the European Green Vehicles Initiative Association, told Reuters technology improvements will mean future PHEVs rely less on their combustion engines, making them fit for the green transition over the next decade and even beyond.
""Will all customers buy battery electric vehicles in 10 years, or nine years? We don't think so,"" said Neugebauer, who is also BMW's director of global research cooperation. 
""Why? Because sometimes you have to make a long-distance trip, you go on holidays, you have to pull a trailer. And for this, you need public charging infrastructure. And this will still be a critical issue.""
BMW and  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), which have not set a date for going all-electric, are among the companies firmly in the hybrids camp. 
BMW boss Oliver Zipse said last month that they were ""a great consumer product"" and there would be a market for them even without subsidies. Renault (PA:RENA) CEO Luca de Meo said in February that PHEVs ""will be part of the landscape for the next 10 years easily"" and were more profitable than conventional cars.
Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson told Reuters: ""It's a bit disappointing they (Brussels policymakers) don't see the value of a plug-in hybrid"". But he said his company, which aims to be all-electric by 2030, was more focused on pushing the EU to make member states invest heavily in charging infrastructure.
""If we in the car industry invest in electric cars, and do that very rapidly, I think our credibility to ask for investments in the charging network increases,"" he said. 
'THE LIMIT OF WHAT'S ACHIEVABLE'
The European Commission is due to propose at least a dozen pieces of legislation to slash emissions across all sectors this year. 
Current drafts of the EU's sustainable finance taxonomy, a list of economic activities that from next year will determine what can be marketed as a sustainable investment, exclude manufacturing of PHEVs from 2026.
That could deter the army of investors seeking assets with green credentials. It could also potentially restrict public funding, if governments moved to align their spending with the taxonomy.
While many countries still subsidise PHEVs, the Netherlands scaled back tax breaks for them in 2016. By 2020, eight times as many BEVs were sold in the country as PHEVs, compared with four times as many PHEVs as BEVs four years before, showing how government policy on vehicle technology can have a major effect on consumer behaviour.
A consortium of researchers, commissioned by the EU and known as CLOVE, this month recommended that so-called Euro 7 rules should tighten car emission limits for pollutants including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide from 2025. Its recommendations are not binding, but aim to inform the European Commission's proposals, due later this year.
Transport & Environment, part of the Commission's expert group working on the standards, said the proposals would force carmakers to fit PHEVs with expensive technology to curb emissions from their combustion engines.
Hildegard Mueller, president of German auto industry association VDA, said the proposals were ""at the limit of what is technologically achievable"". 
""We still have to be very careful that the internal combustion engine is not made impossible by Euro 7,"" she said.

Its shares rocketed 15% higher while shares of LG Chem also rose, climbing 1%.
The row had threatened a $2.6 billion Georgia plant that SK is building to supply Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and is seen as key to the growing industry.
SK had vowed last month to walk away from the Georgia plant if a decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission decision that favoured LG Chem was not overturned.
The settlement will ""enable us to accelerate the construction of the Georgia, U.S. plant and actively promote additional investment and cooperation in line with the development of the U.S. and global electric vehicle (EV) industry,"" SK Innovation CEO Kim Jun said in a message to employees seen by Reuters.
The U.S. market is important for both firms as Chinese battery makers such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) don't have a foothold. Korean firms have also found it difficult to gain ground in China - the world's biggest market for electric vehicles - as Beijing has pushed policies to support domestic manufacturers.
""The U.S. EV market is considered the place where South Korean EV battery makers have the best shot for sustainable growth in the future,"" said Kang Dong-jin, analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the settlement was ""a win for American workers and the American auto industry."" Both Ford and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) also welcomed the agreement.
Volkswagen is a big client for both Korean battery makers and analysts said their longer-term prospects will hinge in part on how they respond to the German automaker's decision last month to move the bulk of its cars to a new unified prismatic battery and away from the pouch-style battery they specialise in.
SK's main clients are Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor Co, while LG has a more diversified client base, supplying both those automakers but also General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, analysts say. 
LG has said it plans to invest more than $4.5 billion in the United States to meet growing EV demand and is considering building a second battery joint venture in Tennessee with GM.

""We will play an active role in successfully expanding the supply of batteries and electric vehicles through bold and preemptive investments,"" LG Energy Solution President Kim Jong-Hyun said in a message to employees.

1239,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 02:04AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Caution Ahead of Action-Packed Week,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Monday, in cautious trading ahead of a week which sees the start of the U.S. earnings season as well as a deluge of important economic data.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%. 
The DAX and STOXX 600 have both hit all-time highs in recent weeks as the global economic recovery from Covid-19 continues to pick up the pace.  The CAC 40 meanwhile is at a 20-year high.
The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, is at an “inflection point”, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in an interview on Sunday, with stronger growth and hiring ahead thanks to the vaccine rollout and powerful policy support. However, a resurgence of the virus is still a serious risk, Powell added. U.S. coronavirus cases bottomed nearly a month ago and have edged up steadily since then.
Overnight, India reported a record number of Covid-19 infections, overtaking Brazil to become the second-most affected country globally by the coronavirus.
Back in Europe, beer gardens, restaurants with outdoor eating and the likes of hair salons are set to reopen across England on Monday for the first time in almost four months. By contrast, the Dutch government said a night-time curfew and other restrictions would remain for at least another fortnight as daily infections rose to a two-week high.
Wall Street kicks off its first-quarter earnings season this week, with the banking giants Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) scheduled to report on Wednesday.
Investors will be looking to see if the companies can justify their sky-high valuations. Data from Refinitiv points to S&P 500 firms recording a 25% jump in profit from a year earlier, which would be the strongest performance for the quarter since 2018.
Economic data will also be closely watched this week, with U.S. March inflation and retail sales both seen surging. There will also be a slew of Chinese data released throughout the week, culminating in the closely-watched first-quarter GDP number on Friday, while in Europe the German ZEW economic sentiment indicator is the highlight.  
Oil prices drifted lower Monday, with talks between Iran and world powers on resuscitating a 2015 nuclear accord set to continue this week. These discussions could result in the member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel being allowed once more to supply crude to the global market.
Oil’s strong start to the year has slowed of late as a surge in Covid-19 cases, particularly in Europe, India and Brazil, raised concerns about the outlook for near-term fuel demand. The OPEC+ alliance also agreed to add more barrels from May, and that’s before the Iranian position is confirmed.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $59.03 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $62.63. Both contracts are down over 9% over the last month.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,739.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1890.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Monday morning, as investors continue to digest the implications of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.'s (HK:9988) record antitrust fine.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.03% by 11:14 PM ET (3:14 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.44%.
China slapped Alibaba with the CNY18 billion ($2.75 billion) fine, amounting to about 12% of Alibaba’s fiscal 2020 net income, on Saturday.
However, some investors said that the decision was already priced in, with Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares rising 7.80%.
“Ever since the Ant IPO was canceled and with the antitrust laws in the pipeline, the market has expected that Alibaba would pay a price... I think it’s good for the share price now that the news has been delivered and it is cleared up at last,” Wealthy Securities managing director Louis Tse told Reuters.
Meanwhile, a slew of Chinese data is due out throughout the week, starting with trade data, including exports, imports and trade balance, on Tuesday and the first-quarter GDP, industrial production and fixed asset investment data on Friday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.48%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.55%, South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.02% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.40%.
Although the global economic recovery from COVID-19 continues to pick up the pace, policymakers warned that they need to see further signs of progress ahead of withdrawing the unprecedented support measures currently in place.
The U.S. economy is at an “inflection point” with stronger growth and hiring ahead thanks to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and powerful policy support, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in an interview on Sunday, where he also warned that a resurgence of COVID-19 remains the principal risk to the economy.
Powell will also speak at the Economic Club of Washington’s moderated Q&A event taking place on Wednesday.
“The Fed is going to be more concerned about the labor market,” Oxford Economics senior economist Sian Fenner told Bloomberg, but added that “definitely inflation’s not spiraling out of control.”
Inflationary risks also remain on investors’ minds as three, 10 and 30-year Treasuries go under the hammer later in the day. The benchmark 10-year yields edged higher on Monday, extending Friday’s gains after the better-than-expected U.S. producer-price index earlier that day.
In Asia-Pacific, rates on Australian 10-year debt jumped past 1.8%.
The U.S. will also release further data throughout the week, starting with the consumer price index on Tuesday, the Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday, and retail sales as well as industrial production data on Thursday."
1241,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2021 10:55PM ET</span>","Corporate leaders plan new push on U.S. voting rights, will reconsider campaign donations","By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Most CEOs on a call to discuss a new push against U.S. state voting restrictions said in a poll they will reassess donating to candidates who fail to support voting rights, while many will consider holding back investments in states that restrict voting access, according to people familiar with the matter.
Some business executives are putting together a new statement calling for the protection of U.S. voting rights, the latest corporate backlash against moves by Republican politicians to change election rules in Georgia and other states, the sources said.
About 100 chief executive officers, investors, lawyers and corporate directors participated in a private Zoom call on Saturday organized by Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld to discuss a new response to Georgia's election law and voting restrictions contemplated by other states such as Texas and Arizona, according to the sources.
All CEOs who participated in a poll during the call agreed they will re-evaluate political donations to candidates based on their track records on voting rights, while 48% said they might reconsider or reduce investments in states that restrict access to voting. Some one-quarter of CEOs refrained from voting on several questions in the poll.
Georgia's decision last month to strengthen identification requirements for absentee ballots and make it a misdemeanor to offer food and water to voters waiting in line, among other changes, prompted many U.S. companies, including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co, to issue statements criticizing the law.
Major League Baseball pulled this year's All-Star Game from Atlanta to protest the restrictions.
Republican officials, including U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, criticized the companies for their response, accusing them of wading too much into politics.
Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp says the law is “another step to making our elections fair and secure.”
But the measure has been slammed by Democratic President Joe Biden and faces legal challenges from civil rights groups that contend it is aimed at suppressing voting among Blacks and other racial minorities in a state that went for Biden in last November's election and elected two Democratic U.S. senators in January.
Former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have made baseless allegations that he lost the November election because of widespread voter fraud, claims that multiple courts across the country rejected.
On the invitation-only call, former  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault and Merck & Co CEO Kenneth Frazier said they were looking to gather support to back a new statement pushing back against the wave of new restrictive voting-rights bills, one of the sources said.
Some participants in the call signed up to the new statement during the call.
Participants noted that the proposed laws disproportionately targeted low-income areas, and that any civil unrest or attack on U.S. democracy could derail potential economic growth. 

""We as business leaders should be much stronger on not allowing people to undermine the 2020 election. The integrity of the system is integral,"" Reid Hoffman, co-founder of professional networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), said on the call.

Investing.com – Share in  SK Innovation  Co. Ltd. (KS:096770) roared back into the double digits after it settled a KRW2 trillion ($1.78 billion) electric-vehicle (EV) battery technology spat with compatriot  LG Chemicals  (KS:051910).
SK Innovation shares soared 13.87% to KRW271,000 ($241.5) by 9:34 PM ET (1:34 AM GMT), after soaring up to 16.6% earlier in the session They had fallen 19.7% since Feb. 11, when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in LG Chem’s favor on the dispute.
LG Chem shares rose 1.85% to KRW827,000, after rising up to 4.1% earlier in the session. The KOSPI index inched up 0.09%.
As part of the settlement reached over the weekend, LG Chem arm LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation agreed to drop all litigation both in the U.S. and South Korea, in addition to not suing each other for the next ten years.
The dispute had threatened the EV plans of companies such as  Ford Motor Co  . (NYSE:F) and  Volkswagen AG  (DE:VOWG). Ford said in a statement on Sunday that it was pleased the pair have resolved their differences, and that the truce allowed it to focus on delivering EVs for retail and fleet customers."
1243,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2021 07:46PM ET</span>",Analysis: Chinese tech start-ups pull IPO plans as Beijing tightens scrutiny,"By Samuel Shen and Scott Murdoch
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A growing number of Chinese tech start-ups are cancelling plans to list on Nasdaq-style markets at home with some eyeing Hong Kong share sales instead, as regulators tighten scrutiny of IPO applicants after the halting of Ant Group's $37 billion float.
Over 100 companies have voluntarily withdrawn applications to list on Shanghai's STAR Market and Shenzhen's ChiNext since Ant's termination of its initial public offering (IPO) in November, according to Reuters review of exchange filings. 
The unprecedented withdrawals come against the backdrop of sharply intensified grilling of listing prospects by regulators, leading to IPO delays, outright rejection or even penalties, say bankers and company executives.
The scramble to withdraw IPO applications raises questions over the quality of China's IPOs and robustness of due diligence done by their underwriters.
The trend, if it continues, would threaten China's ambition to compete with global listing venues such as Hong Kong and New York at a time when Beijing is also considering establishing a new bourse to attract overseas-listed firms.
China launched STAR nearly two years ago with a U.S.-style registration and disclosure-based IPO regime in a bid to dissuade its tech start-ups from tapping offshore bourses, and to fast-track listings. The reform extended to ChiNext last year. 
But Ant's IPO, which was suspended after regulators expressed concerns about some parts of its businesses, shifted the watchdog's attention towards risk control, said a banker with direct knowledge of regulators' thinking.
""Regulators are demanding more stringent due diligence from underwriters,"" said the banker, who declined to be identified.
Sponsors, or the lead IPO underwriters, are withdrawing some applications for fear of being punished, he said, as ""no project is impeccable.""
The STAR Market became the world's fourth most popular listing venue in 2020, with IPOs raising $20 billion. Its ranking fell to the 7th in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
""There's a tech bubble in China,"" said Yiming Feng, partner at Atom Venture Capital. ""It's time for a clean-up."" 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), STAR and ChiNext didn't respond to Reuters request for comment.
PRIVATE FUNDING 
DaoCloud, a Shanghai-based cloud computing start-up, had planned a STAR IPO this year, but is now considering a Hong Kong listing instead, deterred by the likelihood of approval delays.
IPO applicants ""now face a lot of regulatory uncertainty,"" said Roby Chen, DaoClould's founder. ""So we need a plan B.""
For others with no immediate plans for an overseas listing, the priority is to seek fresh private funding.
Several artificial intelligence unicorns, start-ups valued at $1 billion or above, ""have come to me with their business plans, and seek financing,"" said Abraham Zhang, chairman of Shenzhen-based venture capital firm China Europe Capital.
Loss-making tech unicorns that have shelved their listing plans include Yitu Ltd, Unisound AI Technology Co and Shenzhen Royole Technologies Co, according to exchange data.
Ming Liao, founding partner of Beijing-based Prospect Avenue Capital, said many Chinese start-ups now face a bumpy road towards IPOs, with some of them struggling to ""demonstrate their potential for sustainable growth.""
SICK COMPANIES
CSRC Chairman Yi Huiman last month urged underwriters to tighten scrutiny of IPO candidates, vowing to punish those trying to bring ""sick"" firms to the market.
Bankers say bourses are now launching on-site inspections, poring over IPO filings and bombarding sponsors with loads of questions - practices that were not common earlier. 
In addition, senior executives of a start-up must disclose their personal bank accounts and explain large transactions.
As a result, the average waiting time has blown out from six months to 12, creating a backlog of over 100 companies waiting to list on STAR, said a banker. 
The new IPO system lured many companies seeking a swift listing, and now, ""regulators are using relentless attention to details and on-site inspections to intimidate them away,"" said an investment banker who has several IPO deals stuck. 

""It defies the purpose of the IPO reform, which is to give the market the power to evaluate companies.""

Alongside formal discussions on a technical level between the bank and FINMA, the watchdog's head Mark Branson personally discussed the risks with outgoing Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner and Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein during a meeting on an unspecified date, the newspaper reported, citing information it had obtained.
FINMA and Credit Suisse declined to comment to Reuters. 
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within the course of one month.
Credit Suisse's asset management unit was last month forced to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the British firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency. The bank has since suspended the funds' managers and changed the head of its asset management unit.
Huge losses at U.S. investment fund Archegos this month also prompted Credit Suisse to replace its heads of investment banking and of compliance and risk after it said it would book a $4.7 billion first-quarter charge from its exposure to the stricken firm.
SonntagsZeitung on Sunday reported that Archegos founder Bill Hwang could have drawn up to $10 billion worth of credit from Credit Suisse, citing information from an internal source that the bank had assumed nine-fold leverage on the exposure.

Credit Suisse and Archegos declined to comment to Reuters on the matter.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Two proxy advisory firms said shareholders of Nam Tai Property should vote for several directors nominated by IsZo Capital to join the China-based real estate company's six-member board.
New York-based IsZo is Nam Tai's third-largest investor after Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd, which owns 24% and Peter Kellogg (NYSE:K) which owns 19%.
Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS) recommended shareholders elect three of IsZo's six nominees while Glass, Lewis and Co. recommended they elect two of IsZo's nominees.
ISS criticized a lack of independence at the board level saying that four of six incumbent directors breached their fiduciary duty in the context of an improper private placement with Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. 
A court in March concluded that the placement represented a breach of fiduciary duty by certain directors. On April 7, Nam Tai said it is appealing the judgment, a spokesman said.
""Removing three incumbent directors and adding three dissident nominees should be sufficient to improve independent oversight of the board,"" the report said.
ISS said shareholders might ""reasonably"" choose to remove all four directors who were deemed to have breached their fiduciary duty. 
Glass, Lewis wrote IsZo ""provided sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims regarding poor performance and corporate governance.""
Shareholders will vote at a special meeting scheduled for April 26.
ISS recommends shareholders elect Michael Cricenti, Bo Hu, and Louis Leung and remove directors Aiping Lyu, Si Zong Wu and Wing Yan Lo. Glass, Lewis recommends for the election of Hu and Leung from IsZo's slate and for the removal of Wu and Lo.
Last year, IsZo, which owns roughly 13% of the nearly $455 million real estate company, nominated six directors. The firm accused Nam Tai's board of backing a questionable acquisition strategy and having no credible plan to boost the company's share price. 
IsZo pushed last year for a special meeting and criticized the appointment of three Kaisa-affiliated executives to the roles of executive chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer. 
In October, Nam Tai announced that it had raised $170 million through a private placement with Kaisa and a financial group based in Hong Kong.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A majority of residents of European cities support a Europe-wide phaseout of combustion engine car sales from 2030 to reduce planet-warming emissions, a YouGov poll conducted on behalf of environmental campaigners said on Monday.
Of 10,050 survey respondents, 63% said they supported the idea that after 2030, only emission-free cars should be sold in Europe. 
The online opinion poll surveyed people last month in 15 cities including London, Warsaw and Budapest, with an average of 29% opposing the idea of ending petrol and diesel car sales, while 8% said they did not know.
In all cities, a majority of respondents - ranging from 51% in Antwerp and Berlin, to 77% in Rome - supported a ban.
Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E), which commissioned the poll, urged the European Commission to include an EU-wide end date for combustion car sales in climate policy proposals due in June.
""People in cities are the most exposed to toxic levels of air pollution, and they don’t want internal combustion engines to be sold for any longer than is necessary,"" T&E's senior vehicles director Julia Poliscanova said. 
The Commission said in September it would assess ""at what point in time internal combustion engines in cars should stop coming to the market"" to deliver the EU's 2030 emissions-cutting target.
The EU executive will this year propose tougher emissions limits for cars, plus legislation to expand electric charging infrastructure, although a spokesman said its proposals for cleaner transport will be ""technology-neutral"".
EU sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars almost trebled to more than 1 million vehicles in 2020, or more than 10% of overall sales.
Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and six other countries last month urged the Commission to set an EU-wide phaseout date for combustion car sales.
""That date has to be aligned with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050,"" an EU diplomat from one of the countries said. 
""If you take into account the lifetime of cars, then you have to stop adding new (combustion engine) cars to the market in 2030.""

Britain, which is no longer an EU member, will ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in 2030.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean authorities on Sunday backed the country's widespread use of the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac after China's top disease official appeared to make conflicting statements about its efficacy. 
Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday that the country was considering mixing COVID-19 vaccines since currently available vaccines ""don't have very high rates of protection.""
He later said in an interview with state media that his comments were ""completely misunderstood."" 
Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.
The COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac was found to be just over 50% effective in reducing infection in Brazilian clinical trials. A real-world study of vaccination and contagion data by the University of Chile suggested last week the vaccine was 54% effective in reducing infection. 
Chile paid $3.5 million to host a clinical trial of the vaccine and has also ordered 60 million doses to be administered to its 18 million-strong population over three years.
The country has largely relied on the Sinovac vaccine, along with smaller numbers of Pfizer's equivalent drug, to roll out one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns, so far inoculating 4.6 million people with two doses and 7.2 million with one. 
Chile also signed deals for the supply of vaccines from western drugmakers Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) but these are yet to materialise because of supply bottlenecks. 
On Sunday, Chilean science minister Andres Couve said it was important to focus on the data and the vaccine's effectiveness in reducing illness that required medical treatment or being hospitalized or dying, which it achieved in the Brazilian study in 83.7% and 100% of cases respectively.
He said Chile's health ministry will shortly publish a real world study on the effectiveness of both vaccines rolled out in its population and appealed to Chileans to continue to participate in the vaccination programme.
Heriberto Garcia, director of Chile's Public Health Institute which greenlighted CoronaVac's emergency roll-out, said people should not pay attention to headlines.

""The University of Chile study and the study the health ministry will release say the same thing: the number of people who fall ill and are hospitalized has decreased,"" he told local newspaper La Tercera. ""We are going down the right path.""

Cameron, who was prime minister from 2010 to 2016, appointed the Australian banker as an adviser when he was in Downing Street. After leaving office, Cameron in turn became an adviser to Greensill's now-insolvent finance firm. 
The Financial Times and Sunday Times newspapers have reported that Cameron contacted ministers directly to lobby on behalf of Greensill Capital, including sending texts to finance minister Rishi Sunak and arranging a private drink between Greensill and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.
Britain's Treasury has said that the former prime minister contacted Sunak and two other ministers in the department to ask if Greensill could access the government's COVID-19 loan schemes.
In his first comments on the row, Cameron said that in his representations to government he was breaking no codes of conduct and no government rules.
Ultimately the outcome of the discussions on Greensill's proposals regarding the loan were not taken up, he said, and therefore his interventions did not lead to a change in the government's approach.
""However, I have reflected on this at length,"" he said in a statement to the Press Association news agency.

""There are important lessons to be learnt. As a former Prime Minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation.""

Brussels and Rome have been in negotiations for months over Italy's plan to restructure the airline through the launch of a new, state-owned company called ITA.
The new carrier needs the EU's approval for the government injection of 3 billion euros before it can start operating, but risks missing the summer season as talks are dragging on.
""I think next week will be crucial,"" Giorgetti said, adding the discussion with EU's competition unit had been difficult.
""There is a tug-of-war with Brussels ... in the name of competition, the EU wants (ITA) to free up as many (airport) slots as possible, but this is not in the interest of the new company,"" he said during a political debate on the internet.
The EU is requesting ITA gives up as much as half of its airport slots at Milan city airport, drops the brand Alitalia and starts without the handling and the maintenance divisions of the old carrier have triggered criticism in Italy, with trade unions claiming the EU was much tougher with Alitalia than with Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.

""Italy has not bent to the EU ... this is why talks have dragged on,"" Giorgetti said, acknowledging, however, that Alitalia was loss-making in 2019 while Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were profitable when they were hit by the coronavirus crisis.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean battery makers LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation Co agreed on Sunday to settle disputes over electric-vehicle (EV) battery technology, avoiding a potential setback for U.S. EV ambitions.
The settlement after marathon talks by affiliates of two of South Korea's biggest conglomerates was announced just hours before a Sunday night deadline for President Joe Biden's administration to decide whether to take the rare step of reversing a U.S. International Trade Commission decision (ITC).
In a statement, Biden called the settlement ""a win for American workers and the American auto industry.... We need a strong, diversified and resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain"".
The core dispute had threatened the EV plans of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), as well as a Georgia plant that is key to the growing industry.
The resolution is also a win for Biden, who has made boosting EVs and U.S. battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending $174 billion to hike their sales and expand charging infrastructure. 
SK Innovation agreed to pay LG Energy Solution, a wholly owned subsidiary of LG Chem Ltd, 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) - 500 billion won each this year and next, and royalties for at least six years.
""We expect our payment plan will not be financially burdensome,"" an SK Innovation official told Reuters. 
The companies agreed to drop all litigation in the United States and South Korea and not to raise further lawsuits against each other for 10 years. 
""The two companies now can coexist in the global market and compete in good faith,"" LG Energy Solution said in a statement. SK said it would invest actively both in South Korea and abroad now that uncertainties for its EV battery business in the United States have been cleared up. 
The U.S. Office of U.S. Trade Representative had faced a Sunday night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a U.S. International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal.
The Biden administration, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford had been pushing the Korean companies to settle.
DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICAN LOBBYING FROM GEORGIA
Trade Representative Katherine Tai was personally involved in the settlement discussions, urging the companies to come to a resolution, the sources said. 
""I congratulate both companies for working through their significant differences to resolve this dispute, which builds confidence in their reliability and responsibility as suppliers to the U.S. auto industry,"" Tai said in a statement after LG and SK announced the settlement. 
""We are pleased the two battery suppliers at the center of this recent trade dispute have come together and solved their differences,"" Volkswagen said in a statement on Sunday.
“We are pleased that SK Innovation and LG Energy Solution have settled their differences,"" Ford said in a statement. 
BITTER DISPUTE
In the bitter two-year dispute, LG lost to SK in a bid for VW orders, then accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. LG filed a complaint against SK in 2019, and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration.
The ITC in February sided with LG after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology. It issued a 10-year-import ban but allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford's EV F-150 program for four years, and VW's North American EVs for two years.
In March, SK vowed to walk away from the $2.6 billion Georgia battery plant, which is under construction, if the ITC decision was not overturned. LG said in March it could handle the battery needs of automakers if SK abandoned the Georgia plant.
Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could ""reduce U.S. battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles.""
Georgia's two newly elected Democratic U.S. senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, have repeatedly pressed the South Korean companies to reach agreement. The state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, had urged Biden to intervene.
SK's plant in the town of Commerce, 110 km (70 miles) northeast of Atlanta, will employ nearly 2,600, the largest foreign investment in the state's history at nearly $2.6 billion, Kemp said. ""Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.""
LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and is close to announcing plans to build a $2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters.

In March, LG announced $4.5 billion investment plans for its U.S. battery production business over the next four years.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",After dire year England's shops hope for end-of-lockdown shopping spree,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - After more than three months of enforced closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-essential stores in England reopen their doors on Monday, hoping that the escape from lockdown will fuel a trading boom.
Industry lobby group, the British Retail Consortium, estimates UK stores have lost 27 billion pounds ($37 billion) in sales over three lockdowns, while 67,000 retail jobs were shed in 2020 alone.
Some 17,532 chain store outlets vanished from high streets, shopping centres and retail parks across the UK last year, according to data compiled by researcher the Local Data Company for accountancy firm PwC.
But with more than half of the UK's adult population having received at least one of the vaccine's two doses, analysts do not think shoppers will hold back.
Market researcher Kantar is forecasting that consumers will spend 3.9 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) on the high street in the first week of reopening.
""There was definitely a bounce at the end of the lockdown last year (in June), I would be surprised if the same thing didn't happen again,"" Simon Wolfson, CEO of fashion retailer Next, told Reuters.
Many shopping areas will look very different from their pre-pandemic state. A raft of chains, including fashion retailers Topshop, Topman, Burton, Oasis and Laura Ashley, which had been fixtures for decades, will not be there - high profile casualties of a crisis that has hammered the sector.
Eight John Lewis department stores will not reopen and Debenhams stores will only reopen to hold final closing sales.
England's non-essential stores have been closed since Jan. 4 when Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a third lockdown to stem a surge in COVID-19 cases.
Non-essential retail will also reopen in Wales on Monday, though Scotland's shops will have to wait until at least April 26. Northern Ireland does not have a date yet.
PENT-UP DEMAND
Getting shoppers spending again is key to Britain's recovery after official data last month showed that 2020 was the worst year for its economy in more than three centuries.
Analysts reckon the customer bounce-back could be more pronounced than the one last June.
""Lockdowns clearly improve the average family P&L, and many will be thinking that they won’t be going on an overseas holiday this year. Shoppers have money to spend, and most people haven’t shopped fashion for nearly two years,"" said analysts at Peel Hunt.
Roger Whiteside, CEO of baker Greggs, reckons the sector will benefit from pent-up demand.
While Greggs stores were allowed to trade through the latest lockdown, he is hoping for a boost to high street footfall from the relaxation in restrictions.
""There'll be queues outside the shops that people can't access easily online, so Primark's a good example,"" he said.
To help the sector cope with the challenge of social distancing regulations, which are scheduled to remain in place until June 21, the government is allowing extended opening hours. It said last month that shops can open until 10 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",Record penalty for Ma's Alibaba marks tumultuous stretch for its founder,"By Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - Once seemingly untouchable,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) founder Jack Ma has endured a tumultuous run that saw his Chinese e-commerce giant hit with a record 18 billion yuan ($2.75 billion) antitrust fine on Saturday, resolving one key uncertainty even as others persist for himself and his business empire.
The reversal of fortune for the 56-year-old Ma, who has all-but-disappeared from public view since an October speech blasting China's regulatory system, has been striking for an entrepreneur whose transformation of commerce in China - and his relentless optimism - commanded cult-like reverence. 
Ma, who stepped down from Alibaba in 2019 but looms large in the corporate psyche and in the eyes of investors, had revelled in pushing boundaries with audacious statements, taking a high profile even as most Chinese peers kept their heads down. 
Friends in high places, as well as pride in Alibaba's success, had protected Ma, sources have said.
That was until his Shanghai speech triggered a backlash that led to the scuppering of a blockbuster $37 billion IPO for Alibaba financial technology affiliate Ant Group, as well as a clampdown by authorities on the e-commerce giant itself and the wider ""platform economy"", which continues to reverberate.
Ant, whose rapid growth and freewheeling lending practices drew regulatory concern about financial risk, remains subject to an enforced restructuring that is expected to rein in some of its most profitable businesses and slash its valuation.
""Entrepreneurship has to be disruptive. But being provocative to the government has its limits,"" said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based tech consultancy BDA China and author of a book on Alibaba and Ma. 
Saturday's settlement, he said, ""should draw a line"" under the matter for Alibaba.] 
""But for Ant and Jack, there's no line drawn yet,"" he said.
Alibaba declined to comment on Ma, and his foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
CONSPICUOUS ABSENCE
Ma's absence from public view became conspicuous until he surfaced for the first time in three months in late January, speaking to a group of teachers by video, which sent Alibaba shares surging. He has continued to keep an extremely low profile.
""He's playing a lot of golf and improving his handicap,"" said one person who knows him.
A former English teacher, Ma co-founded Alibaba in 1999 from a shared apartment in the eastern city of Hangzhou, ultimately building a colossus that spans e-commerce, financial services, cloud computing and even supermarkets, making him China's most famous businessman.
He was also China's richest, until the clampdown knocked him back to fourth place on the Hurun Global Rich List published in March, although Ma and his family's wealth still grew last year by 22% to 360 billion yuan, according to the list.
As of last July, he owned 4.8% of Alibaba. 
In 2018, Ma was revealed to be a Communist Party member by its official newspaper, debunking a public assumption that he was politically unattached. 
'ARROGANCE DISCOUNT'
Ma has often been described in Chinese media as a source of national pride and even legend. His global prominence made him an almost-diplomatic figure. Countless books have been published on Alibaba's founding and Ma's business tactics.
Ma-isms such as ""Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine"", are common in Chinese business circles. In Hangzhou, small firms have been known to set up altars adorned with images of Ma to bring good fortune.
But in a February snub, Ma was left off a list of Chinese entrepreneurial leaders published by state media.
Franklin Chu, president of Sage Capital in Rye, New York, noted that Alibaba shares are trading at a 30% discount to their 52-week high.
""I call this the 'Jack Ma arrogance discount,' combined with the recent round of China-bashing coming out of Washington,"" he said.
Alibaba, he said, ""needs to work hard to re-establish an accommodative relationship with its regulatory handlers.""
Since stepping back from the company, Ma has sought to focus his time on philanthropy and education, including his charitable trust, the Jack Ma Foundation, and two schools in Hangzhou.
Ma was an active conference participant, making at least 12 appearances in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic began. In March 2020, he opened a Twitter account - the platform is blocked in China - which mainly tweeted about his foundation's COVID-19 prevention efforts. Its last tweet was on Oct. 10.
""It's crucial for Chinese entrepreneurs to be low-key. Don't speak casually. And don't say anything wrong,"" Edward Chen, chairman of Shanghai-based fintech consultancy China Rising Group, said in a social media video post.
""Prudence in words and action is the No. 1 priority so that Chinese entrepreneurs can live longer.""

The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency hit $61,222.22 on Saturday, its highest in nearly a month. It was slightly lower at $59,907 at 0500 GMT on Sunday. 
Bitcoin (BTC) is up 116% from the year's low of $27,734 on Jan. 4. It crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time on March 13, hitting a record $61,781.83 on Bitstamp exchange, just after U.S. President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package into law.
Justin d'Anethan, sales manager at digital asset company Diginex in Hong Kong, said investors had turned their attention to stock markets and other cryptocurrencies in the past couple of weeks, leaving Bitcoin idling in the upper 50-thousand dollar levels. 
""That changed just yesterday when we pierced through 60K. With miners not selling recently minted coins, on-exchange reserves hitting multi-year lows and an incessant stream of corporates, funds, large and small investors piling into BTC, we punched through,"" he said.
Bitcoin's stunning gains this year have been driven by its mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment, accompanied by the rush of retail cash into stocks, exchange-traded funds and other risky assets. 

It soared this year as major firms, such as BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), credit card giant Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), backed cryptocurrencies, while those such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) and MicroStrategy Inc invested in bitcoin.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa can ""break through"" Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine to some extent, a real-world data study in Israel found, though its prevalence in the country is low and the research has not been peer reviewed. 
The study, released on Saturday, compared almost 400 people who had tested positive for COVID-19, 14 days or more after they received one or two doses of the vaccine, against the same number of unvaccinated patients with the disease. It matched age and gender, among other characteristics. 
The South African variant, B.1.351, was found to make up about 1% of all the COVID-19 cases across all the people studied, according to the study by Tel Aviv University and Israel's largest healthcare provider, Clalit. 
But among patients who had received two doses of the vaccine, the variant's prevalence rate was eight times higher than those unvaccinated - 5.4% versus 0.7%. 
This suggests the vaccine is less effective against the South African variant, compared with the original coronavirus and a variant first identified in Britain that has come to comprise nearly all COVID-19 cases in Israel, the researchers said. 
""We found a disproportionately higher rate of the South African variant among people vaccinated with a second dose, compared to the unvaccinated group. This means that the South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccine's protection,"" said Tel Aviv University's Adi Stern.
The researchers cautioned, though, that the study only had a small sample size of people infected with the South African variant because of its rarity in Israel. 
They also said the research was not intended to deduce overall vaccine effectiveness against any variant, since it only looked at people who had already tested positive for COVID-19, not at overall infection rates. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours.
The companies said on April 1 that their vaccine was around 91% effective at preventing COVID-19, citing updated trial data that included participants inoculated for up to six months. 
In respect to the South African variant, they said that among a group of 800 study volunteers in South Africa, where B.1.351 is widespread, there were nine cases of COVID-19, all of which occurred among participants who got the placebo. Of those nine cases, six were among individuals infected with the South African variant.
Some previous studies have indicated that the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was less potent against the B.1.351 variant than against other variants of the coronavirus, but still offered a robust defence.
While the results of the study may cause concern, the low prevalence of the South African strain was encouraging, according to Stern. 
""Even if the South African variant does break through the vaccine's protection, it has not spread widely through the population,"" said Stern, adding that the British variant may be ""blocking"" the spread of the South African strain.

Almost 53% of Israel's 9.3 million population has received both Pfizer doses. Israel has largely reopened its economy in recent weeks while the pandemic appears to be receding, with infection rates, severe illness and hospitalizations dropping sharply. About a third of Israelis are below the age of 16, which means they are still not eligible for the shot.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) -China slapped a record 18 billion yuan ($2.75 billion) fine on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Saturday, after an anti-monopoly probe found the e-commerce giant had abused its dominant market position for several years.
The fine, about 4% of Alibaba's 2019 domestic revenues, comes amid a crackdown on technology conglomerates and indicates China's antitrust enforcement on internet platforms has entered a new era after years of laissez-faire approach. 
The Alibaba business empire has come under intense scrutiny in China since billionaire founder Jack Ma's stinging public criticism of the country's regulatory system in October.
A month later, authorities scuttled a planned $37 billion IPO by Ant Group, Alibaba's internet finance arm, which was set to be the world's biggest ever. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced its antitrust probe into the company in December.
While the fine brings Alibaba a step closer to resolving its antitrust woes, Ant still needs to agree to a regulatory-driven revamp that is expected to sharply cut its valuations and rein in some of its freewheeling businesses. 
""This penalty will be viewed as a closure to the anti-monopoly case for now by the market. It's indeed the highest profile anti-monopoly case in China,"" said Hong Hao, head of research BOCOM International in Hong Kong.
""The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time ... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation.""
The SAMR said it had determined that Alibaba, which is listed in New York and Hong Kong, had been ""abusing market dominance"" since 2015 by preventing its merchants from using other online e-commerce platforms.
The practice, which the SAMR has previously spelt out as illegal, violates China's antimonopoly law by hindering the free circulation of goods and infringing on the business interests of merchants, the regulator added. 
Besides imposing the fine, which ranks among the highest ever antitrust penalties globally, the regulator ordered Alibaba to make ""thorough rectifications"" to strengthen internal compliance and protect consumer rights.
Alibaba said in a statement that it accepts the penalty and ""will ensure its compliance with determination"". The company will hold a conference call on Monday to discuss the penalty.
""We will tackle it openly and work through it together,"" CEO Daniel Zhang said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters. ""Let's improve ourselves and start again together as one.""
The fine is more than double the $975 million paid in China by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, in 2015 for anticompetitive practices.
""There has been weakness in China's big tech stocks and I think this fine will be seen as a benchmark for any other penalties which could be applied to the other companies,"" said Louis Tse, managing director at Wealthy Securities in Hong Kong.
'CLEAR POLICY SIGNAL'
The hefty penalty on Alibaba also comes against the backdrop of regulators globally, including in the United States and Europe, carrying out tougher antitrust reviews of tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
With the fine on one of its most successful private enterprises, Beijing is making good on threats to clamp down on the ""platform economy"" and rein in the behemoths that play a dominant role in the country's consumer sector.
""What comes after Alibaba's fine is the likelihood that there will be damage to China's other internet giants,"" said Francis Lun, CEO of GEO Securities, Hong Kong.
""Their growth has been enormous, and the government has turned a blind eye and allowed them to carry out uncompetitive practices. They can no longer do that.""
China's big technology firms have been stepping up hiring of legal and compliance experts and setting aside funds for potential fines, amid the antitrust and data privacy crackdown by regulators, Reuters reported in February.
Chinese official media hailed the penalty imposed on Alibaba, saying it would set an example and bolster awareness about antimonopolistic practices and the need to adhere to related laws.
The fine has released a ""clear policy signal"", Shi Jianzhong, antitrust consultant committee member of the State Council and professor of China University of Political Science and Law, wrote in the state-backed Economic Times.
Wium Malan, an analyst at Propitious Research in Cape Town, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, echoed the sentiment, describing the fine as a ""clear statement of intent"".

For Alibaba, Malan said, the fine was ""affordable"" but that the market was still ""waiting to see what the ultimate impact would be from the Ant Group restructuring, which still leaves a lot of uncertainty"".

That would go beyond a four-month suspension agreed last month, and send a signal that Brussels is seeking compromise in a 16-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies.
""We have proposed suspending all mutual tariffs for six months in order to reach a negotiated solution,"" Dombrovskis told the news magazine.
""This would create a necessary breathing space for industries and workers on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he added.
In March, the two sides agreed on a four-month suspension covering all U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports and all EU duties on $4 billion of U.S. products, which resulted from long-running World Trade Organization cases over subsidies for planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Dombrovskis also said the EU would closely monitor U.S. President Joe Biden's ""Buy American"" laws which provide for U.S. public contracts to be awarded exclusively to American firms.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc reversed course on Friday and told an activist group it could present a shareholder proposal remotely for the company's May 1 annual meeting, in line with renewed guidance from the U.S. securities regulator.
Warren Buffett's insurance and investment company traditionally draws thousands to its extravagant annual meeting in Omaha but, like many top U.S. corporations during the coronavirus pandemic, had asked investors to log in to the meeting remotely instead of attending in person.
The shift to online has stymied many activist investor groups whose shareholder resolutions often animate the meetings, however. Some have been muted via the technology or told they could only present resolutions in person despite the health risks.
That was the case at Berkshire for As You Sow of Berkeley, California, which filed a measure calling for the company's subsidiaries to report on diversity and inclusion efforts, and was told it would have to send a representative to Los Angeles where some directors and staff would gather for the livestreamed webcast.
Asked about the situation on Friday, Berkshire Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg told Reuters via e-mail:
""We would have preferred that As You Sow present their proposal at the location of the shareholders meeting in Los Angeles. However, we will provide As You Sow an opportunity to provide a recording to be played at the meeting as a means of presenting their shareholder proposal.""
As You Sow welcomed the decision. The organization is ""unwilling to risk other people’s health, so we are relieved that the company changed course,"" President Danielle Fugere told Reuters.
When Berkshire Hathaway contacted the group, it cited new instructions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, As You Sow said.
As You Sow was among a group of activists and investors that on April 5 asked the SEC to extend last year's guidance to allow the virtual presentation of proposals, which a number of companies seemed to be prohibiting this year, in time for the 2021 springtime shareholder meeting season.
""From the standpoint of pandemic safety, it is not yet time to require proponents to appear personally,"" the letter stated. 
In a statement posted on its website on Friday, the SEC said that in light of COVID concerns, corporations were encouraged to ""provide shareholder proponents or their representatives with the ability to present their proposals through alternative means, such as by phone"" during the 2021 season.
The agency also said proponents who couldn't travel to meetings would have good cause to refile their proposals later.

Hamburg did not respond to questions about how it would be handling other shareholder groups.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 09:25PM ET</span>",Judge hands Amazon a setback in New York lawsuit over COVID-19 shortfalls,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Friday ruled against Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the company defends against New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit claiming it prioritized profit over worker safety during the COVID-19 pandemic at two New York City warehouses.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan granted James' request to return her lawsuit to a New York state court, and rejected Amazon's bid to move it to Brooklyn federal court, where the online retailer had sued James to stop her from suing.
James accused Amazon of ignoring its duty to take reasonable steps to protect workers from the coronavirus at a Staten Island fulfillment center and a Queens distribution center, and retaliating against workers who complained.
An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. Rakoff said he will explain the reasoning behind his two-paragraph order later.
""Amazon has forced its employees to work in unsafe conditions throughout this pandemic,"" James said in welcoming her lawsuit's move back to state court, ""where it belongs.""
While the ruling did not address the dispute's merits, it is a setback for Seattle-based Amazon, which accused James of overstepping her authority and said federal laws rather than New York's should govern workplace safety.
Amazon said both lawsuits belonged in the Brooklyn court because Queens and Staten Island are in that jurisdiction, and suing in different courts was wasteful.
James said Amazon had ""cut corners"" in protecting workers because doing more could threaten productivity, sales volume and profitability.
She said she had authority to enforce New York state law ""to promote proper business conduct and ensure that current and future Amazon employees have a safe and honest workplace.""
Her lawsuit seeks improved worker protections, and damages for two Amazon workers who allegedly faced retaliation.

One, Christian Smalls, was fired one year ago, purportedly for violating a paid quarantine when leading a protest over conditions at the Staten Island warehouse.
James sued Amazon on Feb. 16, four days after Amazon sued her. Amazon then moved James' lawsuit to federal court.

Hardware stocks, especially, have seen their shares soar since November in anticipation of increased IT spending. But the best is still yet to come.
Hardware stocks typically outperform the market in economic recoveries. Still, due to lower than usual spending last year, in 2021 hardware stocks are forecasted to skyrocket as survey after survey of IT leaders indicate a massive increase in spending.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 07:40PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: With stocks at record highs, investors look to upcoming earnings","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street is kicking off a crucial reporting season as U.S. companies provide quarterly results a year after the coronavirus pandemic crippled the economy and as investors look for reasons to support a stock market at record highs.
Results begin in earnest next week with major banks. Overall S&P 500 earnings are expected to have jumped 25% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
That would be the biggest quarterly gain since 2018, when tax cuts under former President Donald Trump drove a surge in profit growth.
Graphic: US earnings growth https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpewzqbpr/Pasted%20image%201617919685577.png
With the S&P 500 index at record highs, valuations are stretched heading into the season, leaving some investors looking to earnings for further support.
""We've seen earnings estimates go up, but... when you look at the market price as a multiple of those forward earnings, it has stayed pretty steadily at around 22 times,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.
""If we're going to see significant moves going forward, it's going to come from earnings.""
The S&P 500 was trading at 22.3 times forward earnings as of Friday compared with a long-term average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.
Early quarterly results have been strong. Strategists say that bodes well for the rest of the season, and it could be a sign that results may exceed already high expectations.
The 20 S&P 500 companies that reported earnings as of Thursday topped analyst estimates by 11% on average, said Nick Raich, chief executive of The Earnings Scout, an independent research firm. That is about 1.5 times the average for those companies over the last three years and about triple the longer-term average, he said.
Another positive sign is that estimates overall have been rising heading into the earnings period. Estimates typically drop ahead of a reporting period after companies give conservative outlooks.
At the start of March, analysts expected first-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 22%, based on Refinitiv data.
Still, some fear that investors will be disappointed after the sharp run up in earnings expectations, which could dent stock prices after a months-long rally led by economically sensitive groups including energy and financials.
Investors have bet that these stocks are the most likely to benefit from the reopening of the U.S. economy.
For all of 2021, S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to be 26.5% versus a decline of 12.6% last year.
One risk to future earnings is the threat of U.S. President Joe Biden's corporate tax hikes from their current 21%. A 28% tax rate would take 7.4% off S&P 500 companies' earnings per share, according to UBS.
BANKS UP FIRST
Two sectors to watch are financials and materials, McMillan said, noting: ""If businesses are starting to grow again, they're going to need to borrow money.""
Financials are expected to show one of the biggest earnings gains, up 75.6% year-on-year, while materials are seen up 45.4%.
Graphic: S&P 500 profit estimates by sector https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/nmopaangqpa/chart.png
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is due to report Wednesday, and results from other big banks are also due during the week. The banks are expected to produce astounding bottom-line profit increases from a year-ago as they release funds held aside for potential loan losses and perhaps report a record quarter for capital markets revenue.
Financials were one of the best performers in the first quarter, with the S&P financial index up 15%, while the energy sector led S&P 500 sector gains in the first quarter, rising 29%. Technology was one of the worst-performing sectors, rising just about 2% in the quarter.
Investors also may be looking to see whether ""stay-at-home"" companies and other technology-related names that performed well early in the pandemic can sustain their growth.
Technology shares in recent sessions have begun to outperform more economically focused shares.
Investors are optimistic companies will offer more guidance now after being reluctant give projections at the start of the pandemic.

""We'll probably see more companies giving outlooks,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""That will give the market a lot of confidence.""

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 06:00PM ET</span>",Analysis-Amazon's win in union fight shows harsh realities facing labor movement,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Mike Spector
(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc's fierce resistance to unionization, skepticism among workers that organizing could get them a better deal and decisions on election parameters all contributed to the apparently lopsided defeat of a labor drive at the company's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, people close to the events said.
A vote by workers on whether to unionize failed on Friday by a more than 2-to-1 margin in a major win for the world's largest online retailer. The union plans to challenge the results based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s conduct during the election.
Union leaders had hoped the campaign just outside Birmingham would create Amazon's first organized workplace in the country and spark a new era of worker activism. Instead, it has illustrated the continued challenges facing the labor movement.
Officials at the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) argued that Amazon's unfair tactics were to blame in an election where only just over half of eligible workers cast ballots. 
In a statement, the RWDSU said, ""The results of the election should be set aside because conduct by the employer created an atmosphere of confusion, coercion and/or fear of reprisals and thus interfered with the employees' freedom of choice.""
Amazon in a blog post denied the outcome resulted from intimidation of its employees.
""We've always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace,"" it said.
The e-commerce company campaigned for weeks, plastering the warehouse and even a bathroom stall with anti-union notices, stopping work for mandatory employee meetings on the election, and bombarding staff with text messages criticizing the RWDSU.
In one of the messages seen by Reuters, warehouse leadership warned that collective bargaining could result in workers losing benefits - something the union has disputed. ""Everything is on the table,"" the text declared.
And in one of the mandatory meetings, presentations asserted union leaders used membership dues for improper purposes such as expensive cars and vacations, a former employee at the company's warehouse told Reuters. The union did not immediately comment on the claim.
But some warehouse workers pointed to shortcomings in the union drive. Many younger workers, lacking experience with unions and knowledge of labor history, were never persuaded of the benefits of organizing, these people said. Some cited Amazon's above-average wages, and better working conditions overall than other local employers.
'GOOD PAYING JOB'
Denean Plott, 56, who picked customer orders at the warehouse until March and voted for the union, said, ""It is a good paying job. They do have wonderful benefits."" And young employees ""don't feel they need a union because they’re not putting health and safety at risk as much.""
Some cited fear that voting for a union would mean a constant battle with management they would rather avoid. 
A group of warehouse dock employees who do heavy lifting were against the unionization effort and appreciated Amazon's current benefits, which include receiving health insurance upon hiring, according to one of the former fulfillment center employees. These dock workers also held skeptical views of unions generally, associating them with corruption, the former employee said.
Union leaders had hoped the election would fuel a revival of worker activism, at a time when only 6.3% of private sector workers belonged to unions in 2020, according to U.S. Labor Department statistics. Private sector union membership declined by 428,000 in 2020 from the year before.
High-profile union organizing drives have failed at factories in the South run by Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), and aircraft maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. In each of those cases, as at Amazon, union leaders bet that workers unhappy with wages and working conditions would jump at the chance to have a union go toe-to-toe with management. In each case, the unions were wrong.
The retail workers' union also struggled in Bessemer with some of the challenges that carmakers previously hurled at the auto workers' union, known as the UAW. Car company officials made much of the conviction of several UAW leaders on charges of embezzling union funds, for instance. William Stokes, a process assistant at the Amazon warehouse who voted no, told journalists he had concerns about union conduct.
Other union decisions may have backfired. In December, Amazon lawyers filed lengthy exhibits with regulators delineating thousands of additional individual employees at the Bessemer warehouse they said should be allowed to vote, beyond the 1,500 the union originally proposed. The union later accepted sending ballots to more than 5,800 workers.
Companies often try to pack such proposed bargaining units with additional workers to dilute union support, making it harder to achieve a majority, according to labor experts including former U.S. National Labor Relations Board members.
Harry Johnson, a Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP partner representing Amazon, said Amazon simply wanted ""to make sure that everybody essentially doing the same job at the fulfillment center would have a chance to vote."" He added that, generally, additional voters can include temporary workers not necessarily more inclined to side with the company.
Stuart Appelbaum, the RWDSU's president, said in an interview, ""The bargaining unit size was larger than we thought appropriate, but the alternative was to go through several years of litigation if we didn't accept it, prior to the vote.""
He said that despite Friday's result, the Bessemer campaign had created momentum. ""We have breathed life into the labor movement"" and ""opened the door to Amazon organizing.""
DEFEATING THE UNION
The union’s push for a mail-in vote, rather than the socially distanced in-person election that Amazon proposed, was successful. But the NLRB had set a March 29 deadline for submitting ballots, several weeks after they were mailed. That gave Amazon nearly two additional months to bombard workers with text messages and other communications urging them to vote against unionization.
""Time is the weapon employers use to defeat the union,"" said Mark Pearce, a Democratic NLRB chair during the Obama administration.
Concerns about U.S. Postal Service operations, prominent leading up to the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, likely contributed to allowing weeks between the mailing of ballots and the deadline for returning them, Pearce said. Regardless, the additional time likely conferred some benefit to Amazon, he added.
The union did garner support from U.S. lawmakers and President Joe Biden as the vote drew closer. Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and rapper Killer Mike held rallies in Bessemer supporting the union drive.
But some labor advocates including U.S. Representative Andy Levin of Michigan said the power imbalance between the workers and the company was just too much to overcome.
""The pressure a company like Amazon builds up against you can feel like a 1,000 lb weight on your chest,"" Levin wrote on Twitter. ""The company’s goal is to create so much pressure, anxiety and fear — and to make workers feel that pressure will never go away as long as the union is around.""
The setup of Amazon's warehouse itself may have tipped the vote in the retailer's favor. The size of many football fields, it was not a space for social gathering, let alone union organizing discussion.

The buzz of machines obscured people's voices, desks were spread out, social-distancing became the norm due to COVID-19, and cell phone use while on the clock was not allowed, current and former workers told Reuters.
Plott, one of the former Amazon employees, said, ""You might be in that area for hours and not see a soul.""

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>","BHP, Vale Samarco JV files for Brazil bankruptcy protection","By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture between Brazilian miner Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd, has filed for bankruptcy protection to prevent creditors' claims from affecting its operations, Vale said in a Friday securities filing.
The collapse of a dam at the Samarco mine complex in 2015 killed 19 people and severely polluted the Doce River with mining waste, one of Brazil's worst environmental disasters. The facility, which resumed production in December, is the focus of significant litigation from bondholders holding nearly $5 billion in debt.
""The (judicial reorganization) filing is necessary to prevent legal actions already underway ... from affecting Samarco's ability to produce, ship, receive for its exportations and to fund the normal course of its activities,"" the company said.
Vale said the bankruptcy protection filing would not impact Samarco's ability to pay reparations to those affected by the 2015 dam burst. It said out-of-court negotiations with creditors had slowly broken down over time.
The in-court reorganization request, filed in the state of Minas Gerais, is roughly analogous to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States.
Samarco has $4.7 billion of financial debt from non-related parties, Vale said. In the years following the Samarco disaster, Samarco had negotiated with creditors to reach a restructuring agreement. However, those talks slowed in 2019 after changes in dam regulations in Brazil, which materially affected operations at Samarco, Vale said.
In 2019, another dam burst at a Vale mine in Brazil, killing some 270 people and prompting a tightening of the rules governing mining damns.

A significant portion of the debt is now held by ""investors active in the distressed assets market,"" rather than the original bondholders at the time of the disaster, Vale said.

Companies including U.S. media conglomerates ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc. and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc., as well as apparel retailer Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd. saw a total of about $194 billion in market value erased as banks from New York to Zurich to Tokyo unwound leveraged equity bets by Archegos.
At first, the forced selling in such a specific group of shares raised fears of potential undisclosed issues with the stocks, fueling even more losses. With that scenario now discarded, and with the dust from the Archegos blowup settling, analysts are saying investors should look at some of these names again.
“Usually these dislocations where you get forced selling for non-fundamental reasons work out to be very good buying opportunities,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Toronto-based Purpose Investments. “The counter to that is having to figure out how much of the runup was due to the buying that shouldn’t have been there either. So you have balance that both out.”

Take ViacomCBS for example.
Until late in March, the company was among the top performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 Index, alongside Discovery, boosted in part by optimism over its streaming strategy but also thanks to a massive play by Bill Hwang’s Archegos. The fund at one point amassed $10 billion worth of ViacomCBS shares and colossal positions in a few other companies.

Since Archegos’ blowup and after a 52% drop in ViacomCBS’s stock over the course of a week -- which in turn brought its valuation down by over 50% from a peak on March 22 -- at least six research firms have raised their ratings on ViacomCBS, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
At Wolfe Research, analyst John Janedis said in a note that ViacomCBS shares are now a buy opportunity as the media company’s valuation appeared attractive after its selloff. He also pointed to its streaming business as a potential tailwind.
A similar view is also behind Deustche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft‘s decision this week to raise Discovery’s 12-month forecast to $60 from $35. The company’s improved growth outlook warrants a higher valuation, he noted. Farfetch also got a “buy” recommendation from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth on Thursday, who said the stock delivers a “compelling buying opportunity.”
No Bargains
While the stocks caught at the center of the Archegos crisis are definitely hurting, they aren’t exactly cheap. Their average price-to-earnings ratio -- a measure which indicates how expensive a company is -- is in line with the 10-year median, which signals how high valuations had gotten before the selloff. Aside from ViacomCBS, Discovery and Farfetch, Chinese companies like GSX Techedu (NYSE:GSX) Inc.,  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., VipShop Holdings Ltd. and IQiyi Inc. were also caught in the crosshairs of Archegos.
Determining whether the selloff has turned a once-overvalued stock into a good buy will require some digging, said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.
“If you’ve studied the company and you understand the business and you see this price drop as overdone, then take that opportunity to buy their shares,” Schwartz said by phone. “If you haven’t done your homework and you’re thinking this is another GameStop (NYSE:GME) situation, you’re going to be the sucker at the table.”

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is refusing to testify at an upcoming U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing on competition issues related to mobile app stores, the bipartisan leaders of the panel said on Friday.
App makers long have accused Apple's App Store for iPhones and iPads, along with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Play store for Android devices, of engaging in anticompetitive behavior by requiring certain revenue sharing payments and setting strict inclusion rules. A subcommittee hearing was being planned for late April but no date has been set yet.
Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Mike Lee, a Republican, said they wrote to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on Friday urging the company to reconsider.
""A little more than two weeks before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness,"" the letter said. ""Apple's sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify...is unacceptable.""
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple and game maker Epic Games are scheduled to square off on those issues in a federal trial beginning May 3 in California.
A spokeswoman for Klobuchar did not immediately comment on whether Google or other companies had agreed to testify at the planned subcommittee hearing.

Google has agreed to testify at the hearing, a source said. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>",Failed Amazon union effort renews call for updated U.S. labor laws,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A failed attempt to unionize Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse workers shows why Congress needs to pass proposed legislation to protect labor unions against corporations' anti-organizing efforts, Democratic lawmakers and labor activists said Friday.
Democratic Representative Bobby Scott, who chairs the House Education and Labor Committee, urged the Senate to pass the PRO Act which passed the House last month to make it more difficult for companies to interfere with union organizing.
The Protecting the Right to Organize Act would allow unions to collect dues from non-members covered by their contracts and forbid companies from holding mandatory meetings to lobby against a union, among other measures.
""America's workers will not have consistent access to free, fair, and safe union elections until we strengthen our nation’s labor laws. We cannot continue allowing employers to interfere with workers' decision whether or not to form a union,"" Scott said in a statement. 
Efforts to unionize Amazon.com workers in Alabama were defeated by a big margin on Friday but the union was set to challenge the results in part because of what it said was Amazon pressure on the U.S. Postal Service to put a mailbox outside the warehouse and then pushing employees to use that mailbox to vote.
Representative Andy Levin, a Democrat, said that Amazon win would likely backfire. ""Without knowing it, they are igniting a movement to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act,"" he added.
But the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, which includes the Chamber of Commerce and other big industry groups, argued that unions supported workers in the past but now ""simply want to use political influence to change all the rules to help themselves win elections and pad union dues.""

The Economic Policy Institute noted the key role that Amazon workers played in the pandemic, said they deserved ""a fair election,"" and called for the PRO Act to become law.

Credit Suisse Securities has sued one or more individuals for sending private information about former employees to media outlets, law enforcement and former employees via a March 20, 2021 email, according to a legal filing on Thursday. 
The data was sent from a fake Gmail account in the name of Thomas Gottstein, the chief executive officer of the Swiss banking group, the lawsuit said. It included the former employees' addresses, social security numbers and bank account details, among others. It did not disclose how many former employees were affected by the leaked data.
""Upon learning of the email, we immediately initiated an investigation to determine the scope of the incident. We have now notified affected individuals and offered them 24 months of credit monitoring services,"" a spokeswoman for the bank said.
The lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in San Francisco, also accused the unnamed individuals of threatening to disclose other confidential data.
Credit Suisse said its investigation to date has determined that the defendants may be one or more former employees ""but there is not yet sufficient information to conclusively link the Email to any specific individual or group of individuals.
""We have been working diligently to investigate and contain the incident, and to prevent this type of incident in the future,"" the spokeswoman added. 
Credit Suisse announced this week that it would take a $4.76 billion hit from its dealings with Archegos Capital Management which imploded this month after its leveraged bets on media company stocks soured, causing billions of dollars of losses for the fund and the banks that financed its trades. 

The Swiss bank is also reeling from the collapse of client Greensill Capital.

But let’s find out which of these two stocks is a better buy now.Pinterest, Inc. (PINS) and Facebook, Inc. (FB) are two of the top players in the social media space. PINS is known for its visual discovery platform that acts like a virtual Pinboard where users pin to share their various ideas. FB’s products include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Oculus.
The social media platforms witnessed a massive surge in the number of users and the time spent by them on their platforms amid the pandemic. Even in the post-pandemic scenario, people are expected to spend more time on social media platforms given the advanced ad-target strategy adopted by the platforms which is much improved now thanks to advanced technologies. As a result, both FB and PINS are expected to gain significantly in the upcoming months.
While PINS has returned 410.9% over the past year, FB has gained 79.6%. Also, in terms of past-three months’ performance, PINS is the winner with a 19.6% return versus FB’s 17%. But which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

Amid the fast-paced macroeconomic revival, small-cap tech stocks tend to outperform the markets by huge margins. Thus, investors with higher risk appetites should consider CTS (NYSE:CTS), Universal Electronics (NASDAQ:UEIC),  Aviat Networks  (NASDAQ:AVNW), and Franklin Wireless (FKWL) for their portfolios.The past year was no doubt one of the best years for tech stocks. This is apparent from the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK) nearly 65% gain over this period. The tech sell-off triggered by rising treasury yields and sector rotation toward cyclical stocks have eased, as the Dow Jones and S&P 500 hit record highs recently. Tech stocks are making a massive comeback, as disappointing jobless claims data and concerns over a fourth wave of the pandemic have rejuvenated the interest in the pandemic beneficiaries.
The optimistic market recovery outlook has led investors to bet on small-cap stocks having the highest growth potential compared to mid-cap and large-cap stocks. This is reflected in the Russell 2000 Index’s more than 13% gain year-to-date, compared to S&P 500’s 9.1% return.
So, it is wise to bet on small-cap tech stocks such as CTS Corporation (CTS), Universal Electronics Inc. (UEIC), Aviat Networks, Inc. (AVNW), and Franklin Wireless Corp. (FKWL), as they have plenty of upside left.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Friday said  Blucora  (NASDAQ:BCOR) Inc shareholders should vote for one of Ancora Holdings Inc's four nominees for the Blucora board after the activist investor urged the company to explore strategic alternatives for the tax services business.
""The merits of the issues raised by the dissident lead to a conclusion that change is warranted, specifically in the form of direct shareholder representation in the boardroom,"" ISS analysts wrote.
ISS urges shareholders to vote for Frederick DiSanto, who is chairman and CEO of Cleveland-based Ancora, arguing he is the only one of Ancora's four proposed candidates who has experience serving on a public board.
Ancora owns a 3% stake in Irving, Texas-based Blucora and has urged the company to consider alternatives for its tax services business, including a sale.
The ISS recommendation stands in contrast to a separate recommendation from smaller rival proxy adviser Glass, Lewis and Co, which said on Friday that shareholders should back the company's nominees and reject the dissident's directors.
These types of recommendations often guide investors on critical votes for directors or mergers.
Glass, Lewis said earlier on Friday that the Ancora candidates ""do not clearly offer what we consider to be a superior alternative to the status quo.""
ISS meanwhile noted that Ancora should have a voice, in part because its 3.4% stake in Blucora is more than twice that of the board and management combined. The report said Ancora has identified critical issues at the company and presented a solution, adding the company does not appear to have a plan for its net operating loss assets and has a mixed history of meeting acquisition projections. 
But ISS also said it is not clear whether Ancora's preferred solution - exploring a sale of its TaxAct unit - is the best fix, or that the time is right to pursue a sale.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: BlackRock, Mustier's blank-check firm eye Credit Suisse fund management arm - sources","By Oliver Hirt, Pamela Barbaglia and David French
ZURICH (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Jean-Pierre Mustier's blank-check firm are among investors expressing interest in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s asset management arm, three sources told Reuters, as the Swiss lender explores options for the unit after a run of costly scandals. 
U.S. investment firm  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) is also eyeing a rival bid for all or part of the Swiss bank's fund management business, while European asset managers including Germany's DWS are waiting in the wings, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Former UniCredit boss Mustier's blank-check firm Pegasus Europe, which focuses on financial services investments, is due to list in Amsterdam between the end of April and early May, two sources said.
A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse said the bank had no plans to sell all or any parts of its asset management business. BlackRock, State Street, DWS and Pegasus Europe all declined to comment.
Switzerland's second biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapses of Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management, with a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.75 billion) charge hitting its balance sheet after Archegos failed to meet margin commitments. 
The scale of the charge - close to three times the investment bank's profit last year - and a 25% drop in its shares since the end of February mean Credit Suisse boss Thomas Gottstein needs to take radical action.
The sources said Credit Suisse is in the early stages of a strategic review of its asset management arm and has yet to entertain in-depth discussions with interested parties.
The bank will need to wait for former Lloyds (LON:LLOY) boss Antonio Horta-Osorio to take over as chairman in May before any decision on whether to sell or spin off the unit can be taken, the sources said, cautioning no deal was certain.
Credit Suisse's latest run of problems started when its asset management arm was forced to suspend $10 billion of supply chain funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill Capital after the UK firm lost insurance coverage for its loans.
""They have started talks with some of the parties, but not due diligence, no data room yet. Some of the potential buyers want the entire business, others just parts,"" one of the sources said, referring to the bank's asset management unit.
""Credit Suisse is still in crisis mode and they have not decided how to proceed yet.""
OVERHAUL
Credit Suisse in March announced an overhaul of the asset management unit amid the fallout from the Greensill debacle, bringing in former UBS executive Ulrich Koerner to lead the unit and separating it from international wealth management.
It said at the time the creation of a separate asset management division would serve to emphasize its strategic importance for the bank.
Gottstein also raised the prospect of parting ways with the business in a Bloomberg Television interview in March, saying the idea of separating the unit was ""potentially part of the plan"", and that ""having a holding company around that could be something we are pursuing"".
The bank's fund management business had 440 billion Swiss francs of assets under management in 2020 and a loss before tax of 39 million Swiss francs.
The sources said the business could be valued at roughly $3.7-4 billion, with one adding Credit Suisse is likely to opt for a cash and stock deal that would allow it to extract future returns from the business.
""A potential disposal of Credit Suisse's asset management business has been discussed in the past,"" said Filippo Alloatti, a portfolio manager and credit analyst at Hermes. ""They themselves saw the business as lacking scale and discussed merging it with someone else.""
Credit Suisse is expected to try to retain a stake in any deal involving the business, which could also be spun out and listed in Zurich, the sources said.
The business could also be listed through a deal with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), potentially involving Mustier's vehicle or another blank-check firm, they said.
France's richest man Bernard Arnault is sponsoring Mustier's SPAC along with French investment firm Tikehau Capital and former banker Diego De Giorgi, who worked closely with Credit Suisse's new investment banking boss Christian Meissner at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Formal discussions with Mustier or his team cannot take place until Pegasus Europe finalises its listing in Amsterdam due to regulatory restrictions.
Former Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam is also raising about $250 million for his own SPAC firm to invest in financial services businesses in the developed and developing world.

In another boost for them, Australia has doubled its order for their vaccine to 40 million doses.
BioNTech shares rose more than 5% while Pfizer gained 1%. 
Reuters said the European Commission is seeking EU governments' approval to launch talks with Pfizer and BioNTech for the purchase of the vaccines to be delivered in 2022 and 2023.
Pfizer-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) are already supplying the EU with mRNA vaccines and German biotech firm CureVac is seeking EU approval for its mRNA shot.
Earlier on Friday, without naming the company, Germany’s daily Die Welt reported the commission was shortly to sign contracts to buy up to 1.8 billion doses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airlines suspended the use of dozens of 737 MAX jets on Friday after Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co warned them of a possible electrical fault in the production of some planes.
The glitch is the latest problem to beset the U.S. planemaker's most-sold model but is not related to cockpit safety issues that led to an almost two year grounding, lifted five months ago. The grounding followed two crashes that killed 346 people.
Boeing told airlines that repairs for each plane could take a matter of hours or a few days, according to a notification seen by Reuters.
The top three U.S. 737 MAX operators - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines - said they had removed more than 60 jets from service following the notice from Boeing.
The issue affects about 90 planes globally, sources briefed on the matter said.
The chief operating officer of American Airlines, which said the issue affected 17 of its most recently delivered 737 MAX aircraft, told employees that Boeing has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process.
""(This) occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019,"" David Seymour said in the memo seen by Reuters. 
The status of Boeing deliveries was not immediately clear, with one source saying they too could be disrupted by the new checks.
""Because the problem is understood and the fix looks relatively straightforward, it's unlikely to be a show stopper, although it's unclear if it might have any impact on the expected MAX delivery ramp,"" Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr wrote in a note.
Boeing shares were down 1.8% in Friday trading. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Boeing had notified it late Thursday of its recommendation to temporarily remove some planes from service to address a manufacturing issue that could affect the operation of a backup power control unit.
The FAA said it was in contact with the airlines and the manufacturer, and would ensure the issue was addressed. 
Boeing said in a statement that it wants 16 MAX operators to check and verify that a ""sufficient ground path"" exists for a component of the electrical power system.

Southwest, the largest 737 MAX operator, said it was swapping out 30 of its 58 planes but did not expect a major disruption to its operations.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users may not be learning about jobs for which they are qualified because the company's tools can disproportionately direct ads to a particular gender ""beyond what can be legally justified,"" university researchers said in a study published on Friday.
According to the study, in one of three examples that generated similar results, Facebook targeted an Instacart delivery job ad to a female-heavy audience and a Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) delivery job ad to a male-heavy viewership.
Instacart has mostly female drivers, and Domino's mostly men, the study by University of Southern California researchers said.
In contrast,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) showed the ads for delivery jobs at Domino's to about the same porportion of women as it did the Instacart ad.
""Facebook's ad delivery can result in skew of job ad delivery by gender beyond what can be legally justified by possible differences in qualifications,"" the study said. The finding strengthens the argument that Facebook's algorithms may be in violation of U.S. anti-discrimination laws, it added.
Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said the company accounts for ""many signals to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in, but we understand the concerns raised in the report.""
Amid lawsuits and regulatory probes on discrimination through ad targeting, Facebook has tightened controls to prevent clients from excluding some groups from seeing job, housing and other ads.
But researchers remain concerned about bias in artificial intelligence (AI) software choosing which users see an ad. Facebook and LinkedIn both said they study their AI for what the tech industry calls ""fairness.""

LinkedIn engineering vice president Ashvin Kannan said the study's results ""align with our own internal review of our job ads ecosystem.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Almost 20 major companies worried about a global semiconductor chip shortage that has roiled the automotive industry will send senior executives to a White House summit Monday, a senior official said on Friday.
Reuters reported earlier the summit is expected to include General Motors (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Chief Executive Jim Farley.
The White House official confirmed the three largest U.S. automakers, including Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV will attend, as will executives from GlobalFoundries, PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR), NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
The White House meeting is billed as the ""CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience"" and will include White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. As of midday Friday, 19 major companies had agreed to send executives.
Deese said in a statement the ""summit reflects the urgent need to strengthen critical supply chains.""
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will also take part.
A U.S. auto industry group this week urged the U.S. government to help and warned that a global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
Also taking part are AT&T (NYSE:T), Samsung (KS:005930), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC),  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), HP (NYSE:HPQ) Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU).
""Trying to address supply chains on a crisis-by-crisis basis creates critical national security vulnerabilities,"" Sullivan said in a statement.
Broadband internet, cellphone and cable TV companies also face delays in receiving ""network switches, routers, and servers. ... Shortages in semiconductors and the associated delays will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in impact to the broadband and cable television industry this year,"" an industry group said this week.
President Joe Biden wants at least $100 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor production and fund investments to support production of critical goods, but officials said this funding will not address short-term chip needs. 

On Thursday GM and Ford both announced new vehicle production cuts on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Efforts to unionize Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse workers in Alabama were defeated on Friday by a more than 2-to-1 margin in a major win for the online retailer, but the union trying to organize workers said it will challenge the results, citing election interference. 
According to the tally from agents at the National Labor Relations Board, 1,798 voted against forming a union, with 738 ballots in favor. A simple majority was needed for victory.
Both sides have the right to challenge the eligibility of individual ballots and the entire voting campaign process, but a ballot count official on a Zoom call of the proceeding announced that there were not enough challenged votes to affect the results. 
Amazon shares rose 1.7% Friday, adding to earlier gains.
Union leaders had hoped the election outside Birmingham would spark a new era of worker activism. Instead, it illustrated the continued challenges facing the labor movement, joining high-profile failures to start unions at auto and plane factories in the U.S. South.
The U.S. South is a region that has been particularly anti-union. Nearly all the states in the area, including Alabama, passed so-called right-to-work laws that curtail unions’ abilities to mandate dues and other measures.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which is trying to organize the Amazon employees, said it is filing objections, charging that Amazon interfered with the right of its Bessemer, Alabama, employees to vote.
It has the same legal options as Amazon: challenge the eligibility of individual voters or allege that coercive conduct tainted the election.
In the latter case, the dispute would play out before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and then likely in a federal appeals court.
Unionizing Amazon, the second-largest private employer in America, would be a start to reverse long-running declines in union membership, which fell to 11% of the eligible workforce in 2020 from 20% in 1983, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The vote count followed more than a week of challenges to ballots during closed-door proceedings that could influence the final result. Lawyers for Amazon and the union were allowed to question ballots on suspicion of tampering, a voter's eligibility and other issues.
The NLRB, which is overseeing the election, would adjudicate challenges in coming days.
Amazon for years has discouraged attempts among its more than 800,000 U.S. employees to organize, showing managers how to identify union activity, raising wages and warning that union dues would cut into pay, according to a prior training video, public statements and the company's union election website.
Amazon has said it is following all NLRB rules and wants employees to understand each side of the contest, and that the RWDSU does not represent a majority of its employees’ views. The company has said it wants as many of its employees to vote as possible.
The union objection will focus in part on what it described as Amazon pressuring the U.S. Postal Service to install a mail box and then pressuring employees to bring their ballots to work and use the mailbox. 

Out of 5,867 workers eligible to cast ballots, 3,041 voted. NLRB officials said 505 ballots were contested and 76 were voided.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",Analysis: Investors keep faith in U.S. value stocks as tech roars back,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rebound in growth and technology stocks has investors gauging whether a months-long rally in the shares of banks, energy companies and other economically sensitive names is running on empty or simply refueling.
The Russell 1000 value index started 2021 with its biggest quarterly outperformance relative to its growth counterpart in 20 years, as investors poured money into the shares of battered companies they thought would benefit most from a vaccine-generated reopening of the U.S. economy.
The script has flipped since mid-March, with the Russell growth index gaining over 6% compared to a rise of just over 2% for value. Some investors wonder whether the market has already priced in expectations of a powerful economic rebound on the stimulus, infrastructure spending and vaccine rollouts. 
“We have already had a tremendous move"" in value stocks, said Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""We are probably at the stage where we just want to be a little bit more cautious, a little bit more selective.” 
Value stocks generally trade at low price-to-book or other valuation measures. Investors still see a lot of upside in the group, where names remain cheap after a decade of being trounced by high-flyers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
Despite their recent rally, value stocks remain about 11% below their historic average discount to the market using a composite of price-to-book and other measures, according to Solomon Tadesse, head of North American quant equity research at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). The discount is roughly comparable to where value stood in November 2008, with the financial crisis in full swing.
Based on price-to-book measures, value stocks are also trading some 74% cheaper than growth peers, according to Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research. Such a discount was last seen during the tech boom over 20 years ago, Berezin said.
Investors betting on the reflation trade say that discount gives value stocks plenty of room to run, noting the Federal Reserve expects the U.S. economy in 2021 to grow by 6.5%, its strongest expansion in nearly 40 years.
“We have had some false starts, but I do think that this time it’s real in terms of the value trade,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management, which has tilted toward value in its portfolios by over-weighting financials, industrials, and materials shares.
Graphic: Value stocks vs growth https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/VALUE/jznvnadwapl/chart.png
Strong earnings results by banks and other value stalwarts could trigger more gains in the category. Reports from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are set to kick off earnings season next week.
Overall, 2021 earnings for Russell 1000 value companies are expected to rise 26.4%, beating a forecast 17.7% rise for companies in the growth index, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) data as of the end of March.
Still, some investors expect growth stocks will continue to outperform as they have most of the time since the financial crisis. The Russell growth index has climbed over 700% since early 2009, more than doubling value's gains.
""I think the easy money in value stocks is over,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments. Value has ""closed the gap enough that if the market has more room to run up, it is probably going to come back to the names that investors love, the growth names.""
Some investors say any sign of a coronavirus resurgence could spur a return to the stay-at-home trade that powered tech stocks last year. 
Graphic: Value stock spread vs growth https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwdeempw/Pasted%20image%201617906811983.png
Investors are also watching the U.S. Treasury market where a selloff slowed in recent weeks after pushing the 10-year Treasury yield up by over 80 basis points in the first quarter.
Rising yields could hurt technology and growth stocks, whose cash flows tend to be longer term and are discounted more in standard stock valuation models when bond yields climb.

With plenty of stimulus in the markets and investors focused on inflation, “I don’t see a strong argument against the 10-year (yield) continuing its rise and further juicing the rotation (into value),"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird.

The stock is currently just 5% shot of its 52-week high of $136.49.
Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel maintained a buy rating on CarMax, setting a price target of $153. Nagel expects Carmax Inc to post earnings per share of $1.29 for the second quarter of 2021.

February quarter earnings at the used car retailer, announced April 1, fell 2.3% from a year ago, to $209.9 million. This was even as revenue rose 4%, to $5.16 billion.

Investing.com - Amazon appears to have clinched enough votes to beat an effort to unionize by workers at an Alabama warehouse.
The workers have voted against establishing the first union for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to an unofficial tally. The union they would join has filed an objection, according to CNBC. Shares were slightly higher, after rising almost 4% this week.
After more than a week of vote counting, the no votes hit a simple majority on Friday, according to multiple reports. The ballot counting continues until there is an official count. As of Thursday, the counting suggested the unionization effort would fail.
In the run up to the ballot results, Amazon has faced rebellion from workers in Spain, Italy, and France, amid criticism over poor working conditions. In the face of  criticism, Amazon has fought back, arguing that its pay and benefits for employees are competitive."

Since small-cap stocks are typically more responsive to macroeconomic improvements, these stocks in the infrastructure space are well positioned to soar in the upcoming months. That’s why Alamo Group (NYSE:ALG), EnPro Industries (NPO), and Columbus McKinnon Corporation (CMCO) could be solid bets now.Last month, President Joe Biden unveiled a $2 trillion infrastructure and climate plan to rehabilitate the nation’s fraying infrastructure, reshape its economy, and combat climate change. In a speech at a union hall in Pittsburgh, Biden said, “It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges, it’s a once in a generation investment in America.”
Naming it the American Jobs Plan, he proposed massive investments into modernizing transportation infrastructure, repairing “10,000 bridges,” replacing 100% of the nation's lead pipes, and a long list of other projects. Once approved, this plan is expected to give a huge boost to infrastructure companies that can contribute immensely toward rebuilding the nation.
Economic recoveries usually drive the performance of small-cap stocks because they are more sensitive to increases in investments and federal spending. So, we believe it would be wise to bet on small-cap infrastructure stocks such as  Alamo Group Inc . (ALG), EnPro Industries, Inc. (NPO), and Columbus McKinnon Corporation. (CMCO) now.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft use rides to vaccines to get drivers, customers back on the platform","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) are spending millions of dollars to provide drivers with access to COVID-19 vaccines and offering tens of millions of free or discounted rides to vaccination sites for people in communities that lack access to transportation and healthcare services. 
The effort is both public-spirited, and self-interested.
Ride-hailing demand is ramping up throughout the United States from pandemic-induced lows, but drivers are still slow to return to the road, slowing the companies' efforts to rebuild revenues.
Lack of transportation is a major hurdle to healthcare equity and vaccine access, and studies show fewer options for medical care in low-income and Black communities, which are frequently poorly served by public transit and have lower car ownership rates. 
At Uber (NYSE:UBER), a large team of employees has started calling thousands of drivers who left the platform over the past year, asking them what they need to return, Uber U.S. and Canada Head of Driver Operations Carrol Chang told Reuters.
The company is trying to address drivers' main concerns - safety and earnings - through mask mandates, a vaccination partnership with Walgreen's and $250 million in pay guarantees and incentives.
The Walgreen's partnership has allowed Uber to distribute unique codes to more than 240,000 drivers in several states, including California, Illinois, Virginia and New Jersey, allowing them to book a vaccination appointment at the pharmacy chain. 
Lyft said it is emailing drivers when they become eligible for vaccination in their states. The company requires masks and offers pay incentives and promotions in select markets.
Julia Paige, Uber's director of social impact, who is in charge of the vaccine rides program, said that in her conversations with company management ""I really tried to show people that there are times when doing good is good for business.""
While Uber has not disclosed the costs of the largely self-funded vaccination programs, analysts estimate the roughly 10 million free and discounted rides the company has promised will cost $50 million to $100 million. 
Lyft said its vaccine rides are paid for in partnership with corporate sponsors, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Anthem Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), and private donations.
Officials in Chicago, New Orleans and Jersey City, New Jersey, and nonprofit groups working with the companies said the rides have allowed thousands of people to get vaccinated who otherwise likely would not have gotten a shot.
""There's a huge swath of people sitting on the fence about this vaccine, and only if they have access to it they'll get it done,"" said Tamara Mahal, leader of the Chicago health department's vaccine operation, which has partnered with Uber to offer free rides to 5,000 people.
The Uber and Lyft vaccine rides can be booked by cities or nonprofits on behalf of residents, or by passengers through access codes. Drivers receive the regular fare for the trips, an important element for nonprofit United Way, which partnered with Lyft. 
""People who are driving for Lyft and Uber are financially challenged in our society and this creates more work for them,"" said Suzanne McCormick (NYSE:MKC), the organization's president.
Uber and Lyft say they are not collecting passenger data for vaccine rides, and the data is protected by health privacy laws.
Some city and nonprofit partners said the vaccine service has introduced older people and those in transit deserts to the potential benefits of ride-hail services.
Uber and Lyft have both set up fledgling health businesses, aimed at providing non-emergency medical rides to cities and healthcare facilities. Many of the vaccination rides are provided through those health units, and closer ties with government agencies and healthcare providers could spell more business opportunities down the road. 
Lyft said rides to vaccine centers organized through its healthcare unit were paid for by the clinics and facilities booking them, but counted toward its vaccine access campaign goal.
In New Orleans, Uber is providing a total of 20,000 free or reduced-price rides to the city's mass vaccination sites. Laura Mellem, public engagement officer of New Orleans' office of homeland security and emergency preparedness, said the city was so happy with the partnership that it was discussing how Uber could help with evacuations during the yearly hurricane season. 
City officials said their vaccine collaboration with the companies does not change their outlook on other issues, such as driver pay, taxation and congestion, which have frequently caused rifts between local regulators and Uber and Lyft.

In Jersey City, across the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River from New York City, Mayor Steven Fulop said the city is working with Uber to provide 12,000 free round trip rides, mainly to seniors. Jersey City has in the past enacted regulations Uber opposed, such as caps on food delivery fees delivery companies can charge restaurants.
""We've differed with Uber plenty in the past, but it doesn't mean that we're going to just differ on everything for the sake of disagreeing. Here, we have an overlapping interest and I'm happy to work with them,"" Fulop said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Friday, with the Dow and S&P both pushing to new all-time highs on the back of a fresh wave of reopening trades, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite lagged. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 126 points, or 0.4%, at 33,630 points, while the S&P 500 was up a more modest 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite, by contrast, was down 0.4%, underperforming after producer price inflation data for March pushed bond yields higher. 
Factory gate inflation hit its highest in 10 years in March, coming in above expectations at 4.2%. The rise was mostly due to a distortive base effect, created by the collapse of oil prices a year ago during the first wave of the pandemic. However, not all of the rise could be explained away by statistical quirks. The core PPI rose 0.7% on the month from February, well ahead of expectations of a 0.2% increase and a concrete reflection of higher input prices and supply chain constraints reported by companies in March's business surveys.
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), two big winners of the lockdown age, were among the most prominent losers in early trade. Peloton stock fell 3.7%, while Zoom stock fell 2.2%.
There was also some eye-catching movement among the makers of Covid-19 vaccines, with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rising 5.5% and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) stock up 2.0%.  Overnight, Australia said it would redirect some purchases of vaccines away from AstraZeneca  (NASDAQ:AZN) and toward Pfizer and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), owing to evidence linking the former to a low but nonetheless significant risk of blood clotting disorders. In addition, reports suggested that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will suffer production bottlenecks for its vaccine over the next month, allowing Moderna and Pfizer to grab market share from it in the U.S.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 07:50AM ET</span>","Bayer, Corteva in 'two-dog battle' over U.S. soy market","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) is launching a new genetically modified soybean in the United States, striking back against rival  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc in a bid to retain its dominant position supplying seeds to the $40 billion U.S. soy industry. 
Billions of dollars are on the table for companies producing a growing variety of seeds for soybeans, the top U.S. export crop, as farmers expand acreage this year due to soaring crop prices.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s new XtendFlex soybeans and Corteva's Enlist E3 soy are shaping up to be the most popular with farmers in the coming years, according to interviews with a dozen seed makers, dealers and farmers. Each seed tolerates three chemical herbicides so farmers can destroy weeds without damaging their crops, as weeds grow increasingly resistant to the once-universal glyphosate herbicide. 
XtendFlex soybeans are marketed alongside the previous top U.S. soybean seed, Bayer's Xtend, but offer resistance to one additional weedkiller.
Bayer bought glyphosate-developer  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion in 2018. The following year, Corteva challenged Monsanto's two-decade-long U.S. market dominance by launching Enlist on a small scale. For farmers, the competition is welcome after they had little choice but to accept Monsanto's seeds for years. 
""It is setting up to be a two-dog battle between XtendFlex and Enlist,"" said Jim Herr, a manager for Beck's Hybrids, a seed company that sells Bayer and Corteva brands.
SEEDS OF CHANGE
Corteva, spun off in 2019 after a merger of Dow Chemical and Dupont, says Enlist will account for about 30% of U.S. soy plantings this year, or about 26 million acres. That is up from 20% in 2020, the first year they were widely available, according to the company.
Another player, BASF SE (OTC:BASFY), is distributing a new soybean brand, Xitavo, which contains Enlist technology. It will cover just a few hundred thousand acres in its first year, BASF said.
Enlist was the first soybean genetically modified to withstand sprays from two weed chemicals as well as glyphosate. Corteva expects it will eventually account for half of North America's soybean plantings, said Susanne Wasson, president of the company's crop protection business.
At Latham Hi-Tech Seeds, an Iowa-based company that sells seed to farmers across seven U.S. states, total soybean seed sales are up about 20% and Enlist is the most popular, President John Latham said. 
Seed sellers said some farmers have been reluctant to try XtendFlex because they are unsure of how well it will produce crops.
Dealers could not sell the seeds to farmers last year because Bayer was awaiting approval for XtendFlex from soybean importers. The final clearance did not come until September from the European Union.
In February, Bayer estimated XtendFlex soybeans will account for at least 15 million acres this spring, or about 17% of plantings. That is down from the 20 million acres the company estimated last year, likely due to the delayed approval. 
""People want to see it, feel it themselves, and that just wasn't possible this last year because of the late approval,"" Latham said.
XtendFlex soybeans resist a herbicide known as dicamba that tends to drift and damage vulnerable plants, along with the weedkillers glufosinate and glyphosate. The crop appeals to some farmers who do not want to spray dicamba because of the drifting risk, but want protection if neighbors spray it. 
Illinois farmer Dan Henebry said he dumped plans to plant Enlist in favor of XtendFlex after the EU approval. He wants to use dicamba to kill weeds and prevent them from emerging from his soil. He said he will turn to glufosinate if he needs to fight weeds late in the summer.
For each crop season from 2021 to 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has banned farmers from using dicamba after June 30 because heat can increase the risk of drifting. 
'NO. 1 SOYBEAN SYSTEM' 
Bayer's Xtend soybeans resist dicamba and glyphosate only. The company said it expects to remain ""the number one soybean system for weed control in North America"" in 2021 with its Xtend and XtendFlex offerings. 
Bayer declined to estimate Xtend soy plantings, which flatlined at about 50 million acres last year amid increased competition from Enlist soy. 
Companies generally strike deals with farmers to produce crops for seeds ahead of the spring growing season based on expected demand. The companies then sell the seeds to other farmers to plant the following year. 
Projecting demand for 2021 was trickier than usual, dealers said, after a U.S. appeals court in California in June blocked Bayer from selling dicamba, making Xtend soybeans less attractive.
Nebraska farmer Scott Langemeier said Corteva called him in August offering to buy the Enlist soybeans he was growing, anticipating a surge in seed demand for 2021 plantings after the dicamba court verdict. He had not planned to sell his crop for seed but agreed when Corteva offered a premium.
Then, the Trump administration's EPA in October approved dicamba use for five years, nullifying the court's decision and dealing a blow to Corteva in the seed battle.

Investing.com – Shares of Naked Brands (NASDAQ:NAKD) popped in Friday’s premarket after it disclosed that Ault Global (NYSE:DPW) holds more than 41.1 million shares or 6.4% of its equity.
As many as 4.97 million shares of the company had exchanged hands, making it the most traded counter so far ahead of the session’s opening.
The stock has gained almost 225% year to date through Thursday, milking the frenzy around meme stocks.
The New Zealand-based intimate, apparel and swimwear company last month raised $270 million to clear its debts as it re-establishes itself as a pure-play e-commerce platform.
Ault is a diversified holding company acquiring undervalued assets and disruptive technologies it thinks will have a global impact.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Friday in narrow ranges, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperforming, giving back some of the recent gains as U.S. bond yields edged higher.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 80 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 10 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices all closed higher Thursday, with the broad-based S&P 500 index notching a record close, for the second day in a row, and are all set to post weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 1.6% this week, the S&P 500 has gained more than 1.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite has rallied more than 2.5%, with big tech appreciating the fall in bond yields.
U.S. Treasury yields have edged higher Friday, with the benchmark 10-year note yielding around 1.66%. However, this is still near two-week lows after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated late on Thursday that inflation was not a worry, and the central bank would not be tightening its ultra-easy monetary policies anytime soon.
These accommodative monetary policies and unprecedented stimulus has sparked a massive shift into stocks, with investors pumping more money into equities over the past five months than in the last 12 years, Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) weekly flow figures showed on Friday.
The key economic data release Friday will be March producer prices, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with economists calling for a 0.5% gain, matching the prior month's increase. 
That said, it’s debatable the extent of the market impact from this number given Powell has already said the central bank will not be unduly influenced by a period of higher-than-usual inflation rates, focusing instead on the recovery in the labor market.
In the corporate sector, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is likely to be in the spotlight as warehouse workers at one of the e-commerce giant’s facilities in Alabama vote on whether to form a union.

Oil prices drifted Friday, with traders trying to digest the competing influences of rising supplies and a gathering global economic recovery. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $59.69 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $63.17. 
Both contracts are on track to post a drop of between 2% and 3% this week following the decision late last week by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, to gradually increase supplies by 2 million barrels per day between May and July, and that’s if all the producers stick to their agreed output levels.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",How worried should we be about links of blood clots to AstraZeneca's vaccine?,"By John Miller and Ludwig Burger
ZURICH (Reuters) - Europe's drug regulator on Wednesday said it had found a possible link between AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine and very rare blood clots in adults who received the shot. Britain recommended people under 30 get an alternative COVID-19 vaccine if possible. 
Here's what we know so far:
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
The EMA said its vaccine side effects monitoring system, as of April 4, had received 169 reports of cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or clots in blood vessels exiting the brain, and 53 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), or clotting in veins in the abdomen.
That's out of some 34 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses administered in Britain and the European Economic Area since vaccinations started almost three months ago. 
Its safety committee carried out a review of 62 cases of CVST and 24 cases of SVT, of which 18 were fatal.
Most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60, though that could be misleading. Germany and Britain say many more women received AstraZeneca's shot than men. 
Most cases occurred within 2 weeks of the person receiving their first dose.
German vaccination officials who recorded 29 cases of CVST in women aged 20 to 59 who got the AstraZeneca vaccine said the occurrence rate in that group was 20 times higher within 16 days of vaccination than what would have typically been expected.
Germany's health ministry has said 1 to 1.4 cases of CVST would have been expected during that time.
WHAT HAS BRITAIN'S REGULATOR SAID?
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency reviewed 79 cases of rare clotting coupled with low platelets, with 19 fatalities - 13 women and 6 men. Eleven of the deaths in people under the age of 50 and three under 30.
All 79 cases occurred after a first dose of the vaccine.
HOW DID REGULATORS COME TO THEIR DECISION?
British officials drew on statistics from the University of Cambridge's Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication to explain their recommendations that young people get an alternative shot while older people still get AstraZeneca's. 
According to the Centre, vaccination with the AstraZeneca shot would reduce admissions to intensive care units by nearly seven in 100,000 people in the group aged 20-29 years old with high risk of exposure to the virus, while 1.1 people per 100,000 people in the same group were estimated as likely to suffer serious vaccine-related harms.
The risk of serious harm due to vaccination falls further the older people get, and ICU admissions prevented by vaccination rise sharply, boosting the AstraZeneca shot's benefit-to-risk ratio. The Centre concluded only 0.4 people for every 100,000 in the 50-59 age group would suffer vaccine-linked harm, while 95.6 ICU admissions per 100,000 people would be prevented. 
EMA investigators checked if the frequency of events was higher in the vaccinated population than normal background rates drawn from public health statistics or insurance records. This would be combined with a medical analysis of each case and insight from scientific literature.
In its findings, the EMA said on March 18 that, on average, just 1.35 cases of CVST might normally have been expected among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving AstraZeneca's vaccine, whereas by the same cut-off date 12 cases had been recorded.
By comparison, four women out of 10,000 would get a blood clot from taking oral contraception.
Key to the EMA's assessment that benefits continue to outweigh risks are its conclusions about likelihood of an increased risk from clotting, compared with the benefits of preventing COVID-19 and reducing hospitalizations and deaths. 
WHAT'S THE EU DOING NOW?
The EMA said that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects and countries should decide on how to proceed with their national COVID-19 immunisation campaigns. 
These may vary from nation to nation, the EMA said, depending on factors like how quickly infections are spreading and whether vaccines are available. Its safety committee requested new studies, and changes to ongoing ones, to provide more information about the mechanism behind the rare clots.
AstraZeneca and European regulators have said concerns about blood disorders did not emerge during clinical trials.
ARE THERE ANY THEORIES FOR WHAT MAY BE LEADING TO THE CLOTS?
Among possible causes for these rare cerebral sinous vein clots being investigated are that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in rare cases.
The EMA said the vaccine may trigger an immune response leading to the unusual clotting, though it acknowledged that scientists have yet to identify any risk factors that might predispose somebody to clotting combined with low platelets.
German scientists at Greifswald University concluded the vaccine is linked to the side effects, though their work still requires peer review. Andreas Greinacher, an expert on drug-induced immune responses, said specimens he has examined exhibited unusual antibodies that activate blood platelets, prompting the clots.

Greinacher is still seeking clues about why some people had clots and others did not.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",Rebounding private flights fuel M&A interest in corporate jet services providers,"By Allison Lampert and Maiya Keidan
(Reuters) - As U.S. business aviation traffic rebounds to pre-pandemic levels, a niche, fragmented industry providing services ranging from hangars to fueling is drawing interest from private equity funds and infrastructure investors.
Fixed base operators, or FBOs, play a key role in keeping private jets flying, offering services like hangars and fueling, and some buyers are betting the revival in flights could spill over into allied industries.
While business jet orders and deliveries dropped in 2020, private flights, which carry smaller groups and promise wealthy passengers less risk of exposure to the coronavirus, have generally fared better than commercial. That is underpinning investor interest in FBOs.
The sector recently made headlines when Gatwick Airport owner Global Infrastructure Partners joined forces with Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Bill Gates' investment vehicle to make a $4.73 billion offer for Signature Aviation, the largest private jet services firm.
There are other deals brewing too. Macquarie Infrastructure Corp has said it is seeking buyers for Atlantic Aviation, the second-largest FBO network, for a deal by year's end.
Most of the deals are smaller in scope, with networks growing one site at a time.
FBO network operator Luxaviation Group, which added a site in Miami in March and has plans for another location in New York, is seeing investor interest even as it eyes acquisitions.
""We currently see some interests from private equity firms in our activity and we are carefully assessing our best way forward to expand our FBO business especially in the USA,"" Luxaviation Chief Executive Patrick Hansen said by email.
""Raising capital is part of such plans and so it is good to see some transactions like Signature that draws attention to this sector.""
GROWTH PLANS
Airlines and corporate plane operators cut flights as demand plunged due to the pandemic last year. But with U.S. airlines resuming pilot hiring and corporate charters expecting a recovery in summer travel due to vaccinations, FBO operators are dusting off their growth plans.
Florida-based Sheltair Aviation Services plans to add to its 24 locations, said spokesman David Buritica.
While business aviation investments are too small to track, Refinitiv data show airline deal volumes recovered to $5.85 billion in the first three months of 2021 after hitting a more-than 10-year low of $60.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.
March business aviation flights in the United States, the largest market for corporate aircraft, surpassed 2019 traffic for the fourth consecutive week, according to recent data from Flightaware. 
""The pandemic has unlocked elevated demand for business jets from customers looking for safer and more reliable means of air travel in the current environment,"" RBC analyst Walter Spracklin said in a note this week on Canadian business jet maker Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF).
Independently owned Meridian, which has FBOs located near New York City and San Francisco, gets ""inquiries all the time as to whether or not we would consider selling,"" said a spokesman, who insisted the sites are not for sale. 
Ehsan Monfared, legal counsel at Canada's YYZ Law firm, said he is seeing more cases of private equity investing in aircraft management companies. 

""I do get the sense that there is interest in investing further,"" said Monfared, who expects to see more consolidation in the industry.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German engineering group Siemens Energy wants its slice of the $2.3 trillion U.S. President Joe Biden plans to spend on infrastructure, including power grids and renewables, as the company targets higher sales in its biggest market.
""We see great opportunities for wind energy, onshore but above all in the area of offshore,"" Tim Oliver Holt, who is in charge of Siemens Energy's U.S. business, told Reuters, also pointing to transmission systems as a growth market.
Siemens Energy, spun off from Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) last year, makes about $7 billion in revenues in the United States, or about a fifth of its total, by selling gas and wind turbines, transmission systems as well as servicing power plants.
To better capture growth in the world's top economy, Siemens Energy is considering whether to set up local production for offshore wind turbines on the U.S. East Coast, an area central to a plan announced last week to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030.
Siemens Energy owns 67% in Siemens Gamesa, the world's largest maker of offshore wind turbines, which so far only caters for onshore clients in the United States via two production sites.

(Reuters) - Roughly 500 ballots submitted in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc’s landmark union election have been challenged in a contest that will determine whether an Alabama warehouse becomes the online retailer’s first organized workplace in the United States, people familiar with the matter said.
With about half of roughly 3,200 ballots counted, the election is currently poised to result in workers rejecting a unionization push by a more than 2-1 margin, potentially dealing a blow to organized labor.
The challenged ballots could take on significance if the union meaningfully closes the gap when additional votes are counted. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board would adjudicate the disputed ballots if necessary to determining the outcome.
Representatives for Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) challenged the ballots during closed-door election proceedings that lasted more than a week before U.S. officials began publicly counting votes. They were able to question ballots on suspicion of tampering, a voter's eligibility and other issues.
It is not clear how many votes each side challenged. The union on Wednesday said hundreds of ballots were contested, mostly by Amazon. The company has not commented on that claim.
Of the 3,215 ballots received, workers have so far voted 1,100-463 against forming a union at the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, after several hours of counting on Thursday. The vote count will resume at 8:30 a.m. CT (1330 GMT) on Friday.

Unionizing Amazon, the second-largest private employer in America, has been a goal for the U.S. labor movement, which is aiming to reverse long-running declines in membership. Union membership fell to 11% of the eligible workforce in 2020 from 20% in 1983, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has said.

The federal court fined Volkswagen in December 2019 for breaching the Australian consumer law by making false representations about compliance with the country's diesel emissions standards. (https://reut.rs/3sYH333)
Volkswagen later appealed this decision, insisting that the court impose the A$75 million penalty amount agreed upon with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the regulator said.
In an emailed statement to Reuters, Volkswagen said it believes that A$75 million was ""fair"" and it would review the federal court's decision and consider its options.
ACCC had previously said the breach occurred between 2011 and 2015 and the automaker admitted to fitting its vehicles with a defeat device, causing them to operate in one mode for the purpose of emissions testing and another when being driven.
The case in Australia was part of a host of legal suits that the car maker was embroiled in different parts of the world after it was found using prohibited engine-control software to pass pollution tests in the United States in 2015.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Friday, weighed by concerns that the region’s patchy vaccination program will lead to a slow recovery from the Covid pandemic.
At 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%.
The tone was set by a string of worse-than-expected readings for industrial production across the Eurozone, with German industrial production unexpectedly falling for a second month in February, by 1.6%, and French output contracting 4.7% instead of growing by 0.5% as forecast.
""It would need an explosion of manufacturing and construction activity in March to prevent the German economy from falling into contraction in the first quarter of the year,"" ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said in a note to clients.
Continental Europe has struggled to cope with a third wave of the Covid-19 virus, exaggerated by the region’s lack of success in organizing a concerted vaccination program.
This hasn’t been helped by growing worries over the safety of one of the most prominent vaccines. Italy, Spain and Belgium have joined other European countries in limiting the use of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine, even after the European Medicines Agency on Wednesday repeated that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of very rare cases of blood clots.
The lack of common guidelines within the EU over the use of the drug can only increase public hesitancy, slowing the chance of the region achieving widespread vaccination.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China's Didi picks Goldman, Morgan Stanley for mega U.S. IPO - sources","By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing has mandated Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to lead its blockbuster IPO and plans to file confidentially for the New York float this month, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Didi, backed by Asian technology investment giants SoftBank,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent, is looking to list as soon as July, according to the people.
It is eyeing a valuation of at least $100 billion via the initial public offering (IPO), Reuters reported last month. At that valuation, Didi could raise about $10 billion if it sells 10% of its shares, making it the biggest Chinese IPO in the United States since Alibaba's $25 billion float in 2014.
Beijing-based Didi's selection of the two banks shows it is moving forward apace in its listing plans and that the U.S. capital pool remains a big draw for Chinese companies despite heightened tensions between the world's two-largest economies.
It also shows that for Wall Street titans, flotations of Chinese firms represent a growing business opportunity. 
Didi, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The sources declined to be named as the information is private.
Last year, Chinese companies raised $12 billion in U.S. listings, more than triple the fundraising amount in 2019, according to Refinitiv data.
Confidential IPO filings enable companies to keep vital operational and financial information out of competitors' hands for a few extra months. 
Nine-year-old Didi was considering Hong Kong for its IPO last year as U.S.-listed Chinese firms faced heightened scrutiny and more strict audit requirements from U.S. regulators, while geopolitical tensions escalated between Beijing and Washington. 
Didi later dropped that plan and has picked New York as the listing venue partly due to concerns that a Hong Kong IPO application could evoke more regulatory scrutiny over Didi's business practices, including the use of unlicensed vehicles and part-time drivers, sources have told Reuters.
Didi has opted for New York also because of a more predictable listing pace, the presence of comparable peers like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and a deeper capital pool, said the people.
The move comes even as the Securities and Exchange Commission is pressing ahead with a plan that would kick foreign companies off American stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards.
Didi, which merged with then main rival Kuaidi in 2015 to create a smartphone-based transport services giant, counts as its core business a mobile app, where users can hail taxis, privately owned cars, car-pool options and even buses in some cities.

The company was valued at $56 billion in a 2017 fundraising and its valuation exceeded $60 billion a year later, sources have said.

It said the suspension was because of the ""supply conditions"" for semiconductor parts for powertrain control units. 
""We are closely monitoring the situation to take prompt and necessary measures to optimize production in line with the supply conditions,"" Hyundai said in a statement. 
The Asan factory turns out 300,000 vehicles each year, including the Sonata and Grandeur sedans. 
Hyundai last week announced it would suspend output at Ulsan, its main South Korean factory, from April 7 to April 14 because of chip and component supply issues.
Underscoring the severity of the global chip shortage crisis, Hyundai has become the latest automaker to halt manufacturing because of the chip shortage. 

Hyundai had been able to avoid a hit from the shortage so far largely because it maintained a stockpile of chips unlike its global peers, Reuters reported in February.

1336,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 02:27AM ET</span>",German Industrial Output Falls Unexpectedly Amid Virus Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- German industrial production unexpectedly fell for a second month in February, suggesting that coronavirus restrictions are increasingly harming one of the economy’s most resilient parts.
Output dropped 1.6% from the previous month, surprising all but three economists in a Bloomberg survey. The decline was broad based, with investment-goods production taking a particular hit.
Still, the economy ministry expressed some optimism that growth momentum will pick up in the months ahead.
“The improvement in business confidence and positive trend in orders signal a positive outlook in industry,” it said. “Nevertheless, the future course of the pandemic poses uncertainties.”
German industry has held up relatively well in recent months as it benefits from economic recoveries in China and elsewhere. A separate release showed exports rose 0.9% in February.
At home, persistently high coronavirus infections have kept large parts of the service sector shut, probably resulting in a contraction in output in the first quarter.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled she’d be in favor of another short, sharp shutdown lasting two to three weeks to contain the pandemic. With some regional leaders reluctant to even fully implement the current measures, she has threatened to transfer powers to the federal level to impose additional curbs.
Meanwhile, German business executives are confident their companies will overcome the crisis this year. According to a Deloitte survey of 140 chief financial officers at large firms, 43% have already seen sales recover, and another 23% say they will do so by December.
A separate report showed Thursday that factory orders rose 1.2% in February. The gain was driven by demand from within the country and the euro area, with that for investment goods especially strong.

The clampdown on the school, founded in 2015 by Ma to train China's next generation of entrepreneurs, comes as his business empire faces government scrutiny.
Hupan Academy, based in the city of Hangzhou, where Alibaba has its headquarters, suspended a first-year class set to begin in late March, the newspaper said.
Alibaba and Hupan Academy did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Tuition for the three-year program amounts to 580,000 yuan ($88,500.98). Students listed in the incoming class of 2019 included executives from Keep, a successful Chinese exercise company, and fast-growing domestic chip firm Horizon Robotics.
The school is among the initiatives launched by Ma related to education, a sector the erstwhile English teacher has committed to since stepping down from his role as Alibaba's chairman in 2019.
The enrollment halt comes amid Beijing's crackdown on Ma's businesses. Late last year Ant Group, a financial affiliate of Alibaba, abruptly suspended a planned $37 billion IPO in Shanghai following pressure from the authorities. 
The botched listing came after Ma made comments in public criticising China's financial regulators. He has yet to make a public appearance since, save for a brief 50-second video clip broadcast to a group of teachers.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China set to clear Tencent's $3.5 billion Sogou deal subject to data security conditions: sources,"By Pei Li and Julie Zhu
(Reuters) - China's antitrust regulator is ready to clear tech giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's plan to take the country's no.3 search engine Sogou (NYSE:SOGO) private, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a move that signals the watchdog is willing to wave some deals through even as it ratchets up sector scrutiny.
The regulator, State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR), has no objection to the $3.5 billion deal for the 60% of U.S.-listed Sogou that Tencent doesn't already own, the people said, as long as Tencent is willing to set up a special mechanism to ensure data security - a first for SAMR deal approvals.
Tencent must also pay a comparatively small fine - 500,000 yuan ($76,000) - for not reporting deals properly for antitrust reviews, two of the people said, in line with past cases for similar violations.
The move highlights Chinese regulators are still looking to approve merger and acquisition deals in the tech sector, but now with strict conditions after years of a laissez-faire approach. The green light for the closely watched deal will come as a relief for China's tech sector, reeling from Beijing's antimonopoly crackdown on home-grown internet giants that culminated weeks after the shelving of fintech firm Ant Group's $37 billion IPO in November.
""What SAMR wants is enforcement ... it is not in their interest to kill or actively block a deal,"" said one of the people. ""They are fine with companies' actual market-leading status as long as it doesn't prevent new entry into the market."" 
The people with knowledge of the matter declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Sogou trails only Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Qihoo 360 in China's enormous internet search market, according to analytics firm SpeedTest, and is the sole search engine on Tencent's all-in-one mobile app WeChat, a must-have in everyday life in China. Tencent, China's biggest video game and social media company, first announced plans to take it private last September.
Tencent and SAMR did not immediately respond to requests for comments when contacted by Reuters. 
Sogou declined to comment. 
DATA CONCERN
One of the areas of heightened scrutiny has been M&A deals in the sector in the recent past, with the regulators taking a dim view of the violation of antitrust rules and, in some cases, data privacy laws.
The linchpin of the deal approval conditions is meeting the regulator's requirement on data security - defining who can have what kind of access to the bulk of users' data and personal information, and how to use that, said the three people. 
A merger of China's two leading video games streaming sites - Huya (NYSE:HUYA) and Douyu, both backed by Tencent - is also under review and will need to satisfy similar requirements on data security, said the sources. 
Reuters reported last month that Tencent was having to offer concessions to get approval for its plan to merge the two sites, including giving up exclusivity on some of its content rights.
After the merger, Huya and Douyu will need to set up a firewall in-between and cannot share user data and information to each other, two of the people said.
SAMR would also approve the merger soon after a final touch on the concessions are made, they said.

1339,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2021 02:11AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Mixed; German Industrial Production Weakens,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen trading in a mixed fashion at the open Friday, helped by further signs of a global economic recovery but concerns about the region’s Covid vaccination program remain.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
Earlier Friday, China reported that its March factory gate prices rose at their fastest annual pace since July 2018, climbing 4.4% year-on-year, far above February’s 1.7% growth.
Although China set a modest GDP growth target of above 6% for 2021 earlier in the year, many expect the Asian economic super power’s growth to exceed 8%.
Back in Europe the economic news was less impressive, as Germany’s industrial production slumped 1.6% on the month in February, according to data released Friday, below the expected growth of 1.5%.
""It would need an explosion of manufacturing and construction activity in March to prevent the German economy from falling into contraction in the first quarter of the year,"" ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said in a note to clients.
Adding to these concerns has been growing worries over the safety of one of the most prominent vaccines against the virus. 
Italy, Spain and Belgium have joined other European countries in limiting the use of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine, even after the European Medicines Agency on Wednesday repeated that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of very rare cases of blood clots.
The lack of common guidelines within the EU over the use of the drug can only increase public hesitancy, slowing the chance of the region achieving widespread vaccination.
The concerns over this vaccine will make sure AstraZeneca remains in the spotlight Friday, especially after Australia announced it would be ordering 20 million extra doses of Pfizer’s rival drug, in a pivot away from the British-Swedish drug maker. 
Oil prices drifted Friday, with traders trying to digest the competing influences of rising supplies and a global economic recovery that is gradually gathering steam. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $59.63 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $63.07. 
Both contracts are on track to post a drop of between 2% and 3% this week following the decision late last week by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, to gradually increase supplies by 2 million barrels per day between May and July.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,749.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1891.

The fact that the fund and national aid programs will lead to significantly growing national debt levels was not a problem provided the spending boosted sustainable economic growth, Schnabel told German magazine Der Spiegel.
""The increase in public debt is inevitable and sensible in the face of this crisis of the century, as long as the expenditures sustainably boost growth,"" she said in an interview published on Friday.
Germany's constitutional court put the ratification of the EU recovery fund on hold last month, saying it was looking into an emergency appeal against the debt-financed investment plan.
Schnabel also raised concerns regarding potential threats for the financial markets caused by the activities of hedge funds. 
The fact that the collapse of U.S. hedge fund Archegos Capital Management led to billions of losses at major lenders such as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was ""a warning signal that there are significant systemic risks,"" Schnabel said. 
The case showed that there were also ""significant regulatory gaps,"" she said.
Switzerland's No. 2 bank took a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.76 billion) hit from dealings with Archegos , prompting it to overhaul the leadership of its investment bank and risk divisions.
Archegos collapsed last month when its debt-laden bets on stocks of certain media companies unravelled. Credit Suisse and other banks, which acted as Archegos' brokers, had to scramble to sell the shares they held as collateral and unwind the trades.

The trend since mid-February marks a reversal in the risk-seeking behaviour seen between April 2020 and Jan 2021, and caused the country's blue-chip index to post its worst monthly performance in a year in March. 
Foreign investors also turned cautious, their buying via the Hong Kong-China Stock Connect slumping in March as the yuan also depreciated against a buoyant dollar.

MMFs are traditionally considered low-risk and liquid as they invest in higher quality assets, including government bonds.
The Hwabao WP Listed Money Market ETF, the largest money market ETF listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, saw its total units increase 21% to 1.77 billion on April 8, from 1.46 billion on Feb 18. 
Analysts said the stock market correction since mid-February was mainly driven by fears over frothy valuations after Beijing set a conservative economic growth target that implied policymakers wanted room to rein in financial market bubbles. 
The Yinhua Money Market EFF, another major money market ETF listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, saw its total units increase 30% to 1.3 billion on April 8, from 1 billion on Feb 18.

Fu said MMFs were a good choice for investors as China tightens policy gradually.
Meanwhile, margin lending in the stock market, a gauge of investor sentiment, dropped as markets pulled back.

J&J is attracting investor scrutiny because it partially shields Gorsky from some $9 billion in costs over two years that have arisen from lawsuits claiming the healthcare company fueled the U.S. opioid crisis and allegations of asbestos in its talc baby powder.
In a note to shareholders on Thursday, ISS said ""...investors may nonetheless expect an explanation from the company of how the compensation committee considered the extraordinarily large litigation charges when making compensation decisions.""
Last week, Glass Lewis based its recommendation on the argument that the healthcare company was shielding its top executives from the legal cost of poor business decisions.
J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ISS note outside regular business hours.
The company has previously said it has always set aside certain one-time costs, such as litigation, when calculating stock awards for executives, an approach common across corporate America.
Gorsky's compensation totaled $29.6 million in 2020, up 17% from the previous year. A non-binding resolution on the pay packages will be up for a vote at the company's annual general meeting on April 22.
Gorsky, who became CEO in 2012, has been at the helm of J&J during the opioid abuse and addiction crisis, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention claimed nearly 450,000 lives in the United States between 1999 and 2018.
In 2019, 50,000 people died in the U.S. from opioid related overdoses, according to the National Institute of Health.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Asahi Group Holdings said it will aim to halve its debt and forego overseas investments after spending $11 billion to buy the Australian operations of Anheuser-Busch InBev.
""Basically, we are not considering any large-scale acquisitions,"" said Atsushi Katsuki, who became Asahi's new chief executive in March.
The owner of brands including Asahi Super Dry, Peroni and Pilsner Urquell will aim to reduce its debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to three times from six at the end of December.
Asahi won regulatory approval last year to buy the Australian brands Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) after agreeing to sell other assets in the country. Katsuki previously led Asahi's operations in Australia and Oceania before becoming its chief financial officer in 2019.In mature markets like Japan and Europe, Katsuki told Reuters he wanted to ""premiumize"" products: selling drinks at higher prices as shrinking populations mean that high volume sales may no longer be possible.

In Japan, Asahi has been hit harder than rivals by the COVID-19 pandemic due to its dependence on keg sales to restaurants and bars - many of which have struggled amid the prolonged crisis. Even so, the company in February forecast its full-year operating profit will exceed levels seen in 2019.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Friday morning, but hovering near record levels, as investors continued to assess the U.S. Federal Reserve’s assurance that economic reinvigoration can be achieved without stoking runaway inflation.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.72% by 11:11 PM ET (3:11 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.06%. Consumer and producer price indexes data for March released earlier in the day was better than expected, with the CPI contracting 0.5% month-on-month  and growing 0.4% year-on-year while the PPI grew 4.4% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.84%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.29%, while South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.32% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.24%.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled during an International Monetary Fund event on Thursday that the central bank is nowhere near reducing its support for the U.S. economy. He also said that although the economic reopening could result in a momentary surge in prices, it will be temporary and not constitute inflation.
Although the comments demonstrated the Fed’s commitment to dovish policy for now, Powell added that the Fed would react should inflation expectations start “moving persistently and materially” above tolerable levels.
Meanwhile, Treasuries got a boost, with the benchmark 10-year yield trading around a two-week low. Comments from Powell’s colleague, New York Fed Executive Vice President Lorie Logan, also sparked talk of increased Fed purchases in Treasury 20-year bonds which then went on to outperform.
Disappointing jobless claims data released on Thursday indicated that the economic recovery from COVID-19 is far from complete, however. The data said that the number of claims unexpectedly rose to 744,000, more than the 680,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 728,000 claims filed during the previous week.
“Jobless claims set a tone for the market that perhaps things are not as strong as people think and we’re still ways away from a recovery,” Inverness Counsel chief investment strategist Tim Ghriskey told Reuters.
Other investors struck a more optimistic tone.
“A lot of investors are worried about the stock market highs, but that doesn’t mean it can’t get higher, and the economic conditions are certainly set up for a positive equity environment,” UBS Global Wealth Management managing director Xi Qiao told Bloomberg.
On the COVID-19 front, more than 726 million COIVD-19 shots have been administered globally as of Apr. 9. However, several countries including China are facing supply shortages as they vaccinate their populations.
The U.S. outlook is greatly improved but remains at risk from potential setbacks in the global economy as the vaccine rollout “hasn’t been nearly as robust in many countries,” San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly told Bloomberg."
1345,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Impossible Foods in talks to list on the stock market - sources,"By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Impossible Foods Inc is preparing for a public listing which could value the U.S. plant-based burger maker at around $10 billion or more, according to people familiar with the matter.
This would be substantially more than the $4 billion the company was worth in a private funding round in 2020. It would highlight growing demand for plant-based meat products, driven by environmental and ethical concerns among consumers. 
Impossible Foods is exploring going public through an initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12 months or a merger with a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the sources said. 
The Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California-based company has worked with a financial adviser to help manage discussions with SPACs after receiving offers at a lucrative valuation, the sources said. Going public through a SPAC could dilute existing Impossible Foods shareholders, however, by a greater extent than an IPO, the sources added. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an IPO with the aim of acquiring a private company. For the company being acquired, the merger is an alternative way to go public over an IPO.
Merging with a SPAC has emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies seeking to go public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised.
The sources, who requested because the discussions are private, cautioned that the deliberations are subject to market conditions and the company may opt to pursue another private fundraising round. 
A spokeswoman for Impossible Foods declined to comment.
Impossible Foods, whose backers include venture capital investors Khosla Ventures and Horizons Ventures, as well as celebrities like tennis star Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) and rapper Jay-Z, has so far raised $1.5 billion in the private market, according to PitchBook data. 
In 2020, U.S. plant-based retail sales hit $7 billion, up 27% year on year, according to a report by the Good Food Institute and the Plant-Based Foods Association (PBFA). 
Founded in 2011, Impossible Foods sells its meat-free burgers and sausages in grocery stores and also has partnerships with the likes of Burger King and Disney. 
The number of locations where Impossible Foods' burgers are sold has increased in the past year to more than 20,000 from 150 stores, the company has said. 
Shares of rival Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc are trading more than 400% above its IPO price from 2019. 

Impossible Foods Chief Financial Officer David Lee stepped down earlier this year to join indoor farm builder AppHarvest, with David Borecky currently serving as the company's interim CFO.

Historically, these types of stocks would be companies with decades of dominance in their respective industries. However, as our economy goes through a digital transformation, a blue-chip can also be younger tech stocks with disruptive business models.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>","Boeing sues, cancels contracts with Air Force One supplier","By David Shepardson and Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said Thursday it had filed a suit against and canceled contracts with a Texas-based supplier for Air Force One, the aircraft that carriers the U.S. president, over delays in completing interior work on the two heavily modified 747-8 planes.
The U.S. planemaker said in a statement it had canceled contracts ""with GDC Technics ... due to their insolvency and failure to meet contractual obligations."" GDC Technics did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Boeing said in its suit filed in Texas state court on Wednesday the delays ""have resulted in millions of dollars in damages to Boeing and threaten to jeopardize work that is of critical importance to the (U.S. Air Force) and the president of the United States.""
The Air Force referred questions to Boeing.
In July 2018, Boeing received a $3.9 billion contract to build two 747-8 aircraft for use as Air Force One, due to be delivered by December 2024. A Boeing spokeswoman said the planemaker still planned to meet the Air Force's delivery schedule.
GDC, which ""agreed to design and build the interior"" of the two Air Force One planes, is ""roughly one year behind schedule in meeting its contractual obligations,"" Boeing said in its suit first reported by Dallas NBC affiliate KXAS-TV.
The Boeing 747-8s are designed to be an airborne White House, able to fly in worst-case security scenarios such as nuclear war, and are modified with military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defense system.
In 2018, then President Donald Trump said the new model Air Force One would have upgraded interiors and a different color scheme from the white and two shades of blue that has been used since President John F. Kennedy's administration.

In January, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden ""has not spent a moment thinking about the color scheme of Air Force One.""

The initiative builds on a risk-sharing scheme the banks launched in July to help to fund suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) as they and vaccine makers race to meet global demand that outstrips supply.
By leaning on the ADB's sovereign-level credit rating, private sector lenders such as HSBC can lend more easily to companies in the complex chain of vaccine supply production, HSBC said.
""Right now demand for vaccines far outstrips supply and one of the challenges is that supply and distribution networks have to be formed, which requires a lot of liquidity,"" said Surath Sengupta, global head of financial institutions at HSBC.
The lenders will offer funds through trade loans and invoice financing among other tools, Sengupta said, as countries across Asia try to shorten the usual multi-year time scale needed to deploy large-scale inoculation programmes.
Vaccination levels in Asian countries have varied widely as governments deal with limited supplies, rapidly rising demand and political jockeying to secure doses.

Leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan agreed to pool financing, manufacturing and distribution capacity to send 1 billion coronavirus vaccines across Asia by the end of 2022, India's foreign secretary said in March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Nike Inc said on Thursday a Brooklyn company that made ""Satan Shoes"" in collaboration with the rapper Lil Nas X has agreed to voluntarily recall the shoes, as part of a legal settlement with the athletics giant.
The settlement with MSCHF Product Studio Inc resolves a trademark infringement lawsuit that  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) filed last week over the black-and-red, devil-themed sneakers, which carry the Nike ""swoosh"" logo and quickly sold out at $1,018 a pair.
Satan Shoes are customized versions of the Nike Air Max 97 sneakers, with midsoles purporting to contain a drop of human blood, and printed with ""Luke 10:18,"" a reference to a Biblical verse that alludes to Satan's fall from heaven.
Only 666 pairs were made, with the last held back so Lil Nas X, known for the song ""Old Town Road,"" could choose the recipient.
Nike said MSCHF will offer full refunds to purchasers of its Satan Shoes and Jesus Shoes, which were launched in 2019 and also based on the Air Max 97, ""to remove them from circulation.""
Limited edition shoes can fetch premium prices among collectors, however, and those obtaining refunds could miss out on price appreciation.
David Bernstein, who chairs the intellectual property litigation group at Debevoise & Plimpton and represents MSCHF, said the artistic messages MSCHF hoped the shoes would convey were ""dramatically amplified"" by Nike's lawsuit.
""MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance,"" he said. ""Having achieved its artistic purpose, MSCHF is pleased to have resolved the lawsuit.""
Lil Nas X was not a defendant, and never got to choose who received the last pair after a Brooklyn judge temporarily halted further sales on April 1.

Nike had claimed that even ""sneakerheads"" were confused about who produced Satan Shoes, while MSCHF said the shoes were ""individually-numbered works of art"" and did not sow confusion.
In March, Lil Nas X released a devil-themed video for his song ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name).""

With dividend-paying biopharma stocks increasing their payouts to remain competitive amid rising benchmark yields, we think companies such as AbbVie (ABBV), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), and Gilead (GILD) should be value additions to one’s portfolio. Let’s pore over these names.Rising Treasury yields in the United States have put pressure on dividend paying stocks to increase their dividend payments or maintain payment frequency to retain the attention of fixed-income investors. Several biopharma companies with impressive dividend payout histories are currently maintaining their traction with income investors. In addition, biopharma companies are leveraging investors’ heightened interest in the industry by ramping up their drug pipelines. Last year, a record number of biopharma companies administered IPOs, while several undertook dividend recapitalizations to maintain their dividend payouts amid the pandemic.
Revenues in the biopharmaceutical sector are expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% over the next five years to $496.71 billion by 2026.
Thus, we think pharmaceutical companies  AbbVie Inc . (NYSE:ABBV), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), which have stable dividend payout histories, are ideal investment bets now.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 05:00PM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. voting law debates stoke tussle over airline tax breaks,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airlines are bracing for challenges to tax breaks they receive from U.S. states as a result of wading in to a political debate over voting rights, rekindling a domestic tug of war between politics and profits.
A Republican backlash faced by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in its home state of Georgia after it called new restrictions unacceptable is spreading to Texas as some corporations clash with Republican lawmakers there.
Democrats say the tighter regulations are undemocratic and will hurt Black voters in particular.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines have spoken out against measures that restrict voting access, sparking a furious response from Republicans who say the bills counter fraud. 
After Delta blasted Georgia's Republican-backed voting bill last week, some lawmakers attempted to end its jet-fuel tax breaks.
Now airlines are concerned that tax breaks that allow them to reduce fuel costs could be singled out by lawmakers in Texas in retaliation for opposition to new voting laws, people familiar with their thinking said.
""We have an eye on that as  a possibility and I think it goes without saying that we wouldn't like that,"" one person said, asking not to be identified.
On Tuesday, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick ripped companies for opposing the bill and accused American's chief executive of failing to read it, something the airline denied.
The clashes shed new light on the reliance of some U.S. carriers on state tax breaks to shave their fuel costs, airlines' second-largest expense after labor and one that weighs on razor-thin profit margins. 
""There's one thing that you consume a lot of in the airline business and that is fuel,"" said U.S. airline analyst Bob Mann. 
""So they spend a lot of time trying to avoid taxation or eliminate taxation where they can. It's a competitive weapon.""
Airport and fuel costs can influence airlines' decisions on where to add flights, and most states ""really want more air service, not less,"" an executive at a small U.S. airline said.
RECURRING THREATS
It is not the first time airlines have seen tax breaks fall under the microscope after they became involved in political topics.
In 2018, Georgia temporarily struck down a tax exemption after Delta ended its relationship with the National Rifle Association following a school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
The exemption would have saved Delta $40 million a year, a small sum compared with its $9 billion total fuel bill but enough to impact marginal routes. Eventually it won the tax break.
Delta is the largest employer in Georgia and its Atlanta hub generates significant revenue for the state.
North Carolina threatened to repeal a fuel tax exemption for American Airlines, with a hub in Charlotte, after it opposed a state law on transgender bathrooms, but ultimately backed down.
As hot-button national issues have gained force after the Trump presidency, business calculations are shifting.
Leaders of large U.S. airlines have decided that taking decisive stands on issues like civil rights is increasingly important to protecting their brand and appeasing employees and customers, the sources said.
For now, that overshadows concerns about whether those decisions could imperil items like tax breaks, they added.
Prolonged attention to tax breaks could, however, reopen wounds between U.S. carriers and rivals over what constitutes unfair aid.
In 2015, Delta, American and United - the so-called Big 3 - accused Gulf airlines of benefiting from $42 billion in public subsidies including fuel hedging concessions and tax policies.
Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad rejected the complaint, saying U.S. carriers themselves received support. 
""Airlines are not immune from two-headed behavior. They decry government involvement in anything until it's something that benefits them, at which point they're all for it,"" said Mann.
U.S. airline industry sources rejected any comparison with the Gulf trade dispute.
""Talking about state-subsidized airlines versus some tax exemptions is much different in size and scope than whether or not a particular state chooses to tax jet fuel,” one said.
U.S. airlines have struggled to act in unison on either the earlier trade dispute or the recent domestic political conflict.
That adds a layer of complexity in Texas, where analysts say it would be difficult for lawmakers to punish the Big 3 without also harming Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, which has not directly opposed the voting bills.

""Southwest's biggest imperative right now is to win customers and survive the pandemic without alienating 50% of the population,"" one person familiar with its thinking said.

As more Americans become vaccinated, Southwest is among U.S. airlines signaling a recovery and trying to prepare for pent-up demand for domestic leisure travel.
Last week, the low-cost airline said it had recalled 209 pilots from a similar voluntary leave program.
Both recalls take effect on June 1.

Levi said more than 40% of its European stores were closed as of Thursday, with the rest operating on reduced hours due to lockdown restrictions.
The jeans maker said it expected its revenue to increase 24% to 25%, up from a prior range of 18% to 20%, for the first half of its fiscal 2021.
Levi also said it expected adjusted per-share profit for the period to be 41 cents to 42 cents. Analysts on average expect a profit of 30 cents per share for the first and second quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net revenue fell about 13% to $1.31 billion for the first quarter ended Feb. 28, but came in above analysts' expectations of $1.25 billion. 
Digital revenue, which includes sales from Levi's wholesale partners, rose about 41% and more than made up for a drop in physical store visits due to pandemic.

On an adjusted basis, Levi earned 34 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 25 cents.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 04:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: GameStop's strong stock performance triggered board director's exit,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Hestia Capital Partners LP managing director Kurt Wolf joined  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)'s board to make the U.S. video game retailer more valuable. Then it became too valuable for him to stay on.
The hedge fund manager resigned his directorship this week because his investors fretted the bet on the company, which scored a paper gain of 3,500%, had become too large and risky, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Giving up the board seat allows Wolf to sell GameStop shares for his investors without restrictions to meet redemption requests, the sources said. 
Hestia currently owns 318,600 GameStop shares valued at roughly $53.8 million. It oversaw $75.6 million in assets as of the end of March, with GameStop being its single largest investment. 
Hestia has a mandate to invest in ""deep value"" assets that are unloved and undervalued. GameStop's shares have been on a wild rally since January as amateur traders organized on social media platforms such as Reddit to snap them up, making them unsuitable for the kind of investing Hestia's clients hired the fund for, the sources said.
Hestia returned 223.7% in the first three months of 2021 after gaining 162% last year, and Wolf now plans to unload the GameStop shares, the sources said. 
Wolf did not respond to emails seeking comment. GameStop said in a filing on Thursday that Wolf's resignation ""is not the result of any disagreement with the company or the board."" It declined to comment further.
Hestia originally invested in GameStop in 2019 spending an average $5 a share. A year later, when GameStop was valued at roughly $250 million, Wolf criticized the board for poor strategic planning and capital allocation and asked for a board seat for himself. GameStop shares now trade around $169 and the company is valued at roughly $12.5 billion.
Emergent Capital Advisors, a hedge fund-of-funds that invests with roughly a dozen small firms like Hestia, was Hestia's biggest investor and asked for its capital back. It had invested with Hestia through a separately managed account and asked Wolf to return control of the portfolio at the end of March. In January, Wolf had already sold roughly $20 million worth of GameStop shares on behalf of Emergent when the stock price was around $20 a share, the sources said.
A spokesman for Emergent Capital declined to comment. 

Wolf joined GameStop's board in June 2020. Within months, Ryan Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of online pet food retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc, joined Wolf on the board. He has since been spearheading its pivot from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce. GameStop said on Thursday Cohen would become chairman of its board later this year.

As the demand grows further with the continued, post-pandemic, adoption of remote work structures, and with large-cap companies now operating at near full capacity, we believe mid-cap cybersecurity companies McAfee (MCFE), Trend Micro (OTC:TMICY) and Tenable (TENB) have sufficient scope to grow. So, these stocks could be solid bets for this quarter. Read on for details.As the world witnesses a rapid digital transformation fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for cybersecurity solutions is increasing exponentially. And with more remote and hybrid working models increasing the risks of cyberattacks, businesses around the world are adopting increasingly robust cybersecurity measures.
According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cyber security market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% over the next seven years to $366.10 billion. Investors’ interest in cybersecurity stocks is evident in First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF’s (CIBR) 27.1% returns over the past nine months.
While large-cap stocks don’t typically offer rapid growth and most large-cap companies in the cybersecurity space are now operating at full scale, heightened volatility is typically associated with small-cap stocks. So, we think it might be wise to bet on mid-cap cybersecurity companies such as McAfee Corp. (MCFE), Trend Micro Incorporated (TMICY), Tenable Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TENB) to capitalize on industry tailwinds.

But the company has yet to receive FDA approval for its HNB offerings. Given this backdrop, we think tobacco stocks British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) and Vector Group (NYSE:VGR), which possess robust commercial product pipelines, are likely to deliver relatively higher returns than PM. No smoke; read on for details.Consumer staples have been witnessing a steady rise in demand and prices since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, due in-part to panic shopping. The demand for tobacco products, which was declining typically by 3-4% annually in the United States, has also risen over the past year. The industry saw increasing numbers of smokers worldwide last year, likely due in some measure to stress introduced by remote lifestyles. Regardless, rising concerns regarding health worldwide have incentivized most tobacco companies to research and produce the next-generation smokeless products, which are expected to carry lower health risks.
Philip Morris International, Inc. (NYSE:PM), the producer top cigarette brand Marlboro, introduced heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco products last year. PM has even partnered with  Altria Group , Inc. (NYSE:MO) to make HNB products. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) has not granted approval to replace HNBs with regular cigarettes. So, we think it would be best to avoid PM for now.
As an alternative in sector, we think investors should focus on companies that have viable product pipelines, such as British American Tobacco PLC (BTI) and  Vector Group Ltd . (VGR). These stocks have the potential to perform better than PM in the near term.

The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, to close at a record high of 4,097.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, or 56 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.03%.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC is reviewing SPAC filings, wants clearer disclosures -official","By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official on Thursday said the agency is reviewing filings and seeking clearer disclosures for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), and detailed concerns around fees, conflicts and sponsor compensation.
Staff at the top U.S. markets regulator ""are reviewing these filings, seeking clearer disclosure, and providing guidance to registrants and the public,"" John Coates, acting director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, said in a statement.
The SEC is stepping up scrutiny of the increasingly popular SPACs, shell companies that raise funds via a listing to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public.
SPACs are seen as an easier alternative to the traditional initial public offering, with less regulatory scrutiny.
Coates detailed some of the SEC's concerns about SPACs at an event earlier this week. The agency has also warned dealmakers to follow regulatory demands, and last month launched an inquiry into how underwriters are managing any risks.
Claims that SPACs present less exposure to liabilities are ""overstated at best,"" Coates said, an issue that has been called out by investor advocates and other critics.

Participants may not have considered the legal implications of making performance projections as part of the SPAC process, Coates said. Any material misstatements are a violation of securities laws, he said.
Coates raised the prospect of a formal rulemaking or potential legislative reform to address concerns, but stopped short of offering formal guidance or asking for public comment on the issue.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 continued its run of record highs Thursday as big tech racked up gains after selling in bonds pushed yields lower following weaker labor market data and dovish remarks from Federal Reserve Jerome Powell.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, after hitting an intraday record high of 4,098.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.10%, or 34 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.95%.
Chairman Powell, appearing during a virtual IMF panel discussion on Thursday, laid out the case for the central bank to keep its monetary spigot wide open, cooling investor expectations the central bank will be forced to act sooner-than-expected.
""There is a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy from fiscal support, vaccines, but unevenness in recovery is a serious issue,"" Powell said as he reiterated the current pace of the Fed's monthly bond buying will continue. ""We want to see a string of months like the March jobs report to see progress.""  
The fed chief's dovish comments echoed the tone of the Fed's March monetary policy meeting minutes released Wednesday. Fed policymakers acknowledged progress on the economy, but continued to back the ongoing pace of monetary support, saying  substantial progress on the recovery will likely take ""some time,"" the minutes showed.
The labor market, meanwhile, continue to offer some credence to the Fed's chief's ongoing cautious outlook as weekly jobless claims increased more than expected, sending U.S. bond yields lower and paving the way for big tech to continue its climb.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) continued to rack up gains. 
Banks, however, lagged the broader market rally as stuttering bond yields dented sentiment on the interest-rate sensitive sector ahead of earnings from major Wall Street banks next week.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was higher, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) remained below the flat line.

Illumina said in a court filing this week that the Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction should be denied because its arguments are ""hopelessly speculative.""
""This acquisition provides huge benefits to people who may have cancer and don't know it,"" said CEO Francis deSouza.
GRAIL is developing a blood test to screen for many kinds of cancer at early stages, and Illumina is the sole provider of the technology for the DNA sequencing needed for the test or for rivals designing a competing test, the FTC said. 
The potential lack of access would potentially prevent other companies than GRAIL from developing a rival test, the FTC argued.
DeSouza disagreed, noting that the company has offered a 12-year contract to supply its technology to potential GRAIL rivals. ""Our whole ethos as a company is to drive the price of sequencing down,"" he said. 
The lawsuit was filed at a time when concerns over health care costs, including prices of medicines like insulin that have been off patent for years, have risen sharply, in some cases forcing patients to make painful decisions.
Illumina formed GRAIL five years ago and spun it off in 2017, although Illumina maintained about a 14.5 percent stake. 

This is not Illumina's first tangle with the FTC. In 2019, the agency challenged its planned merger with Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:PACB) of California, and the two companies called off the deal.

Currently, one of the most disruptive technologies is cloud computing. ZDNet defines cloud computing as, “The delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.”
Companies, in all different sectors and around the world, are moving to host their data and applications on cloud platforms.

This volatility has taken an outsized toll on growth stocks and many software names, with multiple Nasdaq constituents staring down (-) 20% returns as we begin Q2. Fortunately, this pullback has allowed valuations to improve for some tech names, which looks to be creating a buying opportunity for hyper-growth names with strong business models.

In AMZN’s case, the company just came off a massive year with annual EPS growth of 81%, and in Bill.com’s case, the stock is not yet profitable but had a huge year with revenue growing by 45% despite a challenging year for small businesses due to COVID-19.

While most of the COVID-19 pandemic winners are now witnessing a sell-off as investors rotate to potential post-pandemic winners, some tech players’ high valuations are still justified by their growth prospects. However, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Snowflake (SNOW), Affirm Holdings (AFRM), and Bill.com (BILL) are not among them. These names look highly overvalued now given their limited promise indicated in their financials. So, we think these stocks are better avoided in the near term.Technology stocks saw a skyrocketing rally in the wake of the COVID-19 market correction in March 2020. The rally caused many technology stocks to become significantly overvalued. As several developments and indicators began pointing to an economic recovery earlier this year, many investors found it wise to rotate their holdings into relatively undervalued stocks that have the potential to capitalize on the economic recovery.
The trend has led to a sell-off of expensive technology stocks. Nevertheless, the high valuation of many tech players is still justified given their enormous growth potential.
But the question is, can the overall technology sector make a comeback from its decline so far this year? Many analysts don’t expect the sector to regain its pandemic-driven momentum. Indeed, according to a CNBC article, the sector could witness further underperformance.

But let’s find out which of these names is a better buy now.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) and ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) are two leading semiconductor equipment producers that operate internationally.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed a lawsuit accusing Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) of defrauding shareholders about its ability to comply with Chinese regulations governing internet content.
In a Wednesday night decision, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh rejected claims in the proposed class action that 12 statements that Baidu made from March 2019 to March 2020 were false and misleading and inflated the Beijing-based company's share price.
The statements included that the world's largest search engine other than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google had ""cleaned up"" harmful or questionable content such as material related to drugs, gambling and pornography, giving users more confidence and potentially boosting online traffic and revenue.
Koh, based in San Jose, California, also found no proof of an intent to defraud, after the plaintiff Roger Ikeda argued that senior Baidu executives concealed compliance shortfalls to avoid fines and suspensions from the Chinese government.
Lawyers for Ikeda did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday, nor did Baidu's lawyers.
The lawsuit was filed last April, shortly after China's internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China ordered Baidu to halt the spread of ""low-brow content,"" prompting Baidu to suspend some channels on its mobile app.
Baidu resumed updating the channels two weeks later.
The proposed shareholder class included holders of Baidu's American depositary shares from March 16, 2019 to April 7, 2020. Koh dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs can amend their complaint.

It has gained 128.5% over the past three years and 53% over the past five years. This can be attributed to its strong market presence—both online and offline—and impressive brand strength.
Because team sports were widely suspended amid the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company’s revenue was affected slightly as the demand for related products fell. However, this was more than offset by strength in its other product categories. BGFV reported impressive total revenue growth in its last-reported quarter.
As people have recognized the importance of staying fit while spending most of the time at home, the demand for BGFV’s athletic apparel has increased. This led to the stock’s 95.8% gain over the past six months. So, we think it is wise to bet on the stock now because this trend is expected to continue in the coming months.

Airbus also posted 39 gross orders, including a new deal for 20 A220s to an unidentified buyer.
But the company saw the number of net orders - which are adjusted for cancellations - remain in negative territory for the first quarter, with a total of minus 61 net orders dominated by a Norwegian cancellation unveiled in the previous month.

The brisk pace of deliveries confirms a Reuters report on Wednesday that the world's largest planemaker was poised to match or even eclipse the 122 deliveries seen in the first quarter of last year after a surge in March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic chair of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has written to several large banks, including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Japan's Nomura, asking them for information on their relationship with New York-based Archegos Capital Management after the fund imploded last month.
Senator Sherrod Brown asked the bank's chiefs to detail how their institutions came to do business with Archegos, a family office run by ex-Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang. Archegos' soured leveraged bets on media stocks have left the fund and banks that financed its trades nursing billions of dollars in losses.
In addition to Credit Suisse and Nomura, which lost $4.7 billion and $2 billion, respectively, Brown sent the letters to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) which did not lose money on the trades, Reuters and other media outlets have reported. 
Representatives of banks declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The letters signal that the fallout from the Archegos meltdown is spreading in Washington, where policymakers are already mulling new rules on nonbanks and how traditional banks may be exposed to their risks.
""I am troubled, but not surprised, by the news reports that Archegos entered into risky derivatives transactions facilitated by major investment banks,"" Brown wrote in the letters.
""The massive transactions, and losses, raise several questions regarding [the banks'] relationship with Archegos and the treatment of so-called 'family offices,' Mr. Hwang’s history, and the transactions."" 
Brown pressed for details on how banks do business with ""family offices,"" lightly regulated funds that manage individuals' and families' personal fortunes, the services provided to them by the banks, and how the banks decide on the amount of credit to extend.

He also quizzed the lenders on whether bank supervisors or bank risk committees signed off on their dealings with Archegos, given Hwang had previously been punished by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged insider trading.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian payments firm Elo has chosen six banks to manage its initial public offering, four sources close to the matter said, in the first concrete sign it is proceeding with a move first proposed by shareholders in August.
The payments network - launched a decade ago to compete with  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) - is planning an IPO on Nasdaq, the sources said, following recent successful listings by Brazilian financial services firms such as XP (NASDAQ:XP) Inc and StoneCo Ltd.
Elo has picked  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Co as the main underwriters, along with the investment banking units of its owners Banco Bradesco SA, Banco do Brasil SA (OTC:BDORY) and Caixa Economica Federal.
One of the sources said Elo is pursuing a valuation of around $7 billion through the flotation, which another source said is likely to happen in the second half of the year. Elo declined to comment on the matter.
Bradesco, Banco do Brasil and Caixa intend to sell only a part of their holdings in the offering, the sources said.
Elo plans to use some of the IPO proceeds to increase its network of issuers. Aside from its three founders, which are among Brazil's biggest lenders, only a few other small banks currently issue cards under its banner. 
The company, with 132 million credit and debit cards outstanding, also needs to increase its acceptance abroad, mainly in Europe and in countries such as Mexico and Canada.
No final decision on a U.S. listing has yet been made, but if it proceeds, Elo would probably also list its Brazilian Depositary Receipts on Sao Paulo bourse B3 SA.
More domestic banks may still join the deal, two of the sources said, asking for anonymity to disclose private talks.
Card payments grew rapidly in Brazil during the coronavirus pandemic last year. The country's card association estimates card transactions will jump by a fifth in 2021, after rising 8.2% last year. 
Elo, which posted net income of 838 million reais ($149.8 million) last year, ended 2020 with 1.5 billion reais in cash.

(Reuters) -The S&P 500 hit a record peak on Thursday, helped by gains in tech-related stocks as weaker-than-expected jobless claims data bolstered the Federal Reserve's stance to keep interest rates lower for a longer period.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Corp and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose between 1% and 1.5% and were among the top boosts to the benchmark index.
High-growth tech stocks have recovered in recent sessions as U.S. 10-year bond yield backed off from its 14-month peak, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to a seven-week high and within 2% of its record closing high.
Latest data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the increase likely understates the rapidly improving labor market conditions.
""While states balance the vaccine rollout with stop and start reopening plans, the labor market continues to feel the heat,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial.
""But the disappointing read actually puts some firepower behind the Fed's accommodative stance.""
The Fed acknowledged the economy was on its path to a strong rebound backed by massive fiscal spending and accelerating vaccinations, minutes released on Wednesday showed. However, the central bank noted it would be ""some time"" before conditions improve enough for the Fed to rein in its support.

Canada's oil and gas sector had a record start to 2021 in terms of mergers and acquisitions as the energy sector benefits from a rebound in oil prices from the pandemic-led crash last year, and as smaller companies bet on economies of scale.
Enerplus said it will buy 78,700 net acres in North Dakota, adjacent to its current core Bakken acreage, with about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) of working interest production from Hess.
The acquisition of largely undeveloped land has expanded Enerplus' drilling inventory in the play by two to three years, Scotiabank analysts wrote in a note, adding its five-year plan to grow production modestly and emphasize free cash flow will likely be well received by investors.
The deal, expected to close in May, will add to Enerplus' adjusted free cash flow per share and net asset value in the first year, Enerplus said.
The company raised its output guidance for the year to between 111,000 and 115,000 boepd, from 103,500 to 108,500 boepd, due to the acquisition as well as strong operating performance in North Dakota and higher-than-expected production in Pennsylvania's Marcellus region. 
It also raised its 2021 spending plans to $360 million to $400 million from $335 million to $385 million.

For Hess, the sale of the acreage, which it was not planning to drill before 2026, strengthens its cash and liquidity position. Last month, the company agreed to sell stakes in the two Danish oilfields to chemicals and energy group INEOS for $150 million.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>","AstraZeneca woes grow as Australia, Philippines, African Union curb COVID shots","By Reuters Staff
(Reuters) - Australia and the Philippines limited use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, while the Africa Union dropped plans to buy the shot, dealing further blows to the company's hopes to deliver a vaccine for the world. 
The vaccine - developed with Oxford University and considered a frontrunner in the global vaccine race - has been plagued by safety concerns and supply problems since Phase III trial results were published in December, with Indonesia the latest country forced to seek doses from other vaccine developers. 
The Philippines suspended the use of AstraZeneca shots for people below 60 after Europe's regulator said on Wednesday it found rare cases of blood clots among some adult recipients although the vaccine's advantages still outweighed its risks. 
Australia recommended people under 50 should get  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine in preference to AstraZeneca's, a policy shift that it warned would hold up its inoculation campaign. 
The African Union is exploring options with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) having dropped plans to buy AstraZeneca's vaccine from India's Serum Institute, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters. 
AstraZeneca's shot is sold at cost, for a few dollars a dose. It is by far the cheapest and most high-volume launched so far, and has none of the extreme refrigeration requirements of some other COVID-19 vaccines, making it likely to be the mainstay of many vaccination programmes in the developing world.
But more than a dozen countries have at one time suspended or partially suspended use of the shot, first on concerns about efficacy in older people, and now on worries about rare side effects in younger people. 
That, coupled with production setbacks, will delay the rollout of vaccines across the globe as governments scramble to find alternatives to tame the pandemic which has killed more than 3 million.
'EXTREMELY RARE'
Italy joined France, the Netherlands, Germany and others in recommending a minimum age for recipients of AstraZeneca's shot on Wednesday and Britain said people under 30 should get an alternative. South Korea also suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60 this week, while approving Johnson & Johnson's shot. 
AstraZeneca has said it is working with the British and European regulators to list possible brain blood clots as ""an extremely rare potential side-effect"".
South Africa also paused AstraZeneca vaccinations last month because of a small trial showing the shot offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the dominant local coronavirus variant.
AstraZeneca is grappling with production issues that have led to shortfalls of its shot in several countries.
Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Thursday the country was in talks with China on getting as many as 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to plug a gap in deliveries after delays in the arrivals of AstraZeneca shots. 
India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of AstraZeneca's shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, as domestic infections rise.

That has affected supplies to the GAVI/WHO-backed global COVAX vaccine-sharing facility through which 64 poorer countries are supposed to get doses from the SII, the programme’s procurement and distributing partner UNICEF told Reuters last month.
Britain is slowing its vaccine rollout due to a shipment delay from India and is at loggerheads with the EU over exports. Australia has also blamed delays in its immunisation campaign on supply issues in Europe.
AstraZeneca has cited reduced yields at a European factory behind the supply shortfall to the European Union.

Fast-food companies and some other restaurant chains have seen sales rise as the weather turns warmer, limits on dining room capacities lifted, and people using stimulus checks to eat out.
However, the pace of hiring is slow compared to the booming demand. The U.S. restaurant industry in March was about 1.2 million employees short from the same month in 2020, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
IHOP said it would look to fill part-time and full-time roles across its over 1,600 U.S. restaurants.

Its industrial and commercial helicopter segments should also benefit from the economic recovery, according to analyst Noah Poponak.
""We see substantial upside to consensus earnings estimates, investor expectations appear low, and valuation levels are among the lowest in our coverage,"" Poponak wrote in a note. 
With no one going anywhere, demand for any aircraft has been minimal at best over the past year of pandemic living. But vaccinations that are increasing across the country and economies that are reopening are leading to increased demand and business activity.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), meanwhile, raised the price target on Textron to $65 from $60, while maintaining a buy rating, StreetInsider reported.

The automobile industry has suffered from a shortage of chips as they were redirected to other industries over the past year as vehicle-making factories closed during the pandemic.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, after a second straight rise in weekly claims for jobless benefits acted as a reminder that the economy's progress out of lockdown is still uneven. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15 points, or less than 0.1%, at 33,432 points. The S&P 500 was up, however, by 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up by 0.9%, as the market digested Wednesday's news that the Biden administration's tax plans will likely hit a much smaller number of companies than at first thought. 
Earlier, the Labor Department had reported that initial jobless claims rose to 744,000 last week, disappointing hopes that they would resume their downward trend. Economists had predicted a number of around 680,000. The broadest measure of those claiming unemployment-related benefits - including two pandemic-related schemes - inched down by 51,000 to 18.16 million.
The data pushed the yields on 10-Year Treasury bonds down by a couple more basis points to 1.64%. They're now down some 11 basis points over the last week, and bank shares such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all lost more than 1% in early trading in response the fresh pressure on their lending margins.
Among early movers, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) stock fell 4.6% after the company issued underwhelming guidance for the coming year. Operating margins in its fiscal fourth quarter also suffered, especially due to the effects of wildfires on its wines division.  
Likewise, ConAgra Foods  (NYSE:CAG) stock opened down 2.2% after it said it expects operating margins to be compressed in the next three months, not least due to higher input costs.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock rose 2.3% after it announced a deal to expand its distribution through major grocery chains including Kroger (NYSE:KR), Wegmans and  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
There was also fresh evidence of the strains felt by the automotive industry due to the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors, as General Motors (NYSE:GM) warned that it will temporarily idle more North American plants due to chip shortages. Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) also said it couldn't rule out further ""adjustments"" to production volumes this year. GM stock, which has surged in recent weeks to its highest since the company emerged from bankruptcy after the Great Recession, fell 2.4%. VW ADRs fell 0.8%."

U.S.-listed shares of Canopy rose 1.3% to $30.33 after it announced the cash-and-stock deal for Supreme, which owns pot brands including 7ACRES and Blissco.
Easing regulatory hurdles and a rise in weed use during the pandemic has brought back investor dollars for cannabis producers after years of underperformance. 
Canada saw legal recreational weed sales surpass illicit channels for the first time in the fourth quarter of last year.
The deal makes Canopy the owner of four out of the top ten cannabis brands in Canada, with an estimated 13.6% of the total recreational market share in the country, the companies said.
Under the terms of deal, Supreme Cannabis shareholders will receive 0.01165872 of a Canopy common share and C$0.0001 in cash in exchange for each Supreme Cannabis share held. 
Including debt, the deal is valued at C$435 million.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Amsterdam-based technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV on Thursday said it netted $14.6 billion from its overnight sale of a 2% stake in Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent in one of the world's largest ever block trades.
""Our belief in Tencent and its management team is steadfast, but we also need to fund continued growth in our core business lines and emerging sectors,"" Prosus Chairman Koos Bekker said in a statement after the completion of the deal on Thursday.
In a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing, Tencent said Prosus sold 191.89 million shares for HK$595.00, reducing its stake to 28.9%. 
The price was a 5.5% discount to Tencent's Wednesday close of $HK629.50. Tencent stock, which is up 10% this year, traded 2.5% lower in Hong Kong on Thursday.
A statement from Tencent Chairman Pony Ma said he viewed Prosus, which was spun off from Naspers of South Africa in a 2019 IPO, as a ""commited strategic partner over a great many years"".
""Tencent respects and understands the (stake sale) decision"", he said. 
Naspers bought the Tencent stake Prosus now holds in 2001.
Prosus has committed to not reducing its remaining stake further for the coming three years.
The block trade was the largest since 2018, when Naspers sold 2% of the group for $9.8 billion, Refinitiv data shows.
Prosus Chief Executive Bob van Dijk said the company has a ""healthy set"" of potential acquisition targets.
""Food delivery, you know, is an important focus for us,"" he told reporters on a call. ""Edtech (education software) is an important segment for us and fintech is as well, so we see quite a few opportunities."" 
Prosus owns interests in online food delivery platforms, classified marketplaces and digital payments businesses.
For the half-year to Sept. 30 it reported a 29% increase in core earnings to $2.2 billion, with proceeds from its Tencent stake offsetting losses from other investments.
The sale of the Tencent stake slightly closed a gap between the valuation of Prosus itself, with a market capitalisation of 153 billion euros, and the value of its remaining Tencent stake, worth about 186 billion euros on Thursday.
""When the discount moves in the right direction we're obviously happy, but we're not happy with where it is,"" Van Dijk said.
He said growth at the company's other businesses would ""alleviate the discount over time"".
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were joint global coordinators for the sale.

Investing.com – Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) fell 3.5% Thursday as the company’s earnings guidance for fiscal year 2022 came in lower than that of last year.
The maker of Corona beer and Cooper Thief wine expects its 2022 earnings per share to be between $9.95 and $10.25. The 2021 number was $10.44. The figures exclude a contribution from its equity in cannabis company  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp (TSX:WEED).
In an announcement that only added to uncertainty, the company said its guidance does not reflect future changes in the fair value of its investment in Canopy’s warrants and convertible debt securities.

Constellation Brands announced earnings per share of $1.82 on revenue of $1.95 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.55 on revenue of $1.86 billion.

The two-year-old New York-based firm competes with  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), new-age fintech startups such as Brex and older expense management software makers like Expensify and SAP Concur.
Stripe, which had invested in Ramp previously as well, had in March raised $600 million at a valuation of $95 billion.
Leading global investors are pouring billions of dollars into fintech startups that have been benefiting from a surge in e-commerce and the use of contactless payment technology during the pandemic.
According to data platform PitchBook, 2020 was a record year for venture capital investments in the U.S. fintech companies. 
Ramp said it would use the fresh capital to hire more and boost its marketing efforts, partnerships and product development. 
The startup makes money by taking a portion of the interchange fee that merchants have to pay to card networks like Visa (NYSE:V) for a transaction that a customer makes. It also charges a fee for access to its advanced software tools. 
Its Chief Business Officer Colin Kennedy, who previously served at Stripe and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said the startup is looking to simplify expense management and eliminate extraneous manual processes to help its clients. 

Ramp's customers include audio app Clubhouse and telehealth company Ro. Its transaction volumes grew by about five times over the past six months, the company said.

By Chen Lin and John Geddie
(Reuters) -Two years after opening his garment factory in Myanmar, Li Dongliang is on the verge of closing down and laying off his 800 remaining workers.
Business had been struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but after a Feb. 1 coup that sparked mass protests and a deadly crackdown, during which his factory was set alight amid a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment, orders stopped. 
His story is emblematic of the perilous situation facing a sector critical to Myanmar's economy, which accounts for a third of its exports and employs 700,000 low-income workers, according to U.N. data.
""We would have no choice but to give up on Myanmar if there are no new orders in the next few months,"" said Li, adding he has been operating at about 20% capacity, surviving only on orders placed before the coup, and had already shed 400 staff.
Li said he and many of his peers were considering moving to other low-cost garment hubs like China, Cambodia or Vietnam, as big fashion brands like H&M and Primark have stopped trading with Myanmar due to the coup.
Chinese nationals like Li fund nearly a third of Myanmar's 600 garment factories, according to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association, by far the largest investor group.
At least two other Chinese-funded garment factories in Myanmar, employing a combined 3,000 workers, had decided to close, said Khin May Htway, managing partner of MyanWei Consulting Group, which advises Chinese investors in Myanmar. She said the two firms were her clients but declined to identify them citing privacy.
Foreign investment in garments surged in Myanmar over the past decade as economic reforms, an end to Western sanctions and trade deals helped establish the sector as the greatest symbol of its nascent emergence as a manufacturing hub. 
Myanmar garment shipments rose from less than $1 billion in 2011, about 10% of exports, to more than $6.5 billion in 2019, about 30% of exports, according to U.N. Comtrade data.
But the sector has been rocked by the pandemic which plunged the world into recession and choked consumer demand, resulting in tens of thousands of garment factory jobs lost in Myanmar and elsewhere in Asia. 
Then the coup happened.
In the weeks that followed, many garment workers joined protests or couldn't get to work as streets became battlegrounds. The turmoil also jammed the banking system and made it difficult to get goods in and out of the country, factory owners said.
With international condemnation of the coup growing, European and U.S. fashion brands last month issued a statement through their associations saying they would protect jobs and honour commitments in Myanmar.
However, many have recently halted orders there including the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, Sweden's H&M, Britain's Next and Primark, and Italy's Benetton. 
Next said it would split its orders previously going to Myanmar between Bangladesh, Cambodia and China, while Benetton said it would mainly move business to China. H&M and Primark have not commented on how they will redistribute orders.
ESCAPE FROM POVERTY
In Vietnam, garment factory owner Ravi Chunilal told Reuters he was starting to get more business from European buyers diverting from Myanmar. 
""They don't want to abandon Myanmar ... but it's being forced upon them,"" said Peter McAllister of Ethical Trade Initiative, a labour rights organisation whose members include European high-street brands. 
McAllister said that it would be very difficult for Myanmar's garment sector to recover if Chinese investors left.
Anti-China sentiment has risen since the coup, with opponents of the takeover noting Beijing's muted criticism compared with Western condemnation. It was against this backdrop that several Chinese-funded factories, including Li's, were torched by unidentified assailants during a protest last month. 
Rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about exploitation in Myanmar's garment sector, where mostly women workers earn as little as 4,800 kyat ($3.40) a day, the lowest rates in the region. 
But it has provided an escape from poverty for many, as workers have migrated from rural areas to the factories, mainly around the commercial hub of Yangon, and sent money back to their families.
Khin Maung Aye, managing director of Lat War garments factory, which employs 3,500 people, says the sector faces collapse if the military does not restore a democratically elected government. 
That would result in ""terrible outcomes of poverty"", he said, adding that he was also staying afloat on orders placed before the coup but feared orders for next season, normally due later this month, will dry up.
Thin Thin, a 21-year-old garment worker, said her family of five was surviving on a 86,000 kyat ($59) monthly retainer her factory had given her while it shut down because of the coup. 
""I feel so stressed ... We have nothing left to pawn. We have to borrow from money lenders at 20% interest a month.""
The United States, which has imposed targeted sanctions on Myanmar's military, late last month suspended trade talks with it and said it was reviewing its eligibility for its Generalized System of Preferences scheme, which reduces tariffs and provides other trade benefits for developing countries.
That could ""portend future disruption"" for Myanmar's garments sector, said Steve Lamar, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents more than 1,000 fashion brands.
But some unions representing garment workers have called for the international community to impose tougher sanctions to press the military, even though it may further damage their industry.

""I accept orders moving away,"" Myo Myo Aye, founder of the Solidarity Trade Union of Myanmar, said through a translator. ""Workers would face difficulties and hardship because there would be no jobs. On the other hand, we simply don't accept the military regime.""

""That is what is key in the market at the moment, as rates appear to have reached some degree of equilibrium, and that is what is encouraging the equities market performance. I can't really see anything on the immediate horizon to upset that.""
U.S. Treasuries yields were down from their 14-month highs, although analysts said markets will be tested next week when the U.S. earnings seasons gets underway.
The U.S. weekly jobless claims data is due at 1230 GMT, and is expected to show the number of Americans filing for new unemployment benefits dropped in the latest week, a further sign the economy is recovering from COVID-19.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at 1600 GMT at an International Monetary Fund event and he is likely to reiterate the dovish outlook.

ECB DOVISH TOO
Stocks in Europe also reached record highs, buoyed by optimism in Britain over easing lockdown restrictions and supportive outlooks from the Fed and the European Central Bank.
The European STOXX index of 600 leading companies rose 0.44%, just off the high of 436.66 points it reached earlier in the session. London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.4%.
""It's looking good as evaluations in Europe are much lower than they are in the U.S., so there is potentially more upside. The line of least resistance for European markets is higher,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
""In terms of economic re-opening, there is enough optimism built in at the moment to drive markets quite a bit higher from here, and the Fed has reiterated it's going to remain on hold for a while,"" Hewson said.
The ECB said in the account of its March 11 meeting, published on Thursday, that it was important to provide reassurance there would be no change in its accommodative monetary policy for as long as necessary.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched up 0.3% in quiet trade. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.3%, not helped by news Tokyo's governor had asked for emergency measures to stem a surge of COVID-19 infections. 
In currencies, the dollar index eased to 92.291 from its recent five-month high at 93.439.
The euro was steady at $1.1877, after rising as high as $1.1914 overnight following a surprisingly upbeat survey of European Union business activity. 
In commodity markets, gold was at $1,750 an ounce.
Oil prices fell after official figures showed a bigincrease in U.S. gasoline stockpiles, causing concern about demand for crude weakening in the world's biggest consumer of the resource at a time when supplies around the world are rising. 

Brent fell 29 cents to $62.87 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 44 cents to $59.33 per barrel.

Investing.com – Shares of Conagra Brands (SA:C1AG34) were gainers marginally in Thursday’s premarket trade after the company’s third quarter earnings and revenues beat expectations.
The company announced earnings per share of $0.59 in its fiscal third quarter, on revenue of $2.77 billion, as at-home consumption, driven by Covid-19, boosted sales volumes. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.58 on revenue of $2.71B.
Rising on the back of 9.7% increase in sales at the organic level, net sales were higher by 8.5%, coming above the company's guidance.
However, the company also warned of a sustained increase in input costs due to the pandemic. As a result, its adjusted operating margin is expected to fall to between 14%-15% in the current quarter from 16.2% in the three months through February. The company made no change to its guidance for the fiscal year through May 2022.
RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi on Tuesday maintained a ‘hold’ on Conagra Brands, setting a price target of $37, a shade lower than its closing level Wednesday.

Eli’s filing said patients treated with baricitinib were 2.7% less likely than those receiving standard of care to progress to ventilation or death, a difference found to be statistically insignificant.
Baricitinib is approved in the U.S. as a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and in the EU and Japan for treating atopic dermatitis.
Additional research is ongoing to further evaluate the potential role of baricitinib in Covid-19, the company said.

Tesla plans to have the factory up and running by July 1, 2021 to start building its electric crossover, the Model Y but the process has been slow and complicated by environmental disputes.
In December, Tesla was told by a court to suspend clearing of a forest at the site of the proposed factory after environmentalists said cutting down more trees could endanger hibernating snakes.
""The German approval framework for industrial and infrastructure projects as well as spatial planning directly contradicts the urgency to plan and realise such projects that is necessary to battle climate change,"" Tesla said in a letter to a local court seen by Reuters.
Tesla, in the letter dated April 7, said it was ""particularly irritating"" that there was still no timetable for the final approval of the plant, located in Gruenheide outside Berlin, 16 months after the carmaker applied for it.
The letter, first reported by newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, urges authorities to speed up processes to ensure investors have more transparency about when their investments in climate-friendly technologies pay off.

Red tape in Germany has also been a problem in the area of wind energy expansion, with some projects taking several years from application to realisation.

1424,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>","Lagarde Says Ambitious, Coordinated Fiscal Aid Remains Crucial","(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said governments can’t afford to let up efforts to support the region’s economy through the pandemic-induced crisis.
“An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains crucial, as a premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk delaying the recovery and amplifying the longer-term scarring effects,” she told a meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee on Thursday.
She added the ECB’s own measures “can be recalibrated if required to maintain favorable financing conditions.”
The ECB has unleashed a barrage of support over the past year to help the euro-area economy fight the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. It recently pledged to ramp up bond-buying under its 1.85-trillion-euro ($2.2 trillion) emergency program after yields rose and policy makers warned that the region may not be ready to absorb higher borrowing costs.
The International Monetary Fund -- which holds its spring meetings this week -- has warned about widening inequality and a divergence between economies’ recovery speeds. While it upgraded its 2021 growth forecast for the euro area to 4.4% from 4.2%, prospects elsewhere are brightening more rapidly.
The U.S. economy is set to be turbo-charged by a $1.9 trillion economic relief package, while the euro area’s joint recovery fund hasn’t even been signed off on in all member states. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday that he’s “deeply concerned” at the slow implementation of the 750 billion-euro plan.
With progress on vaccination also lagging behind, Lagarde said “national fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to firms and households most exposed to the pandemic and the associated containment measures.”
Several of her colleagues have argued that national and joint efforts in Europe will provide significant support, even if they are smaller in size than in other parts of the world.
“These numbers will unlikely match the numbers in the U.S., but I do think the efficiency of the spending in Europe is a bit higher,” Dutch Governing Council member Klaas Knot said in a CNBC interview on Thursday. “At this moment I do think that the response is appropriate but if the response needs to be stepped up then I do think there is a willingness and preparedness on the side of fiscal authorities to step"
1425,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>","Europe should invest in chip design, not a mega-fab: think tank","By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's ambition to make the most powerful computer chips risks wasting billions of euros, a German think tank said in a report on Thursday, urging policy makers to focus instead on rebuilding the region's chip design industry.
The EU executive's new goal of doubling its global semiconductor share by 2030 is doomed to fail because the bloc lacks a meaningful market that any super-advanced chip foundry could sell into, author Jan-Peter Kleinhans said.
""For an EU foundry there is simply no business case at the moment in Europe, mainly for the lack of customers,"" said Kleinhans, an analyst at the Stiftung Neue Verantwortung (SNV) think tank in Berlin.
The European Commission last month launched a 10-year plan, the Digital Compass, setting its sights on a 20% global semiconductor market share and building a fabrication plant, or fab, that can make superfast 2 nanometer chips.
The push has gained urgency due to supply-chain dislocations caused by a sharp recovery in demand for products ranging from smartphones to electric vehicles following a slump at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic a year ago.
The problem with the EU's strategy is that, unlike the United States and Asia, Europe lacks a meaningful chip design industry that could justify the cost of a mega-fab, Kleinhans told Reuters in an interview.
""In terms of volume it's simply not enough to fill a fab,"" he said. ""That would mean an EU foundry would need to attract foreign customers - this is extremely unlikely.""
Industry leaders TSMC and Samsung (KS:005930) already plan investments in the United States to serve chip design leaders like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that rely on contract manufacturers to produce their chips.
Plans by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to launch its own foundry service, or contract manufacturing operation, starting in the United States, would add to capacity and raise questions about the economics of expanding production in Europe, said Kleinhans.
Europe should instead focus on reviving its vestigial chip design industry, he said. Of its last two publicly listed ""fabless"" chipmakers one, Dialog, has just agreed to be bought for $6 billion by Japan's Renesas. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s announcement that it will invest 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in a new chip design facility in Munich, Germany, shows where the EU should be focusing its efforts.
""Apple has single-handedly done more for European-based chip design than the Commission in the past 10 years,"" said Kleinhans.

Demand for specialist housing for the elderly is growing in the United Kingdom as the population ages, with private retirement units accounting for 0.6% of British homes, according to the estate agency Knight Frank.
The investors have formed a special purpose vehicle, Brigid Investments, in which they would hold a 50% stake each, to finance about 250 completed retirement units worth about 80 million pounds.
""(The investment vehicle) provides greater choice and more flexibility and allows more people to access the benefits of retirement living,"" McCarthy Stone Chief Executive Officer John Tonkiss said in a statement on Thursday.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperforming as the Biden administration’s tax proposals may be watered down.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 10 points, or less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 125 points, or 0.9%.
The broad-based S&P 500 index closed at a record high Wednesday, ending up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, also at an all-time high, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.
The S&P and the Dow are on course for their third straight winning week, ahead of next week’s start of what is expected to be a very strong earnings season. According to data from Refinitiv, earnings for the first quarter of 2021 will see the strongest growth since the third quarter of 2018.
Helping the tone were the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, in which the policymakers acknowledged progress on the economy, but stated that substantial progress on the recovery will likely take ""some time"", i.e. the easy monetary policy is here to stay.
The Fed has made great play that the labor market recovery has much more room to run, and with this mind the weekly unemployment claims data, due later in the session, will be studied carefully.
Initial jobless claims for last week are expected to be 680,000, an improvement from 719,000 the prior week, while continuing claims are estimated to be 3.65 million, down from 3.79 million.
Also of interest were comments from President Joe Biden that he was prepared to compromise on his $2 trillion infrastructure bill, and the associated tax increases, as the package faces difficulties in passing through Congress.
The tax plan Biden laid out last week was seen hitting the big technology and pharmaceutical companies particularly hard, as it would limit them from using credits for research and development costs.
In the corporate sector, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is likely to be in focus after both the U.K. and European medical regulators stated that the drug maker’s Covid-19 vaccine was still worth the risk, even as they detailed a potential link to rare blood clotting issues.
Gaming companies, like DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN), could also see interest after New York State, looking to close a hefty funding gap, approved a budget that opens the possibility for online gaming in the state. 
Oil prices weakened Thursday after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, showed gasoline inventories rose by 4 million barrels last week, against expectations of a decline. This raised concerns about demand growth for crude in the world’s largest consumer.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $59.32 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $62.94. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,746.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1864.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura has set up an internal team to investigate a possible $2 billion loss relating to Archegos Capital Management, two people familiar with the matter said.
Archegos, a New York investment fund run by ex-Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, collapsed last month when its debt-laden bets on media companies including ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) unravelled. 
Nomura,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and other global banks, which acted as brokers for Archegos, scrambled to sell the shares they held as collateral and unwind the trades.
The loss incurred by Nomura has thrown Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank's risk management into question and attracted scrutiny from the country's regulators.
Nomura plans to disclose details related to the loss, which it disclosed in March, later this month, possibly on April 27, one of the sources told Reuters.
The bank has set up the team to look into the bank's risk management practices, said the sources, who declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
A spokesman for Nomura declined to comment.
Japanese regulators are heightening scrutiny of high-risk trades by financial firms in the wake of Archegos.

In a letter addressed to Lee on Thursday, Heng said the pandemic meant that he would likely be too old to take over as prime minister “when the crisis is over” roughly five years from now. He said a younger leader should take over instead, adding that he stands ready to support whomever is chosen by party officials.
“When I also consider the ages at which our first three prime ministers took on the job, I would have too short a runway should I become the next prime minister then,” Heng wrote. “We need a leader who will not only rebuild Singapore post-Covid-19, but also lead the next phase of our nation-building effort,” he added.
In a separate letter, Lee said he respected the decision and noted that Heng would step aside as finance minister in the next cabinet reshuffle. Channel News Asia reported that would take place in about two weeks.
“Together with the Senior Ministers, you will help me mentor the younger Ministers as the team develop and identify from among themselves another leader, in order to make a smooth and timely leadership transition,” Lee wrote.
The time frame spelled out by Heng leaves room for Lee to serve as prime minister for as long as half a decade more, unless party officials pick a new successor quickly. While Lee has previously signaled his intention to step down by the time he turns 70 in February 2022, last year he reaffirmed a pledge to stay until the country was in “good working order” following the weakest election performance ever by his ruling People’s Action Party.
In a separate statement Thursday, a group of younger party leaders said they respected Heng’s decision and asked Lee “to stay on as prime minister until such time when a new successor is chosen by the team and is ready to take over.”
“This unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning,” the 32 so-called fourth-generation party members said in a statement. “We recognize that Singaporeans will be concerned. We seek your support and understanding, as we choose another leader for the team.”
A career civil servant and politician, Heng is currently both deputy prime minister and finance minister. His soft-spoken nature and collaborative approach won him allies in the business community, but a poorer-than-expected showing in the 2020 elections drew questions about his popularity and threw the timetable for succession into doubt.
Heng was poised to become Singapore’s fourth prime minister since 1965, a period that has seen uninterrupted rule by the People’s Action Party. His ascent would’ve heralded a change in leadership style for the nation, which for all but nearly 14 years has been run by Lee or his late father, Lee Kuan Yew.
Asked about succession plans in a November interview, Lee said the pandemic presented a “huge challenge” for Singapore.
“It’s existential, really, both economically as well as from a public health point of view, and I think it’s my responsibility to see us through this crisis before I hand it over in good shape -- into good hands,” he said. “And I hope that will be before too long.”
Singapore’s economy is now showing signs of getting back on track from the worst slump in its history. Economists see Singapore’s growth recovering to a 5.9% pace this year, helped by about S$100 billion ($74 billion) in fiscal stimulus, following a 5.4% contraction in 2020 -- the country’s worst performance since independence.
Lee, who came to power in 2004, has been one of the world’s most vocal leaders calling for the U.S. and China to avoid a destructive clash that could force smaller countries like Singapore to choose sides on everything from trade and technology to Covid-19 vaccines and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The city-state supports a strong American presence in Asia by allowing the U.S. to use its military facilities while also counting China as its top trading partner.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Fixing the credit Catch-22: How Biden wants to make credit scores fairer,"By Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) - A chance conversation with a customer ended up saving Vincent Lipford, a self-employed barber in Memphis, Tennessee, more than $20,000.
The 51-year-old single father was stuck in a subprime auto loan with a 25% annualized interest rate because he lacked the credit history that would allow him to obtain financing from traditional lenders. The interest would have cost him nearly as much as the Kia Forte itself if he followed the payment plan to fruition.
When Donald Hall, regional vice president at the Hope Credit Union, strolled in one Saturday for his weekly haircut, he was alarmed to learn about Lipford's situation. He helped refinance the loan into another whose interest rate is just 4.2%, based on his mobile phone and utility bill payment history - factors that firms that determine credit scores and banks ignore. 
The changes cut Lipford's monthly payments to $400 from $640, saving more than $20,000 through the life of the loan.
""That made a huge difference. It took a lot of pressure off me,"" Lipford said. ""It's given me more financial freedom to pay some other bills and do some things with my children.""
Lipford is one of 64 million Americans who are trapped in a credit-scoring Catch-22: they cannot obtain loans from banks because they lack sufficient credit history, and they lack sufficient credit history because they cannot obtain loans from banks. 
CONSUMER ADVOCATES VS RATINGS FIRMS 
Reforming credit scores is one of U.S. President Joe Biden's many priorities as he tries to repair the financial wreckage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which disproportionately harmed minorities, women and low-income workers, according to government data. During his campaign, Biden talked about creating a public entity that would determine credit scores in a more accurate and less discriminatory way.
As it stands, lenders rely on three big rating firms -  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX), Experian Plc (LON:EXPN) and  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) - to determine creditworthiness. They generate a ""FICO"" score for borrowers, on a scale of 300 to 850, based on income, savings, assets, loans and history of debt repayment. Scores above 700 are generally considered solid.
The Biden administration wants to create an entity within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that would incorporate factors like rent and utility payments into lending decisions, three sources familiar with the plan said. 
Such a move would require congressional approval but CFPB officials are already discussing how it might be set up, the sources said.
Credit reporting firms oppose the move, saying they are already working to provide fair and affordable credit to all consumers. A public credit bureau would be bad for consumers because it would expand the government's power in an inappropriate way and its goals would shift with political winds, the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), which represents private rating firms, said in a statement.
Industry experts and consumer advocates disagree.
Almost half of consumers in low-income neighborhoods do not qualify for traditional loans under current methods, according to CFPB research. A public entity utilizing nontraditional data could change that, experts say.
""Using alternative data holds a lot of promise for the CFPB to accurately underwrite people who are 'credit invisibles,'"" said Christopher Willis, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr who helps banks work through consumer regulatory issues.
CHANGES IN THE WIND 
The CFPB has already been examining ways to make the existing system fairer. Rohit Chopra, Biden's nominee to lead the CFPB, mentioned problems with credit scores during his testimony before a Senate committee on March 2. 
Nearly 60% of complaints the CFPB received last year were about errors and other issues with credit scores. Under Chopra, the bureau would push private firms to fix inaccurate information, the sources said.
CFPB officials are also discussing how to use artificial intelligence in lending decisions, sources said. The bureau may issue guidelines to ensure lenders can use algorithms in a manner that is inclusive and does not reinforce discriminatory practices, they said.
The CFPB declined to comment on any of the issues.
The bureau and other U.S. regulators said last week they were seeking public input on the growing use of AI by financial institutions.
The planned changes could help people like Andrew Ballentine, 48, a skilled laborer from Cleveland, Ohio, who had his hours cut during the pandemic.
Without much credit history, Ballentine was unable to qualify with traditional lenders. Eventually, HFLA of Northeast Ohio, a nonprofit, offered him a $1,500 interest-free loan.

""If they weren't there, I hate to think what would have happened to me,"" he said. ""I would probably have been evicted.""

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it plans to argue that it faces abundant competition in the market for video game transactions to defend itself against antitrust allegations by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, the iPhone maker said on Thursday.
Epic sued Apple last year in federal court in California, alleging the 15% to 30% commissions that Apple charges for the use of its in-app payment systems and Apple's longstanding practice of exercising control over which apps can be installed on its devices amount to anticompetitive behavior. The dispute arose after Epic tried to implement its own in-app payment system in the popular ""Fortnite"" game and Apple subsequently banned the game from its App Store.
The case is to be heard in May in Oakland, California, by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG), who will have to rule on which notion of a ""market"" is the correct one for analyzing Apple's moves for signs of anticompetitive conduct.
Epic has framed its case around the idea that Apple's iPhones, with an installed base of more than 1 billion users, represent their own distinct market for software developers. Epic has argued that Apple has monopoly power over that market because it decides how users can install software on the devices and says it abuses that power by forcing developers to deliver their software through the App Store, where developers are subject to fees on some transactions.
In a filing that Apple planned to make Thursday, the company rejected that notion and said the proper market to analyze the case is the video game transaction market, which includes platforms such as Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox gaming consoles, which also limit the software that can run on their hardware and charge fees to developers. 

Apple said it plans to argue that consumers have many choices on how to carry out video game transactions, including purchasing virtual tokens from game developers on other platforms such as Windows PCs and using the tokens on iPhones with no fees to the game developer.

Chip shortages have caused delays in a key step in MacBook production, the report said, adding that some iPad assembly was postponed because of a shortage of displays and display components. (https://s.nikkei.com/3uAZhI7)
As a result of the delay, Apple has pushed back a portion of component orders for the two devices from the first half of this year to the second half, the report said, citing sources briefed on the matter.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
According to the report, Apple's production plans for iPhones have not been affected by the supply shortage, however, the supply of some components for the devices is ""quite tight"".

The shortage of components remains a supply chain issue for Apple, but has not yet impacted any product availability for consumers, Nikkei added. 
Apple's major supplier Foxconn has also warned of the chip shortage affecting supply chains to clients, with businesses and consumers across the globe facing the brunt of an unprecedented shortage in semiconductor microchips.

The central bank saw the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, recovering quickly, but indicated there was much more progress needed before low interest rates and the pace of asset purchases were changed.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock rose 1.1% after updates from the U.K. and European medical regulators turned out less negative than feared for its Covid-19 vaccine. Both regulators restated that the benefits of taking the vaccines outweigh the risks, although both acknowledged a possible link to blood clotting disorders. U.K. medical data indicate 19 deaths from such clots. The U.K. has administered over 20 million shots of AstraZeneca's vaccine.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Avelo Airlines, an ultra-low-cost carrier created by a former United Airlines executive, made its debut on Thursday with plans for service between secondary airports on the U.S. West Coast and one-way fares starting at $19. 
Backed by $125 million in private equity, Avelo will begin operations from its first base at Hollywood Burbank Airport just outside Los Angeles, with flights starting April 28.
Although travel demand has dropped during the pandemic, the downturn has opened opportunities including gate capacity at Burbank and cheaper aircraft as large carriers scaled back operations globally, Avelo's founder and chief executive, Andrew Levy, told Reuters.
""There's market opportunities that would have been harder for us to tackle a year ago,"" said Levy, the co-founder and former president of low-cost carrier Allegiant Airlines and chief financial officer of United Airlines. 
Avelo will begin with 11 non-stop routes from Burbank and three Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 planes with 189 seats and one-way fares starting at $19. It expects to have at least six airplanes and around 400 employees by the end of year, Levy said.
U.S. airlines executives have recently pointed to large pent-up travel demand as the economy reopens and more Americans receive COVID-19 vaccinations, a desire Levy hopes to tap into with low fares.
""Demand is coming back quickly. It's still nowhere near what it used to be so I think in the short term prices will be really low, but we're built for that,"" he said.
Another U.S. start-up, Breeze Airways based in Salt Lake City and backed by aviation veteran David Neeleman, is preparing to begin low-cost flights on routes it says have been abandoned by larger carriers.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>","Uniqlo owner posts 23% jump in HY profit, raises annual profit estimate","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Fast Retailing, the owner of clothing brand Uniqlo, on Thursday reported a 23% jump in half-yearly operating profit and raised its full-year profit estimate.
The company has been among the most resilient retailers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Uniqlo's focus on China and Japan helped it escape the worst of the downturn that hit the United States and Europe.
Fast Retailing said operating profit was 168 billion yen ($1.53 billion) in the six months through February, against 136.7 billion yen a year earlier.
The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to 255 billion yen from 245 billion yen. The average estimate in a Refinitiv poll of 15 analysts was 262.9 billion yen. 
During the pandemic, Uniqlo briskly sold masks and saw strong demand for its stay-at-home jogging pants and other comfortable apparel.
However, the company is now dealing with crises in Myanmar and China that are upsetting its supply chain and one of its most important foreign markets.
Fires broke out at two of Fast Retailing's partner factories in Myanmar last month amid unrest that followed a military coup. The company has had to halt operations at some facilities in the country due to martial law conditions.
In China, the company and other Western brands are facing a backlash over criticisms of alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang province. Fast Retailing operates about 800 Uniqlo stores on the mainland, about the same number as its home market of Japan.
Western brands including H&M, Burberry,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) have been hit by consumer boycotts in China for raising concerns about forced labour in Xinjiang, a major producer of cotton. Five brand ambassadors for Fast Retailing in China have quit amid the backlash.

Only 785,500 J&J doses will be allocated, compared to 4.95 million doses this week. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and J&J did not immediately respond to requests, made outside regular hours, for comment on the drop in numbers.
A New York Times report last week said that workers at an Emergent BioSolutions facility in Baltimore, which produced both AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and J&J doses, mixed up ingredients of the two vaccines, ruining 15 million J&J doses.
However, the Baltimore facility has not yet been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and a federal health official told Reuters last week that none of the vaccine doses from the plant have been used in vaccination efforts so far.
J&J has reiterated that it expected to deliver 100 million doses to the government by the end of May.
According to the CDC data, California is the main recipient of the J&J vaccine, followed by Texas and Florida. The vaccine allocation for California is down by about 88%, with the state set to receive only a maximum of 67,600 doses next week.
A California health official told Reuters that the number will be down further in the week starting April 18, with only 22,400 doses of the J&J vaccine allocated to the state.

U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday moved up the COVID-19 vaccine eligibility target for all American adults to April 19.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 02:40AM ET</span>",Analysis: Mexico vs Brazil: Populist presidents confound investors,"By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When a left wing populist and a far-right lawmaker rose to power in Latin America's two largest economies, investors thought they knew who was going to show them the money.
But more than two years and a costly pandemic later, disillusioned investors are now busy shifting from a Brazil that once promised compelling reforms and privatizations into a Mexico expected to benefit from a U.S. economic rebound.
Investor worries that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador would overspend to appease the base that handed him a landslide victory in 2018 have yet to materialize, and neither have President Jair Bolsonaro's promises to streamline the Brazilian economy.
Lopez Obrador ""is 'less bad' than investors had expected, and the Bolsonaro administration has been 'less good' than investors had expected,"" said Marshall Stocker, portfolio manager at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) in Boston.
While their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic seemed in tune at times as they mixed denial with distrust of science, their financial responses have been sharply different.
Bolsonaro spent an extra 8.6% of gross domestic product on the response while Lopez Obrador barely spent an extra 0.6% of GDP, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.
""The glass-half-full read is that Mexico did not engage in any of the aggressive fiscal loosening policies that its neighbors did,"" said Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at Emso Asset Management in New York.
This, alongside hopes that a $1.9 billion U.S. economic recovery package signed by President Joe Biden will fuel strong growth to the north, is spurring a change in investor sentiment. 
While both countries suffered foreign investor outflows in February, Mexico stocks and bonds attracted $355 million in the first three weeks of March versus Brazil outflows of $465 million, data from the Institute of International Finance shows.
The IMF this week raised the outlook for Mexico's 2021 GDP by 0.7% to 5.0%, while nudging Brazil up by 0.1% to 3.7%.
The shift in favor of Mexico has been further supported by the COVID-19 situation in Brazil where deaths are expected to soon surpass the worst of a record wave in the United States in January.
Brazil has so far reported more than 13 million infections and over 336,000 deaths, while Mexico has reported more than 2.2 million cases and about 205,000 deaths, a Reuters tally shows.
Bolsonaro asked the armed forces this week if they had troops available to control possible social unrest stemming from the COVID-19 crisis.
""Bolsonaro has lost the support of much of the business community, the bulk of the population and part of the top brass of the military,"" Elizabeth Johnson, managing director of Brazil research at TS Lombard, said in a note.
Infighting over the budget has soured relationships between the executive and Congress, she added. (Graphic: Mexico vs Brazil, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqzqngpx/Mexico%20vs%20Brazil.PNG) 
BRAZIL VULNERABLE
Bolsonaro caught investors by surprise in February when he fired the head of the national oil company Petrobras after a battle over fuel price hikes. 
Last month, the CEO of Banco do Brasil, the largest state-controlled bank, resigned after a tussle with Bolsonaro over branch closings.
Brazil's financial markets have not fully recovered from the sell-offs generated by these moves.
The real is down over 7% this year against the dollar, versus an around 1% drop for the peso. If the greenback were to firm further, the effect of a weaker currency would benefit more export-oriented Mexico over Brazil, where a weaker real would mostly add to inflation pressures.
Fiscal imbalances too are making Brazil more vulnerable to U.S. Treasury yield rises, with local benchmark bond yields flirting with highs last seen a year ago. 
The possibility that leftist former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could run against Bolsonaro next year is also piling up pressure on Bolsonaro to boost social spending and diminishing the chances of legislative reforms. 
It is less likely that key administrative and tax reforms will soon be passed, but ""even if they get any of these reforms done, they would be very much watered down with a very back-loaded fiscal adjustment,"" said Gordon Bowers, an analyst at Columbia Threadneedle's emerging markets debt team. (Graphic: 2021 foreign portfolio flows to equities and debt, https://graphics.reuters.com/MEXICO-BRAZIL/FUNDS/yzdvxewzzpx/chart.png) 
An oversold Brazil could still offer opportunities for value hunters, some investors say.
""Brazil's politics are messy and its communication is poor, but the rules still work and the government can maintain control of the path,"" said Ricardo Adrogue, head of global sovereign debt and currencies at Barings. ""There is budget to increase social protection, and the deficit won't be explosive.""

""The rest is just noise,"" he added, ""and maybe a great investment opportunity.""

Toyota's latest launch comes as automakers, electric car startups and tech giants invest heavily in so-called active safety features. 
The Japanese carmaker's new driving assist technology, or Advanced Drive, features a level 2 autonomous system that helps driving, such as limiting the car in its lane, maintaining the distance from other vehicles and changing lanes under the driver's supervision on expressways or other motor-vehicle only roads.
The luxury sedan Lexus LS will be on sale from Thursday, costing between about 16.3 million yen ($148,627.70) and 17.9 million yen, while the second-generation Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car will be offered on April 12 at between 8.4 million and 8.6 million yen.
The new models are Toyota's first products brought to the market that provide over-the-air updates and utilise AI technology centred on deep learning, said Toyota executive James Kuffner, who is also the head of Toyota's research unit Woven Planet.
""This is really an important first step in our journey towards software-first development,"" he said at an online briefing on Thursday, adding that the company has tried to design the software to be truly global and to provide re-usability.
In the future, software features on cars will be ""upgradable"" and ""more customisable"" much like how people personalise their smartphones, Kuffner added.
Fully self-driven cars are still likely to be years away, but rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) early this year made a splash at the virtual Consumer Electronics Show with a fully-autonomous all-electric flying Cadillac concept, while Chinese search engine operator Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) unveiled a partnership with local car brand Geely.

Toyota's domestic competitor, Honda Motor Co Ltd, last month unveiled a partially self-driving Legend sedan in Japan, becoming the world's first carmaker to sell a vehicle equipped with new, certified level 3 automation technology.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Thursday, helped by another record close on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to an ultra-easy monetary policy.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%. 
Overnight, the broad-based S&P 500 index closed 0.2% higher on Wall Street at a new record close while moves in Asia have also been largely upward, creating a positive handover for European markets.
This tone has been largely based on the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, during which the U.S. central bank kept its accommodative policy in place. 
The minutes indicated that while Fed officials saw the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, recovering quickly, there was much more progress needed before low interest rates and the pace of asset purchases are changed.
European markets could also be helped by the announcements from the U.K. and European medicines regulators on Wednesday that the benefits of taking the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Covid-18 vaccine still outweigh the risks, while suggesting age restrictions, even if there is a potential link between the shot and very rare occurrences of blood clotting issues.
Continental Europe is still struggling with a third wave of Covid-19 cases, with authorities in several Spanish regions tightening mobility restrictions on Wednesday to rein in a rising infection rate.
In corporate news, Swiss banking giant UBS (SIX:UBSG) holds its annual general meeting, which will generate some interest after rival Credit Suisse’s recent difficulties with its dealing with Archegos hedge fund.
Additionally, Swedish-Swiss electrical equipment retailer ABB (ST:ABB) has announced a new share buyback plan, and British online fashion retailer ASOS (LON:ASOS) said earnings per share tripled in the six months through February. Homeware retailer Dunelm (LON:DNLM) also reported, saying it expects full-year profit to be above the top end of the current range of analyst forecasts.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Robinhood failed to disclose certain trade executions to public feed,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail brokerage Robinhood Financial did not report a certain type of stock trade it executed for customers last year to a public data feed, according to regulatory data analyzed by Reuters and a source familiar with the matter. 
So-called fractional shares are offered by many brokerages. They let investors buy a slice of a share instead of the whole thing, so rather than forking out more than $3,000 on a share of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), an investor can buy as little as $1 worth. 
Brokerages are required to report all their trades to trade execution facilities (TRFs), according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. FINRA’s enforcement has fined other brokerages, including Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB)'s U.S. securities division, for violations of its reporting and supervisory rules in the past. LINKS: https:// https://reut.rs/3mhgtzK https://reut.rs/3cBYssD https://reut.rs/3m7ybpj https://reut.rs/2PN10eA https://reut.rs/3diuzwA Robinhood launched its fractional share service in December 2019, according to its website, but only began publicly reporting trade executions the week of Jan. 25, 2021, FINRA data relating to over-the-counter transactions show. Data before then does not show any trades reported by Robinhood.  Robinhood's lack of reporting to a trade execution facility was confirmed by a person familiar with the company who asked not to be identified in order to discuss a matter that is not public.  Reuters could not determine how many trades Robinhood failed to report. As of Dec. 31, Robinhood users held $802.5 million in shares bought through its fractional share program, the brokerage said in a regulatory filing. Many of those purchases may have been executed by wholesale brokers. A spokeswoman for Robinhood declined to comment on the reporting issue, but said the company, which had 13 million customers as of November, only executes a ""very small percentage of its fractional orders from its own inventory.""  A spokesman for FINRA, which polices brokerages, declined to comment.  When stocks trade on exchanges, everyone can see the activity. But when stocks trade over-the-counter, as is the case with Robinhood, investors rely on brokers to report the trades to the TRF. The information helps determine share prices. When certain trades are not publicly reported, it diminishes the amount of information available to market participants, and could create an unlevel playing field, FINRA says. Still, some experts said that while the omission was sufficiently serious to warrant fines to keep it from happening again, it was not a major lapse. That’s because the number of trades that went unreported would be a small fraction of the overall trading, these people said.  ""Should they deserve to get a parking ticket for it? Yes. Should it be painful enough that they don’t do it again? Yes,"" said James Angel, finance professor at Georgetown University who specializes in market structure, when Reuters presented the data to him. ""Should it be so overwhelming that it puts them out of business? Heck no.""  The reporting lapse came as the company, which last month filed for an initial public offering that sources told Reuters values it at around $30 billion, was expanding rapidly and legions of new retail traders were entering the market.  FINRA rules state that all trades have to be reported - including trades of less than a share - in the name of transparency, since market participants may base decisions on understanding not just prices but who is trading what and when. Unlike orders for full shares, which Robinhood sends en-masse to wholesale brokers to execute, Robinhood says its clearing broker arm, Robinhood Securities, executes fractional trades from its own account, which it is licensed to do by the FINRA.  
Robinhood executed around 1.86 million tier-one shares during the week of March 15, and around 3.51 million tier-two shares the week of March 1, the latest FINRA data show. Tier-one securities include stocks in the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 1000 Index, and exchange-traded products, while tier-two includes smaller companies.

The minutes also downplayed the risk of inflation from the recent surge in Treasury yields, instead maintaining that the surge reflects stronger growth prospects. Investors have scaled back their most aggressive positioning for interest rates to start rising by the end of 2022 in response.
“The rate side is still somewhat front-and-center, and probably the biggest risk to what is going on with equity valuations... clearly, there’s been a repricing of inflation expectations higher this year, and at times, the stock market has struggled with it,” Penn Mutual Asset Management chief investment officer Mark Heppenstall told Bloomberg.
Yields steadied on Thursday, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note remaining below a 14-month high of 1.776% hit on Mar. 30.
“We’ve already seen long-term 10-year rates jump up and with the Fed telling us they are not going to move so interest rates could stay at the lows that they are until maybe 2022 when they step in,” Cornerstone Wealth Group managing partner Jeff Carbone told Reuters.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also unveiled details of a plan that is estimated to bring back about $2 trillion in corporate profits into the U.S. tax net. The profits are likely to fund U.S. spending initiatives, in turn reducing reliance on further borrowing that could drive rates higher."

More than 3,200 mail ballots were received by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), in an election open to over 5,800 workers at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, the union said. The workers are voting on whether to join the RWDSU and have their warehouse be the first Amazon facility ever to unionize in the United States.
According to the RWDSU, hundreds of ballots were challenged ""mostly by the employer."" Ballots can be challenged by the union, Amazon or the NLRB if they were believed to have been tampered, fraudulent or from a worker ineligible to vote.
Amazon and the NLRB both did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

By comparison, 432 other mail-ballot elections from mid-March 2020 through September 2020 saw turnout of 72%, according to data disclosed by the NLRB in a decision last year. In the nearly six months prior to that — pre-dating the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States — mail-ballot turnout was 55%, the NLRB decision document said.
The public vote count is expected to begin Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, the RWDSU said.

1451,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>","Jobless Claims, Online Gambling, Fintech: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- The markets were muted as everyone waited to hear the Fed’s thoughts on the current state of the economy.
The indexes have surged to record highs in recent days as a strong vaccine rollout and reopening trade overcame fears that inflation is in danger of running hot.
But the Fed is more focused on the labor market recovery, as its meeting minutes from last month’s policy meeting showed on Wednesday. The green shoots are sprouting, but the economy still needs help, the Fed said.
At last month’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee let interest rates alone at zero to 0.25% and promised to keep bond purchases at a monthly pace of $120 billion.
While job data has shown the labor market is rebounding, there is still much room for improvement. More data on unemployment claims is due out on Thursday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Who’s still left behind?
After a series of stronger than expected economic reports in recent days, attention now turns to who has still been left behind in the reopening. President Joe Biden is out promoting his jobs and infrastructure plan, which has come under pressure from Republicans for not spending enough on actual infrastructure. Half the $2 trillion package goes to building out broadband, retooling manufacturing, rehabilitating schools and other projects.
Initial jobless claims for last week are expected to be 680,000 down from 719,000 the prior week. Continuing claims are estimated to be 3.65 million down from 3.79 million the prior week. The data comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Gambling’s going on here
New York State, looking to close a $15 billion funding gap, approved a budget that makes way for online gaming, a long-anticipated move that could generate millions in tax revenue. It could also boost the shares of gaming companies DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) and  Penn National Gaming Inc  (NASDAQ:PENN) as well as casino companies like MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) that have been building out e-gaming and online sports books. 
3. Banks vs. fintech
Plaid has tripled its valuation just months after scuttling a deal with  Visa Inc  Class A (NYSE:V), another sign of the growing threat of fintech on big banks. The company announced a $425 million funding round on Wednesday, boosting its valuation to $13.4 billion. Another fintech, Robinhood, is preparing a public offering, while more established players like  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) have gained ground in the payments business.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders that competition is intensifying, adding that “acquisitions are in our future and fintech is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission followed an appeal by Amazon to block the non-binding proposal from being voted on at the company's upcoming annual meeting.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) did not notify the more than 530 million users whose details were obtained through the misuse of a feature before 2019 and recently made public in a database, and does not currently have plans to do so, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. 
Business Insider reported last week that phone numbers and other details from user profiles were available in a public database. Facebook said in a blog post on Tuesday that ""malicious actors"" had obtained the data prior to September 2019 by ""scraping"" profiles using a vulnerability in the platform's tool for synching contacts.
The Facebook spokesman said the social media company was not confident it had full visibility on which users would need to be notified. He said it also took into account that users could not fix the issue and that the data was publicly available in deciding not to notify users. Facebook has said it plugged the hole after identifying the problem at the time. 
The scraped information did not include financial information, health information or passwords, Facebook said. However, the collated data could provide valuable information for hacks or other abuses.
Facebook, which has long been under scrutiny over how it handles user privacy, in 2019 reached a landmark settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its investigation into allegations the company misused user data. 
Ireland's Data Protection Commission, the European Union's lead regulator for Facebook, said on Tuesday it had contacted the company about the data leak. It said it received ""no proactive communication from Facebook"" but was now in contact.
The July 2019 FTC settlement requires Facebook to report details about unauthorized access to data on 500 or more users within 30 days of confirming an incident.

The Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the company's conversations with regulators but said it was in contact to answer their questions.

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.
Exxon has hired investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said. 
The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.
AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002. 

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 12:35PM ET</span>",Analysis: Credit Suisse in search of new map after losing way with Archegos,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - Thomas Gottstein may have acted decisively enough this week to stay as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) chief executive, but investors are likely to want more radical action after the bank's $4.7 billion loss from the Archegos hedge fund scandal.
Credit Suisse shares have dropped by 25% in the space of a month, with Switzerland's second biggest bank reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management.
This has left 57-year-old Swiss citizen Gottstein facing the daunting task of limiting the longer-term damage to the bank's reputation and retaining both clients and staff.
""It's very disappointing what has happened in the last few months - it's well below the standard we have expected,"" one investor in Credit Suisse debt told Reuters. 
Yet Gottstein's hands will be tied until Antonio Horta-Osorio, known as AHO to some of the staff at Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY) where he is CEO, is installed as chairman, analysts and investors said, adding that the deeper impact is yet to be felt.
""The full consequences from the reputational loss will only be visible over time,"" Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontobel bank, said of the recent events.
Credit Suisse said on Tuesday that it would take a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.71 billion) charge after Archegos ""failed"" to meet margin commitments.
The scale of the charge, which is close to three times the investment bank's profit last year, far eclipses the $2.3 billion rogue trader loss at rival UBS in 2011.
Swiss banks have not been afraid to jettison CEOs if things do not go to plan. The rogue trader affair triggered the departure of Oswald Grubel from UBS, while Gottstein's predecessor Tidjane Thiam was ousted over a spying scandal.
Gottstein, a former investment banker and wealth manager who only took the helm a year ago, has responded quickly, replacing the head of the investment bank and the bank's risk chief.
This followed his announcement that Credit Suisse's asset management unit was to be separated from its wealth business after it was forced to shut $10 billion of funds that invested solely in bonds issued by Greensill.
WAITING FOR AHO
Investors expect broader changes will be hard to undertake until two externally-conducted inquiries into Archegos and Greensill and the change of chairman are complete. 
""This transition is a job guarantee for Thomas Gottstein in the short term,"" a source familiar with the matter said.
Urs Rohner, who has been at the bank since 2011, is due to leave Credit Suisse at the end of April, with retail banking specialist Horta-Osório due to be elected at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting.
""We hope that the change of chairman planned for the next AGM will allow the establishment of a new corporate culture with a more focused approach on risk management,"" Ethos, a firm which advises shareholders on how to vote at AGMs, said.
Ethos has asked that the two investigations examine the board's accountability and the results are made public.
The change of chairman has posed problems for some seeking reassurance during a turbulent time for the bank.
""I don't really know who to turn to,"" one senior advisor said, adding: ""Gottstein has been weakened, Rohner will be gone soon and Horta-Osorio hasn't arrived yet. Everything is in flux, but leadership is needed now.""
A source close to Credit Suisse said that were it not for the planned change of chairman, the bank might already have embarked on significant structural changes. 
In the interim, Credit Suisse has been combing through exposures in its brokerage prime services, another source said, and a more thorough review is expected to result in it reducing risk within the unit and its broader investment bank.
The more immediate concern is if clients and some of its top employees shift away following the most recent scandals. 
One headhunter in Hong Kong said that he had received several inquiries from employees in Credit Suisse's markets business looking to leave in the wake of the Archegos scandal.
The chairman of a wealth management boutique in Monaco said he saw a chance to lure some top Credit Suisse private bankers.
""For someone like us, as a boutique, and other competitors of Credit Suisse, it's a great opportunity to gain more market share with the ultra high net worth segment,"" the wealth manager, who declined to be named, added.
Credit Suisse declined comment on a potential loss of staff.
Christian Meissner, who is to take charge of the investment bank following Chin's exit, has been tasked with retaining talent and winning business in areas where Credit Suisse is doing well, such as listing special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), a source close to the Austrian banker said. 
""People won't quit just yet, they would need to find new jobs first and this gives Meissner time to show they can still be competitive and win mandates,"" the source said.
Gottstein told Swiss newspaper NZZ on Tuesday that he still believed in the ""one bank"" model where divisions work together to serve wealthy clients, saying it ""enhances"" risk management.
If he sticks with the model, he will need to map a path to profitability, while keeping a much tighter rein on risk.
""They've lost earnings and they won't get it back until they find another way,"" Jason Teh, chief investment officer at Vertum Asset Management in Sydney, said.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",Wall Street ticks lower in choppy trading ahead of Fed minutes,"By Shivani Kumaresan and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes dipped in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors cautiously awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting last month that could offer clues on the central bank's views on inflation and an economic recovery.
The industrials, materials and healthcare sectors weighed the most on the S&P 500.
Massive fiscal stimulus and swift vaccinations prompted several Fed officials at the meeting last month to project interest rate increases as early as next year, opening up a gap with those who do not see rates rising until 2024 at the earliest.
""The Fed leadership has generally not been concerned with the recent rise in interest rates, suggesting it reflects a pickup in growth rather than inflation. Any signs of inflation is ... generally expected to be transitory,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group in New York.
""It will be interesting to see if the Fed held uniformly to this view in its meeting, or if members at least discussed actions the committee might take if rising rates posed a risk to economic growth.""
Value stocks, which include economically sensitive sectors, maintain a strong lead this year over their growth counterparts, dominantly tech-related firms. 
However, a resurgence in demand for tech stocks in recent sessions amid renewed restrictions in Canada and parts of Europe has raised questions over the longevity of value trade.
Growth stocks outperformed value shares on Wednesday.
""We do not believe the reopening trade has run its course. The Biden administration's infrastructure stimulus plans would only add fuel to this fire,"" Benowitz said.
The upcoming earnings season and progress in a multi-trillion infrastructure proposal could decide the path forward for markets.
Analysts have raised their expectations for first-quarter S&P 500 profit increase to a 24.2%, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of April 1, versus 21% forecast on Feb. 5.
The sharp run up in earnings expectations could set up for disappointment, a market expert said.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the United States could be in store for an economic boom through 2023 if more adults get vaccinated and federal spending continues.
At 11:47 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 52.86 points, or 0.16% , to 33,377.38, the S&P 500 lost 1.02 points, or 0.03 %, to 4,072.92 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 15.45 points, or 0.11 %, to 13,682.93.
Prison operator GEO Group fell about 19% after suspending quarterly dividend payments.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.7-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.4-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 20 new lows.

Investing.com – Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) shares climbed more than 1% after Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris reiterated a buy rating along with his $95 price target for the stock.
The price target is 13% higher than the stock’s current level.
Morris said the company is well-positioned for significant financial growth in 2021 given continued high consumer engagement, improved advertiser tools and global expansion.
Morris said data from Amazon’s Alexa Rank indicates Pinterest showed further engagement momentum during the first quarter.
The analyst said that data from App Annie shows Pinterest’s monthly average user rankings reached the top five in existing regions including France, Germany, Turkey and the U.K. in 2020. He said this is a clear positive for user trends.
“In Brazil and Mexico, as well as Japan and South Korea, Pinterest also ranks within the top five social apps, which we think presents a positive setup for incremental, newer-region monetization. Note that Pinterest has launched in Latin America beginning with Brazil and plans to expand further within the region throughout 2021,"" he noted.

Investing.com -- Bright Horizons (NYSE:BFAM) fell more than 7% after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded shares on changing work habits.
Bright Horizons provides day care to, among others, working parents who need occasional support. Working from home has changed those needs, and revenue and profit have accordingly decreased. Nonetheless, Morgan Stanely noted that its a valuation has recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
""With the potential for changing on-site work dynamics post COVID, we think this could result in daycare becoming more local to employee homes and lead to increased competition for BFAM,"" said analyst Toni Kaplan, according to StreetInsider. ""This may pressure top-line growth and drive multiple contraction for BFAM's valuation that has recovered to pre-COVID levels.""
Kaplan downgraded Bright Horizons to a sell-equivalent from neutral with a price target of $150 from $153. 
Shares had rallied about 50% over the past 12 months, despite lower sales as a result of the pandemic-driven work from home trend.

“We believe the actual valuation should be closer to ~$10.8 billion. After scrutinizing Vimeo’s disclosures at their March 24 analyst day, we conducted a proprietary survey of corporate customers that found a market far larger than expected; growing faster than most investors probably appreciate; with pricing upside that provides a significant tailwind,” Blackledge wrote in his note.

The company was looking to raise as much as $2.13 billion by selling 25 million shares at a price range of $75 to $85 per share. It had hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to lead its IPO, Reuters reported last year.
The Palo Alto, California-based company is the latest player in the mobile gaming industry looking to cash in on the surge in demand for video games from people staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the past 18 months, firms including DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc, Playtika Holding Corp and Roblox Corp have taken the market route to raise capital.
At a 2018 tech summit hosted by 3Q Digital and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Chief Executive Adam Foroughi had said when the company was founded in 2012 as an advertising platform for mobile games he struggled to raise capital as venture capitalists did not believe in his vision.
AppLovin now has over 410 million daily active users on its platform and its apps consist of more than 200 free-to-play mobile games, including Word Connect, Slap Kings and Bingo Story. 
It posted a net loss of around $126 million last year, compared with a net profit of $119 million in 2019. Its revenue surged 46% to $1.45 billion in 2020.
AppLovin will be listed on the Nasdaq and will trade under the ticker symbol ""APP"".

Investing.com -- Fibrogen plummeted 37% after saying Tuesday there were inconsistencies in how some safety data were classified for its roxadustat drug for chronic kidney disease.
That led to a slew of downgrades as the company said it cannot conclude that the medicine cuts the risk of heart failure, stroke or other cardiovascular events compared to dialysis and other current treatments, Fibrogen said in a statement.  
Mizuho Securities lowered the stock to neutral from buy, reducing the price target to $29 from $72 on higher risk and uncertainty around timelines to regulatory approvals following the clarification of previously disclosed cardiovascular safety analyses on roxadustat, according to StreetInsider. 
Fibrogen previously tumbled after saying March 1 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would hold an advisory committee meeting to review the new drug application for roxadustat in the U.S.  
Mizuho said clinical data previously shared with the scientific and investment community included post-hoc adjustments resulting in more favorable safety data. New data presented using pre-specified criteria still support the benefit/risk profile of roxa, 
""We were surprised by the news and believe this creates higher risk in the near term, and uncertainty around timelines to potential approval,"" Mizuho analyst Difei Yang wrote in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - Deliveroo shares rose on Wednesday, the first day retail investors could trade stock bought during the food delivery group's initial public offering (IPO), while some of its riders cycled through London to demand fair pay. 
At 1411 GMT on the first day of unrestricted trading, Deliveroo's shares were up 2.1% at 286 pence, but still about 25% lower than the IPO price, following a hefty first day tumble when it made its stock market debut in London last week.
Deliveroo was given an initial valuation of 7.6 billion pounds ($10.46 billion) through a 390 pence price tag per share. 
""Though Deliveroo has risen...on the first day of trading available to retail investors, it's too soon to tell whether this is a vote of confidence in the stock,"" said Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex.
""The real test for the company is going to be the coming months.""
About 100 cyclists and moped riders rode from Shoreditch in East London to Deliveroo's headquarters in the City on Wednesday, asking for fair pay and basic workers' rights during a demonstration organised by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB).
""Sometimes I'm able to earn a living wage that I'm comfortable with for one shift. And then the next shift I can go out and work for hours, and literally earn nothing,"" Kerry Hargadon, 25, who has been a Deliveroo rider for six years, told Reuters. 
""5 POUNDS AN HOUR"" 
Musician Jason Bond, 32, who started riding for Deliveroo when work dried up at the start of the pandemic, said that while some shifts brought in decent pay, others left him with less than the minimum wage. 
""You can be earning 5 pounds an hour,"" he said. 
A Deliveroo spokesperson said that in a survey carried out on Tuesday, 88% of riders said they were happy with the company. 
""This small self appointed union (IWGB) does not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over £13 an hour,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.
The poor stock market debut in London, which saw around two billion pounds wiped off Deliveroo's valuation, came after heavyweight investors such as Aberdeen  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) and  Aviva  (LON:AV) sat the deal out, citing concerns about gig-economy working conditions and the outsized voting rights that will be handed to founder Will Shu. 
Antonio De Negri, founder and CEO of London financial boutique Cirdan Capital said the company needed to recoup this lost value. 
""One solution could be, for example, to offer part of the shares with more voting rights to those institutional investors interested in the business model of the British platform,"" he said. 
""SMILING THROUGH THE PAIN"" 
Still, for some investors, the gig-economy model remains shaky at best, with workers considered independent contractors with few legal rights and benefits.
In March, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) announced following a court defeat that it would offer guaranteed entitlements to its more than 70,000 UK drivers, including holiday pay, a pension plan and limited minimum wage. 
Deliveroo said in its IPO prospectus that it is involved in legal proceedings in a number of countries as it faces challenges around the status of its drivers.
Small retail investors who bought shares via a ""community"" share offer, allowing Deliveroo's customers to participate in the listing, were hurt by the first day losses as London Stock Exchange rules prevented them from trading until today.

""I am smiling through the pain and going to hold. I will ride it to 0 if I have to,"" said Sam Elliot, a London-based primatologist who invested 250 pounds.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss luxury watch brands have long considered the market for pre-owned watches as a potential threat to their business, but now their view is shifting as they see it can provide valuable insights into pricing and demand.
Initially seen as cannibalising sales of new watches, the pre-owned market has become the best place to assess the value of a watch over time and provide liquidity to watch owners who want to trade in their watch for a new one.
Richemont, which owns Cartier, has so far been the only big luxury goods company to embrace the pre-owned market with its acquisition of online store Watchfinder in 2018.
Watchfinder has just launched a home collection service to make transactions easier during the pandemic. 
Justin Reis, chief executive of pre-owned platform WatchBox, said the size of the pre-owned watch market was estimated at $16 billion and WatchBox's business was growing about 25% per year, including last year, when sales of new watches took a severe hit.
""We've seen so much in terms of new tailwinds pushing this sector. There's been a cultural change where people are more emphatic about collectibles,"" Reis told Reuters.
Reis said prices for popular Rolex, Patek Philippe or Audemars Piguet models had increased by around 25% and smaller independent brands like H. Moser & Cie, F.P. Journe or De Bethune were also gaining traction on WatchBox.
WatchBox and Watchfinder both set out as online platforms, but now also have some physical showrooms.
H. Moser & Cie head Edouard Meylan told Reuters demand for the brand's new watches had benefited from the ""good job"" WatchBox and peers were doing in the second-hand market. 
""Some brands still try to fight this market instead of working with it,"" Meylan said. ""We monitor it almost day by day, it gives us indications on prices, on what we should produce,"" he said in an interview ahead of the Watches & Wonders virtual industry event launched on Wednesday.. 
Watch brands like Audemars Piguet and established retailers like Bucherer have already started selling pre-owned watches, while eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) recently launched an authenticity guarantee for luxury watches sold on its marketplace. 
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox, who estimated the size of the pre-owned market at close to $20 billion, said brands used to see the secondary market as a channel for discounted grey market products, but tighter controls had helped ease that problem with some pre-owned models now selling at a premium.

""This is a positive,"" Cox said. ""It is part of the change that ultimately can rejuvenate an industry that struggled for much of the last decade.""

""One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.
The findings come as a major hurdle in the global fight against the pandemic and a shift in the stance of the regulator, which had last week backed the vaccine and said there was no increased risk of blood clots in general from the shot.
It is also a blow to AstraZeneca, which was a frontrunner in the race for making an effective vaccine against COVID-19 ever since it began working with the University of Oxford.

The EMA's safety committee, which was assessing the vaccine, has requested for more studies and changes to the current ones to get more information.

""We will continue to support massively and durably the French air transport sector, the small- and medium-sized companies that work in the industry, the aerospace industry, Airbus, and the entire French industry "" Le Maire told the French Senate.
On Tuesday, France announced plans to contribute to a 4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) recapitalisation of Air France-KLM and more than double its stake in the airline to nearly 30%.
Under the EU-approved terms, Air France will give up 18 Paris-Orly take-off and landing slots to competitors, amounting to 4% of its current portfolio at the airport.
Le Maire said the government would make sure that no company practicing ""social dumping"" - cutting staff pay and benefits as much as possible - would get access to these slots. 
He also said the government will support the industry while trying to decarbonise air travel, notably by supporting projects for a zero-carbon hydrogen-fueled airplane.
He added that the government wants to reduce the use of airplanes when possible and said Air France has been asked to scrap all connections to cities where there is an alternative by train that takes less than 2-1/2 hours. 
Le Maire also said Air France will not take a stake in Reunion island's Air Austral but he said the state will defend Air Austral with a 30 million euro state-guaranteed loan.

Investing.com – Carnival (NYSE:CCL) shares jumped more than 5% Wednesday as traders chose to give more weight to its robust outlook for the business and not so much the quarterly loss of $2 billion.
Shares of cruise operators have been surging since last week as they get on with their plans to resume operations in a phased manner. Cruise operators expect Covid-induced pent-up demand to help them in an aggressive rebound once they start sailing again.
 Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) rose nearly 5% and Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) rose more than 6%.
Cruise operators have submitted their plans to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for permission to resume operations, with a goal of setting sail from U.S. ports by mid-summer.
“During the first quarter of 2021 they (booking volumes) were approximately 90% higher than volumes during the fourth quarter of 2020 reflecting both the significant pent up demand and long-term potential for cruising,"" President and Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said in a filing.
As of February 28, the current portion of customer deposits was $1.8 billion, of which $700 million relates to bookings for the remainder of 2021, the company said.
Cruise liners have been amongst the hardest hit by the restrictions imposed by several countries last year to control the pandemic. But as vaccinations roll out and life at many places returns to normal, there are hopes that travel and leisure businesses will boom."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed in narrow ranges on Wednesday, as the consolidation that set in after Monday's surge to record highs continued. 
Abundant liquidity and an improving economic outlook - underlined by the International Monetary Fund's upward revision of its U.S. growth forecast on Tuesday - are keeping sentiment positive, with only concerns about valuations acting as a restraint. Measured on a price-sales ratio, the S&P 500 is currently over 10% more expensive than it had ever been before the pandemic. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 55 points, or 0.2%, at 33,486 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% but the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%. 
The highlight of the day doesn't come until the second half of the session, with the Federal Reserve releasing the minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 PM ET.
Ahead of that, Robert Kaplan – one of very few top officials at the Fed to see a rate hike as necessary already by the end of next year – told The Wall Street Journal that he’s even more optimistic than the IMF about growth, seeing GDP expansion of 6.5% this year and the jobless rate falling to 4%.
Even so, Kaplan warned that the economy is “not yet out of the woods” and added it’s too soon to talk of withdrawing monetary stimulus. Meanwhile, the sustained strength of consumer demand was underlined by another rise in imports in March which took the U.S. trade deficit to a new record high.
Cruise line stocks were in favor, with Norwegian (NYSE:NCLH) stock rising 5.4% and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock rising 6.3% after the latter said that its cash burn in the first quarter was much less than expected. It added that bookings for 2022 are already ahead of its last pre-pandemic year. As with Norwegian, Carnival intends to resume sailings from ports outside the U.S. this summer.
Elsewhere, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock rose 4.6% after the software company said Volvo had chosen its QNX solution to power the software of the 300,000 trucks, buses and construction vehicles that it makes every year.
Among the losers, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs fell 0.4% after the EU's medicines regulator said it had found a possible link to blood clots that have claimed the lives of dozens of patients in the last couple of months. The incidence of the blood clots remains low and the EMA didn't recommend restrictions on its distribution, although various European governments have already taken that step. The U.K. counterpart meanwhile warned under-30s against taking the jab.
Another loser was Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock. The Chinese maker of electric vehicles fell 8.9% after announcing a $750 million bond offering.

Based on Tencent's closing price on Wednesday, the share sale would have been worth $15.53 billion but given the near 9% fall today, the eventual proceeds could clearly be less.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink on Wednesday called for more disclosure requirements for private companies as governments create new accounting standards for sustainable business areas like climate change.
In a letter to shareholders of the world's largest asset manager, provided by a spokesman, Fink wrote that government ""must play the leadership role"" in cutting emissions. He called for mandatory disclosures for public and private companies worldwide, coupled with legal protections for companies making their best efforts at describing risks.
""If large private companies are not held to the same level of scrutiny as public companies, we will create an unintended incentive to shift carbon-intensive assets to markets with less transparency and, often, less regulation,"" Fink wrote.
Fink's language was more specific than in a January memo in which he said climate disclosures ""should be embraced"" by large private companies.
The new wording comes as European Union and U.S. regulators hash out how much sustainability data companies should provide on area like greenhouse gas emissions or workforce demographics. 
New York-based BlackRock, with some $8.7 trillion under management, had previously backed mandatory climate reporting. Last month it joined other asset managers pledging to push companies in their portfolios to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner.

But many of the largest companies, including in fossil fuel industries, are not publicly listed, either because they are in private hands or are state-owned enterprises.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: HSBC moves more than 1,200 UK staff to permanent home working","By Iain Withers and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC is moving more than 1,200 staff in Britain to permanent working from home contracts, in one of the strongest indications yet of how banks are locking in changes to employees' work patterns as a result of the pandemic to cut costs.
Around 70% of the bank's 1,800 call centre staff based across England, Wales and Scotland had volunteered to never return to the office, Unite, one of Britain's biggest employment unions, told Reuters.
Scores of companies have quickly cemented hybrid working and cut office space, but HSBC's move to base some staff permanently at home goes further than most rivals opting for a mixed approach.
Such changes could lead to wellbeing concerns long term if not handled properly, Unite said. 
A HSBC UK spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with contact centre colleagues who serve HSBC UK retail customers about ways that we can offer flexibility on work location while ensuring the way we work meets our customers' needs. These discussions are continuing.""
Unite said HSBC has offered staff a 300 pounds ($414.75) per year working from home top-up payment to cover additional expenses such as higher heating and electricity bills.
Dominic Hook, the union's national officer, said the contract changes for the 70% opting in were being finalised with teams, with those taking it up expected only to come in to HSBC offices for training.
A quarter of staff declined the offer as they wanted to work in the office at least some of the time, while 5% preferred to go back to the office permanently.
HSBC and other British banks have started to cut office space partly because staff are working from home.
HSBC had already closed a call centre in Swansea, South Wales since the pandemic. Its main two remaining call centres are in Leeds in northern England and Hamilton, Scotland. 
Hook said the union was broadly supportive of the change as it was voluntary, but warned other banks against forcing staff to stay at home if they did not want to and to ensure staff did not feel isolated and were properly supported.
""HSBC are at the forefront of this,"" Hook said. ""If it's genuinely voluntary and people's rights are protected then that's fine, but people need to go in with their eyes wide open.
""After a year it may not seem that bad, but after five it might feel different.""

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",CEO Mary Barra bets GM can grow beyond cars and trucks,"By Paul Lienert, Ben Klayman and Joseph White
(Reuters) - Pam Fletcher wants to change the way General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) makes money.
The veteran GM engineer's Global Innovation team is looking for new enterprises to expand the automaker's sources of revenue well beyond vehicle sales and is incubating ventures from commercial delivery services to vehicle insurance, to address future markets worth an estimated $1.3 trillion. That doesn't include flying cars, a market sector that alone could be worth $1.3 trillion, Fletcher told Reuters.
On a recent video chat, Fletcher counted silently before answering how many ventures her team is shepherding. “Just under 20,” she said.
The fact that GM is now incubating its own startups — with its corporate venture arm investing in dozens more — underscores Chief Executive Mary Barra's sweeping effort to remake the largest U.S. carmaker. The goal is to become a diversified purveyor of mobility services - the automotive equivalent of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with revenue that rolls in monthly or quarterly from software and services long after the initial product is sold.
For legacy automakers such as GM, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and others attempting to overhaul and transform their businesses, that task is daunting, according to Evangelos Simoudis, author and adviser on corporate innovation strategy.
“The technologies incorporated in the software-defined vehicle will require areas of expertise that one routinely finds in technology companies rather than in automakers,"" he said.
Barra's push to transform GM's century-old business model is already having a significant impact - even though the first of a new generation of electric vehicles she has promised is still months from launch.
GM returned $24 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks between 2014, when Barra took over, and early 2020. But those buybacks were suspended indefinitely when the pandemic hit last spring.
Now, Barra told Reuters, the company has more productive uses for its money: Investing in electric vehicles and expansion of business lines that promise recurring revenue streams.
GM's new ventures could add tens of billions to the future revenue, Barra said, and push operating profit margins above the current 8% it achieved in 2020, and the 10% it has targeted long term.
“We have very significant growth opportunities and different margin opportunity initiatives to invest in,” she said in a video interview.
Barra's shift from stock buybacks to investing in recurring revenue services, coupled with a drive to make GM an all-EV company by 2035, has achieved in one year what a decade of cost cuts and cash returns to shareholders could not. 
GM's share price over the past six months has broken out of the range it was stuck in since the company's post-bankruptcy IPO in 2010. GM shares hit a post-2010 high of $62.23 on March 18 and are up nearly 50% for the year.
For graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3cTW7cJ
Still, GM's $90 billion market cap lags Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's $600 billion valuation by a wide margin, reflecting doubts among investors that a 113-year-old Detroit manufacturer can keep up with an 18-year-old Silicon Valley company that has no technology or workforce legacy burdens to slog through.
“I understand why people may be skeptical (of GM) because this is a company where we have seen revolutions being announced over the last half century and for some reasons it wasn't authentic,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership programs at the Yale School of Management.
Barra, he said, ""has the authenticity and legitimacy to pull it off in a way that a lot of other people wouldn't.""
Barra's effort to remake GM's business relies on an executive corps that mixes long-time GM managers like herself - Barra has worked at the company for 40 years - and recent recruits from outside the auto industry.
“We're marrying people who really understand the auto business with people who understand these other businesses that we think are growth opportunities,” Barra said.
A new venture that combines several aspects of GM's approach is BrightDrop, a unit that will provide electric vans and related hardware to commercial delivery firms, starting with FedEx (NYSE:FDX), along with support services from fleet management to predictive analytics. 
GM rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is introducing its own electric delivery van and expanding support services to defend its leading share of the U.S. commercial vehicle market of more than 40%. 
BrightDrop, one of the first “graduates” of Fletcher's innovation incubator, started life less than two years ago as an idea initially dubbed Smart Cargo.
Fletcher's team started incubating Smart Cargo in September 2019, about the same time another GM group was working on the company's future electric vehicle portfolio. The ""big idea"" - marrying an electric van with the software- and data-driven delivery services business - was hatched in February 2020.
The enterprise gained additional traction in late 2020, when GM recruited longtime tech entrepreneur Travis Katz to become BrightDrop's president and CEO.
Ultimately, GM's leadership wants BrightDrop to operate independently and cultivate ""outside ideas and new ways of thinking,"" Katz told Reuters. 
""We expect BrightDrop to be a very big and very profitable business,"" he added. Eventually, ""there will be a lot of learnings from the BrightDrop experience that will flow back into GM."" 
Barra also is building GM's long-standing OnStar telematics business into a platform for selling insurance and other services that can be delivered over the air.
Santiago Chamorro, head of global connected services, has expanded OnStar's safety and security portfolio with new products and services incubated in-house, including OnStar Insurance, mobile safety app Guardian and Vehicle Insights, a data analytics platform for commercial fleet managers.
Insurance, a new arena for GM, is led by outside hire Andrew Rose, who previously worked for auto insurance powers Progressive (NYSE:PGR) and Britain's  Admiral Group  (LON:ADML). 
Rose says GM dealers could offer policies to owners when they buy or lease a vehicle. OnStar could offer discounts to better drivers, as well as quicker claims service after an accident, and eventually could offer home insurance as part of the package. 
GM has never broken out OnStar's financial results, and Barra won't say if or when the company will do so. 

""OnStar is already a very significant business,"" she said. ""We think there are opportunities to grow it even out beyond our vehicles.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) expects its fuel sales to fall or at best be broadly steady for the first quarter, the world's biggest fuel retailer said on Wednesday, indicating fuel demand recovery has remained slow amid coronavirus restrictions.
In a trading update, Shell said it saw refined oil product sales at 3.7-4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first quarter compared with just under 4.8 million bpd in the last quarter of 2020. It had previously forecast sales of 4-5 million bpd.
Refinery utilisation rates in the quarter stood at 71%-75%, compared with a forecast of 73%-81%.
Shell's refining margins have improved to around $2.6 per barrel in the quarter from $1.6 in the previous quarter. 
In gas, Shell said it expected trading results to be ""significantly below average"". 
Shell sees its first-quarter liquefied natural gas (LNG) production at 7.8-8.4 million tonnes, compared with 8.2 million in the previous quarter and a forecast of 8-8.6 million tonnes.
Total upstream production was expected to rise to 2.4-2.48 million barrel of oil equivalent, at the lower end of the forecasted range, from 2.37 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
An extreme cold snap in Texas is expected to have shrunk its output by 10,000-20,000 bpd and to shave up to $200 million from its adjusted first-quarter earnings, due to be reported on April 29.

Benchmark crude prices in the first quarter rose around 24% and were trading near $63 a barrel on Wednesday. (Graphics: Shell fuel products sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-EMISSIONS/xlbvgxnadpq/chart.png)

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, remaining near record levels, with focus on the release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up just 5 points, less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 1 point, again less than 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures was flat.
The S&P 500 closed 0.1% lower Tuesday, snapping a three-day winning streak, after hitting a record high of 4,086.10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite ended down 0.1%.
However, these losses were minor and the overall mood is one of optimism, with all three major averages coming off their fourth straight positive quarter, as an impressive vaccination program, continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong data all point to a sharp economic recovery.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon sees strong growth ahead for the U.S. economy as the government’s response to the pandemic has left much of the U.S. population flush with cash.
“This boom could easily run into 2023 because all the spending could extend well into 2023,” Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday moved up the Covid-19 vaccine eligibility target for all American adults to April 19, two weeks earlier than the May 1 deadline he announced previously.
The minutes of last month’s Federal Reserve meeting are due at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT), and will attract much attention later Wednesday, particularly in terms about what policy makers were thinking about inflation, the bond-buying program and the associated yields.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note last traded at 1.64%, having climbed as high as 1.78% last month, the highest level since January last year.
In the corporate sector, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is likely to be in focus after CEO Jeff Bezos signaled his support for President Biden’s plans to raise corporate income tax on Tuesday.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) could also be in the spotlight over its handling of the Archegos Capital saga.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, helped by U.S. crude inventories falling last week.
Data from the industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, showed a reduction of 2.6 million barrels for the week ending April 2, more than expected and indicative of a pickup in demand in the United States, the world's biggest fuel consumer. 
Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $59.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $63.27.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday the United States could be in store for an economic boom through 2023 if more adults get vaccinated and federal spending continues.
""I have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge deficit spending, more QE (quantitative easing), a new potential infrastructure bill, a successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S. economy will likely boom,"" Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders published on the bank's website. 
""This boom could easily run into 2023 because all the spending could extend well into 2023.""
As head of the biggest U.S. bank, Dimon is widely seen as the face of America's banking sector, and he used the letter to share his views on the country's economic health and to press for policies to help address inequality and improve the criminal justice system.
The average U.S. consumer's finances are in ""excellent shape,"" Dimon said, and the stock market's high valuations are justified. The price of U.S. treasuries, however, are not, he wrote.
The economic growth Dimon projects the United States could see in the next two years will create opportunities to ""deal with issues stemming from inequality,"" Dimon wrote.
He called for raising the federal minimum wage, improving training for jobs at high schools and colleges and making it easier for people with criminal records to get jobs. 
Dimon, who has called for higher taxes to pay for federal stimulus, said corporations could support many of these initiatives if the government adopted rigorous budgeting, transparency and discipline when it comes to its spending.

""We must remember that the concepts of free enterprise, rugged individualism and entrepreneurship are not incompatible with meaningful safety nets and the desire to lift up our disadvantaged citizens,"" Dimon wrote.

The Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.-backed company is working with advisers on the preparations for the offering, which could take place as soon as this year, the people said. MissFresh could look to raise as much as $1 billion in the share sale though deliberations are still at an early stage, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.
No final decisions have been made on the IPO details including size and timeline, the people said. A representative for MissFresh had no immediate comment.
MissFresh offers more than 4,000 types of products from vegetables, seafood to snacks and cooked food, and promises deliveries as fast as 30 minutes, according to its website. The company has raised at least $1.5 billion since its inception in 2014 and counts  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Tiger Global Management among its backers.
In December, the startup raised 2 billion yuan ($306 million) in a funding round led by the Qingdao government. The latest fundraising valued the company at about $3 billion, the people said.
MissFresh is competing in a grocery delivery battle in China between startups such as Nice Tuan and Dingdong Maicai and platforms operated by Meituan and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. Consumers sheltering at home during the pandemic have reinvigorated a once-difficult online grocery arena. Dingdong Maicai is also considering a U.S. IPO as soon as this year to support its expansion, Bloomberg News reported in February.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>","Singapore becomes a global cruise leader, for now","By Chen Lin
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore currently accounts for a third of the world's cruises its tourism body said on Wednesday, owing to the roaring success of its ""cruises to nowhere"" at a time of crisis in the industry globally. 
Cruises have yet to restart in many parts of the world after taking a beating from the coronavirus pandemic, with some of the earliest big outbreaks found on cruise ships.
The city-state launched what it called ""round trips"" on luxury liners in November, which have no port of call and last only a few days. Singapore has seen relatively few domestic COVID-19 cases since last year. 
The Singapore cruises are open only to its 5.7 million residents, who have been unable to leave the tiny country for leisure and have settled instead for activities like staycations and even indoor camping. 
The cruises recorded about 120,000 passengers, according to the Singapore Tourism Board, and run at lower capacity, with stringent health protocols. STB did not cite a source for its industry data. 
Some cruises from the Caribbean are expected to resume from June while the U.S. Centers for Disease has retained tight curbs on resuming cruises from the United States.
Some cruises have operated in parts of Europe, Asia and the South Pacific, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. 
 Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) said this month that it was extending the season in Singapore for its Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) of the Seas ship due to ""overwhelming demand"" through October. 
Genting Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean launched their pilot cruises late last year. 
STB Chief Executive Keith Tan said Singapore did not expect to be leading in cruises for long. 
""Over the next few months, I certainly believe there will be more resumption of cruise business in the Caribbean, and in the Mediterranean as well,"" Tan said. 

Singapore's tourism industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with visitors dropping nearly 86% to 2.7 million last year.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",Global growth hopes keep shares near record high,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks took a well-earned rest near record highs on Wednesday, as an International Monetary Fund forecast of the strongest global growth since the 1970's this year and steady bond and FX markets kept risk appetite buoyant.
While rising global COVID case numbers and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan and between Russia and Ukraine ensured it was by no means a fairytale, markets certainly had a Goldilocks feel again.
Europe's STOXX 600 perched just below the first record high it had hit in over a year on Tuesday. MSCI's 50-country world index was grinding out a sixth day of gains and Wall Street futures were pointing higher too. 
In the bond markets, there was little sign that the benchmark government yields that drive global borrowing costs were gearing up to shoot higher again. The dollar was sitting quietly at a two-week low. 
The IMF raised its global growth forecast to 6% this year from 5.5% on Tuesday, reflecting a rapidly brightening outlook for the U.S. economy.
If realized, that would be the fastest the world economy has grown since 1976, albeit after the steepest annual downturn of the post-war era last year when the COVID pandemic brought commerce to a near stand-still at times. 
""Even with high uncertainty about the path of this pandemic, a way out of this health economic crisis is increasingly visible,"" IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said. 
Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares had started on a firm footing, going as high as 208.46 points, a level last seen on March 18.
However, it succumbed to selling pressure and ended flat as China's blue-chip CSI300 index dipped 1% and Hong Kong eased 0.9%. 
Geopolitical tensions in the region added to the jitters. Taiwan's foreign minister said on Wednesday it will fight to the end if China attacks, adding that the United States saw a danger that this could happen amid mounting Chinese military pressure, including aircraft carrier drills, near the island. 
Other Asian markets managed to stay positive. Japan's Nikkei closed higher; Australian shares rose 0.6% and South Korea's KOSPI added 0.3%.

PEPP TALK
Wall Street futures pointed to a 0.1% rises for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq. The S&P 500 and the Dow had hit record levels on Monday, driven by a stronger-than-expected jobs report last Friday and data showing a dramatic rebound in U.S. services industry figures. (N) 
The upcoming earnings season is expected to show S&P profit growth of 24.2% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data, and investors will be watching to see whether corporate results further confirm recent positive economic data.
All eyes will also be on minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's March policy meeting when they are published later. 
Ten-year and five-year Treasury yields, were down at 1.6455% and 0.874% respective in Europe from as high as 1.776% on the 10-year on March 30. 
The five-year Treasury yield especially is seen as a major barometer of the faith investors have in the Fed's message that it doesn't expect to raise U.S. interest rates until 2024.
Europe's bond yields also eased, with southern European debt markets stabilising after a selloff the previous session as traded braced for a 50-year bond from Italy. 
The European Central Bank meanwhile will release monthly data on its conventional asset purchases and a bi-monthly breakdown of its PEPP pandemic emergency bond purchases which it has vowed to increase to keep borrowing costs low. 
The dollar circled a two-week low of 92.246 against a basket of world currencies. 
The euro was flat at $1.1871, sterling was weaker at $1.3795. The Japanese yen was a touch lower at 109.92. 
In commodities, Brent crude futures were nudging lower at $62.67 a barrel. U.S. crude was up at $59.51 and both gold and copper were off at $1,736.4 an ounce and 8,980 a tonne respectively. 
""A large share of the hopes of a U.S. growth boom supported by state aid and rapid vaccination progress has already been priced in,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) FX and EM analyst Esther Reichelt wrote in a note to clients.

""Further and more pronounced USD gains would only be justified if this boom also caused rising inflation rates to which the Fed would have to react with higher interest rates.""

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, as the global economy's outlook brightens, with the U.K. outperforming on the back of its speedy vaccination program and an endorsement of its prospects from the International Monetary Fund.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.9%.
Investor sentiment has been boosted globally by continued support from central banks and an improving growth outlook.
The International Monetary Fund raised its 2021 global growth forecast late Tuesday to 6%, up from 5.5% less than three months ago, citing unprecedented public spending, primarily by the United States. It revised up its forecast for U.K. growth by 0.8 percentage point to over 5%.
The outlook for continental Europe is less impressive. Germany, the largest country in the European Union, is only seen growing 3.6% this year, according to the IMF, with its economy having faced different waves of infections and subsequent lockdowns. Additionally, there are concerns about the latest initiative by Euroskeptic Germans to stop Germany putting its financial firepower behind the EU's 750 billion-euro recovery plan.
There was some good news regarding the virus, with the U.K. to begin rolling out the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine later Wednesday, around two weeks earlier than expected. This will become the third approved vaccine to be offered in Britain, and comes at an opportune time, with the European Medicines Agency likely to confirm later in the day a link between AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine and potentially dangerous blood clotting reactions.

Ahead of a slight easing of lockdown restrictions in England on March 29 but with non essential retail remaining closed, consumers also turned to supermarkets to treat themselves on clothes as well as home and garden items, market researcher NielsenIQ said.
It said sales of clothing doubled to 313 million pounds, while sales of home, up 61%, and garden items, up 92%, collectively increased to 175 million pounds.
“It’s clear that as we draw ever closer to the end of lockdown, consumers have been looking ahead to spring and indulging in some retail therapy, ranging from Easter chocolate to some new clothing or accessories for the home and garden,” said Mike Watkins, NielsenIQ’s UK head of retailer and business insight.
The researcher said overall grocery spending fell 2.9% in the four-week period as it compared with the period before and just after England's first national lockdown last year.
However, British shoppers still spent 1 billion pounds more on groceries in the four weeks than they did in the same period in 2019.
NielsenIQ's data for the 12-week period to March 27 showed Asda, with sales growth of 6.0%, was the fastest growing of Britain's big four grocers, followed by Morrisons with growth of 5.9%.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Analysis: High stakes at sea in global rush for wind power,"By Susanna Twidale and Nora Buli
LONDON(Reuters) - Global competition for offshore wind power is so hot that licence auctions now resemble the oil and gas competitions of just a few years ago, and some of the names are familiar too as global oil majors move aggressively into renewable energy.
The drive among top fossil fuel producers to make fast inroads into lower-carbon businesses comes as more and more countries roll out plans to boost wind power in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint. 
The cost of securing sites to develop has risen to levels that some top wind farm operators say are unsustainable and which will hurt consumers by driving up power prices.
Governments worldwide are expected to offer a record number of tenders for offshore wind sites and capacity this year, with more than 30 gigawatts (GW) on the block.
That is almost as much as total existing global wind capacity of 35 GW, and the tenders are shaping up to be the most competitive ever. 
Several European oil firms including Total, BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) plan to rapidly increase their renewable power portfolios, reducing reliance on oil and gas to satisfy investors who want to see viable long-term low-carbon business plans and governments which are demanding reductions in emissions. 
The oil majors, with deep pockets, are willing and able to pay up for a foothold in the market, even though margins are much smaller than for their traditional operations.
At a leasing round held by the Crown Estate earlier this year for seabed options around the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, BP and German utility EnBW paid a record price to secure two sites, representing 3 GW.
Developers pay an annual option fee prior to taking a final investment decision (FID), which in the case of BP and EnBW will amount to around 1 billion pounds ($1.38 billion) made in four annual payments of 231 million pounds for each of the two leases.
Traditional offshore wind developers, Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY), Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and SSE (LON:SSE) all confirmed to Reuters they had been unsuccessful in the leasing round. 
The previous Crown Estate offshore round was held more than a decade ago when the market was a fraction of its current size and structured without option fees, an added cost developers will now have to recoup.
""Someone is going to have to pay and it’s probably, at least in part, the consumer,"" said Duncan Clark, Orsted’s UK head.
Some analysts also said the high fees threaten to erode the huge cost reductions the industry has achieved over the past decade.
Mark Lewis, Chief Sustainability Strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), said the Crown Estate option fee would add around 35% to project development costs, assuming today's building costs.
BP said the fee was justified by the prime location of the two Crown sites: in the Irish Sea, in shallow water, close to the shore allowing for shorter, cheaper connection cables, and next to each other allowing for cost efficiencies across both projects. 
""Not every resource base was born equal,"" BP’s low carbon energy chief Dev Sanyal told Reuters, adding that those factors made the company confident of achieving the 8-10% return it has set for renewable projects.
EnBW said the prices achieved reflect the different intrinsic value of the respective projects. HOT TENDERS 
Some in the industry fear a knock on effect with Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), saying there aren't enough projects currently to meet demand. 
""So you are going to create an over-heated market when what we want to see is more opportunities made available,"" he said.
A price cap at a Crown Estate Scotland tender of Scottish seabed leases taking place this year has already been hiked tenfold.
Orsted, Iberdrola and SSE all confirmed to Reuters they expect to enter the Scottish round, and while neither BP, Total nor Shell would directly confirm their involvement to Reuters, analysts said it would be surprising if oil firms did not participate.
Projects from the recent Crown Estate auction will not be built until 2027-2030, when development costs are expected to have fallen further, at least partly offsetting higher fees. 
Announcements about larger turbines, for example, show the pace of technology development remains very active, said Julien Pouget, senior vice president renewables at Total, which won a lease in the Crown Estate auction with Macquarie’s Green Investment Group.
""(That) makes us optimistic on the potential in terms of cost reductions,"" he said.
While Britain offers a guaranteed return on some renewables, the amount has fallen sharply, tracking lower development costs. 
At a 2019 auction for contract for differences (CfD), which guarantee operators a minimum price for electricity sold, a record low price of 39.65 pounds per megawatt hour (MWh) was achieved, some 30% lower than the previous auction held in 2017 and lower than current average electricity prices. 
The next CfD auction is expected at the end of 2021, too early in the development process for the recent Crown Estate lease winners.
NEW MARKETS Although Britain is the world’s largest offshore wind market, with around 10 GW of capacity, opportunities elsewhere are increasing and tenders are expected to be keenly fought.
European countries including Denmark, Poland and France are expected to hold auctions this year, with more regions planning to build up capacity.
In the United States, President Joe Biden wants to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind power by 2030. There are currently 13 projects in development, with a combined capacity of around 9.1 GW and expected to come online by 2026.
Iberdrola is already involved in tenders in Rhode Island and Massachusetts through its U.S. arm Avangrid (NYSE:AGR), while BP sealed a $1.1 billion deal last year to buy 50% stakes in two U.S. developments from Norway's Equinor.
In Asia, Japan plans to install up to 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and 30-45 GW by 2040, with analysts expecting tenders for a total of around 3 GW of capacity to be held this year.
Iberdrola, which bought Japanese developer Acacia Renewables last year, said it expects to participate in tenders there.
“Asia is going to be a huge market for renewable growth globally and we as a global player want to be actively participating in that,” said Jonathan Cole, managing director at Iberdrola Renewables' offshore wind division.
However, experts cautioned new regions cannot charge as much for seabed leases or expect to offer such low price support as Britain.
""We have a mature industry in Europe and the UK but it's not there yet in Asia, or the U.S.,"" GWEC's Backwell said.
""Each region has to build up its own industry and skills before they can expect to see the most competitive prices.""

CBA was found to have misled customers and overcharged interest by more than A$2.2 million over a three-year period by the federal court in February.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had sought a A$7 million fine, while CBA made submissions for a penalty of A$4 million to A$5 million.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Wednesday, as the global economy's outlook brightens, and the region shows signs of getting on top of its latest wave of the Covid-19 virus.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%. 
Investor sentiment has been boosted globally by continued support from central banks and an improving growth outlook.
The International Monetary Fund raised its 2021 global growth forecast late Tuesday to 6%, up from 5.5% less than three months ago, citing unprecedented public spending, primarily by the United States.
However, the outlook for Europe is less impressive. Germany, the largest country in the European Union, is only seen growing 3.6% this year, according to the IMF, with its economy having faced different waves of infections and subsequent lockdowns. Additionally, there are concerns about the latest initiative by Euroskeptic Germans to stop Germany putting its financial firepower behind the EU's 750 billion-euro recovery plan.
The country’s current lockdown looks set to last for a while, with German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz stating on CNBC on Tuesday that “this is not a time for opening. This is the time for being very tough, for keeping infection rates down.”
There was some good news regarding the virus, with the U.K. to begin rolling out the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine later Wednesday, around two weeks earlier than expected. This will become the third approved vaccine to be offered in Britain, alongside shots from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and partners  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech.
In corporate news, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) has settled a multi-year patent fight with China's Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY), the world's biggest PC maker, resolving all pending litigation across all jurisdictions, the companies said on Wednesday.

On the data front, eurozone final composite purchasing manager’s index data for March is scheduled for release later in the session, and should show improvement.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, helped by the stronger IMF growth forecast as well as U.S. crude inventories falling last week.
Data from the industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, showed a reduction of 2.6 million barrels for the week ending April 2, more than expected and indicative of a pickup in demand in the United States, the world's biggest fuel consumer. 
Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $59.37 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $62.77.

A Nokia spokesman declined to disclose the financial details.
Nokia launched its legal battle against Lenovo in 2019 over alleged infringement of 20 video-compression technology patents and had cases in the United States, Brazil and India, in addition to six cases in Germany.
Lenovo had also sued Nokia in a court in California.
A Munich court ruled https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-nokia-patent-lenovo-idCAKBN2751ZR-OCATC in September that Lenovo infringed one of Nokia's patents, and it ordered an injunction and a recall of products from retailers.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",Japan's Toshiba considers $20 billion take-private deal - source,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp is considering a $20 billion offer from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to take it private, a person familiar with the matter said, as the Japanese industrial conglomerate faces pressure from activist shareholders to improve governance.
The proposed deal, which comes three weeks after shareholders approved an independent probe into the scandal-hit company, could shield managers, particularly Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani, from that scrutiny. It would, however, invite regulatory review given its government work. 
""Toshiba received an initial proposal yesterday, and will ask for further clarification and give it careful consideration,"" Toshiba said in a statement, without providing further details.
Toshiba's board, which includes Kurumatani who joined Toshiba from CVC, and Yoshiaki Fujimori, a senior advisor at the private equity firm, will discuss the proposal on Wednesday, the source with knowledge of the proposal said.
Shares in Toshiba were untraded in morning trade with buy orders overwhelming sell orders.
CVC is considering a 30% premium over Toshiba's current share price in a tender offer, putting the value of the deal at nearly 2.3 trillion yen ($21 billion) based on Tuesday's closing share price of 3,830 yen, said the source, who declined to be identified as the matter is private. 
LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato, who publishes on investment research platform Smartkarma, described that offer price as too low. 
""We believe that current shareholders, especially activists, will want a rather steep price,"" he said in research note. 
If they accepted the current offer it would still be the biggest private equity-led deal in Asia Pacific this year, surpassing Blackstone’s $6 billion offer for Crown Resorts Ltd in Australia, according to Refinitiv data. It would also be CVC’s biggest foray into the region so far.
For CVC, which declined to comment, the proposal represents another chance to expand in Japan where large companies are under pressure to sell non-core assets and improve returns to shareholders. Other deals by the private equity firm include the $1.5 billion purchase of Shiseido Co's lower-priced skincare and shampoo brands. 
Any approval by Toshiba's board will face regulatory review, because Toshiba, which makes products ranging from escalators to sewerage plants, is one of only a handful of companies able to build nuclear reactors and manufacturers other sensitive equipment, including lithium-ion batteries for Japan's military submarines. 
Japan's government would want to ensure that Toshiba's work on infrastructure was not disrupted, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said in a press briefing.
""Even though it faced bankruptcy Toshiba is still one of Japan's leading companies. It also has many businesses linked to government policies, so it seems a little unrealistic for it to become a foreign-owned private company,"" said Takuro Hayashi, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities. 
UNDER PRESSURE 
Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.
That battle is seen as a test case for whether Japan's established corporate giants will respond to calls for better governance.
On March 18, Toshiba's shareholders, led by Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management voted in favour of an independent probe, opposed by management, into allegations that investors were pressured to agree with management proposals.
That pressure included contacts from a government adviser and Japan's trade ministry, sources previously told Reuters. 
""The incentives for management would be to have a friendly shareholder who would keep them in place. There is the government to consider as well for Toshiba as they seem to have been heavily involved behind the scenes,"" said LightStream Research's Kato.

The London branch of Citibank lodged an application on Tuesday to wind up OneSteel Manufacturing, which includes the Whyalla steel plant in South Australia, and Tahmoor Coal, which includes a coal mine in New South Wales, according to the court. 
A directions hearing is listed for May 6.
The application comes as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) takes steps in London and Australia to recoup losses from supply chain provider Greensill Capital, which has applied for insolvency, after providing funding to Gupta's privately held conglomerate GFG Alliance among others. 
Greensill began to unravel last month when its main insurer stopped providing credit insurance on $4.1 billion of debt in portfolios it had created for clients including Credit Suisse.
Greensill said in court documents that GFG had started to default on its obligations. Gupta has maintained that his steel businesses have adequate current funds and that its businesses were operationally strong. 
GFG Alliance said in a statement that its Australian steel businesses had received multiple offers of finance from large investment funds and was in advanced due diligence, with the terms providing enough cash to repay creditors. 
""GFG Alliance expects the confirmatory due diligence to be complete within weeks before a final offer is accepted,"" it said.
On the court case, GFG Alliance said that it did not conduct any financing with Credit Suisse, has not sold receivables to the bank and would vigorously defend any court procedures. 
""GFG Alliance is in constructive discussions with Grant Thornton, Greensill’s administrators, and other stakeholders to negotiate a consensual and amicable solution on the way forward, which is in the best interests of all stakeholders,"" it said.

""The Australian businesses are performing well and generating positive cash flow, supported by the operational improvements we’ve made and strong steel and iron ore markets.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports a hike in the U.S. corporate tax rate as part of an infrastructure overhaul, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of the largest U.S. retailer, said on Tuesday after facing withering criticism from the White House, Congress and on social media.
""We support the Biden Administration’s focus on making bold investments in American infrastructure,"" Bezos said in a blog post. ""We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what’s included as well as how it gets paid for (we’re supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate).""
The largest online U.S. retailer, which has been widely criticized in recent years for paying little or no U.S. federal income tax, did not endorse raising rates to a specific figure.
The White House did not immediately comment.
Biden’s infrastructure plan proposes increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and would revise the tax code to close loopholes that allow companies to move profits overseas
Biden said last week Amazon was one of 91 Fortune 500 companies that ""use various loopholes where they pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax,"" in sharp contrast to middle class families paying over 20% tax rates.
Bezos is stepping down from the CEO role during third quarter of 2021.
After paying no federal income tax in 2017 or 2018, Amazon reported a $162 million current U.S. federal tax liability for 2019 and $1.835 billion U.S. federal tax liability for 2020.
Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, and Republican lawmakers cut the corporate rate to 21% in 2017 from 35%. Trump repeatedly promised to tackle the nation’s crumbling infrastructure during his presidency but never delivered on that.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business group, last month called Biden’s proposed hike in corporate taxes “dangerously misguided” and warned it would “slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally.""

In June 2019, Biden named Amazon and said no company making billions in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.

(Reuters) -The top executive for oilfield services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co earned roughly $10 million more in 2020 than the prior year, despite company pledges to reduce executive pay as the coronavirus pandemic crushed the oil industry, according to a regulatory document filed on Tuesday. 
Chief Executive Jeff Miller earned $22.3 million in 2020, versus $12.8 million the previous year. His compensation is 293 times that of the median compensation for his employees. 
Halliburton laid off thousands of workers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which destroyed fuel demand worldwide, and sent oil prices plummeting, causing numerous companies to throttle back spending. 
Halliburton employed roughly 40,000 people worldwide at the end of 2020, down from 55,000 a year earlier, according to its latest annual filing. 
While Miller’s base salary declined by $200,000 between 2019 and 2020, he received some $9.7 million in stock awards, versus $3.6 million the prior year. 
Halliburton attributed the steep jump to a change in its executive compensation plan and reporting. 
""Because of a shareholder requested and overwhelmingly approved change in our executive compensation plan, the proxy rules required that we combine two years of actual and possible future compensation into one year,"" Halliburton said in a statement. 

Miller completed his third full year as Halliburton's CEO at the end of 2020. That, combined with changes to the company's compensation plan, increased his 2018 performance unit plan cycle award payout by $3.7 million and stock awards by $5 million for 2020, according to the company proxy. 
Lance Loeffler, Halliburton's chief financial officer reported annual income of $3.8 million in 2020, versus $2 million the prior year. His base salary jumped from $650,000 to $709,000, and his total earnings were also bolstered by stock rewards.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 slipped on Tuesday but stayed near closing record highs posted in consecutive sessions, as investors weighed more strong U.S. economic data against nervousness about upcoming quarterly earnings reports. 
U.S. job openings rose in February to a two-year high while hiring picked up. The data came on the heels of Friday's strong payrolls report and a report on Monday showing activity in the service sector climbed to a record high in March.
The International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast to 6% this year from 5.5%, a rate not seen since the 1970s.
But with an upcoming earnings season expected to show S&P profit growth of 24.2% from a year earlier, according to Refintiv data, investors may be waiting to see how strong the results will actually be.
""The big unanswered question is how open the economy is right now and how many people are out there,"" said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""These security prices are reflecting an anticipation that the economy is going to get back to normal sooner rather than later and it is not exactly clear where we are in that process."" 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 96.35 points, or 0.29%, to 33,430.84, the S&P 500 lost 4.09 points, or 0.10%, to 4,073.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.21 points, or 0.05%, to 13,698.38.
Gains on Wall Street were muted, with the Dow slightly lower a day after a rally sent it and the S&P 500 to record highs. Investors were assessing the staying power of gains in economically sensitive sectors such as industrials and materials that have been leading the charge higher. 
Shares of many economically sensitive companies are classified as value stocks. But growth, which includes many stocks in the technology and communication services sectors, has shown signs of life. 
Large U.S. fiscal and monetary stimulus measures and a swift rollout of vaccines have pushed the S&P 500 and Dow to record levels, with the CBOE volatility index retreating to pre-pandemic lows.
Still, some investors remain worried about the possibility of rising inflation and proposals for higher taxes. In addition, other countries continue to have difficulty containing the coronavirus.

Investing.com -- Markets closed slightly lower Tuesday after a record Monday. 
Tech companies were lower, with the exception of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Financials were also larger down. On the upside, ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) made a comeback after getting hit by the Archegos debacle, and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) made a comeback on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s initiation.
Good news abounds: The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, California said it would almost fully reopen as of June 15, while maintaining its mask mandate, and Europe's expected to bounce back quickly after lockdowns end. 
On Wednesday, we'll get some insight from the Fed and a ballooning trade balance.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Fed minutes
We'll get a little more insight into what policy makers were thinking about inflation and the current state of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program when the minutes of last month's Open Market Committee meeting are released. Those will hit at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT).
2. Trade balance 
Economists expect the trade deficit to have ballooned to a record level in February. Consensus calls for a gap of $70.5 billion when the data are released at 8:30 AM ET. That's up from the $68.2 billion deficit in January.
3. Cruise, anyone?
Carnival (NYSE:CUK) reports results before the market opens. Expect the focus to be on booking trends and when ships can set sail again. Revenue and profit are expected to be non-existent since it's kind of hard to generate both from the pier.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>",GM to start making Silverado electric pickups late next year in Detroit: source,"By Paul Lienert and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is planning to start production of Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck late next year at its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant, a source familiar with the U.S. automaker's plan said on Tuesday.
The vehicle is expected to go on sale in early 2023 as a 2024 model, another source said.
The company declined to comment on the production timeline for Silverado. Its announcement that the trucks will be made at the Michigan plant, also known Factory Zero, sent GM shares to a record $62.45.
Wall Street has been increasingly focusing on GM's strategy to roll out electric vehicles, as it slowly aims to catch up with EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. It had recently unveiled GMC Hummer electric sport utility vehicle, which will also be built at Factory Zero.
The company's plan is part of increased projected spending of between $9 billion and $10 billion this year, including more than $7 billion for electric as well as autonomous vehicles.
GM said the electric Silverado is expected to offer customers a range of more than 400 miles on a full charge. The news about the company working on the pickup truck was reported last year.
The Detroit-Hamtramck plant is expected to build a broad range of full-size electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. Additional models and details will be announced later.

Prior to this, GM had said that electric Hummer pickup truck and automated EV shuttle, the Cruise Origin, will be made at the plant.

The purchase equates to nearly a quarter of the value of shares traded in Deliveroo during its first two days as a public company last week, the report https:// said, citing Bloomberg data.
The share purchase by the bank, when taken together with the ""overallotment"" option, would mean the bank would have recorded a profit from the food delivery group's declining share price, the report said, adding that most of these profits would be given to Deliveroo as part of an undisclosed agreement.
Deliveroo did not immediately return a Reuters request for comment, while Goldman declined to comment.
The startup's listing was the biggest in the UK in a decade, but its dismal debut dealt a blow to London's hopes of attracting fast-growing technology companies. Shares in Deliveroo fell by as much as 30% in their debut.

""That is with certainty one of the core strategic themes that the board under the new chairman, together with the bank's executive leadership, will be focusing on,"" Gottstein told Neue Zuercher Zeitung on Tuesday. 
Credit Suisse on Tuesday announced it was overhauling risk and investment banking leadership as it booked a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.7 billion) hit from deals with U.S. hedge fund Archegos Capital Management that imploded.
""There are no sacred cows,"" Gottstein added in the interview. ""What we can already say is, we will be taking risks out of certain parts of investment banking. That certainly includes the Prime Services business"" that serves hedge funds like Archegos.
Horta-Osorio is due to join the bank from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank after current Chairman Urs Rohner retires this month amid several crises that have dragged on the Swiss bank's reputation. 
In addition to the costly Archegos blow-up that has engulfed Credit Suisse and other global financial institutions including Nomura, the Zurich-based bank has been in the crossfire over potential losses stemming from loans and funds with one-time billionaire Lex Greensill and his insolvent supply-chain finance company.
In the NZZ interview, Gottstein blamed Credit Suisse's failings to adequately manage risks at least partly on the lack of face-to-face meetings with clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

""It's a challenge to manage a global bank during a pandemic over Zoom,"" Gottstein told the newspaper. ""I'm convinced that in the era of COVID-19 the scrutiny of risk business, whether for banks or insurers, has grown more difficult.""

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>","More women in Italian boardrooms, but fewer female CEOs","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian listed companies have increased the number of women serving on their boards but the number of female chief executive officers fell slightly last year, the market watchdog Consob said on Tuesday. 
According to a 2019 law, companies listed on the Milan stock exchange were required to apply a quota to ensure that two-fifths of their board appointments from 2020 forward were women. That rule strengthened a one-third quota requirement imposed by a 2011 law. 
These two laws have brought about change, but more needs to be done to ensure that companies can choose among a reasonable number of highly skilled women, Consob Commissioner Paolo Ciocca said at the presentation of the watchdog's report on corporate governance.
""Female representation in companies' boards reached its historic high at the end of last year,"" Ciocca said, adding that in the future ""it will be crucial to neutralise the gender distortions that still see an under-representation of women in advanced science, technology, engineering, mathematics studies and lower job opportunities and lower salaries for them.""
Despite a rise in female board members, the number of women in managerial roles was still very low.
Women accounted for nearly 39% of board members of Italian listed companies at the end of 2020, data collected by Consob showed.
Looking at women's roles within the board, data at the end of 2020 showed female CEOs headed 15 companies, which accounted for 2.5% of total market capitalization on the Milan stock exchange. In 2019, companies with women serving as chief executives were 17, equal to 2.6% of total market capitalization. 

Last year women chaired the board of directors of 26 companies, the same number as in 2019, but the companies were of much smaller sizes than in 2019.

The company's statement comes just a day after rival Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd said it would mandate travelers be vaccinated under a proposed plan to restart U.S. cruises in July.
The U.S. cruise industry is currently under a ""no-sail order"" from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Last week, the agency updated its guidance for the resumption of passenger voyages, which included the need for COVID-19 vaccinations and more frequent reporting of coronavirus infections from cruise operators.
However, Carnival said on Monday the guideline was ""largely unworkable and stood in stark contrast to the approach taken in other travel and tourism sectors.""
Norwegian and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group have both said they would restart cruises from the Caribbean later this year with vaccinated passengers.

""We continue to closely monitor the evolving situation with vaccines globally,"" a Carnival spokesman said in an emailed statement.

“The government is not now, nor will we be, supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential,” Psaki told reporters at a briefing.
The administration doesn’t want vaccine passports “used against people unfairly” and will provide guidance “that will look like an FAQ” for private-sector development of the credentials.
Vaccine passports are usually conceived as smart phone apps that would show the holder has been vaccinated against the coronavirus, easing travel and use of services like restaurants. The White House has previously said any such efforts should be led by the private and not-for-profit sectors.
But several Republican-led states have moved to limit development and use of the passports, citing privacy concerns. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an order Tuesday forbidding state agencies or any entity receiving public money from requiring vaccine passports.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Argentina's e-commerce firm  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc said on Tuesday it will invest $1.1 billion to expand its warehouse space and services in Mexico this year, spurred on by a pandemic-driven boom in online shopping.
The figure is nearly triple the $420 million MercadoLibre spent last year in Mexico, a rapidly growing market where it is battling to stay ahead of global giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other rivals.
The investment will help MercadoLibre double its warehouse space and boost fintech services such as consumer credit, the company said in a statement, adding that it will create more than 4,700 jobs.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Mexico exceeded MercadoLibre's home market of Argentina in terms of items sold and the company has steadily ramped up its Mexico delivery network, recently opening a fourth distribution center, a 60,000-square-meter site in the northern state of Nuevo Leon.

By the end of last year, MercadoLibre operated 210,000 square meters (2,260,421 square feet) of warehouse space, mostly on the outskirts of Mexico's populous capital.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Taco Bell wants to hire at least 5,000 employees in one day, it said on Tuesday, and is adding benefits for some general managers to sweeten the pot as restaurants struggle to hire enough workers to keep up with a surge in sales amid a broader U.S. economic recovery.
Taco Bell, part of Yum Brands Inc, will hold spot interviews on April 21 in parking lots at nearly 2,000 Taco Bell locations, where some candidates won't even have to leave their cars to apply.
It has also added four weeks of annual vacation, eight weeks of paid maternity leave, and four weeks of new parent and guardian ""baby bonding"" time for general managers at company-owned locations.
Taco Bell has used such hiring events before, but never at so many locations at once. ""It is no secret that the labor market is tight"" now, Kelly McCulloch, Taco Bell's chief people officer, said in a statement.
""Total nightmare"" is the way FAT Brands Inc CEO Andy Wiederhorn describes the staffing situation for franchisees of his company's restaurants, which include Johnny Rockets and Fatburger.
""The most recent stimulus check and unemployment benefits have been a catalyst for people to stay at home"" instead of looking for work, he said.
U.S. job openings in the accommodation and food service industry increased by 104,000 to reach 761,000 on the last day of February from the prior month, according to federal data on Tuesday.
Though fast-food companies and some other restaurant chains did well through the coronavirus pandemic as their customers turned to drive-thru, carry-out and delivery, they are seeing greater sales now that the weather is warmer, many limits on dining room capacities are lifted, and people with stimulus checks are eating out.
A measure of U.S. services industry activity surged to a record high on Monday amid robust growth in new orders, the latest indication of a roaring economy boosted by increased vaccinations.
Hiring cannot keep pace. The U.S. restaurant industry in March was still about 1.2 million employees short from the same month in 2020, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
The gap is hardly limited to hospitality. High jobless rates have not translated into a flurry of applications for open positions in manufacturing, either. 
On Friday, the Labor Department said 916,000 jobs were created last month, the most since last August, including 53,000 manufacturing positions. That was the highest number of new factory jobs in six months.
HAWKING CARS OR COCKTAILS
One McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) franchisee said sales have soared as consumers spend their stimulus checks. Yet some McDonald's dining rooms may not reopen until the second half of 2021 because of labor shortages, the franchisee said.
McDonald's franchisees are aiming to hire 5,000 employees just in the state of Ohio, according to local media reports in late March.
Restaurants are competing not just with each other for employees but with other industries, as some hospitality workers who were laid off found other kinds of work – construction or real estate, for instance - and are not coming back, FAT Brands' Wiederhorn said.

""That waiter or waitress can sell a car just as well as they can sell a cocktail,"" Wiederhorn said.
In Las Vegas, which has about 16 Johnny Rockets and Fatburger locations, employees are working double shifts. ""It's just hard, it gets old and tiring,"" Wiederhorn said. ""You can only do it for so long.""

Investing.com -- Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) rose about 5% after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) joined the fray in favor of the pandemic winner.
Analyst Kaumil S. Gajrawala initiated coverage on Peloton with an outperform rating and a price target of $164, StreetInsider reported. 
Peloton's lost a little shine with shares dropping about 15% since the start of the year, after rallying almost 500% in 2020 as we got stuck at home amid Covid and sought outlets. The demand for at-home exercise equipment and, in Peloton's case, the accompanying cheerleading, is so out of hand that its orders are backed up, with a weeks-long wait list. To address that, the company bought Precor, a U.S. maker of exercise equipment, among others.
With the return of life outside our front doors, there has been concern over Peloton's ability to maintain its dominance in our lives. 
But the company is at the forefront of major secular trends against the backdrop of a sizable market, according to Gajrawala. 
""Peloton has built a brand and achieved success with a narrow product offering (bikes & treadmills in a few markets ) while under severe supply constraints,"" the analyst wrote in a note. ""In the medium term, we expect the equity story to evolve, incorporating an expanded value proposition (new equipment, new content, new countries ) that appeals to more customers: an expanding addressable market.""
Some 19 analysts say buy the stock, three say hold and two say sell, according to data compiled by Investing.com.

Stitch Fix had rallied to a record in late January, and has tumbled by 50% since then, a dip that investors should take advantage of, Mahaney said. Shares fell after the company missed analyst estimates for results and guidance with its quarterly earnings report from March 9.

Investing.com – Shares of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) rose more than 3% in Tuesday’s trade on hopes that the unwinding in the shares of the Archegos-linked companies may be over.
The company’s aggressive push in Latin America with purchase of a broadcaster in Chile added to the positive mood for Viacom shares, which have mostly been at the receiving end of traders’ wrath.
ViacomCBS will buy Chilevision from AT&T- (NYSE:T) owned WarnerMedia as the media giant looks to boost its streaming audience in Latin America.
Chilevision attracted nearly a quarter of Chile's total television viewership in 2020, according to ViacomCBS.
ViacomCBS has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately. In a March 24 filing, the company said it would raise almost $3 billion in the sale of new equity. That send the shares tumbling as traders feared dilution.
Now Archegos, a family office of former hedge fund manager Sung Kook ‘Bill’ Hwang, was heavily exposed to Viacom and stocks of other media companies including Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA). As the stocks slid, there were margin calls and when Hwang could not meet the demand of his brokers like Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and Nomura (NYSE:NMR), they resorted to selling shares.
That fiasco has resulted in a $4.7 billion hit for Credit Suisse and a $2 billion damage for Nomura. Final numbers haven’t been prepared yet or at least not disclosed.
ViacomCBS shares have more than halved since trading at a record of $101.97 in March.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>","Qatar Airways interested in potential Boeing 777X freighter, CEO says","DUBAI (Reuters) - Top Boeing (NYSE:BA) customer Qatar Airways on Tuesday expressed interest in a potential new freighter from the U.S. planemaker, while urging engine maker GE to invest in future technology as pressure builds on airlines to reduce emissions.
Plans for a freighter 777X have been delayed as Boeing wrestles with certification delays and weak demand for its passenger version.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told an online event the Gulf carrier would ""definitely be interested to look into"" a freighter 777X, though said he had not been notified by Boeing about plans to launch it.
Qatar Airways would need to start replacing older 777 jets by the time Boeing or rival Airbus launch any new aircraft programmes, he said.
European planemaker Airbus is also gauging airline interest in a freighter version of its A350 passenger jet, which if launched would target a market key to Boeing, Reuters reported in March.
Qatar Airways has ordered 65 777X passenger jets, according to Boeing's website, and Baker said the airline would receive its first three in 2023 following delays at the planemaker.
Boeing said this year the jet would start deliveries in 2023, three years later than initially planned with a longer and costlier certification process. 
Baker also urged GE to get involved in ""future technology engines sooner than later,"" citing an airline industry carbon neutral growth commitment in 2050.

""When you look at how long things take to develop, 2050 is not far away,"" he said.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",IMF sees U.S. equity market rally continuing despite stretched valuations,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. equity markets will continue booming in the short to medium term on strong economic growth and easy monetary conditions despite already stretched valuations, according to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) annual financial stability report. 
With the S&P 500 index having rallied more than 21% since September, as of Monday, on expectations of a rapid recovery from the pandemic-induced slump, an improved earnings outlook and continued easy monetary policy, equity markets are trading ""meaningfully"" above fundamentals, raising concerns about ""excessive risk-taking,"" the IMF said in its Global Financial Stability Report on Tuesday. 
""The markets are stretched relative to fundamentals when you take uncertainty regarding future economic activity into account,"" Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said in an interview, adding that valuations in the tech sector are particularly stretched. 
""We are in another tech revolution, a bit like 1999, and there could be an adjustment at some point. But my guess is that in the short run, and perhaps the medium run, financial conditions will remain accommodative and the markets will keep on booming,"" Adrian said. 
With nearly $6 trillion in U.S. government aid since the start of the pandemic and super-easy monetary policy in place, Federal Reserve officials are forecasting economic growth to remain above trend for at least two years to come, at 3.3% in 2022 and 2.2% in 2023.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hit fresh record highs on Monday, as a fresh round of strong economic data, including jobs growth, buoyed investor optimism. The S&P 500 is up around 8.5% year-to-date and has gained more than 81% from its March 2020 lows. 
In addition to the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination rollout, investors are closely tracking the massive infrastructure plan President Joe Biden unveiled last week, which includes $2 trillion in spending but also higher corporate taxes that some fear could crimp profits.
January's GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga, which saw users of the social media site Reddit band together to push shares of the video game retailer sharply higher, also ""brought to the fore the role of leveraged retail investors in the recent rally,"" the IMF said.

It also added that the meltdown of New York investment fund Archegos Capital, which has left banks including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Nomura nursing billions of dollars in losses, also raised questions about opaque leverage and its possible systemic implications, the IMF warned.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened slightly lower on Tuesday, consolidating after their surge to new all-time highs on Monday on optimism about the economic recovery. 
The market is still basking in the afterglow of the March employment report on Friday, which showed that employment in the key services sector roared back as states across the country started to relax their restrictions on businesses and on social gatherings. The survey showed that 916,000 jobs were created through mid-March, with February's number also being revised up by nearly 80,000.  There was more good news from the labor market on Tuesday as the JOLTS job opening survey showed the highest number of vacancies since May, at over 7.36 million. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 49 points, or 0.2%, at 33,478 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was essentially flat. 
Sentiment was underpinned by a firm bond market, which was reassured about any potential inflationary threat by a clear slowdown in average weekly wages in the report. The slowdown was in large part due to the preponderance of lower-paid services workers rejoining the workforce. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield stayed resolutely below 1.70% in response, having traded as high as 1.77% in recent weeks. Inflationary concerns were also eased by the sharp drop in oil prices, after OPEC and its allies sketched out plans to raise output by as much as 2 million barrels a day by the end of the quarter. 
The rally in oil over recent months has had a salutary effect on the balance sheet of Big Oil: BP ADRs (NYSE:BP) rose 4.8% after the company said it will resume buybacks almost a year ahead of schedule after reaching its net debt target faster than expected. The improved outlook has allowed it to realize a suite of asset sales in good time. 
Among individual stocks, there were few egregious moves. Snap  (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, was one exception, rising 6.8% to a three-week high after Atlantic Securities upgraded its recommendation to 'overweight'. Atlantic was convinced by the company's strategy of transitioning into a broader content provider.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 1.2% after the market's enthusiasm for its quarterly deliveries number cooled a bit - even though it remained some 12% higher than its level before the numbers. Tesla had reported better-than-expected sales volumes for the three months through March at the weekend, but some fretted that the sales mix was skewed toward its lower margin Model 3 product. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 0.5% after new data showing that it continues to eat into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s dominance of the online advertising market.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>","United Airlines prepares to shake up white, male-dominated pilot population","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Tuesday it wants women and people of color to make up at least half of the 5,000 pilots it plans to train this decade at its new flight school, a push to diversify a career traditionally dominated by white men.
The announcement comes as U.S. airlines resume pilot hiring halted last year during the pandemic and as they find themselves in the crosshairs of politically charged issues involving race.
""We want to make sure that we are tapping into a big deep talent pool and not limiting ourselves to just one section of the pond,"" Chief Communications Officer Josh Earnest said on a Zoom call with journalists. 
Chicago-based United joined Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) on Monday in speaking out against voting restrictions following recent legislation in states like Georgia that activist groups say unfairly target Black and other racial minority voters.
United is the only major U.S. airline to own a flight school, the United Aviate Academy, which it bought last year just before vanishing demand because of the pandemic forced the industry to scale back its operations.
Now, as more Americans are vaccinated, airlines are ramping up again.
United plans to hire 10,000 pilots by 2030, half coming through its academy, and the rest from other airlines or the U.S. military. 
Of United's roughly 12,000 pilots, about 7% are women and 13% people of color, the company said.
There are fewer than 100 black women pilots flying for major airlines, United pilot Carole Hopson said on the call, adding this situation had to change. 
Becoming a pilot can be a long and costly pursuit and the company is offering $1.2 million in academy scholarships. 
The airline's credit card partner, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), will fund another $1.2 million for women and people of color accepted to the academy, which expects to enroll 100 students this year. 

United said it hopes the program gives it an advantage in recruiting and training pilots as the industry braces for a wave of retirements at the mandatory age of 65 and after thousands retired early during the pandemic.

 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) came under attack on Chinese social media last month over past comments.
Some researchers and foreign lawmakers say Xinjiang authorities use coercive labour programmes to meet seasonal cotton picking needs, which China strongly denies.
The listed price of the ""All Star"" version of Li-Ning Way of Wade 4 on the Dewu App - the country's largest sneaker resale platform also known as ""Poizon"" - reached 48,889 yuan ($7,463) per pair, 31 times higher than the official price of 1,499 yuan, the state-owned Global Times reported on Monday. 
Anta's Doraemon-themed casual shoes on the platform were also eight times higher than the original price of 499 yuan.
Both offerings disappeared from Dewu, which deleted listings for numerous local shoe models after state media criticised speculation on sneaker prices and taking advantage of people's patriotic feelings.
""A large number of internet users choose to support domestic brands, which is normal,"" said a Tuesday opinion piece on People.cn, the website of the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party. 
""But some scalpers thought they have caught on to a business opportunity, as if they smelled blood.""
Dewu on Tuesday said that it deleted listings of 20 kinds of sneakers made by Chinese sportswear brands including Li Ning and Anta Sports after noticing abnormal price fluctuation.
Michael John, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, said he believes the frenzy for domestic sneaker brands will pass.
""First, the platform Dewu continues to facilitate exchange of limited edition Nike and Adidas sneakers,"" he told Reuters on Tuesday. 
""Second, the items that were subject to speculative activity feature an American basketball star and a Japanese cartoon character.""
Chinese consumers speculating on high-end sneakers typically target foreign brands. One of the most sought-after items is the Jordan 1 sneaker, with some editions currently selling at more than 40,000 yuan per pair on Dewu.

Investing.com -- BP (NYSE:BP) ADRs were up nearly 3% in Tuesday’s premarket, after the company committed to resume share buybacks and return at least 60% of surplus cash flow to shareholders
The twin promises are a result of the company achieving its $35 billion net-debt target, about a year earlier than expected. BP’s net debt at the end of 2020 was $38.9 billion. Further details relating to share buybacks will be given on April 27, the day the company will detail its first-quarter results.
The oil and gas company’s early success in meeting its debt target was driven by profits from its trading operations, a windfall of $4.7 billion from asset sales, a strong rally in crude prices since November and resilient operations. Trading profits came in part from the wild swings in crude prices that the company was able to capitalize on in the pandemic year.
The news will gladden shareholders at a time when the world opinion is turning against fossil fuels. The trend toward investing in more sustainable energy forms has weighed on Big Oil's share prices in the last year, putting ever more pressure on them to keep churning out cash to shareholders. BP has said it too will invest in new technologies to curb climate change and harness greener forms of energy.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, consolidating after Monday’s record highs, but the overall tone remains optimistic as strong data points to a sharp economic recovery.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 32 points, or 0.2%.
The S&P 500 closed Monday up 1.4% at a record high of 4,076.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1%, or 373 points, to close at an all-time high of 33,527.19, while the Nasdaq Composite ended up 1.7%.
This positive tone has been based on signs of a strong economic recovery, as illustrated by Friday’s blowout jobs report and Monday’s surge in services activity, as a successful vaccination program leads to hopes of a prompt reopening.
More evidence of this economic rebound is expected from jobs opening data for February at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), with analysts looking for a reading of 6.99 million, which would be up from 6.917 million the prior month.
The United States has administered more than 165 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of Sunday morning and distributed nearly 208 million, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
Elsewhere, Investors continue to digest President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal and the chances of it becoming reality, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a global minimum corporate tax ""to ensure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in public goods and respond to crises.""
In the corporate sector, stocks likely to be in demand include those geared towards the reopening trade, including cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK), which reports earnings early, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), which is looking for the restart of its sailings by early July.
Oil prices traded higher Tuesday, paring some of Monday’s hefty losses on expectations of bouncing global demand, but concerns still exist about the prospect of producers returning significant amounts of crude to the market over the next three months.
Late last week the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, announced it was bringing back 350,000 barrels per day of supply in May, another 350,000 barrels in June and a further 400,000 barrels in July. Saudi Arabia is also set to phase out its extra voluntary cut of 1 million barrels per day during this period.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $59.26 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.9% to $62.70. Both contracts fell more than 4% on Monday.

Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and New York-based Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) are among the bidders still in the race for the deal, which could fetch Aramco over $10 billion, they said.
China Investment Corp, the country's sovereign wealth fund, was also weighing a bid for the assets, a third source told Reuters. 
Aramco, Apollo and Brookfield declined to comment.

Bloomberg earlier reported the news about BlackRock and Brookfield Asset being no longer in the race.
Aramco, which is looking to sell as much as 49% stake, is preparing a so-called ""staple financing"" for its bidders - a financing package provided by the seller that buyers can use to back their purchase.
The planned pipeline deal would be similar to infrastructure deals signed over the last two years by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Co (ADNOC), which raised billions of dollars through sale-and- leaseback deals of its oil and gas pipeline assets, sources have previously said.
Aramco, the world's largest oil exporter, reported last month its net profit fell 44.4% to 183.8 billion riyals ($49.01 billion) for the year ended Dec. 31 as the COVID-19 pandemic depressed global crude demand.

However, it maintained its pledge to declare a $75 billion dividend for 2020, most of which goes to the Saudi government.

This followed Friday’s impressive U.S. jobs report suggesting that the American economic rebound gained momentum.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 0.1%, after heavy losses last week, as the Swiss banking giant said Tuesday it was replacing senior managers, halting its share buyback program and slashing its 2020 dividend in the wake of the Archegos and Greensill fiascos.

The luxury sector is in the spotlight after Dolce & Gabbana’s CEO denied that the Italian fashion company was in talks with French group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) over a possible tie-up. The possibility of mergers within the hard-hit sector remains, although the early reopening of China has lifted names like LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) to all-time highs in recent weeks.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, paring some of Monday’s hefty losses on the back of last week’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",Winds of change: how Enel and Iberdrola powered up for the energy transition,"By Stephen Jewkes and Isla Binnie
MILAN/MADRID (Reuters) - Europe's biggest utilities  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) saw the clean energy transition coming decades ago when others baulked at the high cost of producing energy from the sun and wind and instead stuck with coal and oil.
Thanks to early decisions to buy power grids and build renewable plants, the once-staid utilities are now among a handful of global green energy majors going into battle with Big Oil to supply low-carbon power full of confidence.
European oil giants such as BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total have sharpened their focus on power, seeing it as the sector to build their businesses around as they reinvent themselves as clean energy suppliers. 
But they will need to wrestle market share from incumbents such as Enel and Iberdrola that have been positioning themselves for years to profit from the shift to cleaner energy, betting the demise of fossil fuels was inevitable. 
""The energy transition has been part of my life,"" Enel Chief Executive Francesco Starace told Reuters. ""There was no eureka moment for us. We just said this is too stupid to be continued for a long time.""
The transformation of the two companies into global green powerhouses has helped boost their profits and share prices while generating cash and dividends despite a global pandemic. Over the last two years their shares have skyrocketed as investors shifted from oil stocks to buy into businesses they felt had the financial footing and skill sets to lead the accelerating energy transition. https://tmsnrt.rs/3fwgdeJ
Enel and Iberdrola have built clean energy capacity in key markets such as the United States and Latin America and are now aiming to have a combined 215 gigawatts of their own renewable capacity by 2030 - enough to power some 150 million European homes, based on an estimate by consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Other leading green utilities that have also benefited from the shift away from fossil fuels include wind and solar power giant NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) in the United states and Denmark's offshore wind farm specialist Orsted (OTC:DOGEF). (Graphic: Stock markets favour green utilities, https://graphics.reuters.com/ENERGY-UTILITIES/ENEL-IBERDROLA/dgkvleoezpb/chart.png) 
'KISS THE FROG' 
Even before joining Enel at the turn of the century, Starace was pushing companies hooked on oil and coal to switch to less-polluting gas turbines.
""This is not the first energy transition, before there were coal steam cycles which then transitioned to gas steam and so on,"" he said. ""I liked the sustainable side of renewables, the fact you keep reusing the same energy from the sun.""
The turning point for Enel was its creation of Enel Green Power (EGP) in 2008, just after it launched a 39 billion euro takeover of Spain's Endesa, a deal that boosted its access to Latin America's fast-growing markets. Starace was tasked with running EGP as a viable independent business which did not rely on the generous incentives governments were offering then to kick-start their green drives. 
""Renewables were a whole different ball game - smaller plants, less competitive, costlier. It needed its own space with the right footprint and technology mix to deliver,"" a source who worked at EGP said. By the time Starace became chief executive of the Enel group in 2014, he lost little time in buying back the part of EGP listed in 2010 so the growth engine was fully in-house.
Iberdrola Chief Executive Ignacio Galan made an even earlier switch away from coal and oil when he took the helm at Spain's largest private utility in 2001.
He started closing fuel oil power plants - 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of capacity had been decommissioned by 2012 - and shut the company's last two coal-fired plants in 2020.
At the same time, Iberdrola boosted its spending on building renewable plants, mainly wind farms, in Spain from 352 million euros ($413 million)in 2001 to over 1 billion euros in 2004.
Galan met with internal and regulatory resistance, though Swiss bank UBS said in a 2002 report entitled ""Kiss the Frog"" that Iberdrola's new low-carbon focus could produce profits.
Investors still needed convincing. One Iberdrola source recalled a U.S. asset manager's doubts about wind farms in 2004, calling them pretty white darts stuck on a hillside. He changed his mind when he visited one in Spain in 2007.
""He was sceptical, but three years later he said we were right,"" the source said. (Graphic: Ambitious targets, but long way to catch up to the renewable energy majors, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpelkkzvr/Long%20way%20to%20catch%20up%20to%20the%20Renewable%20Energy%20Majors.png) 
GRIDS APART
Consultancy Rystad Energy says oil giants have a long way to catch up with the renewable energy majors in terms of capacity, despite their ambitious target. By 2035, it estimates Enel will still be leading followed by Iberdrola and NextEra.
Enel and Iberdrola have another significant advantage that analysts say oil majors will struggle to match – thriving power grids businesses. Almost half of Enel and Iberdrola's earnings come from millions of kilometres of power lines carrying electricity into homes in Europe, the United States and Latin America. 
""Grids are the backbone of the energy transition,"" says Javier Suarez, head of the utility desk at Milan's Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY). ""Owning them means steady cash flow and lower investment risk."" Most grids are monopolies with regulated, guaranteed returns and operators rarely put them up for sale. ""Any new entrant into the industry is not going to be able to get access easily or certainly not cheaply to the really good legacy assets that Iberdrola and Enel have - the infrastructure assets,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Tom Heggarty. 
Networks built to take one-way power flows from fossil-fuel plants now need a massive round of investment to accommodate electricity generation from sources such as rooftop solar panels that can also inject power back into the grid.
Incumbents like Enel and Iberdrola are the most likely candidates to provide capital, analysts say. 
Because returns are typically locked in with contracts, more spending on grids and renewable power generation assets will translate into more profit for the major green utilities, said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). By the U.S. bank's calculations, reaching international targets to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 will require a 200% jump in spending on such power infrastructure. Enel is now looking to expand its grid network in Europe, Latin America, the United States and the Asia Pacific region, sources said. 
In November, it said it would spend 150 billion euros of its own money to help cut its carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and nearly triple its owned renewables capacity to 120 GW, with grids soaking up almost half the overall investment. Iberdrola, meanwhile, has earmarked more than a third of its spending plans for grids, mostly in the United States, which will become its biggest market for regulated assets.
It has pledged to spend 150 billion euros on tripling its renewable capacity and doubling its network assets by 2030. The sums dwarf amounts European oil majors have pledged for their fledgling green businesses so far.
""I don't think it was simple to decide to spend money in renewables,"" Pierre Bourderye of PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) said of Enel and Iberdrola. ""If it had been simple others would have done it at the same time, but they did it 10 years later.""

(Reuters) -Energy group BP (NYSE:BP) said on Tuesday it expects to have hit its $35 billion net debt target in the first quarter of this year, sooner than expected and paving the way for it to deliver on its promise of buying back shares.
""This is a result of earlier than anticipated delivery of disposal proceeds combined with very strong business performance during the first quarter,"" Chief Executive Bernard Looney said in a statement.
Shares in the London-based company, which had previously expected to reach the net debt target in around the fourth quarter of 2021 or the first quarter of 2022, rose as much as 3% to 299 pence in early trade on news it would reach the target sooner.
BP shares are now up around 16% this year, after shedding 45% in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic hit oil demand. 
BP plunged to a $5.7 billion loss last year and had a debt pile of $39 billion at the end of 2020. It had expected that debt level to rise in the first half of 2021 due to several payments due.
However, in the first quarter it generated around $4.7 billion from sale proceeds.
As part of Looney's plan to shift the focus of the oil major to low carbon energy investments, BP aims to sell $25 billion of assets by 2025. 
BP said in February that it plans to start share buybacks once it reaches its debt target. The company said on Tuesday that it would provide an update on share buybacks during its first-quarter results on April 27.
""We estimate that at $60/bbl oil prices, the company will be buying back around $2 billion - $2.5 billion in shares annually,"" Berenberg analyst Henry Tarr wrote in a note.
BP also said its performance in the first quarter of 2021 was driven by trading, the price environment and resilient operations.

Brent crude rose 22.6% during the quarter on optimism about a recovery in oil demand following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines since the start of the year.
BP said on Tuesday it expects sale proceeds in 2021 to be at the top end of its existing $4 billion to $6 billion range.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Fans of LG Electronics smartphones rued the loss of more affordable Android-based devices after the South Korean tech company said on Monday it would quit the business, with some praising LG for the innovation it brought to the industry.
LG smartphone users in South Korea and the United States posted nostalgic tributes on social media after the firm announced the exit, citing a prolonged sales slump. LG still holds a roughly 10% share of the U.S. smartphone market, according to researcher Counterpoint, though its slice of the global pie is just 2%.
""Please release the Rollable phone before you die,"" said one user on a 300,000 member-strong forum on Naver, South Korea's largest online search portal, referring to LG's latest expandable display https://www.cnet.com/news/lg-rollable-phone-makes-ces-2021-appearance-and-were-intrigued concept that the company flaunted at the CES trade show in January.
Fans fondly noted some of the company's more unique designs, such as a T-shaped dual screen, as well as features including a double-tap to turn a screen on and off.
""LG has some of the best audio hardware of any phone,"" Kim Dong-woon, who has used six LG smartphones, told Reuters. ""It's a shame that LG is withdrawing.""
Influential U.S. tech reviewers echoed the sentiments.
""LG were never perfect but in a world of boring slabs they delivered some of the most unique phone designs, ideas and features ever,"" said YouTuber Austin Evans https://twitter.com/austinnotduncan/status/1378894062388797441 on Twitter. 
LG, which had been making mobile phones for about a quarter of a century, ultimately fell behind rivals Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, in part due to lacklustre marketing and slow software updates.
Its smartphone division logged nearly six years of losses, totalling roughly $4.5 billion by the end last year.
For all the fandom, some criticised the phones, saying the shutdown was inevitable.

""The writing has been on the wall for a long time ... things didn't improve,"" said user cdegallo on Reddit.

The ministry has approved a proposal from the aviation authority following reports on safety and the resumption of the operations of the aircraft elsewhere in the world, Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
The Civil Aviation Authority Of Vietnam (CAAV) in March 2019 suspended issuing licenses to 737 MAX planes until the cause of an Ethiopian crash was determined.
The ministry has told CAAV to keep monitoring the situation and updating information from the aviation authorities of other countries before fully allowing the operations of the aircraft, the report added. 

The United States lifted its own ban on the 737 MAX in November, followed by Brazil and Canada.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 03:30AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse overhauls management as it takes $4.7 billion hit on Archegos,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Matt Scuffham
ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse said on Tuesday it will take a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.7 billion) hit from dealings with Archegos Capital Management, prompting it to overhaul the leadership of its investment bank and risk division. 
The scandal-hit bank now expects to post a loss for the first quarter of around 900 million Swiss francs. It is also suspending its share buyback plans and cutting its dividend by two thirds.
Switzerland's No. 2 bank, which has dumped over $2 billion worth of stock to end exposure to Archegos, said Chief Risk Officer Lara Warner and Brian Chin, the bank's investment banking head, were stepping down following the losses. 
""The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said in a statement. ""Serious lessons will be learned. Credit Suisse remains a formidable institution with a rich history.""
The Archegos fallout is the second major scandal for Credit Suisse in just over a month after the collapse of Greensill Capital, with the bank's shares down by a quarter since March 1. Credit Suisse had marketed funds that had financed the operations of the British supply chain finance firm.
The bank's board has launched an investigation into the Archegos losses. It also has begun a probe into its $10 billion supply chain funds which invested in bonds issued by Greensill. Bonuses for executive board members have been scrapped and outgoing chairman Urs Rohner is to forgo his 1.5 million Swiss franc fee. 
Credit Suisse shares were down 1.5% in early trade.
The bank said Christian Meissner would be appointed chief of the investment bank as of May 1, while Joachim Oechslin, who was the bank's chief risk officer until February 2019, would take on the risk head role again on an interim basis. Thomas Grotzer is to be interim global head of compliance.
""At least - in our opinion - personnel consequences have now been taken. The main damage, however, has been inflicted on shareholders, who have to make do with a lower dividend and a suspended share buyback,"" said Michael Kunz, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank. 
""In view of the bank's vulnerability to risk....it does not seem appropriate to us to recommend bets on the securities of CS Group."" 
Warner and Chin are paying the price for a year in which Credit Suisse's risk management protocols have come under harsh scrutiny. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) analysts estimate that combined losses from the Archegos and Greensill scandals could add up to $7.5 billion.
Archegos, a private investment vehicle of former hedge fund manager Sung Kook ""Bill"" Hwang, fell apart late last month when its debt-laden bets on stocks of certain media companies unravelled. Credit Suisse and other banks, which acted as Archegos' brokers, had to scramble to sell the shares they held as collateral and unwind the trades. 
Last month Credit Suisse said it was separating its asset management business from its wealth unit and bringing former UBS executive Ulrich Koerner to lead the funds business. 
""Obviously heads are rolling. After any sort of blow up there's always tighter control,"" said Jason Teh, chief investment officer at Vertium Asset Management in Sydney.
Credit Suisse had lost a lot of money and its share price will struggle to rally, Teh said.
""In the short term, even if all that is declared, (the stock) is not going to go up because you still have to grow earnings. Basically they've lost earnings and they won't get it back until they find another way to get it."" 
The episodes have also put pressure on Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein who has been trying to move Credit Suisse on from another string of bad headlines, spanning a spy scandal that ousted predecessor Tidjane Thiam to a $450 million write-down on a hedge fund investment. 
UNWINDING THE TRADES
Hwang, a former Tiger Asia manager, ran into trouble following a March 24 stock sale by media company ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc. Archegos was heavily exposed to ViacomCBS, sources said, and the slide in stock set off alarm bells at its banks, which called on the fund for more collateral. 
When the firm could not meet the demand, the banks started selling the collateral, which included shares of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), among others.
While some banks were able to offload their collateral earlier, Credit Suisse still had shares left. On Monday, it offered 34 million shares of ViacomCBS priced between $41 to 42.75; 14 million American depository receipts of Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) Holdings Ltd between $28.50 and $29.50; and 11 million shares of Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd, priced between $47.50 and $49.25 in secondary offerings, a source familiar with the situation said.

The shares were the remaining holdings tied to Archegos that Credit Suisse needed to sell before tallying up losses, the source said.
ViacomCBS shares, which traded at a record of $101.97 in March, closed down 3.9% at $42.90 in regular trading. Vipshop was down 1.19% at $29.78, while Farfetch shares fell nearly 6.1% to $49.69.

Britain's airlines and travel industry were left disappointed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's warning on Monday that it was too soon to say when international holidays could resume, meaning the re-opening could be pushed later than the current date of May 17.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said on Tuesday that there were a lot of details missing from the previous day's announcement. 
He said the government's proposed traffic light system of ranking low risk countries as green and higher risk countries as red made sense, but travel to green countries should not require passengers to take two COVID-19 tests. 
""That doesn't make sense for me...because this could add to cost and complexities,"" he told BBC Radio. 
He said the cost of COVID-19 tests sometimes exceeded easyJet's ticket prices.
""That means that you wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, you would open up for those who could afford to pay it,"" he said. 
Asked if people would be able to travel to popular destinations like Spain and Greece without restrictions by July and August, Lundgren said: ""Yes, I definitely think so."" 

He said easyJet continued to discuss the issues around re-opening travel with the government.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 02:40AM ET</span>",Asian equities witness foreign outflows for third month in March,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Foreigners were net sellers of Asian equities for the third consecutive month in March, as higher U.S bond yields and a stronger dollar prompted outflows from the region. 
Overseas investors sold a net combined total of $3.18 billion in South Korean, Taiwanese, Philippine, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Indian stocks last month, data from stock exchanges showed.
While Asian equities looked lucrative at the start of this year on bets over the region's faster recovery from the pandemic compared with Western countries, outflows in the first quarter suggest a reversal in sentiment.
(GRAPHIC: Foreign investments in Asian equities - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvodggwpd/Foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg)
A spike in U.S. bond yields and concerns over tightening China policy drove a rotation out of long-duration assets and may further affect the regional equities in the second quarter, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a report.
The brokerage referred Asia's internet, media, and other high growth sectors such as biotech and healthcare as long-duration stocks as they are more sensitive to the rise in yields.
Taiwan and South Korea, which house many high-flying tech stocks, faced the biggest outflows in the region, witnessing net sales of $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.
Foreigners continued to exit Philippine equities for the 17th consecutive month March, struck by fresh lockdowns in capital Manila and nearby provinces after a surge in new coronavirus cases.

However, India lured inflows of $1.6 billion, despite a surge in infections last month.
""India has bucked the trend as investors buy into the country's recovery story,"" said Mitul Kotecha, chief emerging market Asia and Europe strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.
""(But) a renewed increase in virus cases and lockdowns in India could dampen recovery expectations and inflows in the weeks ahead.""
Vietnam and Thailand also faced outflows last month. 

However, Indonesia obtained an inflow of $800 million on optimism that the country would emerge from a pandemic-induced recession in the second quarter.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Tuesday, as investors digest signs of strong global growth while the region attempts to ramp up its Covid-19 vaccination program/
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.8%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%. 
Germany will have immunized 20% of its population against the novel coronavirus by the beginning of May, the country's health minister Jens Spahn said on Monday, doubling the number of people with the jab in a month after taking three months to immunize the first 10%.
Germany, the largest country in the European Union, has been forced into a fresh lockdown to combat a rise in infections as it has lagged the likes of Britain and the United States in the pace of vaccinations.
France reported over the weekend a rise in patients in intensive care units for Covid-19 to the highest levels in five months, as it too entered its third national lockdown. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated meanwhile that the lifting of restrictions on international travel may be pushed back beyond the current target date of May 17.
However, the news isn’t all bad. Johnson reiterated his plans to ease England's lockdown next week, with the likes of hairdressers, gyms and pubs reopening, while Portugal also allowed cafe and restaurant terraces, museums, middle schools and gyms to start trading again on Monday.
Mobility restrictions in Europe are set to delay the region’s economic recovery, but growth signals are more positive in both the U.S. and China, the two largest economies in the world. 
Overnight, the Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.3 in March, the highest since December, from 51.5 in February, indicating that the recovery in China's services sector picked up speed. This follows Friday’s impressive U.S. jobs report suggesting that the American economic rebound gained momentum.
In corporate news, Swiss banking giant  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said Tuesday it was replacing senior managers, halting its share buyback program and slashing its 2020 dividend in the wake of the Archegos and Greensill fiascos.
The luxury sector could also be in the spotlight after Dolce & Gabbana’s CEO denied in an interview published Tuesday that the Italian fashion company was in talks with French group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) over a possible tie-up. The luxury market has taken a big hit during the pandemic, raising the possibility of mergers within the sector, although the early reopening of China has lifted names like LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) to all-time highs in recent weeks.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, paring some of Monday’s hefty losses, but concerns still exist about the prospect of producers returning significant amounts of crude to the market over the next three months.
Late last week the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, announced it was bringing back 350,000 barrels per day of supply in May, another 350,000 barrels in June and a further 400,000 barrels in July. Saudi Arabia is also set to phase out its extra voluntary cut of 1 million barrels per day during this period.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $59.41 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $62.81. Both contracts fell more than 4% on Monday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,738.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1812.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Tuesday said it was replacing senior managers, halting its share buyback programme and slashing its 2020 dividend as it grapples with the estimated 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.69 billion) fallout from its relationship with Archegos Capital Management LP.
Chief Risk Officer Lara Warner and investment banking head Brian Chin will both leave the bank in April, Switzerland's second largest lender said.
The bank said it now expects to post a pre-tax loss of roughly 900 million francs for the first quarter, as its strong performance in the quarter was wiped out by the affair.
""The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable,"" Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said in a statement. ""Serious lessons will be learned.""
The bank will now propose a dividend of 0.10 francs per share, down from its earlier plan for a pay-out of 0.2926 francs. 
It scrapped proposals for executive bonuses for the year and outgoing Chairman Urs Rohner's 1.5 million franc fee for the 2020-2021 period.
Warner will be replaced with immediate effect by Joachim Oechslin as interim Chief Risk Officer and Thomas Grotzer as interim Global Head of Compliance, the bank said. Christian Meissner will become CEO of the Investment Bank when Chin steps down from his role on April 30.
The changes mark the second and third changes to its executive board in the past month, after the bank in March overhauled its asset management business following a separate costly collapse of supply chain firm Greensill Capital.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2021 01:25AM ET</span>","MUFG says to stick with some coal lending, even as green pressure mounts","By Takashi Umekawa and Yuki Nitta
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc won't completely stop financing for coal-fired power plants, even as external pressure has forced it to tighten its lending policy, the chief executive of its main banking unit said.
Like its rivals, Japan's biggest lender is coming under more pressure from global investors and environmental groups over its ties to coal. A shareholder proposal last month called on MUFG to outline how it will align its business with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
Smaller rival Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc is considering halting new financing for any coal-fired power plants, without exceptions, Reuters previously reported. 
However, MUFG is unwilling to abandon lending to ""transition projects"" that could become more environmentally friendly down the line, Junichi Hanzawa told Reuters in an interview on March 26 that was embargoed for release on Tuesday.
""Realistically, it would be very difficult to eliminate all financing of transition projects, given Japan's energy situation,"" Hanzawa said.
Despite pledges to reduce carbon emissions under the Paris agreement, coal remains a mainstay for Japan. It accounts for around a third of the energy supply mix, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry official said in 2020.
MUFG has already said it would not finance new coal-fired plants in principle, but there have been exceptions to that, such as newer plants that burn coal more efficiently.
A new lending policy, likely to be announced this month, will see the bank narrow down those exceptions, Hanzawa said, without giving examples.
If the bank were to consider new coal financing, it would have to be for projects that would eventually lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, he said.

""We've heard our policy looked loose because of such exceptions, so we are in discussion to change it,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. auto industry group on Monday urged the government to help as it warned the global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
The U.S. Commerce Department should dedicate a portion of funding in a proposed bill to expand U.S. semiconductor production to auto sector needs, the Alliance for Auto Innovation said in written responses to a government-initiated review.
U.S President Joe Biden in February ordered several Federal agency actions to address the chip crisis and is also seeking $37 billion in funding for legislation to supercharge chip manufacturing in the United States. 
Some funding should ""be used to build new capacity that will support the auto industry and mitigate the risks to the automotive supply chain evidenced by the current chip shortage,"" the group's chief executive, John Bozzella, wrote.
The group said the U.S. government could specify ""a particular percentage – that is reasonably based on the projected needs of the auto industry – be allocated for facilities that will support the production of auto grade chips in some manner.""
The group represents nearly all major automakers with factories in the United States including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Hyundai Motor Co.
Automakers have been hit particularly hard by the global chip shortage after many cancelled orders when auto plants were idled during the coronavirus pandemic.
When they were ready to recommence production, they found that chipmakers were busy fulfilling orders for the consumer electronics industry which as seen demand for premium devices - both for work and leisure - boom as people spent more time at home.

Most automakers have been hit by the shortage. In recent announcements, Ford said last week it would cut output at seven North American assembly plants, while Kia Motors said it was cutting two days of production in Georgia.

U.S.-based KKR started marketing the new Asia fund towards the end of 2019, initially targeting $12.5 billion, sources familiar with the situation have said previously.""Companies across Asia Pacific are recognising their potential to become not only national and regional champions but also global leaders in their industries,"" Ashish Shastry, KKR's co-head of Asia Pacific private equity, said in a statement announced the fund-raising.
KKR said the fund exceeded its target size to reach its hard cap for fund investors' commitments and received strong support from new and existing global investors, including significant representation from Asia Pacific-based investors.
Coronavirus-spurred growth in the technology sector is expected to drive M&A activity in Asia this year. Private equity-backed deals in the region rose 51% to a record $129 billion last year.
Many regional funds including China's Primavera Capital and Boyu Capital are also raising funds, while Hillhouse Capital is targeting raising $13 billion, sources have said.
KKR said its fund would tap into opportunities stemming from rising consumer spending and urbanisation trends, as well as corporate carve-outs, spin-offs and consolidation.
KKR will invest about $1.3 billion in capital alongside fund investors through the firm and its employees' commitments.

In January, it said it had closed its first fund targeting real estate investments in Asia Pacific, days after it closed its inaugural Asia infrastructure fund.

""JAL has decided to accelerate the retirement of all P&W equipped Boeing 777 by March 2021, which (was) originally planned by March 2022,"" the Japanese airline said on Monday in a notice on its website.
JAL said it would use newer Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A350s on domestic routes to Osaka's Itami Airport and use international planes for other domestic routes to help maintain flight frequencies.
Flying demand industry-wide is currently lower than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Japanese carrier had an incident of its own with the PW4000 engines in December, when a malfunction forced a Tokyo-bound JAL 777 to return to Naha airport.
The engines are found on only a small number of older 777s operated by JAL, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc, ANA Holdings Inc, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, Asiana Airlines Inc and Jin Air Co Ltd.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in February had ordered immediate inspection of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before further flights after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United flight was consistent with metal fatigue.
A spokeswoman for Pratt, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, in February said fan blades would need to be shipped to its repair station in East Hartford, Connecticut, for inspection, including those from airlines in Japan and South Korea.

Analysts had said airlines might speed up retirement of the planes as a result of the need for additional checks.

The Japanese company will acquire the stake from funds affiliated with AutoStore's majority shareholder Thomas H. Lee (THL) Partners and other investors including EQT (NYSE:EQT) Private Equity, valuing the firm at $7.7 billion.
Founded in 1996, AutoStore has 20,000 robots deployed across 35 countries and counts Puma, Best Buy and Siemens among its customers. The company also touts a design method that allows customers to store four times the inventory in the same space in a warehouse.

Such technology enables e-commerce companies to deliver packages faster and more economically, as online shopping has surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.
SoftBank in January last year took part in a $263 million funding round in Berkshire Grey, which develops artificial intelligence-based logistics automation systems used by its customers - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) - in their warehouses and distribution centers.

(Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp's XTO Energy shale unit filed a breach of contract lawsuit against  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) LP over disputed payments for the Dakota Access Pipeline, according to a Texas state court filing. 
The suit alleges the pipeline operator hit XTO with deficiency charges and revoked other credits after the oil producer shifted some oil to other outlets last August. Exxon (NYSE:XOM) took the actions after a U.S. court ordered Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) shut, it said. 
Exxon asked a state court in Houston last week to award it damages exceeding $1 million, a return of its revoked credits, attorneys fees and other costs.
Energy Transfer and Exxon both declined to comment. 
In July 2020, a U.S. District Court suddenly ordered the crude pipeline with a capacity of about 570,000 barrels per day to be shut and gave Energy Transfer 30 days to empty the line, prompting Exxon to scramble to find other ways to move its oil. DAPL is the main artery for shipping crude from North Dakota's Bakken oilfield. 
Exxon lined up alternatives that were dwindling ""by the hour"" as other DAPL shippers sought outlets, and to avoid violating a potential court order, it told the court. 
At about that time, a U.S. Gulf Coast hurricane forced Exxon's Beaumont oil refinery offline, prompting it to declare force majeure on pipeline volumes over four days. Energy Transfer rejected Exxon's force majeure claim. 
The refinery is a major consumer of Exxon's DAPL oil. 

Shortly after the DAPL shutdown, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing the pipeline to temporarily continue operations. By then, Exxon had shifted 40% of its promised DAPL volumes to other suppliers, according to the lawsuit. 
A federal court hearing is set for Friday on whether the pipeline can continue to operate without a crucial permit while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts an environmental review of line.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc illegally fired two employees who advocated for better working conditions during the pandemic, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board has found.
The online retailer last year terminated the employment of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who accused the company of enforcing policies in a discriminatory fashion and having vague rules that ""chill and restrain"" staff from exercising rights, according to their charge filed in October, seen by Reuters.
The board said on Monday that its regional director in Seattle will issue a complaint if the parties do not settle the case.
The decision comes at a delicate moment for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as it awaits the outcome of its Bessemer, Alabama, workers' vote on whether to make their warehouse the company's first unionized facility in the country.
Cunningham and Costa, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more on climate change, about a year ago questioned Amazon's pandemic safety protocols and worked to raise money for warehouse staff at risk of contracting COVID-19.
In a statement, Amazon said it supports workers' rights to criticize work conditions, but that doing so does not absolve staff of breaking lawful rules. ""We terminated these employees not for talking publicly about working conditions, safety, or sustainability, but rather, for repeatedly violating internal policies,"" it said.
Amazon on Monday did not specify what those polices were.

Cunningham and Costa did not immediately comment. Marc Perrone, international president of the UFCW union whose local unit helped file the charge, said in a statement: ""Today is a reminder that Amazon will break the law to silence its own workers who speak out.""
The New York Times earlier reported the news.

Among other major U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have also recalled pilots who were sidelined during the pandemic.

United Airlines, which reached a deal with its union to keep pilots active throughout the downturn, said last week it was preparing to hire about 300 pilots as travel demand rebounds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks rallied on Monday with the Dow and S&P 500 closing at record levels, as a round of strong economic data buoyed investor optimism for the economic reopening and a muted climb in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield kept inflation worries in check.
An ISM survey for March showed a measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high. The data followed Friday's report showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs in March, trouncing forecasts. 
Investors have bet on cyclical sectors poised to lead an economic reopening, with energy, financials and materials among the best performing on the year. A climbing yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has dented appetite for technology stocks. 
Despite strong economic data, gains were led by sectors that have underperformed recently, including communication services, consumer discretionary and tech, as the 10-year yield remained below a 14-month high hit last week. 
""Part of today is yields aren’t moving and that is helping tech, there is at least some rotation going back into tech by somebody that is helping the sector,"" said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, New York. 
""At some point the cyclical move is discounted, these stocks, a lot of them had big moves and are valued above where they were in early February of 2020."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 373.98 points, or 1.13%, to 33,527.19, the S&P 500 gained 58.04 points, or 1.44%, to 4,077.91 and the Nasdaq Composite added 225.49 points, or 1.67%, to 13,705.59.
With speedy vaccinations and additional government stimulus helping the S&P 500 and the Dow clinch all-time highs, focus turns to progress on a massive infrastructure plan and the upcoming corporate earnings season.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still about 3% below its February high as the recent spike in bond yields spurred inflation concerns and made growth stocks less attractive. But rising COVID-19 cases and resumed lockdowns in countries such as France recently have helped the appeal of tech names of late.
Energy shares closed 2.4% lower, as the sole decliner among major S&P sectors, following a sharp drop in oil prices. Reopening plays gained, as the S&P 1500 airlines index jumped 2.54% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk."" The agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all non-essential trips.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was working with G20 countries to agree on a global corporate minimum tax rate to end a ""30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares climbed 4.43% as one of the biggest boosts to the S&P after the world's most valuable automaker posted record deliveries. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.05 billion shares, compared with the 12.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 85 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 164 new highs and 16 new lows.

""The reopening of leisure & hospitality hit a higher gear in March and evidence suggests that it will hit an even higher gear in April. The vaccine distribution process has been progressing well, and a more normal economy appears to be close at hand,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The services sector is critical component of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product (GDP).

In consumer discretionary stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of the standout performers on the day, rising 5% after the electric vehicle maker reported record first-quarter deliveries.
Energy was the exception to the broader-market rally, pressured by a fall in oil prices after major oil producers agreed to ease production cuts.
Looking ahead to the start of the quarterly earnings season, Wall Street continues to back cyclicals as sectors of the economy to shine. 
""We expect S&P 500 earnings to grow by 17.7% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2021,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said. ""Financials and Materials appear set to lead the rebound — we remain favorable on these sectors.""

Archegos, run by U.S. investor Sung Kook ""Bill"" Hwang, was caught on the wrong side of debt-laden bets on the stocks of these companies last month, forcing several Wall Street banks that acted as brokers to sell shares in the companies.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, which is expected to record billions of dollars in losses from its exposure to Archegos, is still unwinding its positions, a source familiar with the trades said on Monday. The bank declined to comment. Nomura, which has flagged a possible $2 billion loss, also declined to comment.
Other banks with exposure to Archegos, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), have unwound their trades, according to sources with direct knowledge of the transactions.
ViacomCBS shares, which traded at a record of $101.97 in March, were down 2.8% at 43.40. Discovery last traded down 1.4% at $42.69 after hitting $78.14 last month. Shares of  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) and Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) also slid.

1. Focus on automakers?
Tim Cook hinted at the possibility of an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) autonomous vehicle in a recent interview, without outright confirming the much-rumored idea. That would be another competitor for Tesla as old-school names like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also set their sights on electric vehicles and autonomous technology. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) beat expectations for first quarter deliveries.
“There’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we’ll see what Apple does,” Cook said in an interview with Kara Swisher on the ‘Sway’ podcast released Monday. Asked if Apple was working on such a car itself or a technology within it, Cook declined to comment.
Automakers reported strong vehicle sales in the first quarter, boosted by consumer spending, helping to overcome the negative effects of chip shortages.
2. Jobs Jobs Jobs
Job openings for February are released Tuesday at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect a reading of 6.99 million, which would be up from 6.917 million the prior month.

3. Meme stonks in share sales
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)’s share sales plans have changed. It’s now going to sell up to $1 billion of stock instead of only $100 million, as it takes advantage of a surging price after a retail-driven rally this year. Its shares fell nearly 14% on Monday but erased most of that loss in the afternoon.
Investors don’t usually like being diluted, but they don’t always act like it. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) shares jumped 12% on Monday a few days after it said it would sell another 500 million shares. The theater chain operator got a nice boost from an analyst upgrade to buy after a better than anticipated box office showing for “Godzilla vs. Kong.”

(Reuters) - Transat's shares slumped more than 22% on Monday after Air Canada scrapped its C$188.7 million ($150.83 million) buyout deal for the tour operator due to antitrust hurdles in Europe.
The failed takeover prompted several analysts to lower their ratings on Montreal-based Transat, whose business has suffered because of COVID-19. 
""The catastrophic impact of the pandemic, Transat's liquidity requirements, the tenuous state of the recovery, and the elimination of a formal takeover offer for the company justify a 'reduce' recommendation,"" TD Securities analyst Tim James wrote in a note.
Some analysts also raised doubts on whether other suitors, including Quebec businessman Pierre Karl Péladeau (PKP), would come through given Transat's financing needs of at least $500 million.
""We would not yet assume that PKP will honour his C$5 per share offer or even buy Transat, considering that Transat stated last month that his proposal lacked evidence of financing to support a deal,"" Scotiabank analyst Konark Gupta said in a note.
Péladeau said on Friday his offer was still available.
Transat's shares fell to C$4.25 on Monday, marking their biggest intra-day percentage loss in over a year.
Air Canada's offer, which the airline abandoned over the European Commission's concerns around competition, would have offered a lifeline to Transat after its annual loss ballooned to more than C$355 million ($283.77 million) last year.
""In our view, traditional EPS and EBITDA-based multiples are not relevant or possible at this time due to the excessive debt in the capital structure and negative earnings,"" TD Securities' James said, cutting Transat's target price to C$3.25 from C$7.50. 
Transat's total debt stood at over C$900 million as of Jan. 31.
Most analysts, however, said they expected some government support for Transat in the upcoming federal budget, set to be released on April 19.

Pioneer's fourth multi-billion shale deal this year comes as investors in the shale patch have called on producers to focus on cash flow and shareholder returns, rather than spending to grow, as demand remains low due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In January, Pioneer closed its $4.5 billion, all-stock purchase of  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE), giving it one of the largest positions in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field.
RBC Capital Markets said it was surprised Pioneer made such a large acquisition after Parsley Energy and that the rationale seemed to be part opportunistic and part defensive.
The stock-and-cash deal for DoublePoint Energy, the largest privately-held U.S. oil producer since 2011, increases Pioneer's holdings in the Permian to more than 1 million net acres. 
KeyBanc downgraded Pioneer to ""sector weight"" and said it was ""one of the highest purchase prices we have seen in years, and it was surprising given the fact that it is largely undeveloped and a bit dilutive to PXD's average acreage quality."" 
DoublePoint Energy will add 97,000 acres to Pioneer's holdings in the Permian Basin and analysts at Cowen & Co praised the deal, saying it ""undoubtedly fits like a glove within PXD's Midland Basin acreage and...increases expected per share variable dividends in 2022.""

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the acreage overlap of the two companies provides industrial logic for the transaction and viewed the deal as accretive to Pioneer's free cash-flow. 
Pioneer's shares fell 6.1% to $154.52, slightly more than the 3% decline in oil prices.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose 2% Monday, boosted by its CEO Tim Cook signaling that an autonomous car may be in the offing.
Strong jobs data helped the S&P 500 and Dow touch all-time highs. Apple’s share price has more than doubled in a year.
A usually reserved Cook, much like the company he heads, dropped hints in an interview about the company’s much-rumored plans for an autonomous car.
 “The autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. If you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we’ll see what Apple does,” he said in an interview with Kara Swisher on the ‘Sway’ podcast released Monday.
When asked if Apple was working on such a car itself or a technology within it, Cook declined to comment.
“We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that,” he said.
An autonomous car is seen as the next big thing from Apple’s stable, known less for being the first in the segment, but more for being the best in class.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Friday that nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since last August. That was well above economists’ median forecast of 647,000 and was closer to markets’ whisper number of 1 million, Reuters said.
Data for February was also revised to show 468,000 jobs were created instead of the previously reported 379,000.
Adding to the optimism was an ISM survey for March that showed a measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high, according to Reuters.

(Reuters) -GameStop Corp on Monday increased the value of new stock it may sell from $100 million to $1 billion, as the U.S. video game retailer seeks to capitalize on a surge in its shares from a Reddit-driven rally this year.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has rampaged over 900% higher since January in highly volatile trading as amateur investors organized on social media sites such as Reddit staged a stubborn buying spree, winning out over Wall Street hedge funds that had shorted its shares.
GameStop's shares fell as much as 13.9% on Monday. They briefly reversed course to trade up slightly, but were trading lower again at 11:53 a.m. EDT at $188.50. 
The company has not sold any new shares since the frenzy started, mainly because security laws prevented it from doing so without disclosing its latest financial information, Reuters reported in February.
GameStop reported fourth-quarter earnings on March 23, and on Monday it published unaudited sales results for its fiscal first quarter to date, to bring investors up-to-date with its financial situation. 
GameStop said it may sell up to 3.5 million shares worth no more than $1 billion, and use the proceeds to hasten its shift to e-commerce in an overhaul being led by billionaire Ryan Cohen, GameStop's biggest shareholder and board member.
In a regulatory filing for the offering, Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop addressed the extreme gyrations in its shares in the last three months, which have swung from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51. 
""During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume,"" GameStop said. 
""Investors that purchase shares of our common stock in this offering may lose a significant portion of their investments if the price of our common stock subsequently declines."" 
GameStop had registered in December with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell $100 million worth of stock through an at-the-market offering (ATM), which it never deployed. 
The company said on Monday that global sales for the nine-week period ending April 4 rose about 11%.
""A lot of interested parties have been asking about when GameStop would do something like this,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said.

""The stock has remained elevated so the company is taking advantage of the access to capital.""
The prospectus for the new $1 billion ATM offering filed with the SEC replaces the previous $100 million proposal. The ATM program allow GameStop to sell stock over a prolonged period of time.

Investing.com --  Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rallied 3.6% after winning its Supreme Court case against Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). 
Google did not commit copyright infringement against Oracle when it copied programming language for the Android operating system, the court said in a 6-2 decision.
Google said its use of the code was covered under the doctrine of fair use and therefore not subject to copyright liability, CNBC reported. The court didn't weigh in on the broader question of whether Application Programming Interfaces can be copyrighted.
The ruling helps affirm a longstanding practice in software development, CNN said. 
""The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater — the barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower,"" said Oracle's general counsel Dorian Daley. ""They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can.  This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a chance to further expand religious rights, turning away two cases in which employees accused companies of violating federal anti-discrimination law by insufficiently accommodating requests for time off to meet religious obligations. 
The justices declined to hear appeals by two men of different Christian denominations - a Jehovah's Witness from Tennessee and a Seventh-day Adventist from Florida - of lower court rulings that rejected their claims of illegal religious bias. Lower courts found that the accommodations the men sought would have placed too much hardship on the employers. 
In a dissent, conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito said the court should have taken up the case from Tennessee. The Supreme Court has taken an expansive view of religious liberties in a number of important cases in recent years.
At issue in the cases was the allowances companies must make for employees for religious reasons to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on religion as well as race, color, sex and national origin. 
Gorsuch wrote that religious rights under the employment law are ""the odd man out"" because they do not receive as much protection as other rights guaranteed under federal law, such as those that apply to the disabled.
""Alone among comparable statutorily protected civil rights, an employer may dispense with it nearly at whim,"" Gorsuch wrote.
Under the law, employers must reasonably accommodate workers' religious observance or practices unless that would cause the company ""undue hardship"" - which the Supreme Court in a 1977 case determined to be anything more than a minor, or ""de minimis,"" burden. Critics of the ""de minimis"" standard have argued that it particularly harms religious minorities. 
Last year, in a similar appeal that the court declined to hear that involved a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, three conservative justices - Alito, Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas - indicated that the court should consider overruling the 1977 precedent.
The Tennessee case involved Jason Small, a leader in the Jehovah's Witnesses congregation in the Memphis suburb of Collierville who worked as a dispatcher at Memphis Light, Gas and Water, a large public utility. Small missed work in 2015 to attend worship on the Good Friday holiday as well for a congregational duty the following Wednesday even though his requests for time off had been denied. 
Small was suspended for two days without pay. The company said Small missed work on ""multiple occasions.""
The Florida case involved Mitche Dalberiste, a Seventh-day Adventist. GLE Associates, a Florida company that performs work-site safety monitoring, revoked his job offer after he disclosed that he would be unable to work on the Sabbath, which he observed from sundown on Friday to sundown Saturday. 
GLE, in a court filing, said Dalberiste lied about his ability to work on weekends and said it regretted being dragged into a ""special-interest fueled lawsuit attempting to circumvent Congress."" Dalberiste is represented in part by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a religious rights legal group.

Both men sued in federal court, alleging religious discrimination in violation of Title VII. 
In Small's case, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that accommodating him would cause more than ""de minimis"" hardship on the company's operations and other employees. The Atlanta, Georgia-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a similar ruling against Dalberiste.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court brings end to Trump Twitter fight,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley
(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought an end to a legal fight over former President Donald Trump's effort to block critics from following his now-frozen Twitter account, deciding the dispute was moot and throwing out a lower court's decision that found he had violated constitutional free speech rights. 
None of the justices on the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, dissented from Monday's action. But conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion echoing concerns made by Republicans about the power of social media companies like Twitter, saying the court needs to step in.
""We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms,"" Thomas wrote. 
Thomas said social media companies, which under U.S. law have leeway as private entities to moderate user content as they see fit, might have to be treated more like businesses that are subject to public accommodation laws, which require all customers to be treated equally.
Trump had appealed after the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that he had violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by blocking his critics on the social media platform. Trump, a Republican, left office in January, replaced by Democratic President Joe Biden.
With Trump no longer president, the justices declined to hear arguments and resolve the case on the merits, tossing out the 2nd Circuit decision.
Throughout his presidency, Trump had regularly used Twitter to promote his agenda and attack detractors. Twitter banned Trump from its service days after a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in a deadly riot on Jan. 6.
Republicans and Democrats both have criticized social media companies but often for different reasons, with Republicans saying these platforms have discriminated against conservatives while Democrats contend that the companies have not done enough to remove disinformation and extreme content.
Some Republicans have called for the companies to be stripped of legal protections they are accorded under a measure called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law gives companies immunity over content posted on their sites by users.
Trump made his innumerable posts on the  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) social media platform an important way of communicating both before and during his presidency. 
Before his permanent suspension, Trump's @realDonaldTrump account, which he opened in 2009, had more than 88 million followers. Twitter said it expelled Trump from its platform ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence.""
Trump touted his use of social media as a way to bypass traditional news media outlets, which he has called ""fake news"" while referring to journalists as the ""enemy of the people.""
The case began when seven people who Trump had blocked in 2017, along with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, challenged Trump's power to exclude people with whom he disagreed from his Twitter account. 
One of the blocked people had criticized Trump's travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries. Another had objected to Trump's promotion of a new coal mine, writing, ""Congrats and now black lung won't be covered under #TrumpCare."" Trump's administration had said some blocked users had used inflammatory language. 

The 2nd Circuit's ruling upheld a federal judge's 2018 decision against Trump, which prompted the president to unblock some accounts.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley upgraded MGM Resorts to a buy-equivalent from a neutral-equivalent, boosting its price target to $45 from $34, according to StreetInsider.
""Our channel checks suggest the Vegas (~50% of mix) recovery is occurring faster and stronger than expected,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen wrote in a note. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), however, maintained a sell rating, though it did bump its target price to $32 from $28, saying, ""We continue to see a slower path to recovery versus other areas of our coverage and less upside from partial ownership of the rapidly growing Sports Betting business.""The Goldman analyst says the following would be needed to have a more positive view: stronger convention trends in Las Vegas; improving visibility on Macau concessions and recovery trajectory; and the sustainability of momentum on the iGaming/online sports betting front.
In the skies, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth upgraded JetBlue to a buy-equivalent from a neutral-equivalent, citing earnings momentum and improving trends, including a recovery in near-international markets, MarketWatch reported. Syth said daily bookings almost doubled to as much as $12 million at the end of March from about $6 million early in the month.

One of the reasons behind the executives' departure was that they were unwilling to relocate to Florida, where Icahn and his firm moved last year. Icahn Enterprises has market capitalisation of more than $13 billion and investments in energy, metals and real estate, among others.
Icahn planned the move as far back as in 2019 after growing weary of working in New York, Reuters reported at the time, citing people familiar with the matter.

(Reuters) - Cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd said on Monday it would require mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for all guests and crew when it restarts trips from U.S. ports in July.
The company's announcement follows the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) latest guidance last week to the cruise ship industry, including the need for COVID-19 vaccinations. 
The cruise operator has taken a hit for over a year due to the pandemic, resulting in heavy annual losses and plunging revenue, forcing it to take new steps to ensure customers can set sail again. 
 Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL), which is set to resume some trips in the Caribbean in June, and Norwegian Cruise have also set up an expert panel to safely resume operations. 

""We believe that through a combination of 100% mandatory vaccinations for guests and crew and science-backed public health measures ... we can create a safe, 'bubble-like' environment for guests and crew,"" Norwegian Cruise's Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio said in a statement. 
In a letter to the CDC, Norwegian said it will begin trips at a reduced capacity of 60%. It then plans to gradually ramp up its fleet departing from U.S. ports and increase capacity by 20% every 30 days.
Shares of all three cruise operators - Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, Norwegian Cruise and Royal Caribbean - were up more than 2% before the bell.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped 6% Monday following its announcement of record deliveries in the March quarter.
The company Friday said it delivered 184,800 vehicles and produced 180,338 cars in the first quarter of 2021, topping the 180,570 deliveries of last year’s fourth quarter and also estimates of 177,822 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data.
The record deliveries prompted analysts to upgrade the stock.
“We now believe Tesla could exceed 850k deliveries for the year with 900k a stretch goal, despite the chip shortage and various supply chain issues lingering across the auto sector. . .we believe the tide is turning on the Street and the eye popping delivery numbers coming out of China cannot be ignored..,”  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note. He put a $1000 target on the stock.
Wedbush’s target is 51% higher than the stock’s Thursday closing price. Friday was a market holiday in the United States.
Tesla’s robust performance is noteworthy given that the quarter has been a rough one for the industry still trying to come out of the effect of the pandemic.
The electric vehicle maker faces several challenges, starting from a shortage of chips that go into its cars to a reduction of subsidies in the U.K. and the anti-American sentiment in China, its biggest market."

The net estimated $10.1 billion in flows in March was the lowest monthly figure since April 2020 and compares with a downwardly revised $23.4 billion net inflows in February.
China took in nearly 90% of net flows last month with $3.8 billion going to equities and $5 billion to Chinese debt instruments. Excluding China, EM equities funneled $0.2 billion while $1.2 billion flowed to non-Chinese debt.
""Despite the disappointing readings, some positive support to flows remains, stemming from increasing commodity prices and constructive balance of payments dynamics,"" the IIF said in a note. ""Our view is that contagion risk is less severe than during the EM sell-off in 2018 or during the 2013 taper tantrum.""

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was set to add about $50 billion to its market value as the electric car-maker's shares surged on Monday, after it posted record deliveries on strong demand in China that helped it offset the impact of a global shortage in auto parts.
The stock jumped nearly 8% in pre-market trading and it was on track to hit its highest in over a month.
The company said on Friday it was encouraged by the strong reception of its Model Y crossover in China and it was quickly progressing to full production capacity.
Analysts remained hopeful as despite a global chip shortage that has slammed the entire auto sector, various supply chain issues and rising competition, Tesla still managed to produce roughly the same amount of vehicles in the first quarter as in the fourth quarter.
At least three brokerages raised their price targets on Tesla's stock. Brokerage Wedbush was the most aggressive, increasing it by $50 to $1,000, much higher than the median price target of $712.50, as per Refinitiv data. Wedbush also raised its rating to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"".

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 08:50AM ET</span>","After failed takeover, Air Transat seeks help as debt crunch looms","By David Ljunggren and Allison Lampert
OTTAWA/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Struggling tour operator Air Transat is in talks with the federal government on aid but may not reach a deal by an April debt deadline, a source close to the situation said, putting pressure on Quebec to ride to the rescue of another troubled aerospace brand in the province.
Air Canada dropped its merger plans with Transat on Friday, saying European regulators had signaled it was unlikely to pass antitrust concerns. 
Canada’s largest carrier first bid for Transat in 2019 and discounted its offer last year as the pandemic decimated the travel and tourism sector. 
Airlines have been in talks with Ottawa since last year about a possible aid package. Transat’s aborted deal adds fresh urgency to the talks, given the jobs at risk if the carrier fails and the political importance of Quebec ahead of an expected federal election this year.
Transat, which last month suspended flights until June due to pandemic guidelines, has said it needs at least C$500 million in financing this year. 
It has obligations due on April 29 for a $50 million revolving facility and a C$250 million short-term loan that matures on June 30. If it does not meet the April 29 requirements, or obtain another extension, creditors could accelerate the repayment obligation. 
""There are ongoing negotiations and there is a budget coming up and there is no guarantee at this point that they will get there before the budget,"" said a source close to the situation, referring to the federal budget slated for April 19. 
""I think politically it would be a problem in Quebec. The federal government therefore absolutely has to come up with a solution,"" the source added, noting that ""Transat has more of a cachet in Quebec (than Air Canada).""
Both airlines are Montreal-based but Air Canada originated in Winnipeg before moving its headquarters to Quebec in the 1940s. Transat was founded by a group of Quebec businessmen, including the province’s current premier, in 1986 and grew to become the country’s third-biggest airline.
The airline was ""confident we will be able to secure the necessary financing in the coming weeks,"" spokesman Christophe Hennebelle said on Sunday, reiterating it was at an ""advanced stage"" of discussions with Ottawa on sector aid and accessing specific pandemic-aid to businesses.
Asked about the status of government talks with Transat, a spokeswoman for Canada’s finance minister said: ""I can’t speak to which creditors or lines of financing Air Transat is pursuing. As a private company, they’d be best placed to answer that.""
Ottawa said on Friday that protecting jobs and securing the long-term viability of Transat were a priority for the government. The carrier employs 5,000 people, mostly in Quebec, home to much of Canada’s aerospace sector. 
'COLLECTIVE INTEREST'
The survival of Transat, its Montreal headquarters and employees puts significant pressure on the Quebec government to secure its future. 
Quebec has come to the aid of struggling aerospace companies before. In 2015, the previous provincial government sunk US$1 billion into planemaker Bombardier’s then-struggling CSeries program. Two years later, Airbus paid Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) one dollar for control of the commercial jet program.
""The Quebec government is caught between a rock and a hard place on this one,"" said John Gradek, a former airline executive and program coordinator at McGill University's aviation management program. 
""There will be a lot of pressure on (Premier Francois) Legault to come to (Quebec businessman) Pierre Karl Péladeau’s aid in terms of funding.""
Péladeau, who proposed buying Transat for $5 a share, said on Friday his offer is still available. Transat had previously said the bid lacked the required level of financing.
Péladeau, chief executive of Quebecor Inc, said in a statement that his offer includes ""a rigorous business plan focusing on areas of the company with high growth potential, on expertise and job creation in Quebec” and a continued Montreal head office.
A second source familiar with the matter said Péladeau’s offer did not call for funding from the Quebec government, which said in February it was looking at scenarios for Transat ""with or without Air Canada.""
A spokesman for Quebec’s economy minister declined comment on Sunday. 
The separatist Bloc Quebecois said it wanted to ensure Quebec ownership would be favored for the carrier and blamed Ottawa, which approved the merger in February, for delaying an airline aid package.
""Air Transat is a flagship that has made Quebecers proud while offering Francophones a career in aviation,"" BQ transport critic Xavier Barsalou-Duval said in a statement. 

""It is in our collective interest that its decision-making center as well as its control remain in Quebec.""

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: South Korea steel giant POSCO weighs how to exit Myanmar military-backed venture - sources,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - Giant South Korea steelmaker  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) has begun reviewing how it might end a joint venture with a firm controlled by the military in Myanmar in the wake of the coup there in February, two people with first-hand knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
As Myanmar's army rulers continue a deadly crackdown on protest, with hundreds killed, the people said the Korean parent's POSCO C&C arm is looking into either selling its 70% stake in the venture with Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL), or buying out its partner's stake. It wasn't immediately clear how much the 30% holding might be worth. 
The internal discussions come amid growing scrutiny from shareholders and rights activists on international businesses still operating partnerships in Myanmar. Firms from Australia's Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum and Japan drinks giant Kirin Holdings are among those who have already pulled the plug.
MEHL is among Myanmar military entities recently sanctioned by the United States and Britain. POSCO C&C has repeatedly said it hasn't paid dividends to MEHL since the 2017 Rohingya crisis drew international criticism of Myanmar's military.
But the people with knowledge of the matter say POSCO is wary of an abrupt steel exit because it could potentially jeopardise hundreds of millions of dollars earned from more lucrative gas projects operated jointly with another Myanmar state firm by an affiliate, Posco International. 
""We won't want to run the business like we do now, and we are reviewing restructuring our Myanmar operation,"" one of the two sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters. The people declined to be identified citing internal company policy.
""This doesn't mean we are rushing to make any decision, but two options that could potentially take place include selling our stake or buying out their (MEHL's) stake.""
POSCO C&C previously said its business would not be hit by sanctions, and that it will only take action if it finds that MEHL is directly involved in the coup.
MEHL didn't respond to Reuters' request for comment.
'BIG BUCKS'
The profits POSCO makes from the Myanmar steel business - about 2 billion won ($1.77 million) last year - are dwarfed by earnings from Myanmar gas projects.
About two thirds of the operating profit at Posco International came from latter last year - around 300 billion won ($265.5 million) - in partnership with local state energy firm Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).
""Relatively speaking, (the) steel sheets business isn't making big bucks. And its ownership structure is much simpler than some of POSCO's other businesses in Myanmar,"" the second source at the company said.
""But if we exit, it would be important to say 'bye' on good terms.""
Total of France and U.S.-based  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) have also worked for decades with MOGE, which is yet to come under sanctions, although the UN's human rights investigator last month called for coordinated sanctions.
Exiting steel rather than gas would also be simpler due to a more complex ownership structure in the latter venture, the sources said. 
While Posco International controls the gas projects via its 51% stake, India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and GAIL own 17% and 8.5% stakes respectively. 
PRESSURE BUILDING
International pressure against the military and companies that have ties with it has steadily risen since February, with death toll close to 550 in the two months since the generals overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government.
Shin Mee-jee at South Korea's People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy was among those at pressure groups who said the country's huge national pension fund - the National Pension Service (NPS) - should exert pressure on POSCO to cut ties with Myanmar's military. 
NPS is the largest shareholder in POSCO, with an 11.1% stake worth $2.42 billion, and the world's third-biggest pension fund overall with nearly $1 trillion in assets. 
""What a nonsense, to see our taxpayers' money being channeled to kill the people of Myanmar through the (pension) ... The government also needs to be more responsible about where the pension fund's money is going,"" Shin said.
An NPS spokesperson declined to comment when asked if the fund or its governing committee would take action to possibly exclude POSCO from its fund.
Meanwhile European investors are taking a greater interest in POSCO's plans for Myanmar.
Sweden's public pension fund, which owns POSCO shares, told Reuters it has quizzed the company over its Myanmar investments as it is concerned about human rights issues in the country.
Meanwhile Nordic investor Nordea told the Swedish arm of the Fair Finance network, initiated by Oxfam, that it had put POSCO ""in quarantine until further notice"" regarding its Myanmar plans.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc will wind down its loss-making mobile division after failing to find a buyer, a move that is set to make it the first major smartphone brand to completely withdraw from the market.
Its decision to pull out will leave its 10% share in North America, where it is the No. 3 brand, to be gobbled up by Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its domestic rival expected to have the edge. 
""In the United States, LG has targeted mid-priced - if not ultra-low - models and that means Samsung (KS:005930), which has more mid-priced product lines than Apple, will be better able to attract LG users,"" said Ko Eui-young, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities.
LG's smartphone division has logged nearly six years of losses totalling some $4.5 billion. Dropping out of the fiercely competitive sector would allow LG to focus on growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices and smart homes, it said in a statement.
In better times, LG was early to market with a number of cell phone innovations including ultra-wide angle cameras and at its peak in 2013, it was the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer behind Samsung and Apple.
But later, its flagship models suffered from both software and hardware mishaps which combined with slower software updates saw the brand steadily slip in favour. Analysts have also criticised the company for lack of expertise in marketing compared to Chinese rivals.
While other well-known mobile brands such as Nokia (NYSE:NOK), HTC and Blackberry (TSX:BB) have also fallen from lofty heights, they have yet to disappear completely.
LG's current global share is only about 2%. It shipped 23 million phones last year which compares with 256 million for Samsung, according to research provider Counterpoint.
In addition to North America, it does have a sizeable presence in Latin America, where it ranks as the No. 5 brand.
While rival Chinese brands such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) do not have much of a presence in the United States, in part due to frosty bilateral relations, their and Samsung's low to mid-range product offerings are set to benefit from LG's absence in Latin America, analysts said.
LG's smartphone division, the smallest of its five divisions accounting for about 7% of revenue, is expected to be wound down by July 31.
In South Korea, the division's employees will be moved to other LG Electronics businesses and affiliates, while elsewhere decisions on employment will be made at the local level.
Analysts said they were told in a conference call that LG plans to retain its 4G and 5G core technology patents as well as core R&D personnel, and will continue to develop communication technologies for 6G. It has yet to decide whether to license out such intellectual property in the future, they added. 
LG will provide service support and software updates for customers of existing mobile products for a period of time which will vary by region, it added. 
Talks to sell part of the business to Vietnam's Vingroup fell through due to differences about terms, sources with knowledge of the matter have said. 

LG Elec shares have risen about 7% since a January announcement that it was considering all options for the business.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>","Stocks gain after bumper U.S. jobs data, bonds smell Fed trouble","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stock prices rose to a 1 1/2-month high on Monday after data showed a surge in U.S. employment while U.S. bonds came under pressure on worries the Federal Reserve may bump up interest rates sooner than it has indicated.
U.S. S&P500 futures traded 0.3% higher, maintaining most of their gains made during a truncated session on Friday though tech-heavy Nasdaq futures lagged behind, trading almost flat.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8% while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped slightly, with China closed for Tomb-Sweeping day and Australia on Easter Monday.
MSCI's all-country world index was almost flat but stood near its highest level since late February and within sight of a record high set that month, though trade remains slow, with much of Europe on holiday.
The U.S. labour department said on Friday that nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since last August.
That was well above economists' median forecast of 647,000 and was closer to markets' whisper number of one million. Data for February was also revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000. 
""There will be further improvements in April, as restaurants have started to reopen. People have expected economic normalisation to take place sooner or later but its pace seems to be accelerating,"" said Koichi Fujishiro, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research.
Although employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, an accelerating recovery raised hopes that all the jobs lost during the pandemic could be recouped by the end of next year.
The prospect of a return to a full employment, in turn, is raising questions about whether the Fed can stick to its pledge that it will keep interest rates through 2023.
Markets have strong doubts, with Fed funds futures fully priced in one rate hike by the end of next year.
Many market players also expect the Fed to look into tapering its bond buying this year, even though Fed officials have said it has not discussed the issue yet.
""It will become impossible for the Fed to avoid discussing tapering by the autumn,"" said Kozo Koide, chief economist at Asset Management One, noting U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure spending plan is likely to be passed by then. 
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 0.186%, near its eight-month peak of 0.194% touched in late February.
Yields on longer-dated bonds also rose, with 10-year notes at 1.725% in Asia on Monday, extending its rise that began on Friday after the job report.
The strong jobs data helped to underpin the dollar.
The greenback traded at 110.65 yen, not far from Wednesday's one-year peak of 110.97. The euro stood at $1.1752 .
Gold slipped 0.4% to $1,724.70.
In crypto assets, ether slipped 1.7% to $2,040.21 from Friday's record peak of $2,144.99. Bitcoin eased 0.9% to $57,704.
Oil prices dropped, paring strong gains made in the previous session that was driven by the decision by OPEC+ to gradually ease some of its production cuts between May and July.
""Although the market rose initially on the news, it will be an output increase after all,"" said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity analyst at Nomura. 
The decision came after the new U.S. administration called on Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, to keep energy affordable for consumers. 
U.S. energy firms also added the most number of oil rigs in a week since January 2020 as higher oil prices in recent months have prompted drillers to return to the wellpad.

U.S. crude futures fell 1.4% to $60.62 per barrel while Brent fell 1.4% to $63.95.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>","Samsung first-quarter profit likely surged 45% on bumper smartphone, appliance sales","By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd likely saw a 45% jump in profit for January-March on robust sales of smartphones, TVs and home appliances, though chip division earnings are seen tumbling after a storm suspended production at its U.S. plant.
Spending more time at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, consumers have splashed out on an array of high-margin consumer electronics which in turn has helped cause a global shortage of semiconductors.
Operating profit for the South Korean tech giant in the quarter is expected to have climbed to 9.3 trillion won ($8.2 billion), according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate drawn from 16 analysts. SmartEstimates assign more weight to forecasts from consistently accurate analysts.
That would mark Samsung (KS:005930)'s highest operating income level for the first quarter since 2018. Revenue likely rose 12%.
Samsung is scheduled to announce preliminary first-quarter results on Wednesday.
In particular, its mobile division looks like it had a stand-out quarter, benefiting from the launch of its Galaxy S21 series in mid-January - more than a month ahead of the flagship model's usual annual release schedule.
The world's largest smartphone maker is estimated to have cornered roughly 23% of global market in the quarter, thanks to that launch and cheaper-than-usual pricing for its premium devices, according to Counterpoint Research. The S21, for example, was priced $200 lower than the S20.
That compares with 20% market share in the same quarter a year ago and 16% market share in the previous quarter when arch-rival Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) released the iPhone 12.
High-margin accessories such as Galaxy Buds did brisk business as well, analysts said. They estimate operating profit for the division likely soared by more than 1 trillion won from a year earlier to about 4.15 trillion won.
Samsung's TV and home appliance business is expected to see operating profit more than double to around 1 trillion won.
Despite stratospheric demand worldwide for chips, profits for Samsung's semiconductor division are expected to have fallen by roughly a fifth to 3.6 trillion won.
The division has been hampered by the cost of ramping up new production and losses at its Texas factory after a winter storm halted output in mid-February. Samsung said production at the plant had returned to near-normal levels as of late March.
Analysts have estimated the losses related to the Texas factory shutdown at around 300-400 billion won.

Le Maire, speaking on LCI TV, declined to comment on the amount involved. He confirmed that the airline group's board was due to meet on Monday to discuss and approve the package, as successive coronavirus shutdowns take their toll.
Air France-KLM, which last year received 10.4 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in government-backed loans, has been discussing a multi-stage recapitalisation plan to lighten the resulting debt load, sources have said. 
This will likely involve converting a 3 billion-euro French government loan into hybrid instruments. 
But the plan had been held up by wrangling over EU demands that Air France give up Paris-Orly take-off and landing slots as a condition. 
Le Maire said the airline had given up some slots in negotiations, but not the 24 initially demanded by Brussels, which would have put Air France on a par with those ceded by Germany's Lufthansa in Frankfurt and Munich as part of its state-backed capital hike. 

""It has been a long and difficult negotiation but I think we have reached a good deal with (EU competition chief) Margrethe Vestager,"" Le Maire said. 
France and the Netherlands each own close to 14% of Air France-KLM, and the Dutch state has held separate EU talks over converting its 1 billion euro loan to KLM into hybrid debt in return for slot concessions at Amsterdam-Schiphol.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: ByteDance says India's freeze on bank accounts is harassment - court filing,"By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI (Reuters) - China's ByteDance has told an Indian court that a government freeze on its bank accounts in a probe of possible tax evasion amounts to harassment and was done illegally, according to a filing seen by Reuters.
ByteDance in January reduced its Indian workforce after New Delhi maintained a ban on its popular video app TikTok, imposed last year after a border clash between India and China. Beijing has repeatedly criticised India over that ban and those of other Chinese apps.
An Indian tax intelligence unit in mid-March ordered HSBC and Citibank in Mumbai to freeze bank accounts of ByteDance India as it probed some of the unit's financial dealings. ByteDance has challenged the freeze on the four accounts in a Mumbai court.
None of ByteDance India's employees have been paid their March salaries due to the account freeze, said two people familiar with the matter. The company told the court it has a workforce of 1,335, including outsourced personnel.
In the 209-page court filing lodged on March 25, ByteDance told the High Court in Mumbai the authorities acted against the company without any material evidence and gave no prior notice, as required by Indian law, before such ""drastic action"".
Blocking accounts ""during the process of investigation amounts (to) applying undue coercion,"" ByteDance argued. It is ""intended, improperly, to harass the petitioner.""
India's Directorate General of Goods & Services Tax Intelligence, and the finance ministry which oversees it, did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the weekend.
The details of the tax investigation have not previously been reported. The tax agency told ByteDance last year it had reasons to believe the company suppressed certain transactions and claimed excessive tax credits, the filing shows.
ByteDance declined to comment on its court filing but told Reuters on Tuesday it disagrees with the decision of the tax authority. HSBC declined to comment, while Citibank did not respond.
ADVERTISING, OTHER DEALS SCRUTINISED
The court declined to grant ByteDance immediate relief in a brief hearing on Wednesday. The next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.
The investigation centres on potential evasion of taxes related to online advertising and other financial dealings between ByteDance India and its parent entity in Singapore, TikTok Pte Ltd. TikTok did not respond to an email seeking comment.
ByteDance told the court its India workforce includes 800 people working in its ""trust and safety"" team that supports activities like content moderation overseas.
The company has ""robust business plans in India and is not contemplating winding up,"" it said, urging the court to lift the freeze on the accounts.
The tax agency started investigating the company in July. It inspected documents at the company's office and summoned and questioned at least three executives, the filing says. Authorities also asked ByteDance to submit documents, including invoices and agreements signed with some clients.
ByteDance representatives ""appeared multiple times"" before tax officers and provided documents, the filing says. 
TikTok, one of India's most popular video apps before it was banned, has faced scrutiny around the world. 

Under then-President Donald Trump, the United States alleged the app posed national security concerns. The new administration of Joe Biden has paused a government lawsuit that could have resulted in a de facto ban on TikTok's use there.

The proposed deal, which is subject to approval by the U.S. bankruptcy court for the district of Delaware, is supported by holders of over 85% of the company's unsecured notes, Hertz said in a statement. 
Under the deal, the supporting noteholders have given the green signal to support the exchange of the unsecured funded debt claims against the company for approximately 48.2% of the equity in the reorganized company, and the right to purchase an additional $1.6 billion of equity.
They have also committed to purchase, or otherwise backstop, the full $1.6 billion of equity being offered to the holders of the company's unsecured funded debt. 
""This plan accomplishes all the goals we set out to achieve through our financial restructuring. Our new sponsors combined with our strong leadership team will bring significant operational experience across fleet financing and management, which will benefit all of our stakeholders,"" Chief Executive Paul Stone said.
Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection in May as travel plummeted during the pandemic, slamming the car rental business, and talks with creditors failed to result in much-needed relief.

On March 2, Hertz said two investment firms -- Knighthead Capital Management LLC and Certares Opportunities LLC -- will buy a majority stake in the company for $4.2 billion under a restructuring plan expected to help it out of bankruptcy by early- to mid-summer.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: High-flying market to take cues from infrastructure plans, upcoming earnings","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's massive infrastructure proposal and the upcoming corporate earnings season could offer investors fresh insight on the sustainability of a rally that has taken stocks to all-time highs. 
The S&P 500 scaled 4,000 for the first time on Thursday and closed up 1.18% at 4,019.87, extending the benchmark index's gain to nearly 80% from lows in March 2020. The rally has been driven by unprecedented U.S. stimulus measures and expectations that widespread vaccinations against COVID-19 will spur an economic rebound.
Evidence of strengthening economic and corporate growth could support investor confidence after a quarter that saw solid stock gains but also a worrying surge in bond yields and pockets of market volatility, including the wild ride in GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares and the meltdown of highly leveraged family office Archegos Capital.
Investors also are set to get a snapshot of how companies are performing a year after the onset of the pandemic when corporate earnings kick off in earnest in mid-April.
""We've been seeing the volatility over the past few months,"" said Matt Hanna, portfolio manager at Summit Global Investments. ""There's always a doubt that perhaps the rug can get pulled out, but now that we're hitting 4,000 I'm sure that renews confidence in a lot of traders’ minds that this bull cycle is not over.”
Recent history suggests stocks could keep rolling this month, with the S&P 500 tallying its highest average gain in April out of any month over the past 20 years, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
One near-term market focus is likely to be whether Congress will pass the infrastructure plan Biden formally introduced this week. It includes $2 trillion in spending but also higher corporate taxes that investors fear could undermine profits.
Coupled with Biden's recently enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, the infrastructure initiative would give the federal government a bigger role in the U.S. economy than it has had in generations. The initial plan calls for spending on everything from roads and bridges to broadband and elderly care, and he may unveil another spending package in April.
Economists at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) estimate Biden's infrastructure plan overall could add 0.5 to 1 percentage points to their estimate of 5.2% growth in U.S. gross domestic product in 2022.
With any spending set to come over time, the market impact could be blunted compared to the recent relief package that sent $1,400 checks directly to Americans, investors said.
But more infrastructure spending could fuel shares of companies in the industrials and materials sectors, which have already been among the groups benefiting in recent months from bets on an economic rebound.
""From a market perspective, that cyclical/value area that has been working should have another leg in the second quarter as we see things like this infrastructure package maybe add some more fuel,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise.
Biden also plans to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from the 21% levy set by the Trump administration's 2017 tax bill, which had previously been a support for stocks. S&P 500 earnings could take a 7.4% hit from the proposed tax plan, including the higher corporate rate, according to UBS equity strategists.
Investors have taken the tax plan largely in stride as it has come within expectations and may not take effect until next year, but any new tax increase that accompany Biden's next proposed spending plan could pose a risk, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.
""The market has digested the initial news very well...,"" Todd said. ""My concern is potentially the next round may be more expansive on the tax front than people are expecting.""
Corporate results are due in earnest starting in mid-April and overall S&P 500 first-quarter earnings are expected to jump 24.2% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES.
But there could be a downside to increasing profit expectations, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).

""When the expectations bar has been raised as much as it has, then I think that it sets up for some disappointments and that could cause the market to potentially stall out,” Frederick said.

Amazon has long discouraged attempts among its more than 800,000 U.S. employees to organize. Allegations by many workers of a grueling or unsafe workplace have turned unionizing the company into a key goal for the U.S. labor movement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Part of the reason why U.S. stocks are struggling for a second straight week may be quarter- and month-end rebalancing by pension funds, which could also keep pressure on equities through the end of March next week. 
With the S&P 500 up nearly 2% for the month and more than 3% for the quarter while bond prices have struggled, pushing the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a 14-month high last week, many analysts expect money to shift into the fixed income segment. 
But as the benchmark S&P index has struggled of late while pressure on bond prices has eased, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury hitting a one-week low on Thursday,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts now expect U.S. pensions to move an additional $19 billion into fixed income for rebalancing, down from their initial estimate on March 18 of $28 billion. 
In a note on Wednesday,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimated combined selling of $32.6 billion in U.S. equities from pension funds that rebalance on a monthly or quarterly basis. Using the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund ETF as a proxy, the firm anticipates about $45 billion to buy as funds boost their fixed-income exposure. 
But not all analysts expect rebalancing to cause a downdraft on stock performance. Marko Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan's chief global markets strategist believes recent trends in portfolio rebalancing have taken the bite out of the dreaded quarter-end rebalancing. These include tweaks to portfolios being more opportunistic rather than strictly at quarter-ends, and reallocations geared towards volatility levels rather than fixed target weights for particular asset classes.
""A lack of these flows, and broad anticipation of 'month/quarter-end' effect, could result in the market moving higher near term, all else equal,"" Kolanovic said.

Each of the firms cautioned the actual timing of the rebalancing can vary, and in some cases may have already begun.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2021 12:34AM ET</span>",U.S. regulators inch toward pet-insurance rules as Sir Purrs A Lot ails,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - U.S. insurance regulators are close to creating a legal standard for pet insurance that would address long-standing consumer complaints that insurers rarely pay up when their furry friends are not well.
A National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) committee is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss fine-print provisions about several controversial issues. Among them: determining whether a pet's condition is ""pre-existing"" and how long customers must wait after buying coverage to file claims.
The committee is preparing for NAIC's national meeting in April, where regulators from all 50 states will congregate to discuss top-of-mind issues. The committee is getting closer to presenting the ""model"" pet insurance law to those regulators to approve. Then, state legislatures can decide whether to adopt the proposed law or create their own versions.
It is an important development at a time when the pet insurance market is poised to grow.
The pandemic led many Americans to adopt or purchase pets for companionship during extended lockdowns. Dog inquiries on Petfinder, an online pet directory, rose 36% for the year ended January 31, a spokeswoman said.
Less than 3% of U.S. pets are insured, compared to 20% in some European markets, according to IBISWorld. The research firm expects pet-insurance earnings to swell from $1.6 billion last year to $2.4 billion in 2025.
Policies are similar to human health coverage, with annual premiums and deductibles. Rates are typically based on animals' ages and care levels. Pricier policies tend to have broader protections.
However, customers who buy insurance are often stunned by rejected claims, facing unexpected restrictions, or companies take aggressive stances about what should be covered.
For instance, Philadelphia-based consultant Chris Arlene pays Embrace Pet Insurance $45 a month to cover his dog, Chance. When Chance swallowed a stuffed animal last year, requiring hospitalization, Embrace initially denied the $1,100 claim, citing a ""pre-existing condition"" for eating objects.
""I was so emotionally distraught,"" said Arlene.
He appealed the decision, providing additional information that convinced Embrace to pay, a spokeswoman said.
Experiences like Arlene's are so common that California adopted consumer-protection laws about pet insurance beginning in 2014, and has since reinforced the rules. A pending bill would require insurers to include spaying and neutering in standard coverage.
U.S. insurance regulation is a state-by-state patchwork rather than a federally-managed process. That means NAIC's proposal can be influential for states that have been less proactive than California, whose laws provided a mold.
NAIC's move is especially important, consumer advocates said, as new entrants have flooded into the United States, hoping to get a piece of the growing pet-insurance pie.
Familiar insurance brands like Nationwide and MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) offer coverage, sometimes through employee-sponsored benefits programs. Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) and PetPlan have become big players, while Lemonade Inc entered the market last year. European insurer Bought By Many just launched ManyPets in Illinois on Thursday.
""You have to read the policy carefully,"" said Robert Hunter, insurance director for the Consumer Federation of America. ""I've never been a big fan despite having owned dozens of dogs.""
Hunter and others cautioned that NAIC's suggestions will not be a panacea for customers expecting pet insurers to cover bills for dogs, cats, ferrets and iguanas who need medical help.
NAIC began working on the idea in 2016, and there is no guarantee states will embrace its proposal quickly, or at all. And insurers may fight claims even with tougher rules.
Pet insurers simply want customers to understand what they are buying, the North American Pet Health Insurance Association said in a March regulatory update. The industry group says a model law could ""provide consistency"" but wants a version that allows insurers to ""remain competitive.""
For Gregory Allen, a restaurant worker in Baltimore, the changes may come too late.
Allen got a cat last year after losing his job due to government-imposed business shutdowns. The cat, Sir Purrs A Lot, soon began showing signs of an ""excessive grooming"" disorder, which can cause sores and infections.
Despite buying insurance, Allen has paid out of pocket for Sir Purrs A Lot's vet visits, first because of a two-week waiting period for coverage and then because his insurer deemed the cat's illness a pre-existing condition.

""My former therapist said that getting a pet would be really good for my mental health,"" Allen said. ""But with him being as sick as he is and having to deal with insurance, it's like the opposite of that.""

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2021 12:33AM ET</span>",Online lender SoFi to give IPO access to retail investors,"(This March 26th story corrects to fix typographical and grammatical error in quote in paragraph 6)
By Anirban Sen, Krystal Hu and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Online lending startup Social Finance Inc (SoFi) will allow retail investors to buy into initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies, an investment opportunity traditionally reserved for large Wall Street investors. 
SoFi's Friday announcement comes a day after a Reuters report revealed that online brokerage Robinhood Markets was building a platform to ""democratize"" IPOs, including its own, that would allow users of its trading app to snap up shares alongside big funds. 
Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been first in line for such stocks, as well as the investment banks that earn big money from arranging such offerings.
SoFi's latest move could expand access to buying IPO shares alongside large investment firms to everyday investors, most of whom are only able to buy stock when the shares start trading. Nineteen IPOs of companies in 2020 had seen their shares' value more than double in their first day of trading. 
In an interview, SoFi Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto said the new IPO offering was designed to encourage more long-term holders and would penalize investors who focus on short-term profits from opening-day pops. 
""We have a very different customer base, members who are high earners, not well served,"" said Noto. ""It's a client base that is interested in investing, is actively managing a portfolio and focused on financial objectives. Their interest is in line with issuers.""
SoFi said the latest IPO offering, which has been in the works since 2019, will be available to anyone with an investment account with the company and a minimum of $3,000 in the account. 
Noto, who has previously headed the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and has worked on more than 50 IPOs in that role, said SoFi will selectively choose the IPOs it plans to offer to investors on the platform, based on the quality of the companies. 
DEMOCRATIZE IPOs
Currently, retail investors and other amateur traders cannot buy shares of a newly listed company until they start trading. Since shares often trade higher when they debut, big funds that get allocations in an IPO have a massive advantage.
The average first-day trading pop on U.S. listings of businesses in 2020 was 36%, according to data provider Dealogic.
SoFi has already obtained regulatory clearances to operate the new IPO platform, Noto said, adding that the company will act as a ""passive"" underwriter on deals. SoFi pitched the allocation plan to issuers and will work with banks and underwriters on allocating shares.
Like other Wall Street banks and underwriters on deals, SoFi will collect underwriting fees from issuers for allocations. 
""I've talked a lot about leveling the playing field for retail investors, and am proud to say @SoFi is aiming to do that starting today,"" tweeted venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya, whose blank-check firm struck a deal to take SoFi public in January.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) said on Friday that Scott Soussa, who co-heads the hedge fund and private equity stakes business, has decided to leave the firm and that Mustafa Siddiqui, who co-heads the business, will be the sole head of the Strategic Capital Holdings unit.
Soussa, a senior managing director in the company's Blackstone Alternative Asset Management unit (BAAM), is leaving for another opportunity but has agreed to remain at Blackstone until the end of the year. 
Siddiqui, also a senior managing director in Blackstone's BAAM unit, has served as co-head of the business, known as the GP Stakes platform, alongside Soussa. Previously he worked in Blackstone's Private Equity Group, where he led the firm's private equity investment activities across the energy sector in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
""We are incredibly grateful to Scott for his significant contributions in building our successful stakes business,"" said Blackstone President Jon Gray, adding that he was promoting Siddiqui and naming firm veteran Mike Nash to a new role. ""Our stakes business has tremendous momentum partnering with world-class GPs and we are quite excited about what's to come,"" Gray told Reuters ahead of an announcement of the changes.
Nash, who co-founded Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, will become chairman of the GP Stakes platform. The business oversees $7.4 billion in assets.
The unit makes minority investments in a general partner's underlying management company. Some of its most prominent successes include Senator Investment Group, New Mountain Capital, Francisco Partners and Leonard Green.
Blackstone is the world's biggest investor in hedge funds and its BAAM unit manages $79 billion in assets. It has been expanding this year. 

In January it hired former Brown University endowment chief Joe Dowling to join John McCormick (NYSE:MKC) at BAAM's co-head. Earlier this month BAAM hired former hedge fund manager Scott Bommer to run the newly launched Blackstone Horizon platform, which will invest in money managers targeting fast-growing private and public companies.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2021 12:32AM ET</span>","Ackman stays mum on $4 billion SPAC target, says a second may follow","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Joshua Franklin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Monday that there was nothing to report yet on finding a target for his $4 billion blank-check investment vehicle.
Ackman made headlines last year when he raised Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, making it the biggest blank check company ever. It now has between $5 billion and $7 billion of equity capital for its initial business combination.
Speculation grew about Ackman's potential target - with talk about Airbnb Inc, Stripe, and Bloomberg L.P. being on his list. Late last year, he said he hoped to be able to break the news on a target by the end of the first quarter of 2021.
""Eight months since PSTH's launch, we remain convinced that an investment in PSTH will generate highly attractive long-term returns, even from PSTH’s current stock price,"" Ackman said in a report. 
""While we previously believed that we would be able to announce a potential transaction by the end of this quarter, we will not be in a position to do so.""
Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings fund has returned 5.9% this year after surging 70.2% last year.
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) like Pershing Square Tontine raise money in an initial public offering with the aim of merging with a private company. For the private company, the process is an alternative to it doing an IPO itself. 
Pershing Square Tontine held talks with Airbnb, Reuters reported last year, but the home-rental start-up ultimately opted for a traditional IPO. 
In a regulatory filing for the IPO last year, Ackman's team highlighted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets and corporate earnings as a likely constraint on the broader IPO market, creating an opportunity for his SPAC.
The market quickly rebounded, however, resulting in the busiest year for IPOs since 2000. In addition, a record amount of SPAC capital was raised, resulting in more competition.
Ackman said he would likely seek to raise a second SPAC once Pershing Square Tontine completed a merger. 
Pershing Square Tontine has until July 21, 2022 to do a deal or sign a letter of intent, which would then give it another six months to complete the merger. If it does not, the funds are returned to investors. 

Ackman also discussed environmental, social and governance - or ESG - issues, saying they are critical for his investments and play no role in trying to market to potential newcomers because he is not presently raising new capital.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2021 12:32AM ET</span>",Analysis: Cathie Wood's ARK funds still in favor despite poor first-quarter performance,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cathie Wood failed to repeat her stellar 2020 performance with ARK Invest funds in the first quarter, but the celebrity fund manager still managed to attract a steady pile of cash into her red-hot funds.
Wood outperformed every other actively managed equity mutual or exchange-traded fund manager last year, according to Morningstar, helping propel the firm's assets under management of its flagship ARK Innovation fund from $1.86 billion at the end of 2019 to nearly $22 billion as of March, according to Lipper data.
    But for the first quarter her flagship fund is down 10.7% through March 29, ranking in the worst 1 percentile of the 601 U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/performance. Over a five-year period, its annualized gain is 44.6%.
ARK's Space Exploration & Innovation ETF also slipped on Tuesday in their Wall Street debut.
ARK Invest did not respond to a request to comment.
Despite this year's performance, ARK still attracts retail investors at a time when many have given up on stock pickers in favor of passive index investing. Wood's ARK Innovation ETF has brought in nearly $5.5 billion in new funds so far this year, the most of any actively managed equity fund, while three other ARK funds attracted inflows that ranked among the top 10, according to Morningstar. 
The inflows could signal that retail investors are focusing on frothy stocks rather than fundamentals, said Phil Toews, chief executive of financial advisory firm Toews Corp, which has about $2 billion in assets under management.
""I used to feel that at some point we could reach the highs of the late '90s during this rally. Witnessing the rise in ARK and the stocks that support it helped me realize we are already there,"" said Toews.
A fixture on financial media and Twitter, Wood is among the few mutual or exchange-traded fund managers whose remarks can move markets. When Wood said earlier in March that she expected Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares to top $3,000 by 2025, shares of the electric automaker popped nearly 5% in morning trading. 
    Still, rising concerns about inflation have stalled a rally in Wood's portfolio companies like  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) that outperformed during the pandemic. Wood, for her part, has said that she still considers companies like Zoom Communications Inc ""undervalued"" and has been buying on dips.
Wood is not alone in her tepid performance since the start of the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell into a correction - a 10% decline from its most recent highs - on March 8. For the quarter as a whole, the Nasdaq is up 1%. 
Technology and high-growth stocks that Wood favors have suffered as investors price in the likelihood of above-average inflation that would raise borrowing costs for consumers and companies. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries hovered near a 14-month high of 1.72% this week, as investors priced in the effects of the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep monetary policy loose, boosting economic growth and inflation.
Wood's adherence to her investment approach despite the movements of the broader markets could be a double-edged sword, said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of wealth management at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who has known Wood for over 30 years.  
""She's a gifted, brilliant portfolio manager because she is so committed and disciplined to her style and rides the rollercoaster of the markets because sometimes that style goes out of favor and sometimes that style has spectacular bear markets,"" she said.
Some investors and analysts said that Wood remains correct in her bullish outlook despite the short-term hiccups. 
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said higher bond yields and inflation would have less of an effect on the technology and growth stocks in Wood's portfolio than the market expects.

Wood has ""been dead right over the last three to four years,"" said Ives.

Firms including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) have recently announced they are betting on bitcoin, as the wider adoption of the cryptocurrency for settling transactions and investments gathers pace. 
The move by Goldman, reported by CNBC earlier on Wednesday, comes days after a report that rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had started offering clients investments to the emerging asset class. 
CNBC reported that Goldman would ultimately offer investments in bitcoin and digital assets that would include the physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles. (https://cnb.cx/3u6VXEA)
A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the details of the report, which cited an interview with Mary Rich, the global head of digital assets for Goldman's private wealth management division. 
Reuters reported earlier this month that Goldman had restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk and that it was also exploring possibilities for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.
The rising interest in the cryptocurrency comes after Tesla revealed in February that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, helping drive the cryptocurrency to record highs and breach $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time. 

The digital currency, however, remains highly volatile.

""We are encouraged by the strong reception of the Model Y in China and are quickly progressing to full production capacity,"" Tesla said in a statement. 
""The new Model S and Model X have also been exceptionally well received ... and we are in the early stages of ramping production,"" it added. 
Tesla's Shanghai factory started production of the Model Y late last year in the key market where it already produces Model 3 sedans. In February, Tesla's China sales jumped from the previous month even as demand usually falls during China's Lunar New Year holidays which occurred that month. 
The electric-car maker delivered 184,800 vehicles globally during the first quarter, above estimates of 177,822 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data.
This also exceeds its previous record of 180,570 achieved last quarter. 
In February, Tesla suspended its California plant for two days due to ""parts shortages."" 
""We believe China and Europe were particularly robust this quarter,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. He expects Tesla's annual sales to exceed 850,000 vehicles this year, fueled by the Biden administration's policy of boosting EV sales and by rising global demand. 
Tesla delivered 182,780 Model 3/Ys in the first quarter, up 13% from the previous quarter. In contrast, deliveries of pricier S/Xs slumped from 18,920 to 2,020 during the period, ahead of model refreshes. 
Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber said sales declines of the more profitable cars would lead to weaker margins for Tesla in the first quarter, but he forecast ""blowout"" results for the second quarter.
Other automakers like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Thursday reported a rebound in first-quarter U.S. sales from a coronavirus-induced slump last year, but volumes were capped by a global chip scarcity that forced many companies to cut production. 

Tesla has become the most valuable auto company in the world by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and GM.

The airline group, which last year received 10.4 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in government-backed loans, has been discussing a multi-stage recapitalisation plan to lighten the resulting debt load, sources have said.
But the plan, likely to include conversion of a 3 billion-euro French government loan into hybrid instruments, has been held up by wrangling over European Union demands that Air France give up Paris-Orly take-off and landing slots as a condition.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire signalled a breakthrough in those talks earlier this week, predicting an agreement within ""a matter of days"".
Air France-KLM declined to comment on the airline group's planned board meeting, first reported by Bloomberg.
EU officials had initially demanded a similar number of slots to the 24 ceded by Germany's Lufthansa in Frankfurt and Munich in return for its government-backed capital hike, sources close to the talks have said.
That position drew protests from Air France, its unions and the government.
France and the Netherlands each own close to 14% of Air France-KLM, and the Dutch state has held separate EU talks over converting its 1 billion euro loan to KLM into hybrid debt in return for slot concessions at Amsterdam-Schiphol.
Converting the government debt will not be enough to right Air France-KLM's balance sheet, say analysts, who predict a further dilutive capital increase will follow.

The group told investors it planned to raise ""quasi-equity and equity"", after its balance sheet recorded 5.42 billion euros in negative shareholder equity as of Dec. 31.

TOKYO/ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse shares rose on Thursday, ending a losing streak in which they shed close to a fifth of their value, though the lender is yet disclose how much it lost in trades for stricken U.S. fund Archegos.
Defaults on margin calls by Archegos Capital, a family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, caused a clutch of banks to rapidly unwind billions of dollars of his leveraged trades. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Japan's Nomura have borne the brunt of those losses, with the Swiss lender warning it could have a ""material impact"" on its profits, but details of who else was exposed to Hwang are still emerging. 
Japanese financial firm Mizuho Financial Group Inc may face a loss of 10 billion yen ($90 million) from deals with Archegos, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday.
""We refrain from making comments on individual deals, but we don't currently see any issue that may affect our profit forecast,"" a spokeswoman for Mizuho said, adding the bank does not conduct prime brokerage services globally.
Mizuho's U.S. subsidiary has lent to Archegos, the Nikkei reported.
Mizuho rival Nomura has said it expects to book a $2 billion loss on Archegos. 
Credit Suisse is expected to detail in the coming days the scale of the losses it is facing as a result of its dealings with Archegos, according to a source familiar with the matter. Two sources close to the bank said they could be as high as $5 billion, a figure the bank has declined to comment on. 
Switzerland's second largest lender has lost almost a quarter of its value over the past month, hit first by worries over its exposure to collapsed UK supply chain firm Greensill and then Archegos. Supply chain funds run by the bank had invested $10 billion in securities issued by Greensill, and it is not clear how much of that they will get back. 
The bank said in a notice to investors on Wednesday that it expects to get the ""majority"" of that money to be recovered.
Its shares were up 2.6% on Thursday though still down 18.5% for the week, while Nomura closed up 0.22% but is down 19% since Monday. 
Credit Suisse's CoCo, or contingent convertible dollar bond maturing Dec 2023 has fallen more than three cents in price since last Friday and is now trading at 107.7 points, the lowest since July, MarketAxess data shows. 

Average daily trading volumes in the bond spiked in March over $1.9 billion compared to February levels of $710 million.
Shares of big U.S. banks were headed to end the holiday-shortened week on Thursday with a mix of gains and losses of 2% or less, despite expectations for new regulatory scrutiny of trading they do for funds.

(Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent's Timi Studios, maker of popular video games Honor of Kings and Call of Duty Mobile, generated revenue of $10 billion last year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The $10 billion would make Timi the world's largest developer, the sources say, which many industry watchers had suspected to be the case. 
It also provides a hefty basis for its ambitions to move beyond mobile games and compete directly with global heavyweights developing expensive ""AAA"" titles on platforms such as desktop computers,  Sony  (NYSE:SNE)'s PlayStation, Nintendo's  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox. 
In a recruitment notice last month, a Timi engineer wrote that the company aims to create a new AAA game that resembles the virtual community from the movie Ready Player One, and will ""compete head-to-head against big powers from Japan, Korea, Europe and U.S.""
Tencent is building studios overseas, including one for Timi and one for Lightspeed and Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO), both in Los Angeles, with the goal of creating content with original intellectual property that has global appeal.
Tencent aims eventually to derive half its game revenue from overseas, from 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, the most recently available figure.
Many major studios are turning to Tencent for support to convert their ""hardcore"" desktop or console games to mobile. Such games feature long sessions and in-depth storytelling or battles, with some including multiplayer online role-playing or online battle arenas.
Last week, Tencent reported 156.1 billion yuan ($23.79 billion) in overall online game revenues for 2020 but did not break down revenue for individual studios, which are run independently and compete with each other.
Timi's proceeds accounted for 40% of the game revenue, said the two people.
Of Tencent's remaining gaming revenue last year, its Lightspeed and Quantum studio, the developer of PUBG Mobile, another top-grossing game, contributed 29%, the people said, while 26% was proceeds from publishing for other developers. Aurora Studios Group, boosted by its Moonlight Blade Mobile title, contributed 3%, the people said.
The sources declined to be identified because the information is not public. 
Tencent did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
Tencent, which has benefited from a surge in paying gamers, said last week its online games revenue rose 29% to 39.1 billion yuan in the fourth quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European market for initial public offerings has come roaring back this year after a moribund, COVID-hit 2020, but the poor debut by Deliveroo has amplified concerns around whether the momentum can last.
European companies raised $19.55 billion through stock market listings in the first three months of the year, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Refinitiv data, and bankers say the pipeline on IPO candidates is crowded. 
""There's a particularly strong pipeline of European IPOs both in terms of volumes and quality of assets,"" said Saadi Soudavar, head of equity capital markets for the EMEA region at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""Certainly our pipeline is the busiest we have seen in some time. Market dependent, we should have an even busier Q2 than Q1,"" he said. 
But the market backdrop is a concern to some. It has turned more volatile in recent weeks and rising government bond yields may mean worse IPO conditions for the rest of 2021, with mixed trading for several of this year's debutants. 
Listings by Poland's InPost, Germany's Vantage Towers and Britain's Dr. Martens stood out, but a disastrous debut for Deliveroo - with the company's shares sliding 30% on the first day due - mean investors go into Easter with a bitter taste.
""We've been in an environment where growth has been scarce, lacklustre and investors have been happy to pay up for growth wherever they can find it,"" said Duncan Lamont, head of research and analytics at British asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR). 
""While I don't think (interest) rates are going to go up, I do think we will have an economic recovery and investors may be less happy to pay those premium price tags,"" he said. 
Equity capital market bankers said that while they believe overall sentiment remains supportive, investors are getting pickier and will concentrate on what they view as quality deals.
""The market, which has seen some exaggerations in recent weeks, will normalize. Investors will get more selective and non-prime IPO candidates may have to wait a bit,"" said Thorsten Pauli, head of equity capital markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

SPAC HOPES 
That is also true for so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), he added. SPACs have no operating business of their own and raise money with the purpose of merging with an operating company to take public. 
""The merger with a SPAC offers companies an opportunity to go public faster than via the traditional route. A disadvantage is that such a deal is usually more expensive for the seller because the SPAC sponsor takes a share for himself,"" said Christoph Stanger, head of EMEA capital markets at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
That market segment has seen a surge in activity this year in the United States and to a much lesser extent in Europe, but dozens of additional deals are in the pipeline in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London, people familiar with the industry say.
So far, there have only been 10 SPAC listings in Europe in 2020 and 2021, with a total value of about $1.3 billion - figures dwarfed by the United States where 522 such listings have brought in over $300 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
As European markets are calming down only SPACs led by renowned entrepreneurs with elaborate concepts are expected to fly, bankers said.
""Three things are important for a successful SPAC: structure, sponsor, selection,"" says Fabian de Smet, head of investment banking at Berenberg.

The SPAC must be structured in a way that gives investors a say on the target company and the ability to withdraw if necessary; the entrepreneur must be known and successful; and the target company should be active in an attractive industry like technology or healthcare, he said.

The company, based in Sweden, has faced a backlash in China in recent days after it voiced concerns last year about alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.
ABC News reported that the city government of Shanghai had asked H&M to correct a 'problematic map of China'.
H&M did not immediately respond to telephone calls or an emailed request for a comment.
Citing a statement by the Shanghai government, ABC said Internet users reported the problem to the management of H&M's website and the Shanghai municipal bureau of planning and natural resources ordered it to be changed.
The Wall Street Journal cited the Shanghai arm of the Cyberspace Administration of China as saying that H&M's website operator had taken actions to address the issue.
Last week, H&M said it would work to win back trust in China after a statement it had made in 2020 about sourcing cotton there resurfaced on social media.

In the statement, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer expressed concern about the allegations of forced labour in Xinjiang province and said it would no longer source cotton from there.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Biden administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and expectations of rising inflation helped bolster the performance of fund managers who made bets on economically-sensitive cyclical or small-cap companies in the first quarter of the year, Morningstar data showed. 
At the same time, fund managers who remained heavily-invested in giant technology companies and high-growth stocks that had outperformed during the pandemic floundered. 
The gap in performance was pronounced, with the average large-cap value fund gaining 11.4% for the quarter while the average large-cap growth fund rose 2.2% over the same time, according to Morningstar. 
The Kinetic Small-Cap Opportunities fund notched the best overall performance among actively managed U.S. equity funds with a 52.5% gain for the year through March 24, according to Morningstar. Among fixed income funds, the Virtus InfraCap US Preferred Stock logged the best overall performance with a 9.1% gain over the same time period. 
Overall, active U.S. equity funds returned an average of 7% through March 24, with large cap funds returning an average of 5% while small-cap funds gained an average of 11.7%, according to Morningstar. 
The benchmark S&P 500 is up 8.2% for the year to date. 
""The more value-oriented, more economically-titled portfolios tended to do better in the first quarter,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA. ""If interest rates remain range bound that bodes well for the future. But if we see rising interest rates that could slow the economy, which would benefit the larger cap strategies."" 
Expectations of an economic boom in the United States have pushed inflation expectations have risen to their highest levels since 2014. Rising inflation could weigh on the economy by increasing debt rates for companies and consumers.
Bond yields, meanwhile, rose to their pre-pandemic highs during the first quarter, with benchmark 10 year Treasuries rising to nearly 1.75%. 
That surge weighed on tech companies, many of which are valued more on their future earnings than current profits, and prompted investors to seek out companies such as financials that benefit from higher interest rates. 
The ARKK Innovation ETF, run by star stock picker Cathie Wood, fell more than 10.7% during the quarter in a performance that left it in the worst 1 percentile of funds in its category, according to Morningstar. Among its top holdings are automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and streaming platform  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. 
Despite that underperformance, the fund brought in nearly $5.5 billion in new funds so far this year, an inflow greater than any other actively-managed equity fund. 

ARK did not respond to a request to comment.

NEW YORK(Reuters) -The dollar and the yield on the benchmark Treasury note edged higher in light trading on Friday after data showing a surge in the hiring of Americans in March pointed to a U.S. economic recovery that is poised to be the strongest in decades.
Equity markets were closed for Good Friday in the Americas, Europe and elsewhere, but it is not a U.S. government holiday and the Labor Department released the closely watched non-farm payrolls report.
The U.S. economy added 916,000 jobs in March, more than economists' forecast of 647,000, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.0% from the previous month's 6.2%. Jobs numbers for February were revised upwards according to the jobs report.
Futures for the S&P 500 stock index extended gains to 0.43% after the report. 
Despite the strong numbers the data will not alter the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy, said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. 
""The economy's bouncing back, but it's not producing the things that are going to change the direction of monetary policy,"" Ricchiuto said. ""We're going to test the 1.77% level (in the 10-year Treasury note), but I'm not sure it's going to break (through) on this number.""
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 3.5 basis points to yield 1.7143%, but the rise was still below a 14-month high of 1.776 hit on Tuesday. [US/]
Treasury yields have spiked on the economic outlook, spurred by U.S. President Joe Biden's plans for $2.3 trillion in infrastructure spending and the accelerating rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.
The March labor market report is the first of what are likely to be several very strong jobs reports over the next few months, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.
""The outlook looks very good,"" Price said. But ""in my mind the biggest constraint could be the ability of the supply side of the economy to fulfill consumer wishes.""
Asian markets overnight rose as optimism over a global economic recovery lifted equity markets in Japan, China and South Korea. 
The Nikkei in Tokyo hit a two-week high, with semiconductor- related shares leading the market as the industry looks to boost manufacturing amid a global shortage of chips. 
Biden's spending plan includes $50 billion for chip manufacturing and other technology research, said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
China stocks posted a second weekly gain as recent data pointed to a solid recovery in the world's second-largest economy. Both the CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index closed at an almost four-week highs.
Chinese steel rebar and hot-rolled coil prices closed at record highs after China on Thursday announced a nationwide investigation into steel capacity cuts launched in 2016 as part of efforts to ensure output falls this year.
South Korean shares closed higher to clock their biggest weekly gain in nearly two months as optimism about a stimulus-fueled economic recovery lifted equities.
Stocks rose on Wall Street on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index hitting a fresh peak as it scaled the 4,000 mark, and the benchmark Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) DAX index in Germany setting a new high. Equities rose on reports of the strongest manufacturing data in decades around the world.
The dollar gained for the third straight week. Strength in the labor market is likely to prove dollar-positive, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
The dollar's ascent to multi-month highs is likely to continue as more investors bet on economic recovery.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2021 03:25PM ET</span>","Seduced by Archegos' growth, Nomura took a chance on Hwang comeback","By Lawrence Delevingne, Matt Scuffham and Sumeet Chatterjee
NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. investor Sung Kook ""Bill"" Hwang was looking for a second chance on Wall Street after falling from grace and shutting his multibillion-dollar hedge fund firm. Japan's  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc gave him one.
Nomura had previously had a relationship with Hwang's Tiger Asia Management LLC before the investment firm shut down in 2012 after being punished by U.S. and Hong Kong regulators over insider trading of Chinese stocks.
Like other banks, it initially did not resume the business relationship with the Korean-American investor's new family office, Archegos Capital Management, according to one person familiar with the situation. But Hwang's appetite for huge bets on technology, media and other company stocks in the United States and Asia proved too lucrative to resist.
""It was 'They paid their fines, everything's settled ... they are open for business'"" said a former Nomura employee with knowledge of the revived relationship. ""It was like 'OK ... what are you looking to do?'"" 
It took time for executives in Tokyo to approve the renewed relationship, in around 2016, the person said. But once they did, Archegos grew to become one of the ten most profitable clients for the bank's U.S. operations, according to the same two people. 
A U.S. spokesman for Nomura declined to comment on the relationship with Hwang.
Hwang and Archegos did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of the family office previously said in a statement that ""This is a challenging time for the family office ... our partners and employees.""
The story of how Hwang worked his way back in to Nomura's good graces with the promise of a lucrative trading relationship, details of which are reported here for the first time, underscores the risks Nomura was prepared to take to make headway in the world's most competitive capital market. 
This story is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people with knowledge of Hwang and Archegos and their relationships on Wall Street, including two people familiar with Nomura's dealings with the fund.
Last week, that relationship was looking like a terrible miscalculation as a plunge in the shares of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc left Archegos - which had a highly leveraged bet on the stock - facing a massive margin call from its banks looking to cover the increased exposure. 
Those banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which had helped finance Hwang's trades, initially discussed holding off on unwinding them. 
But as the shares that underpinned Hwang's positions continued falling, his banks quickly began scrambling to sell off those stocks to try to stem losses.
Two banks -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Nomura - are facing billions in losses.
NOT ABOUT THE MONEY 
Bankers on Wall Street describe Hwang as a down-to-earth and polite person. Married with children, he was not seen indulging in a flashy lifestyle, said Wall Street sources who knew him.
Hwang, who has said he is inspired by his Christian faith, lives in a house in the New York City suburb of Tenafly, New Jersey, with an estimated value of $3.1 million, according to Zillow, where he was photographed this week according to the Daily Mail https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9424195/Bill-Hwang-Billionaire-Archegos-founder-lived-modestly-despite-worth-10billion.html. That is modest compared with many billionaire fund managers. 
Hwang did not need to ""buy mega mansions and be on TV,"" said the same source. 
“I’m not afraid of death or money. The people on Wall Street wonder about the freedom that I have,"" Hwang said in a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcO5QVVtYiQ posted by his foundation in 2019. ""Ultimately, the most important thing is the Bible.""
That contrasts with Hwang the investor, who was ""super aggressive"" and ""considered a guy who was willing to do incredibly bold things,"" said a professional hedge fund investor who has tracked his career. 
Hwang used leveraged to amplify his bets, holding stock positions worth over $50 billion while his funds had assets of about $10 billion, three sources familiar with the trades said. 
He did that by buying derivatives known as total return swaps, which allow investors to bet on stock price moves without owning the underlying securities, according to the sources. Instead, the bank buys the stocks and promises the investor a performance-related return. That client, in turn, posts collateral to secure the trades with the bank.
One banker said Hwang's business, producing ""staggering returns,"" was a highly profitable account for banks. 
Another of the sources said Hwang would exploit his status as a top client to push banks to reduce their collateral requirements - a key way banks mitigate risks posed by clients. 
Competition to win Hwang's business was particularly fierce among banks trying to challenge the dominance of ""top tier"" prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. 
That included Nomura, which currently ranks 23rd on Preqin's global ranking of prime brokers. After deciding to once again deal with Hwang, the Japanese bank rapidly increased its business with him, seeing it as a strategy to win more business from other large U.S. hedge funds. 
A bigger market share in the United States is key for the ambitions of Japan’s biggest brokerage to become a global investment bank, a goal fueled by its acquisition of Lehman Brothers' operations in Europe, Asia and the Middle East after the decade-ago financial crisis.
""The relationship really blossomed in the last four to five years as that tied in with (Nomura's) push to get a bigger share of the market in the United States,"" said another person familiar with Nomura and Archegos. 
Representatives for Credit Suisse, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Friday.
BIG BUSINESS, BIG RISK
Archegos' risk-taking was heightened because it had trading relationships with multiple banks. That meant its leverage was amplified on particular stock positions, with exposure on some of Hwang's trades reaching up to 20 times the collateral he had pledged against them, the sources said.
As a family office, Archegos had limited disclosure requirements, so banks may not have been aware of the full extent of how leveraged it was, the source said.
Still, some banks had approached Archegos more cautiously.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) did not take on Hwang as a client in recent years because of the family office's leverage, concentration in certain securities and Hwang's brush with regulators, according to a person familiar with the bank's thinking.
Compliance executives at Goldman had been wary of Hwang and the bank only agreed to start dealing with him again last year, providing that his positions were highly collateralized, one of the sources said.
As some banks smart from the fire sale, attention is now focusing on whether prime brokers need to step up their due diligence on clients. 
Japan's finance minister said on Friday the government is looking into the financial losses incurred by Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE:MUFG) and Nomura, and will share information on the matter with the Bank of Japan and overseas authorities.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority have also launched preliminary probes into the Archegos meltdown, according to a different source familiar with the situation. The SEC declined to comment on Friday and the FCA did not immediately respond.
At Nomura, the question of whether the bank fell down on client due diligence is especially acute after it fired risk and compliance professionals in the United States in 2019. One of the sources familiar with matter linked those cuts to risks the bank took with Archegos. 

""They probably felt they could manage the risk,"" said the source. ""They were wrong.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Friday they would stage a rolling protest outside his prison next week unless he is examined by a doctor of his choice and given what they regard as proper medicine.
Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, has complained of acute back and leg pain and accused authorities of refusing him access to his chosen doctor and of declining to supply him with the right medicine for a condition he has joked darkly could deprive him of the use of both legs.
Members of the Doctors Alliance trade union, a group the authorities regard as opposition activists, said in a video released on Friday that they would demonstrate outside Navalny's prison on Tuesday unless he gets to see the doctor he wants and the medicine he needs by the end of Monday.
Authorities at the IK-2 corrective penal colony 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow where the 44-year-old opposition politician is being held have said his condition is satisfactory and that he has been provided with all necessary medical care.
State media and some members of a prison monitoring group have accused him of faking his medical problems to keep himself in the public eye, something Navalny and his allies deny.
Navalny was jailed in February for two and a half years on charges he called politically motivated. He was arrested as he returned to Russia from Germany in January, where he had been recovering from what doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning.
The West, including the European Court of Human Rights, has demanded Russia release Navalny. Moscow has called such appeals unacceptable interference in its internal affairs and questioned whether Navalny was really poisoned. 
Some state media or media sympathetic to the state on Friday ran CCTV footage of what they said was Navalny walking around the prison without any obvious signs of discomfort.
Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
State media portrayed his jail, which Navalny has called ""our friendly concentration camp"", as clean, well run and humane.
State outlet RT cited Natalia Avdeeva, a prison paramedic, as saying that Navalny had been taken to a local hospital, undergone tests and a scan, and been offered the right medicine. 

She told RT that Navalny had refused treatment however, insisting he only wanted his own doctor.
Anastasia Vasilyeva, a Navalny ally and medic, confirmed he had refused treatment, but said he had done so because the medicine he was being offered had been wrongly prescribed and, in at least one case, would harm rather than help him.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",Brooklyn man accused of using information from Bloomberg reporter for insider trading,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Brooklyn man indicted for an insider trading scheme used information from a Bloomberg News reporter about certain deals to trade, according to a review of the charging documents, in a case that comes as the volume of leaked information about mergers and acquisitions is rising.
On March 23, a federal grand jury indicted 38 year-old Jason Peltz for trading on ""material nonpublic information"" obtained from a company insider and a financial reporter.
Peltz has been charged with securities fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, among other offenses, according to the indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York. 
Reuters was unable to obtain contact information for Peltz and a company called Peltz Financial Firm, where the indictment says he was formerly the principal. His lawyer Jeremy Temkin of Morvillo Abramowitz law firm declined to comment. 
The indictment does not name the journalist or the media outlet, but Reuters and other media outlets have identified him as Ed Hammond, a deals reporter with Bloomberg in New York, based on a review of articles mentioned in the indictment. 
Hammond, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, declined to comment through a spokeswoman. 
""Ed Hammond is a very accomplished reporter. We're not aware of any facts to suggest any wrongdoing on his part,"" the same Bloomberg spokeswoman said in an email statement. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Brooklyn prosecutors declined to comment. 
Among the trades Peltz allegedly executed, the indictment said, was the purchase of securities and options in chemical manufacturer Ferro (NYSE:FOE) Corp.. based on information, obtained from a friend, that Ferro had received a takeover offer. 
After Peltz began placing the trades with the help of co-conspirators between Feb. 22, 2016 and March 11, 2016, Peltz had ""numerous contacts"" with Hammond over the phone and in person, the indictment alleges. Bloomberg published a story by Hammond about the approach on March 15, 2016, which pushed Ferro's stock up 4.7%. 
A spokesperson for Ferro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The case casts a stark light on the workings of the world of corporate mergers and acquisitions, where a cadre of bankers, lawyers and other advisers as well as executives know about talks. Information often leaks, studies have shown.
Despite a long-term trend of increased oversight and enforcement, the percentage of M&A deal leaked globally increased 1.3 points to 8.7% in 2019, the second-highest rate in a decade, according to research published by the University of London last year. 
Wall Street intermediaries have an incentive to leak prospective deals because doing so typically attracts more suitors, driving up the target price, the report said. 
""The motivations for intermediaries and other sell-side parties related to M&A transactions to leak information are clear. Our research shows that over the past ten years leaked deals have commanded an average premium that is 124 percent higher than for non-leaked deals,"" the reported noted.
Apart from the Ferro deal, Peltz is accused of continuing to have frequent conversations with Hammond during which he obtained material nonpublic information about stories Hammond was working on regarding certain companies.
Peltz used this information ""to trade in certain companies' stocks just prior to the publication of an article about each respective company written by the Reporter,"" the indictment alleges. 
Those were biopharmaceutical companies Medivation Inc and INC Research Holdings, communications company R.R. Donnelley and healthcare provider  Community Health  (NYSE:CYH) Systems Inc., according to the indictment. 
Each of the stories referenced in the indictment cite multiple sources and involved two or more reporters. 

The companies did not immediately return Reuters requests seeking comment.

The agreement, first reported by La Tribune, paves the way for talks to resume at a political level among the project's three government backers, France, Germany and Spain, the source said.
Airbus and Dassault both declined to comment.
The Future Combat Air System (FCAS) is designed to replace the German-Spanish Eurofighter and Dassault's Rafale with a combination of manned and unmanned aircraft from 2040.
First floated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in 2017, the programme has been dogged by political differences as well as corporate disagreements.
It is also up against the rival BAE Systems-led Tempest fighter project involving Britain, Sweden and Italy.
A joint proposal from European defence group Airbus and Dassault still faces outstanding issues, including intellectual property matters, Dassault Chief Executive Eric Trappier said last month.
Dassault had accepted that Airbus will receive a larger overall share of FCAS work but remained ready to pursue a ""Plan B"" alternative if the talks failed, Trappier also said.
The industrial partners in the aircraft programme are Airbus on behalf of Germany, France's Dassault and Indra of Spain.

Separate negotiations have been taking place with engine suppliers  Safran  (PA:SAF) of France, MTU Aero in Germany and ITP, a Spanish subsidiary of Rolls Royce (LON:RR).

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",The hunt for lost billions: Failed Hin Leong's owners face asset claims,"By Jessica Jaganathan and Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Stung by the collapse of Asia's top independent oil trading firm, some global banks have teamed up to seek the personal assets of the family behind Hin Leong Trading, which has left creditors on the hook for billions of dollars.
As part of what sources say is the biggest legal case in living memory in Singapore, liquidators and creditors are hunting for assets from the city-state to China to Australia belonging to the Lim family, after the Singapore-based company was wound up in March.
At a hearing on Monday, court-appointed liquidators will ask the Singapore High Court to freeze the family's assets worldwide, from multimillion-dollar homes to country club memberships, shares and funds, three sources with knowledge of the case told Reuters. 
Hin Leong failed in a year-long effort to restructure about $3.5 billion in debts after the COVID-19-led oil crash laid bare huge losses. Founder Lim Oon Kuin admitted in a court document last year to directing the firm not to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over several years.
At least a dozen creditors, able to recoup just $270 million from the collapsed company, are going after the assets of the tycoon, known as O.K. Lim, his son Evan Lim and daughter Lim Huey Ching.
""There isn't much money left in the company, but the family has many assets, so the creditors are now trying to go after those,"" said one of the sources who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.
The elder Lim, 78, who started his sprawling empire by delivering diesel in a truck in 1963, was once ranked among Singapore's 18 richest people by Forbes. The magazine said last year he was worth $1.3 billion, while the sources estimate the family's wealth at up to $2 billion in Singapore alone.
Banks, which began to pull credit lines from Hin Leong last year, have been unable to recover any meaningful funds from Hin Leong so far.
Of the nearly two dozen banks involved with Hin Leong, at least four have sued the family, court records show: France's Natixis SA, Bank of China, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp and the Dutch-based lender Rabobank.
The Lim family, their legal representative, the liquidators and their law firm did not immediately reply to Reuters emailed queries on the matter. Rabobank, Natixis and HSBC declined comment, while there was no response from Bank of China.
PRIVATE EYES, BRAINSTORMING
In addition to hiring private investigators to unearth the family's assets, some of the creditors are taking the unusual step of meeting informally to share information on their search, the sources said.
While directors are typically not personally liable for the debts of their Singapore-registered companies, they can be if fraud is involved, lawyers say.
O.K. Lim has been charged by Singapore prosecutors with two counts of abetting forgery over his directions that the firm hide losses. The prosecutors said this week they expect to charge him on Thursday with 23 more counts of forgery-related offences.
One-third of the roughly 150 ships owned by the family's Xihe Group have been sold for at least $420 million, according to VesselsValue, which tracks ship sales.
The Lims have also raised some $300 million to $370 million from selling their stake in Singapore's prized Universal Terminal oil storage facility, two sources said.
With O.K. Lim said to be in poor health and the family represented by a top Singapore litigator, who has previously represented the city-state's prime minister, creditors expect the Hin Leong legal saga to drag on.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Texas threatens to become next flash point on voting rules,"By David Shepardson, Joseph Ax and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas appeared on Thursday to become the next flash point on politically charged issues in Corporate America after legislation passed by the state Senate to limit voting access prompted a rebuke from American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
""We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,"" Fort Worth, Texas-based American said in a statement. 
The legislation, which is now set to go before the Texas House of Representatives, would eliminate drive-through voting, limit polling site hours and give partisan poll watchers more autonomy.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), also based in Texas, declined to say if it opposed the legislation but said: ""We believe every voter should have a fair opportunity to let their voice be heard. This right is essential to our nation’s success.""
The Texas effort drew sharp criticism from voting rights advocates and Democrats in the state, who argue that the legislation would make it more difficult for Texans, particularly those of color, to cast ballots.
The state already has some of the most stringent voting laws in the country, according to election experts. A state House of Representatives committee on Thursday was holding a hearing on a companion bill that would impose other voting restrictions.
Texas is one of several states, including Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Iowa, where Republican lawmakers have pursued new voting limits after former President Donald Trump falsely blamed his November loss on widespread voter fraud despite no evidence.
Republican lawmakers say the law is needed to ensure public confidence in election integrity.
The comments by American and Southwest came after Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) on Wednesday joined a growing number of companies that challenged the state of Georgia's new voting restrictions.
Delta CEO Ed Bastian blasted the law on Wednesday in a reversal from an initial statement last week that sparked a popular backlash.
But his new stance drew condemnation from Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and many Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio who questioned why Delta criticized Georgia but not China.
""Far too many multinational corporations are too eager to make their voices heard on the woke issues of the day in the United States, but remain stunningly silent, or in Delta’s case, complicit, in real, ongoing atrocities in countries like China."" Rubio wrote.
Delta did not immediately comment on Rubio's letter.
The Georgia House late Wednesday voted to repeal a jet fuel sales tax break that Delta uses but the state Senate did not act on it before the legislative session adjourned.

Kemp told Fox Business he thought the tax issue was ""moot"" now that the legislature had adjourned.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>","Analysis: In China's small cities, home buyers suffer as debt-ridden developers fail to finish projects","By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
ZHUOZHOU, China (Reuters) - In Zhuozhou, a small city in China's north, Zhu has stopped making mortgage payments on her apartment after its developer did not build a promised rail line that would have allowed residents to commute to Beijing for work.
The accountant is one of some 1,000 home owners in the housing project who ceased payments in anger last year, according to Zhu and two other buyers campaigning for compensation who spoke with Reuters.
""I didn't do anything wrong, so why do I have to bear all the consequences?"" said Zhu.
In the picturesque city of Dali in the southwest, Li, a small business owner, is still waiting to move into an apartment that was meant to be handed over more than two years ago.
""The developer has postponed delivery four times since the end of 2018. We have completely lost trust in them,"" said Li, who is currently squeezing his family into a small rental apartment with his parents.
Li and another buyer in the project said they had been told by the developer it could not hand over the keys to the apartments because it doesn't have the money to pay its contractors.
The developer behind the Dali project, Dali Haidong Development & Investment Group, did not respond to a request for comment. China Fortune Land Development, the Shanghai-listed developer of the project in Zhuozhou which has grabbed headlines with defaults on some $5.7 billion of debt, also did not respond to requests for comment.
The plight of Zhu and Li, who asked that only their surnames be used for fear of harassment, underscores the growing debt woes of developers active in smaller cities. Many of them indulged in unbridled borrowing amid a red-hot market between 2016 and 2018 but now find themselves grappling with too much debt, sharply weaker demand and tighter regulations.
Analysts say the problem is largely confined to smaller cities and that relentless demand in big cities will keep large listed developers in business, but they expect debt defaults in the sector to climb and worry about the potential for the fallout to affect lenders and local governments.
""We will probably see rising debt defaults this year, and the market should closely monitor developers with high debt ratios and whose business is concentrated in smaller cities,"" said Song Hongwei, a senior analyst at Shanghai-based property consultancy Tospur.
SO MUCH DEBT DUE
Bond defaults by property developers quadrupled last year to 26.6 billion yuan ($4.1 billion) and as of mid-March this year, developers, led by China Fortune Land, had already defaulted on 8.7 billion yuan of bonds, according to data from the National Institution of Finance & Development.
Onshore and offshore bonds from developers maturing this year are set to jump 42% to a record 900 billion yuan ($138 billion), the data also shows.
China's developers have come under more pressure this year with the advent of new caps on debt-to-cash, debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios that have been set by regulators keen to limit lending to the sector, including by trust funds and other parts of the country's shadow banking industry. 
Analyst worry about the potential for systemic risk that debt defaults may bring, although they add it is difficult to assess how large that risk is.
""Some real estate companies with high leverage and weak capital turnover are facing a relatively high amount of pressure on short-term debt repayments,"" economists with Beijing-based Zhixin Investment Research Institute said in a report.
""The tightening financing environment may lead to a cash crunch, and there is a possibility of cross defaults among developers, trusts and third-party wealth institutions,"" they added.
Local governments are often dependent on land sales for financing and any prolonged downtrend in new projects as developers rein in spending will also affect their ability to pay debt, other analysts have said.
At a national level, home prices are still on an uptrend, with figures for 70 large cities climbing 4.9% on average last year, according Reuters calculations from government data.
But prices in 19 cities, mostly smaller ones, have plunged by double-digit percentages from peaks in 2017 and 2018, data from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences shows. The 19 cities are home to about 7.8% of China's population.
Many small cities with persistent population outflows and weak economic prospects, have housing inventory levels equal to more than 40 months of sales, according to Chinese property research firm CRIC.
The problem of unfinished projects has prompted at least three local governments - Yantai city in Shandong province, Honghe Autonomous Prefecture and Qujing city in Yunnan province - to set official timetables for projects to be completed and step up supervision of new ones.
But some buyers are finding they have little recourse through official means.
Zhu, who still lives and works in Beijing, is hoping the lack of mortgage payments will bring China Fortune Land to the negotiating table after she and other buyers engaged in fruitless rounds of petitions and protests.
""I came from the countryside hoping through hard work to earn my own home in a city, but now I am back being rural again with an apartment in the middle of nowhere,"" she said.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 06:30PM ET</span>",Ford resumes political donations after review,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co will resume making political donations and will not rule out donations to those lawmakers who voted on Jan. 6 against certifying President Joe Biden's election win, according to a letter from Ford seen by Reuters.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker was among many companies that suspended political donations earlier this year pending a review, including some that opted to halt all donations to the 147 House and Senate members who voted against Biden's certification, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Marriott Inc, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP). 
In the letter seen by Reuters, Ford said its political action committee (PAC) was resuming donations to lawmakers effective April 1, and had opted against imposing a blanket ban on the Republican lawmakers who voted against certification.
Five people died when supporters of former President Donald Trump attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 to prevent the U.S. Congress from certifying Biden's win. Trump had urged them to protest the results of the Nov. 3 election, which he falsely claimed was rigged. 
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said in February its PAC would suspend all donations through 2022 to the 147 lawmakers who voted against certification, as well as contributions through the same period for state officials and organizations who suggested the election should be overturned.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co PACs also suspended donations through 2022, while Dow Inc said it would extend its suspension to senators voting against certification for up to six years.
It was not immediately clear whether any of those other companies had reversed those plans. 
In the letter to company employees donating to its PAC, Chief Government Relations Officer Mitch Bainwol said Ford would strengthen principles it used for supporting candidates ""by adding a new principle related to 'public service and integrity.'""
Bainwol added that the candidates Ford supports must ""demonstrate public service consistent with building trust and acting with competence, integrity and serving others.""

Ford noted it and the industry ""are in a period of massive disruption that is deeply connected with policy issues. Participation in the political process has been a constant over our 118-year history and is central to navigating Ford’s global priorities in a world of competitive voices.""

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are dropping accounting fraud charges against the former chief executive officer and onetime chief financial officer of  Brixmor Property  (NYSE:BRX) Group Inc, who were accused of manipulating a key financial metric for the large shopping center owner and operator.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan in a court filing said they concluded based on new information that they could not prove their case against former CEO Michael Carroll and ex-CFO Michael Pappagallo, prompting a judge to dismiss the case on Thursday.
That information concerned ""particular accounting adjustments that form a significant portion of the allegedly misstated metric charged in the indictment,"" prosecutors said.
Prosecutors also dropped charges against two former executives who had pleaded guilty, Steven Splain and Michael Mortimer.
""We are pleased that the government now agrees with what we have said from the beginning: this prosecution should never have been brought,"" said Victor Hou, a lawyer for Carroll at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.
Gregory Kehoe, Pappagallo's attorney at Greenberg Traurig, said he appreciated the decision by U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss' office to take the ""extraordinary"" and ""rare"" step to dismiss the case.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it is evaluating dismissing a related civil case.
A spokesman for Strauss declined to comment.
Brixmor, a New York-based real estate investment trust (REIT) with about 421 shopping centers, agreed in 2019 to pay a $7 million fine to resolve SEC charges, without admitting wrongdoing.
Investigators began examining Brixmor in February 2016 after the REIT said it had uncovered ""smoothing"" in same property net operating income (SP-NOI), a measure for investors of a REIT's financial performance.

Prosecutors said Carroll and Pappagallo falsely touted the consistency of Brixmor's SP-NOI growth rate, with Carroll describing it at an industry conference as the REIT's ""secret sauce,"" when in fact the rate fluctuated significantly.

Greensill's administrator, Grant Thornton, has received denials from companies listed as debtors to the steel group stating that they had never done business with Gupta, the FT report added.
Insolvent finance firm Greensill collapsed last month, days after losing investor funding and insurance coverage for its supply chain financing business. 
Liberty is part of the GFG Alliance, a conglomerate owned by the Gupta family and one of the biggest customers of Greensill Capital.
Grant Thornton and GFG Alliance declined to comment on the report. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Greensill Capital.
Grant Thornton, which is looking to regain the money owed to Greensill in its role as administrator to the collapsed firm, last month approached companies that were listed as debtors to Gupta's Liberty Commodities trading firm, the FT report added.

Earlier on Thursday, Gupta cautioned creditors against pulling the plug on Liberty Steel, saying he had garnered huge interest from financiers willing to refinance billions of dollars in debt owed to failed lender Greensill Capital. He did not give details on any specific offers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday sided with  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) in ordering a Brooklyn company to temporarily stop further sales of ""Satan Shoes"" it produced in collaboration with the rapper Lil Nas X.
U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee in Brooklyn ruled three days after Nike sued MSCHF Product Studio Inc, claiming that the black-and-red, devil-themed sneakers, which carry the Nike ""swoosh"" logo, infringed its trademarks.
The sneakers are customized versions of the Nike Air Max 97 sneakers that purport to contain one drop of human blood in the midsoles, and are printed with ""Luke 10:18,"" a biblical passage referring to Satan's fall from heaven.
Only 666 pairs, costing $1,018 each, were made. Lil Nas X, known for the song ""Old Town Road,"" was planning to select who gets the 666th pair, but that plan was shelved following Nike's lawsuit filed on Monday. He is not a defendant in the case.
""MSCHF strongly believes in the freedom of expression,"" the company said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with Nike and the court to resolve this case in the most expeditious manner.""
Nike and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
MSCHF's lawyers had argued that Satan Shoes were ""not typical sneakers, but rather individually-numbered works of art,"" following on the company's ""Jesus Shoes"" based on the same Nike model in 2019.
They said a temporary restraining order was unnecessary because shoe buyers would not think Nike was involved, and all but the 666th pair had already been sold and no more were being made. 
Nike's lawyers, in contrast, said ""even 'sneakerheads' were actually confused by MSCHF's shoes,"" and MSCHF had a ""history"" of shipping infringing shoes faster than courts could stop it.

Lil Nas X last month released a devil-themed video for his song ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name).""

Tech stocks started the quarter in rally mode, continuing to their rebound from oversold levels, but the reprieve could prove short-lived as the recent rotation to value from growth still has room to go.
""It took a long time for that previous rotation [following the tech bubble] to play out,"" Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance, said in an interview with Investing.com. ""We're here again, growth got very expensive and value is starting to outperform again, but no one believes in [the value] trade and they're all saying it's going to end.""
""But if you look at the returns in the last 12 months on tech versus everything else the gap is still big. Three years, five years, or even 10 years ago, the growth outperformance relative to value is historic. So, value has a lot of catching up to do,"" Diton added. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were higher. Chip stocks also helped push the broader tech sector following bullish quarterly results from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) that stoked investor appetite for the sector.
Financials and energy were among the biggest gainers for value, with the latter aided by rising oil prices even as major oil producers agreed to raise output.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) were among the biggest gainers for the sector.
On the labor market front, an unexpected rise in jobless claims didn't dent optimism for a strong rebound in nonfarm payrolls slated to be released Friday.
""[W]e remain optimistic about claims and the labor market more broadly in the near-term,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""With more vaccine distribution and further reopening of the labor-intensive service sector, we will see claims continue to decline on trend over time.""
In other news, Nio (NYSE:NIO) climbed 2% after reporting a 373% jump in deliveries for March from the prior-year, providing investor with some respite after the Chinese electric vehicle trimmed its production forecast earlier this month, citing supply-chain disruptions.
The record-setting day for stocks comes a day after President Joe Biden unveiled his $2.2 trillion stimulus package to support investment in key infrastructure including roads, airports, broadband rollout and more.
The bill, which will likely need to be tweaked to win the backing of moderate Democrats, represents a double edge sword, however, as it will be partly funded by tax increases that could force corporations to rein in stock buybacks and dividends.  
""When Trump put through those tax cuts, we saw a pretty big increase in buyback activity and notable dividend increases. So [a decline in buybacks and dividends] is entirely possible, and would make some sense,"" Diton said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Biden administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and expectations of rising inflation helped bolster the performance of fund managers who made bets on economically-sensitive cyclical or small-cap companies in the first quarter of the year, Morningstar data showed. 
At the same time, fund managers who remained heavily-invested in giant technology companies and high-growth stocks that had outperformed during the pandemic floundered. 
The gap in performance was pronounced, with the average large-cap value fund gaining 11.4% for the quarter while the average large-cap growth fund rose 2.2% over the same time, according to Morningstar. 
The Kinetic Small-Cap Opportunities fund notched the best overall performance among actively managed U.S. equity funds with a 52.5% gain for the year through March 24, according to Morningstar. Among fixed income funds, the Virtus InfraCap US Preferred Stock logged the best overall performance with a 9.1% gain over the same time period. 
Overall, active U.S. equity funds returned an average of 7% through March 24, with large cap funds returning an average of 5% while small-cap funds gained an average of 11.7%, according to Morningstar. 
The benchmark S&P 500 is up 8.2% for the year to date. 
""The more value-oriented, more economically-titled portfolios tended to do better in the first quarter,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA. ""If interest rates remain range bound that bodes well for the future. But if we see rising interest rates that could slow the economy, which would benefit the larger cap strategies."" 
Expectations of an economic boom in the United States have pushed inflation expectations have risen to their highest levels since 2014. Rising inflation could weigh on the economy by increasing debt rates for companies and consumers.
Bond yields, meanwhile, rose to their pre-pandemic highs during the first quarter, with benchmark 10 year Treasuries rising to nearly 1.75%. 
That surge weighed on tech companies, many of which are valued more on their future earnings than current profits, and prompted investors to seek out companies such as financials that benefit from higher interest rates. 
The ARKK Innovation ETF, run by star stock picker Cathie Wood, fell more than 10.7% during the quarter in a performance that left it in the worst 1 percentile of funds in its category, according to Morningstar. Among its top holdings are automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and streaming platform  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. 
Despite that underperformance, the fund brought in nearly $5.5 billion in new funds so far this year, an inflow greater than any other actively-managed equity fund. 

ARK did not respond to a request to comment.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 topped the historic 4,000 level Thursday, as tech turned on the swagger thanks to falling bond yields, but value stocks are expected to set the pace as the new quarter gets underway, according to an expert.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.95% to hit a record high of 4,014.20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.35%, or 115 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.56%.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), were higher.
Chip stocks continued their recent revival, rallying 3% to help push the broader tech sector higher following bullish quarterly results from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) that stoked investor appetite for the sector.
Still, there are some on Wall Street who are wary of high-valued tech stocks in a rising rate environment, and believe value stocks are primed to continue their recent outperformance relative to growth stocks, spurred by a robust recovery.
""I think [tech stocks] were definitely oversold .. and due for a rebound,"" Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance, said in an interview with Investing.com.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court backs Facebook in case about unwanted texting,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday made it easier for businesses to pester consumers with phone calls or text messages by tossing out a lawsuit accusing  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) of violating a federal anti-robocall law.
The justices, in a 9-0 decision authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, sided with Facebook over its argument that text messages the social media company sent did not violate a 1991 federal law called the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). 
The case highlighted the challenge for the justices in applying outdated laws to modern technologies. The ruling sparked calls for the U.S. Congress to update the law, enacted three decades ago to curb telemarketing abuse by banning most unauthorized robocalls. 
""By narrowing the scope of the TCPA, the court is allowing companies the ability to assault the public with a non-stop wave of unwanted calls and texts, around the clock,"" Democratic Senator Edward Markey and Democratic Representative Anna Eshoo said in a joint statement.
The court ruled that Facebook's actions - sending text messages without consent - did not fit within the technical definition of the type of conduct barred by the law, which was enacted before the rise of modern cellphone technology.
The lawsuit was filed in 2015 in California federal court by Montana resident Noah Duguid, who said Facebook sent him many automatic text messages without his consent. The lawsuit accused Menlo Park, California-based Facebook of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act's restriction on using an automatic telephone dialing system.
Facebook said the security-related messages, triggered when users try to log in to their accounts from a new device or internet browser, were tied to users' cellphone numbers.
""As the court recognized, the law's provisions were never intended to prohibit companies from sending targeted security notifications and the court's decision will allow companies to continue working to keep the accounts of their users safe,"" Facebook said in a statement.
Sergei Lemberg, Duguid's lawyer, said anyone could steer clear of liability under the law as long as they use similar technology to Facebook's.
""This is a disappointing ruling for anyone who owns a cellphone or values their privacy,"" Lemberg added.
In this instance, the lawsuit asserted that Facebook's system that sent automated text messages was akin to a traditional automatic dialing system - known as an autodialer - used to send robocalls.
""Duguid's quarrel is with Congress, which did not define an autodialer as malleably as he would have liked,"" Sotomayor wrote in the ruling.
The law requires that the equipment used must use a ""random or sequential number generator"" but the court concluded that Facebook's system ""does not use such technology,"" Sotomayor added.
Duguid said that Facebook repeatedly sent him account login notifications by text message to his cellphone even though he was not a Facebook user and never had been. Despite numerous efforts, Duguid said he was unable to stop Facebook from ""robotexting"" him.
Facebook responded that Duguid had most likely been assigned a phone number that had been previously associated with a Facebook user who had opted in to receive the notifications. 
A federal judge threw out the lawsuit but in 2019 the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it. The 9th Circuit took a broad view of the law, saying it not only bans devices that automatically dial randomly generated numbers but also stored numbers that are not randomly generated.

The National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions said the decision ""to narrowly interpret autodialers is a win for the credit union industry.""
""We have long fought for this clarity to ensure credit unions can contact their members with important, time-sensitive financial information without fear of violating the TCPA and facing frivolous lawsuits,"" the association said in a statement.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 02:41PM ET</span>",Deliveroo IPO debacle leaves small investors with bad taste,"(Refiles to add dropped word in paragraph 9 and delete extra word in paragraph 11)
By Elizabeth Howcroft and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - London-based amateur trader Amy Lee wasn't sure whether to buy shares in Deliveroo's stock market debut but decided eventually to take the leap, swayed by ad campaigns on the food delivery company's app.
""I took a gamble,"" she said. ""It was my own fault, but I think I was swayed by the thought 'surely Deliveroo wouldn't advertise a bad product to their customers through their app. That would be stupid right?'""
Lee and others like her who were allocated shares worth a total of 50 million pounds ($69 million) are nursing paper losses after Deliveroo shares plunged as much as 30% on their London Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday.
The fall, slicing 2 billion pounds off initial valuations, is a blow to Britain's ambitions of attracting fast-growing tech companies to London. 
It may also raise questions about retail traders' appetite for future investments, especially in initial public offerings (IPO) - this was the first time individuals in Britain were given a chance to get in on the first-day action.
Deliveroo had dubbed its campaign: ""Great food with a side of shares"".
But things went wrong even before the IPO. Several asset managers shunned it, citing concerns about gig-economy working conditions and Deliveroo's corporate governance. 
Many amateurs discussing the matter on online Reddit forums cited similar reasons for steering clear.
Since buying 250 pounds worth of stock, Lee has done more research and now says she is ""gutted"" to have given her money to ""what seems to be another greedy tech company lacking social value or drive to do things differently"". 
But she can't sell until April 7, because of rules around ""conditional trading"" - a practice customary in London IPOs until the shares ""settle"", usually lasting a week.
A spokesman for PrimaryBid, a platform that allows retail investors to participate in major share sales, said this had been made clear to customers at every stage. 
One Londoner who bought 295 pounds of Deliveroo stock said the company's sales team seemed to have ""bent over backwards"" to turn diners into investors.
""Every time you placed a Deliveroo order they flashed a sign. They let me invest even without a brokerage account. They said we will open up a Lloyds (LON:LLOY) (bank) account for you and do it for you, (for) a one-off fee of 5 pounds. They made it super helpful,"" he said, requesting anonymity.
Asked for comment, a Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""Although the trading started lower than we would have liked, we are just starting life as a public company and we are confident that our winning proposition will deliver long term value for all shareholders.""
""We thank each of our customers who took part in our customer offer and will work tirelessly for them each and every day.""
Deliveroo shares have recovered slightly from Wednesday's lows, but their first day performance was the worst on record for a London IPO worth more than 1 billion pounds, markets platform Dealogic said.
DEMOCRACY
Retail investors will likely be wooed by other market debutants as many trading companies, including the Robinhood app, say they want to ""democratize"" IPOs by not restricting allocations only to institutional investors. 
PrimaryBid is in talks with other listings candidates, a source familiar with those discussions has told Reuters. 
The company collects orders from individuals and then makes a collective bid on deals. Bankers say it is becoming an influential participant, getting involved in fundraising deals from tech firm Ocado (LON:OCDO) and caterer  Compass Group  (LON:CPG).
PrimaryBid estimates retail ownership is about 15% of the UK stock market, as many people stuck at home in the pandemic with spare cash have taken to dabbling in equities on trading apps. 
While UK amateur participation has risen from 10% in 2009, it lags U.S. levels of 25%-30%. 
Still, some - such as Sam Elliot, a London-based primatologist - confess to having become ""obsessed"" with stock markets, following the frenzy around U.S. video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) in January.
He invested 250 pounds in Deliveroo and, while also ""gutted"" by the shares' fall, intends to hold them for the long term. 
Another investor - and former Deliveroo courier - Rui Lopes also committed 250 pounds, a sum he said he could afford to lose.
""The price drop did get me slightly apprehensive at first ... but you know what they say. Buy the dip!""
And even without the first-day ""pop"" or surge last year's U.S. deals enjoyed, investors could well end up in the money - after all, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) were also IPO flops initially.

(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc said on Thursday it has agreed to transfer its pension obligations to annuities provider Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd, ensuring that the U.S. department store chain's retired employees will continue to get their benefits. 
J.C. Penney, which said in December that it would seek to exit bankruptcy protection sometime this year, will not receive any money as part of the deal, but will shed the liabilities that came with the pensions.
""We are thrilled that this one-of-a-kind transaction will enable the Pension Plan to pay the benefits that JCPenney intended the participants to receive,” J.C. Penny said in an emailed statement. 
Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, the private equity firm that controls Athene and earlier this month inked an $11 billion deal to take it private, is seeking to profit by earning a higher return on investing the pension assets than its payouts to the retirees will be.
It is Athene's biggest ever pension transfer deal.
Under the terms of the deal, J.C. Penney Co Inc has agreed to transfer $2.8 billion in pension obligations for roughly 30,000 participants in J.C. Penney's pension plan, according to people familiar with the matter. 
In a pension risk transfer, an insurer takes on a pension plan's assets and liabilities, and writes a group annuity contract obligating it to pay participants. The insurer is betting it will make more on investments than it pays out.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) in November had taken responsibility for J.C. Penney's pension plan, but also allowed the retailer to explore alternatives that would avoid cuts to retiree benefits. 
J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close its then nearly 850 stores.

The 118-year-old department store chain said in December it would exit Chapter 11 after agreeing to a deal with two of its biggest landlords, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management Inc.

Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 1% or more, with those and other growth stocks showing signs of awakening after lagging in recent weeks behind so-called value stocks expected to outperform as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week. However, other data showed a measure of manufacturing activity soared to its strongest level in more than 37 years in March, with employment at factories the highest since February 2018. 
In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5% at 33,145.88 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.95% to 4,010.77.
The Nasdaq Composite added 1.48% to 13,442.31.
With its latest intra-day record, the S&P 500 was up about 7% in 2021, and has gained about 80% from its low in March 2020.
""We’re still bullish for this year, and we think that with stimulus, with the Fed committed to being dovish, with the economy reopening due to more of the U.S. getting vaccinated, overall you're going see corporate earnings do pretty well,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.
The Nasdaq remained about 5% below its Feb. 12 record high close, still smarting as higher U.S. bond yields hurt technology stocks.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with technology, communication services and energy gaining more than 1%. 
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) jumped 4% after the chipmaker forecast fiscal third-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates due to higher demand for memory chips, thanks to 5G smartphones and artificial intelligence software.
U.S.-listed shares of rival Taiwan Semiconductor rose 3.7% after it said it will invest $100 billion over three years to meet rising chip demand.
The three main indexes are set to close out a holiday-shortened week with gains, led by the Nasdaq. U.S. stock markets will close for the Good Friday holiday.
The CBOE volatility index slipped below 18 points for the first time in 14 months, a level last seen before the coronavirus-driven global financial market meltdown in March 2020. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fell 0.5% after the drugmaker said it had found a problem with a batch of the drug substance for its COVID-19 vaccine being produced by Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS), whose shares tumbled 14%. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Thursday promoted four female partners to senior leadership roles at the firm, according to memos seen by Reuters. 
Among them, Goldman's head of investor relations, Heather Kennedy Miner, was given the No. 2 job in the bank's asset management business, and Jacqueline Arthur was named deputy chief of staff for the executive office.
Goldman has set some of the most aggressive and specific goals among big U.S. banks for increasing the presence of Black, Latino and female professionals at all job levels. Thursday's promotions reflect what Chief Executive David Solomon has said was a lack of diversity in the bank's senior ranks.
Solomon said at a virtual event last year hosted by the Economic Club of New York that he was ""not pleased"" with the levels of diversity among the bank's senior leaders.
Goldman has four women on its board of directors and will have a fifth if shareholders approve the nomination of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) plc Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl later this month. But Solomon has urged the bank to increase diversity in the top ranks more quickly.
A recent analysis of the companies included in the Russell 30000 Index, which includes Goldman, shows women held just 12% of the ""named executive officer"" positions, up from 9% in 2015. 
In the memos, Miner was named chief operating officer for Goldman's asset management division. She previously led investor relations for the bank since 2017. 
The head of Goldman Sachs's bank unit and deputy treasurer, Carey Halio, was appointed to replace Miner as head of investor relations. 
Arthur will serve as deputy chief of staff and secretary to the management committee, reporting to John Rogers (NYSE:ROG). 

Lisa Donnelly was given an expanded role as head of core operations responsible for coordinating common practices, standards and protocols for the bank's global divisions. She succeeds Phil Armstrong, who is retiring.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>","Investors should reject J&J CEO pay package, proxy adviser Glass Lewis says","By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis is recommending investors reject the nearly $30 million pay package for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, arguing that the healthcare company is shielding its top executives from the legal cost of poor business decisions.
J&J is attracting investor scrutiny because it excluded from its calculation of stock awards to its top executives costs related to lawsuits claiming that the healthcare company helped fuel the nation's opioid crisis and that traces of asbestos in its talc baby powder caused cancer, Reuters reported on Monday.
Including the opioid and talc-related legal costs would have weighed on Gorsky's compensation, which totaled $29.6 million in 2020, up 17% from the previous year. 
J&J said it has always set aside certain one-time costs such as litigation from calculating stock awards for executives, an approach that is common across corporate America. J&J and Gorsky did not respond to requests for comment on the Glass Lewis report, dated March 31.
Glass Lewis said in the report to investors that it is ""critical of the substantial financial adjustments"" to J&J's performance results and that shareholders should cast their ballots against it. A non-binding resolution on the pay packages will be up for a vote at the company's annual general meeting on April 22.
""In our opinion, the adjustments related to well-documented legal actions essentially shield executives' compensation from the detrimental impact of their decisions for the company,"" Glass Lewis said.
Gorsky, who became CEO in 2012, has been at the helm of J&J during the opioid abuse and addiction crisis, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has claimed nearly 450,000 lives in the United States between 1999 and 2018. In 2019, 50,000 people died in the U.S. from opioid related overdoses, according to the National Institute of Health.
The company has denied any part in fueling the crisis. J&J is one of three companies with COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States, although it has run into some early manufacturing stumbles.
Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) have also come under pressure from investors on their moves to set aside the costs of agreed-to opioid settlements in determining pay for their CEOs.

Cardinal Health has said it will engage with shareholders to incorporate their views in its executive compensation plan after a minority of them revolted in November against a similar executive pay structure.

Investing.com – Visa (NYSE:V) shares extended their recent gains by more than 2% in Thursday’s trade, a momentum built on the credit card company’s plan to start using cryptocurrencies to settle transactions.
The company two days ago said it will allow the use of cryptocurrency USDC/USD to settle transactions on its payment network, the latest sign of growing acceptance of digital currencies by the mainstream financial industry.
USDC is a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is directly pegged against the U.S. dollar in a 1:1 ratio. It is based on the Ethereum blockchain, a rival to the more popular Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD).
Visa’s latest step strips out the need to convert digital coin into traditional money to settle the transaction. This feature wasn’t available earlier when users had to convert their cryptocurrency stored in a wallet into traditional money before they could complete the transaction.
The cryptocurrency wallet will deposit traditional fiat currency in a bank account, to be wired to Visa at the end of the day to settle any transactions, adding cost and complexity for businesses.
Visa joins an expanding list of companies embracing cryptocurrencies to offer a choice to users to settle transactions. It already includes PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), BNY Mellon, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). "

The airline started generating positive cash flow at the beginning of March, a key milestone for an industry that has been burning money after drastically scaling back flights last year as demand tanked.
Frontier is now benefiting from a recovery driven by domestic leisure travel, its specialty, flying more capacity this March than in the same month of 2019.
""Coming out of this, we're in the best position we believe of anyone in the space given our concentration in the domestic leisure business and our ability to make money with low fares,"" Biffle said in a virtual interview from New York. 
The airline, owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners, whose managing partner is no-frills tycoon Bill Franke, is seeking to raise around $600 million from its initial public offering, its second attempt to go public.
Frontier on Wednesday priced its initial public offering of 30 million shares at $19 per share, the low end of its marketed range of $19-$21, likely underscoring the risks involved as the airline industry pulls out of its worst crisis. 
Airline investments have been notoriously volatile in the past. Frontier made a previous attempt to float in 2017. The head of planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday the pace of vaccinations hold the key to the industry's recovery to prior levels.
Shares of Frontier opened 2% below their IPO price, valuing the company at roughly $4 billion.
Frontier has offered 15 million shares and will receive net proceeds of about $266 million, the carrier said. Existing shareholders are also selling 15 million shares in the offering.
The company will use the proceeds of the IPO to fund growth and manage debt, including repaying some of the $150 million in government loans from a COVID-19 relief package. 
That will help restore its balance sheet to near pre-pandemic levels and allow it to continue growing by 10% to 15% a year, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Dempsey said.
The listing follows a stellar debut by Apollo Global Management-backed Sun Country Airlines last month.
Like other U.S. budget carriers, Frontier took on less debt and had a lower cash burn than large legacy airlines, creating a better financial position for a recovery that Biffle said is coming fast.
Frontier, with $1.25 billion of revenue in 2020, is targeting growth from all of its key U.S. cities beyond its home base Denver, where it has roughly 100 non-stop flights, including popular Florida destinations such as Orlando and Miami. It plans to open Tampa and Atlanta routes later this year.
The airline averted employee furloughs during the pandemic and was among the first to announce pilot and flight attendant hires. It expects to hire roughly 700 employees this year as it receives six new aircraft.
It hires roughly 100 employees per airplane, including mechanics and ground staff, the executives said.
Frontier has 156 aircraft on order with Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and the new jets will feature lighter-weight seats debuted last week to cut its fuel burn.
The airline generates 43% fuel savings compared with other U.S. airlines, making it the most fuel-efficient U.S. carrier, according to a Frontier statement last week.

""We live in Colorado,"" Biffle said, adding: ""ESG is real.""
Environmental groups have called into question the industry's plans for reducing emissions and say cheap fares such as those practiced by ultra-low-cost carriers over-stimulate the demand for air travel and contribute to global warming.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 12:50PM ET</span>","Europe's IPO market roars back to life, can it last?","By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Arno Schuetze
LONDON (Reuters) - The European market for initial public offerings has come roaring back this year after a moribund, COVID-hit 2020, but the poor debut by Deliveroo has amplified concerns around whether the momentum can last.
European companies raised $19.55 billion through stock market listings in the first three months of the year, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Refinitiv data, and bankers say the pipeline on IPO candidates is crowded. 
""There's a particularly strong pipeline of European IPOs both in terms of volumes and quality of assets,"" said Saadi Soudavar, head of equity capital markets for the EMEA region at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""Certainly our pipeline is the busiest we have seen in some time. Market dependent, we should have an even busier Q2 than Q1,"" he said. 
But the market backdrop is a concern to some. It has turned more volatile in recent weeks and rising government bond yields may mean worse IPO conditions for the rest of 2021, with mixed trading for several of this year's debutants. 
Listings by Poland's InPost, Germany's Vantage Towers and Britain's Dr. Martens stood out, but a disastrous debut for Deliveroo - with the company's shares sliding 30% on the first day due - mean investors go into Easter with a bitter taste.
""We've been in an environment where growth has been scarce, lacklustre and investors have been happy to pay up for growth wherever they can find it,"" said Duncan Lamont, head of research and analytics at British asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR). 
""While I don't think (interest) rates are going to go up, I do think we will have an economic recovery and investors may be less happy to pay those premium price tags,"" he said. 
Equity capital market bankers said that while they believe overall sentiment remains supportive, investors are getting pickier and will concentrate on what they view as quality deals.
""The market, which has seen some exaggerations in recent weeks, will normalize. Investors will get more selective and non-prime IPO candidates may have to wait a bit,"" said Thorsten Pauli, head of equity capital markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

SPAC HOPES 
That is also true for so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), he added. SPACs have no operating business of their own and raise money with the purpose of merging with an operating company to take public. 
""The merger with a SPAC offers companies an opportunity to go public faster than via the traditional route. A disadvantage is that such a deal is usually more expensive for the seller because the SPAC sponsor takes a share for himself,"" said Christoph Stanger, head of EMEA capital markets at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
That market segment has seen a surge in activity this year in the United States and to a much lesser extent in Europe, but dozens of additional deals are in the pipeline in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London, people familiar with the industry say.
So far, there have only been 10 SPAC listings in Europe in 2020 and 2021, with a total value of about $1.3 billion - figures dwarfed by the United States where 522 such listings have brought in over $300 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
As European markets are calming down only SPACs led by renowned entrepreneurs with elaborate concepts are expected to fly, bankers said.
""Three things are important for a successful SPAC: structure, sponsor, selection,"" says Fabian de Smet, head of investment banking at Berenberg.

The SPAC must be structured in a way that gives investors a say on the target company and the ability to withdraw if necessary; the entrepreneur must be known and successful; and the target company should be active in an attractive industry like technology or healthcare, he said.

Investing.com – CarMax (NYSE:KMX) shares lost more than 6% on Thursday after reporting disappointing earnings.
CarMax's shares are not very far from their 52-week high of $136.49.
February quarter earnings at the user car retailer fell 2.3% from a year ago, to $209.9 million. This was even as revenue rose 4%, to $5.16 billion.
A major cost factor behind the fall in earnings was an almost 15% rise in selling, general, and administrative expenses to $556.1 million. As a percentage of net sales, they rose by 100 basis points to 10.8%.
The company also warned about the dangers that a Covid-19 health crisis poses for its business.
CarMax is buying the remaining stock of Edmunds, an online guide for automotive information. The enterprise value of Edmunds has been pegged at $404 million, including the $50 million CarMax paid for an initial stake in January last year.
In 2020, Edmunds generated unaudited revenue of around $140 million. The transaction is expected to close in June.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",U.S. automakers post high quarterly sales even as chip shortage bites,"(Reuters) -Automakers on Thursday reported a rebound in first-quarter U.S. sales from a coronavirus-induced slump last year, but numbers were dulled by a global chip scarcity that forced many companies to cut production.
The need for increased personal safety during the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted sales for automakers, as people prefer to travel by their own cars to using public transportation.
However, the semiconductor chip shortage and severe winter weather in south west United States in February have caused automakers to shut factories, turning analysts cautious about the speed of the sector's recovery in 2021.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said its first-quarter U.S. sales rose 4% to 642,250 vehicles, helped by increased demand for its Escalade sport utility vehicles and Encore subcompact crossover SUVs.
""Sales are off to a strong start in 2021, we are operating our truck and full-size SUV plants at full capacity and we plan to recover lost car and crossover production in the second half of the year where possible,"" said Steve Carlisle, GM executive vice president.

The No.1 U.S. automaker said it estimates that the seasonally adjusted annual sales pace for the first quarter of the year was around 16.7 million units. 
Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co said its U.S. sales rose nearly 11% to 285,553 vehicles in the quarter, while South Korea's Hyundai Motor's U.S. sales jumped about 28% to 167,130 vehicles.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Deliveroo's IPO slump casts doubt over London's post-Brexit ambitions,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Anna Irrera
LONDON (Reuters) - Deliveroo's share price plunge on its London stock market debut has put a question mark over Britain's ambitions to become a home for fast-growing tech companies following its departure from the European Union, investors and analysts say.
Shares in the food delivery company slumped as much as 30% on Wednesday in one of the biggest first day falls for a stock in London. They were down another 2.2% on Thursday. 
Many of the reasons for the brutal decline are likely to be company-specific, according to a dozen interviews by Reuters of venture capital (VC) investors, bankers, analysts and tech executives. 
But some said it also highlighted shortcomings in the London market and that - whatever the cause - it would deal a blow to Britain's efforts to attract more top tech companies.
""The volatility facing Deliveroo's share price is a setback for the UK's ambitions to convince more VC-backed tech businesses to list,"" said Nalin Patel, EMEA Private Capital Analyst at PitchBook. ""Deliveroo's decision to list on the LSE (London Stock Exchange) will come under scrutiny given its disappointing debut and the fact that Europe-based tech companies have predominantly listed in the U.S. in recent years."" One source close to some Deliveroo board members said some directors felt the loss-making company should have merged with a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) in New York - an increasingly popular way for firms to go public without an initial public offering (IPO). 
""It's not great for London to be honest. The feeling is that Deliveroo should have SPACed to New York where investors understand and accept the risk associated with pre-revenue businesses,"" the source said. 
A Deliveroo spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The LSE declined to comment on Deliveroo, but said the exchange had had a strong start to the year for listings. 
""The positive activity demonstrates the ability of UK capital markets to support dynamic companies across all sectors and from around the globe,"" said Murray Roos, head of capital markets at LSE Group. 
Attracting European technology companies has long been an goal for the LSE. Those ambitions became more pressing after Brexit, with London wanting to retain its position as a major global financial hub without access to EU markets. 
The LSE, British government officials and bankers all launched a charm offensive to persuade Deliveroo to list in Britain.
Traditionally, European tech companies, such as music streaming firm Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), have chosen a New York listing to access the world's biggest tech investment community and an entrepreneur-friendly listing regime. 
Britain's finance ministry declined to comment on the Deliveroo IPO but said the country had ""a long track record of attracting the best companies in the world"". 
'UNIQUE COCKTAIL OF FACTORS'
Several VCs and entrepreneurs said Deliveroo's flop had more to do with company-specific factors than London. 
Some questioned whether Deliveroo's recent growth could be sustained when coronavirus lockdowns are eased and worried its reliance on a gig-economy model might run into legal problems. 
""There are specific issues for Deliveroo - workers rights, how much of the recent growth will unwind post-lockdown,"" said Rob Moffat, a partner at Balderton Capital.
""I wouldn't get too into a read across for upcoming IPOs."" Some bankers also said the deal had little relevance to the IPO pipeline. ""It's a sign that ESG (environmental, social and governance) concerns are very important to investors' minds,"" said Andreas Bernstorff, head of equity capital markets at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). ""If you combine that with the expensive valuation and governance, there was a unique cocktail of factors at play on this deal.""
Still, some investor objections to Deliveroo could be read as a lower tolerance among British fund managers to entrepreneur-led growth firms with weaker corporate governance. Heavyweight investors Aberdeen  Standard Life  (LON:SLA),  Aviva  (LON:AV), Legal & General Investment Management and M&G all publicly stated their intention to stay away from the IPO. Unequal voting rights enjoyed by Deliveroo founder Will Shu were one of the reasons. The Hut Group opted for a similarly unequal, dual-class share structure last year, and other IPO candidates are reportedly considering the same. A listing review commissioned by UK finance minister Rishi Sunak has recommended such structures be allowed in London without restriction, but some investors are opposed. As a result, some equity capital bankers believe British companies will once again look at the New York option. 
""There is no shortage of SPACs to choose from,"" one said, referring to the record number of SPACs raising money in the United States and looking for acquisitions, many in Europe. 

UK online car seller Cazoo Holdings Limited said this week it was opting for a SPAC deal to list in New York. Whether Deliveroo becomes a lesson on IPO execution or on venue, or just a natural unwinding of some of the froth around tech IPOs in recent years, remains unclear. ""It may be in part a reaction to the drumbeat of negativity around the first day IPO pop, which has led some issuers to demand overly aggressive IPO pricing,"" said Matt Harris, a U.S.-based partner at Bain Capital Ventures. ""While you could argue that the drop in price means that Deliveroo raised money at an admirably low cost of capital, I doubt they are rejoicing about it.""

Investing.com --  Uber (NYSE:UBER) jumped more than 3% after Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) called it a top reopening play. 
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill initiated the coverage with a buy rating and $75 price target, slightly higher than the average price target of around $72.50. The stock has 27 buy ratings, three holds and no sells.
The ride hailing company looks poised to accelerate growth and reach profitability on mobility and delivery, with the former expected to jump this year, StreetInsider reported Thill as saying. 
The pandemic was terrific for delivery and terrible for mobility, with offices, bars and restaurants shut down to stem the spread of the coronavirus. For the fourth quarter, mobility sales dropped 52% compared to a year earlier, while delivery jumped 224%. Overall revenue declined 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019, the company said in a statement in February.
Thill sees mobility bookings up 24% this year, after a 46% drop last year, with even better results coming next year and the year after. The delivery segment will also benefit, set to double by 2022.  
“Ordering habits from COVID days should persist, even if some cohorts reduce average order size or frequency,"" Thill said. ""Offsetting factors include the return of work meal deliveries, additional opportunities, such as groceries, alcohol and package delivery, and high-margin advertising.""
And then there are Uber's stakes. Its investment portfolio is valued at about $13 billion, including Didi (15% stake), Grab (16%),  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX).Taxi (35%), Zomato (10%), Lime (32%), Aurora (26%) and Joby (unknown).
