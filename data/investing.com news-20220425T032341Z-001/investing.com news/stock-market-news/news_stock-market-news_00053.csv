Bloomberg reported on Thursday that tiny spy chips from China had infiltrated the supply chains of U.S. companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Both Apple and Amazon have denied the report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (N:JPM) has agreed to pay $5.3 million to settle allegations it violated Cuban Assets Control Regulations, Iranian sanctions and Weapons of Mass Destruction sanctions 87 times, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday. 
Treasury also said it had found the bank violated sanctions on narcotics and Syria, when it processed 85 transactions, totaling $46,127, and maintained accounts for six sanctioned individuals. 
""We’re pleased to resolve this issue, which we self-identified and voluntarily disclosed more than six years ago. We have since upgraded our systems and made substantial enhancements to our sanctions compliance program,"" said Brian Marchiony, a bank spokesman.
Specifically on the Cuba and Iran violations, the Treasury said the bank engaged in a ""very small portion"" of net settlement payments that appeared to have been attributable to airline interests that were blocked by U.S. sanctions or located in countries subjected to sanctions.

The Treasury said the bank voluntarily disclosed the violations, and they constituted a ""non-egregious case.""

14,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Analysts see more risks than hope in Italy budget plan,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's expansionary multi-year budget plan published late on Thursday may backfire on the populist government, according to several analysts who see a risk of rising borrowing costs, a bruising battle with Brussels and ratings downgrades.
The budget raises the target for the fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product next year, tripling a 0.8 percent goal left by the previous center-left administration.
The deficit is projected to ease gradually in the following two years to 2.1 percent and then 1.8 percent, while remaining far above targets previously agreed with the European Commission.
Officials in Brussels fear it will increase Italy's huge public debt, already the highest among large European economies at around 131 percent of GDP.
The government bets that by raising domestic demand through investments, welfare hand-outs and tax cuts, stronger economic growth will enable the debt to fall as a proportion of GDP.
It targets growth at 1.5 percent next year, which is strong by Italy's chronically sluggish standards, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
Many analysts are skeptical.
Lorenzo Codogno, head of LC Macro Advisors and a former chief economist at the Italian Treasury, said the growth forecasts were ""unrealistically high"" and noted that the budget plan was ""miles away"" from complying with EU rules.
The EU's Fiscal Compact requires countries' ""structural"" deficits, adjusted for economic growth fluctuations, to fall steadily each year towards zero, whereas Italy's targets its structural deficit to rise next year by 0.8 percentage points.
""We're concerned that the government debt path is over-reliant on strong growth, thus making it more vulnerable than the fiscal plan implies,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note.
It predicted Italian growth would average just 1 percent between 2019 and 2021 and the debt would rise marginally to 131.5 percent of GDP in 2021 rather than fall to 126.7 percent as the government targets.
In the near term, the European Commission will request extra belt-tightening and Italy's sovereign debt rating will be downgraded before the end of this month, the bank warned. 
MOODY'S VERDICT
Moody's, which has a negative outlook on Italy's Baa2 rating, has been waiting for Rome to announce its fiscal plans and said it would pass judgment some time in October.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital analyst Fabio Fois said next year's 2.4 percent deficit target was based on an ""overly optimistic"" growth forecast. Using Barclays' 1.1 percent growth projection the deficit would end up ""close to 3 percent of GDP"", he said.
The hike in the deficit target means Italy will have to issue some 43 billion euros of fresh debt next year, increasing the vulnerability of public accounts to any worsening of market sentiment. Yields on Italian state bonds have already climbed steeply since the government took office in June. 
While most market analysts are concerned about the budget plan, some economists welcomed the change of direction.
Gustavo Piga, economics professor at Rome's Tor Vergata university, said that by rejecting the straitjacket of EU rules the government had created an ""enormous opportunity"" to increase growth through public investments.
These are projected to increase to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2021 from 1.9 percent this year. 
Giovanni Dosi, an economics professor at Pisa's Sant'Anna University, applauded the 10 billion euros to be spent next year on a so-called ""citizen's income"" for the poor, saying it could have a major impact on consumer spending and economic growth.
""If the government transfers money to the poor, they spend it all. If it transfers money to the rich, they only spend a bit of it,"" he said.

15,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Tech Sell-Off Accelerates as Treasury Yields Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks headed for the biggest two-day slide since May as the sell-off in technology shares deepened amid growing concern the U.S.-China trade spat will intensify. Treasury yields rose to seven-year highs on speculation the latest jobs report clears the path for raising interest rates.
The Nasdaq 100 Index sank to a six-week low and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). led declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Bloomberg’s report that China infiltrated American companies with hardware hacks. Chipmakers in the S&P 500 Index fell almost 2 percent, as the measure careened toward a second weekly decline. It has fallen 1.5 percent in the past two days. Stocks began higher after the employment data added to confidence in the strength of the American economy.
Just a week after U.S. stocks plowed to fresh records, investors continued to sell the bull market’s biggest winners, ditching high-flyers from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The tech rout is the latest blow for global stocks in a week that saw 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climb to seven-year highs, reducing demand for riskier assets. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stoked the rates surge when he said the central bank could eventually boost its benchmark past the neutral level.
“It’s more trade worries than anything else because these companies, they either sell a lot to China or produce a lot in China,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “And we have the issue of the two naval boats in China, which raises it to more than just an economic issue -- there’s political tensions there. And then of course there’s the hacking issue.”
The 10-year bond yield pushed above 3.21 percent as the unemployment rate fell to a 48-year low, though the number of jobs created fell short of estimates. The dollar turned lower versus major peers. Gold futures rose, crude gained and the pound advanced.
“The jobs report was nothing great -- it was ok. Today we’re all over the place,” Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities, said. “It will be volatile, it will chop around in both directions. We’ll settle into a lower range until earnings start coming out towards the end of the month.”
Treasuries resumed a slide as investors speculated the low unemployment rate and major upward revision to prior months would do little to deter the Fed from raising rates for a fourth time this year. The hiring figures were influenced by the hurricane that hit the Southeast last month, muddling the picture.
“This is a report that’s consistent with being pretty close to full employment and it’s going to reinforce the Fed’s path for raising rates,” Alan Krueger, professor of economics at Princeton University, said on Bloomberg TV.
Earlier, a rout in technology shares roiled Asian equity markets. PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. plunged 15 percent in Hong Kong, amid Bloomberg’s report that China infiltrated U.S. companies by hacking hardware. In Europe, miners led the Stoxx 600 lower as industrial-metal prices fell and Danske Bank A/S headed for a four-year low. Germany’s 30-year bond was poised for its biggest one-week yield increase since April. Italian bonds also slipped as GDP forecasts failed to convince investors the country will be able to meet fiscal targets.
Elsewhere, West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices climbed back toward $75 a barrel. Copper led a decline in industrial-metal prices as a rally in raw materials stalled. Gold advanced, capping the best week in six for the precious metal.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch government will reconsider plans to scrap the country's dividend tax, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Friday, hours after multinational  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) said it would not move its headquarters to the Netherlands.
Unilever scrapped plans to move its headquarters to Rotterdam earlier on Friday in the face of a shareholder revolt, keeping one of Britain's most valuable companies in London ahead of Brexit. 
The change of course could have political consequences for Rutte, who worked for Unilever from 1992-2002 before entering politics. He has spent vast political capital convincing coalition government partners to support doing away with the 15 percent tax on corporate dividends.
Rutte has maintained that attracting Unilever was not the objective of dropping the tax, which is strongly opposed by many Dutch people who see it as a 1.9 billion euro ($2.2 billion) tax cut for foreign investors.
""We didn't decide to scrap the dividend tax for just one company, but the fact that such a large company that had decided to come to the Netherlands has withdrawn its plan is very relevant for our considerations,"" Rutte told journalists.

""Scrapping the dividend tax was part of a broad range of measures aimed at improving our competitiveness. We will reconsider this whole package in the coming time,"" he said.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Investors pile into emerging markets at fastest pace since April: BAML,"By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pumped money into emerging market equities and debt at the fastest rate since April, while government bonds sold off and Italian funds suffered ""huge redemptions"", a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysis of EPFR data showed on Friday. 
The data, which tracks fund flows in the week up to Wednesday, found that emerging markets were the biggest beneficiaries of improved risk appetite, as investors poured $1.8 billion into the asset class, split evenly between debt and equities. 
That marks it the biggest combined inflow into the sector since April, BAML said in a note. 
Emerging market funds are benefiting after a long period of weakness prompted by the currency crisis in Turkey and Argentina and the trade conflict between the United States and China.
A sell-off in U.S. Treasuries was also a key theme this week, with investors withdrawing $1.8 billion from government bonds and Treasuries on the back of stronger U.S. growth and a more hawkish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
The data does not take into account the seven-year highs seen in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields on Thursday, which suggests more outflows could be recorded next week. 
Away from the United States, improved risk appetite extended to high yield debt, which saw inflows of $2.6 billion, the highest in 18 months. 
Higher oil prices - which earlier this week rose to over $86 a barrel for the first time in four years - did not translate to inflows into energy funds.
Italy was also hard hit this week after revealing a larger than expected budget deficit target of 2.4 percent for 2019, which risks putting them on a collision course with the EU. 
Italy funds have lost 29 percent of assets under management year to date. 
The financial sector and real estate investment trusts (REITs) also experienced outflows with BAML citing quantitative tightening as the primary driver. 
Overall bond funds experienced outflows of $1 billion, while investors moved $3.6 billion in to equities, the largest of which were seen in the United States.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 07:27AM ET</span>",Red October rumbles on ahead of U.S. jobs data,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World markets steadied ahead of U.S. jobs numbers on Friday, as a four-year high in oil prices and the biggest weekly jump in Treasury yields since February left investors wondering where to go next.
The usual drop in activity ahead of the monthly non-farm payrolls couldn't prevent Europe's main bourses following Asia into the red - but it wasn't the deep shade of crimson of the previous day.
Lingering worries about Italy's finances pushed Milan down 1 percent again, while London's FTSE, Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC in Paris were off 0.6-0.8 percent. (EU)
Wall Street futures were also modestly weaker but it was the bond and currency markets [/FRX] where the attention was really trained.
The dollar barely budged against its main sparring partners the euro and the Japanese yen after testing a 10-week high, but rising bond yields - which drive the global cost of borrowing - were causing a headache again.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields were at a seven-year top of 3.2 percent on their way to their biggest weekly yield rise since February as European yields added to their biggest rise in months as well. [GVD/EUR]
And with talk of plenty more U.S. interest rate hikes growing louder, it put all the more focus on the U.S. jobs data later. 
Eaton Vance portfolio manager Justin Bourgette said though there was too much hype around the payrolls figures, whichever way you approach it, the U.S. labor market is currently super strong. 
The latest Reuters poll sees 185,000 new jobs pushing the unemployment rate to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. Average hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.3 percent after leaping 0.4 percent in August. 
""Whatever the Fed's concept of the neutral interest rate is, it must be rising,"" Bourgette said. ""And it is going to be trial and error to some degree (on how high rates go), because you just don't know where the choking point is.""
HOT OIL
Tied in with the rise in borrowing costs has been the latest spike in oil prices, as energy costs tend to have an outsized impact on inflation which is what most major central banks focus on when setting interest rates.
Brent crude futures nudged around $85 barrel, and U.S. crude went quiet at $74.5 a barrel. That kept both just under 4-year highs. They have also risen an staggering 15-20 percent since mid-August. [O/R]
""Iranian exports could fall below 1 million barrels per day in November,"" U.S. bank Jefferies said, referring to looming U.S. sanctions on Tehran.
The bank said there was enough oil to meet demand, but ""global spare capacity is dwindling to the lowest level that we can document ... meaning any further supply disruptions would be difficult for the market to manage - and could lead to spiking crude oil prices"".
The painful combination of rising oil prices, borrowing costs and a climbing dollar have also been rocking emerging markets which tend to be vulnerable to all three.
MSCI's 24-country emerging market equity index was down 0.7 percent and headed for its worst week since February and plenty of currencies were carrying heavy losses too. 
The Indian rupee fell to new record low after the central bank kept its interest rates on hold despite clear inflation places. The rupee has been hammered by higher oil prices, and is the worst performer in Asia this year.
Indian stocks also fell for a third straight session, dragged down by energy firms, a day after the government announced a cut in fuel prices.
That cut sparked fears of the country going back towards the regulated regime where the prices of diesel and petrol were controlled by the government. Petrol prices were regulated until 2012, while diesel prices remained so until 2014.
A new Reuters poll also pointed to more pain for this year's worst performing currency, the Argentine peso. It showed analysts think it could fall almost 20 over the next year, doubtful about the government's ability to tame inflation.

""In general, what's driving emerging market weakness is a stronger U.S. economy ... there is a lack of clarity on the effectiveness of rate hikes as a currency defense,"" said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer with Sanctum Wealth Management.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 06:33AM ET</span>",Unilever backs down on Dutch HQ move after British investor revolt,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) scrapped plans to move its headquarters to the Netherlands on Friday in the face of a shareholder revolt, keeping one of Britain's most valuable companies in London ahead of Brexit.
The climbdown comes three weeks ahead of the planned vote on the proposal and is a victory for shareholders who opposed the move, which would have kicked the maker of Marmite, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream out of the benchmark FTSE 100 index (FTSE). 
""We are pleased they have abandoned the plan to 'go Dutch',” said GAM portfolio manager Ali Miremadi, who intended to vote against the move. ""Now the company can put its focus into the core job – driving long-term shareholder value.""
Unilever's board agreed to scrap the plan during a call early on Friday after it became clear it could fall short of the required votes, a source familiar with the matter said. 
The plan needed the backing of a majority of UK shareholders holding at least 75 percent of the shares, but only required approval from 50 percent of the Dutch-listed shares. 
Shareholders representing about 12 percent of Unilever PLC had publicly opposed the move, concerned about the effective forced selling of their shares with no premium, uncertainty around the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends and a perception that the move was partly aimed at securing greater takeover protection under Dutch law.
Unilever's U-turn comes at a sensitive time for the British government, which is battling to protect jobs and investment as Prime Minister Theresa May fights for her proposed divorce plan from the European Union.
""The UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business, and our modern Industrial Strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy and a great place to locate global headquarters,"" Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
The decision is set to trigger political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on dividends that was seen as helping to woo Unilever.
Deputy Finance Minister Menno Snel said the Dutch cabinet was meeting to discuss the consequences. ""We would have liked to have seen this turn out differently,"" he told reporters.

Unilever's exit from the FTSE would have forced funds mandated to track the index to sell their shares. That may have pressured the price for the remaining shareholders, some of whom worried that shares in the new Unilever would be less liquid. 
Unilever decided to collapse its Anglo-Dutch structure following a review sparked by last year's failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft-Heinz (O:KHC). The stated aim was to make it more efficient and agile in a consumer market rocked by e-commerce, social media and upstart rivals. 
But on Friday Unilever said it recognized that the proposal had not received support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore withdrew it.
""The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,"" Chairman Marijn Dekkers said, adding Unilever will proceed with the plan to cancel its Dutch preference shares.
Earlier this week, influential proxy advisory firm PIRC recommended shareholders vote against the move.
Another service, IVIS, which is the corporate governance research service of the Investment Association, issued a ""red top"" recommendation on the move on Friday, its strongest level of concern. 
Sources said Unilever probably knew that recommendation before it was made public, which could have signaled that further shareholder defections were likely. 
WHAT NEXT
Unilever's Anglo-Dutch structure dates back to 1929 when British soap maker Lever Brothers combined with Dutch margarine company Margarine Unie. Unilever sold its margarine and spreads business earlier this year to KKR (N:KKR).
UBS analysts said the investor focus would now shift to Unilever's next steps, corporate governance improvements under the current structure and its operational performance. 
Unilever's London-listed shares were down 1 percent at 0957 GMT, while its Dutch shares were down 0.2 percent.
""This change should not really affect the group's near-term operation, although it may lead to a faster pace for CEO succession planning,"" Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt said. 
Waldschmidt said the bigger drivers for Unilever's shares were U.S. interest rates and continued difficulties in emerging markets, particularly related to their currencies.
Avoiding uncertainty over the shape of Brexit is another benefit to Unilever putting off a change, analysts at Baader Helvea said.
""Given current political discussions (i.e. Brexit), delaying such a vote until better mid-term visibility exists looks a reasonable approach (by Unilever),"" they said. 

Unilever was advised by its corporate brokers, UBS and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), and its legal adviser, Linklaters.

Last month VW Group's sales fell by half in Europe's five biggest markets, according to analysts at Citi, after several top selling models failed to conform to new the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) rules. 
Audi's monthly sales were down by 69.4 percent in Germany, while China deliveries increased 12.5 percent and sales in North America rose 1.2 percent, the carmaker said.
""Following above-average sales results in Europe over the past two months due to the sell-off of models in stock, the increasingly empty stores and the restrictions in the sales portfolio had an adverse effect on deliveries in September,"" Audi said.
Some of the supply bottlenecks that have slowed sales of VW's namesake brand, however, are now easing, VW said.
""Currently we have WLTP certification for volume sellers for all of our 14 models,"" it said in a statement. 

""Further vehicle variants will gain their product release shortly,"" VW said, adding that by year-end it would be able to offer close to all models to customers.

""We are worried that U.S. equities as a whole could see a leg-down after a long rally driven by the information technology sector,"" Christophe Moulin, head of multi asset at BNP Paribas wrote in his quarterly outlook, adding that he has opened a short position on the U.S. tech sector versus U.S. equities.
The Dow Jones and S&P 500 have risen around 8 percent since the start of the year while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped more than 14 percent.
While tech earnings had been strong, there were doubts about whether the current pace of earnings growth could be sustained, said Moulin, whose firm has 560 billion euros of assets under management.
BNP Paribas also closed its long position in U.S. bank stocks and Japanese equities, which had rallied at the end of the third quarter helped by a weaker yen. In currencies, BNP Paribas closed its short euro/yen position, but keeps its short euro/dollar position, Moulin said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shares in Danske Bank plummeted on Friday to their lowest in four years after a media report the bank executed up to 8.5 billion euros of mirror trades for Russian customers in 2013, and a downgrade by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
An internal memo seen by the Financial Times indicates that Danske Bank executed mirror trades in 2013 of between 6 billion euros and 8.5 billion euros, the UK newspaper reported on Friday.
Danske shares were trading 9.8 percent lower at 0744 GMT. 
Analysts partly attributed the share drop to the FT report, saying that it increases the risk of a major fine. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was previously hit by a $630 million fine from authorities in the United States and the UK for using mirror trades to allegedly launder Russian money.
On Thursday, Danske said it faces a U.S. criminal investigation into the scandal, and that it would discontinue a share buyback program.
The Financial Times said the document estimated that Danske made 10 million euros in 2013 from the mirror trades.
""There is potential reputational risk in being seen to be assisting 'capital flight' from Russia,"" the memo said.
""This is anyway a risk we run in other parts of our non-resident business, where the natural currency flow is always out of Russia,"" it said.
""Given the strong income from the solution, the risk-return is seen as very attractive.""
Credit Suisse on Friday downgraded Danske Bank to 'neutral' from 'outperform' and cut the target price to 199 Danish crowns from 244 crowns.

""The investment case and key reason for buying Danske and taking anti-money-laundering risk is gone as buybacks no longer support shares,"" Credit Suisse said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks opened lower on Friday and were set for their biggest weekly loss in a month due to rising yields ahead of U.S. jobs data which is expected to shed light on whether higher interest rates will be needed to stop the economy overheating. 
U.S. Treasury bond yields are at a seven-year high, echoing a market correction in February when rising yields on risk-free government debt made equities less attractive.

At 0843 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index was down 0.6 percent and set for its biggest weekly loss in a month. Germany's DAX also declined 0.4 percent and the UK's FTSE fell 0.7 percent.
Among the top movers was Danske Bank, which is facing a U.S. criminal investigation into a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal at its Estonian branch.
Shares in Denmark's biggest bank were down 8.7 percent after a rating cut by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
The banking sector, which typically benefits from higher interest rates and rising yields, was nonetheless in the red, with a 0.7 percent decline.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 05:09AM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk mocks SEC as judge demands they justify fraud settlement,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Elon Musk on Thursday mocked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, just hours after a federal judge ordered him and the regulator to justify their securities fraud settlement, which let Musk remain chief executive.
""Just want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,"" Musk, a frequent critic of investors betting against the electric car company, wrote on Twitter. ""And the name change is so on point!""
The tweet came five days after Musk settled SEC charges that he misled investors in tweets on Aug. 7, including that there was ""funding secured"" to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 per share.
Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine, and step aside as Tesla's chairman for three years, to settle charges that could have forced his exit from Tesla. The company also accepted a $20 million fine, despite not being charged with fraud.
Tesla and the SEC declined requests for comment. 
Former SEC lawyers questioned the wisdom of Musk's latest tweet, but said it was unlikely to jeopardize the settlement, which prevents Musk from denying wrongdoing or suggesting that the regulator's allegations were untrue.
""I don't think the SEC would look at this as a denial of the facts alleged,"" said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. ""But you don't take gratuitous shots at the SEC. There's no real upside.""
Shares of Tesla closed down $12.97, or 4.4 percent, at $281.83, and fell another 2.1 percent to $276 following Musk's tweet after market hours.
The tweet came less than four hours after U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan ordered Musk and the SEC to explain by Oct. 11 in a joint letter why their settlement was fair and reasonable and would not hurt the public interest.
Nathan said it was her regular practice to request such letters.
""She may want to know why Tesla is paying a fine because the CEO doesn't know when to shut up,"" said Adam Pritchard, a University of Michigan law professor and former SEC lawyer.
Musk's tweet on Thursday received more than 2,500 responses, with some users questioning the billionaire's judgment.
""Seriously? You know you still need their help convincing a judge that your penalty was sufficient... Maybe a 420M fine would have been more appropriate?"" one Twitter follower said. The proposed take-private price was $420 a share.
Musk replied, ""the opposite is true.""
He has used Twitter to criticize short-sellers betting against his company.
In a separate rambling tweet, he took another shot at short-sellers and accused BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) of enabling them by saying, ""The big funds can & will (sic), as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket (sic) make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for 'passive' index tracking.""
BlackRock declined to comment on Musk's tweet.
DEFERENCE TO SEC
The settlement also required Tesla's board to implement procedures for reviewing Musk's communications with investors, which include tweets.
Thomas Gorman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney in Washington, D.C., said Musk might argue that the latest tweet might be a mere ""personal lament,"" and not a violation of the settlement.
For her part, Nathan may have limited room to intervene, after a federal appeals court curbed the ability of judges to reject SEC settlements.
One such judge was Jed Rakoff, a colleague of Nathan's who objected to the SEC policy of letting some corporate defendants settle without admitting or denying wrongdoing, as Musk did.
But in 2014, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Rakoff's rejection of a $285 million SEC settlement with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), saying he should have given ""significant deference"" to the regulator.
The 2nd Circuit has jurisdiction over Nathan's court, and lawyers said Musk's settlement would likely win approval, though orders such as Nathan's are not too common.
""In and of itself it's not an ominous sign,"" said Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow and former SEC lawyer. ""The vast majority of settlements like this are approved by courts.""
Pritchard said before Musk's tweet that he saw no ""serious chance"" for a rejection of Musk's settlement, based on 2nd Circuit precedent. ""This is just a hoop to be jumped through,"" he said.

The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-08865.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 05:07AM ET</span>","Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, long opposed to producing its premium Lexus cars in China because of concerns over quality and profitability, is now considering it to ignite growth and narrow sales gaps with its German rivals, four company insiders told Reuters.
The company, which imports Lexus models made in Japan to sell in China, has spent the last two years researching how to produce them locally. 
Toyota also talked to its Chinese joint-venture partners – Guangzhou Automobile Group Co and FAW Group - last year about Lexus models. It wasn't clear whether Toyota approached the Chinese companies about a partnership or vice versa.
Local production would be a major shift for the world's largest automaker, encouraged by improved China-Japan ties, as well as new Chinese investment rules that might allow foreign automakers to fully own or majority-control China operations. 
""We're torn over this,"" said one of the insiders.
""But it makes little sense to let this opportunity slip by,"" another told Reuters.
All four insiders declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
China's planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms' access to the world's second-largest economy.
The rule changes - affecting electric carmakers this year and others by 2022 - led Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to gain Beijing's approval for a wholly-owned China manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai. That marked the first time a foreign carmaker established itself in China without a partner.
Toyota already produces numerous Toyota-brand models, including the Camry, Highlander, Corolla, Levin and Crown, in China with partners. Last year it sold 1.29 million cars there, including imported Lexuses. 
Toyota had contemplated moving Lexus production to China before - as far back as 2011-12, according to one of the four insiders. 
But it had until now considered a potential erosion of quality too much of a risk, and didn't want to sacrifice the brand's relatively high margins by sharing profits with a local partner.
Two of the Toyota insiders said the automaker had identified specific scenarios for localizing Lexus.
""All the preparation has been more or less completed,"" one said. ""All we're waiting is a 'go' from management.""
TRICKY TIMING
Toyota's preferred option is to own all or most of a localized Lexus unit, which it could do immediately by building only electric cars. (Lexus has plans for electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid versions of existing models.)
But China might not let another brand in when the market has slowed down significantly, with sales of some foreign vehicles, including Groupe PSA, Ford and Hyundai, all falling in the gutter in recent months. 
""You'd still need a good political follow-wind to execute this,"" one of the sources said, pointing to help from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has a state visit to China planned for this month.
Even as other premium brands - such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac - have opened assembly plants in China to gain market share, Toyota has resisted.
That reluctance reflects the company's unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States.
Opponents inside Toyota also point to China's lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses. 
They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea.
A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said ""the most important task"" for Lexus is to become a distinguished brand in China.
""We always weigh the need for localizing production as part of the consideration for the Lexus brand's future in China,"" he said. ""But at this point in time, we don't have any specific plans for producing Lexus cars in China.""
Nonetheless, support for localization is growing among Toyota leaders.
China has typically been a difficult market for Japanese companies, but there is new optimism, especially after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May.
During his visit, Li toured Toyota facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, escorted by the company's family scion and chief executive, Akio Toyoda.
Toyoda has since sought to boost his company's presence in China, including an effort to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, and share more technologies with Chinese companies. 
NEED FOR SPEED
China has also proposed limiting new production capacity for automakers, adding an incentive for Toyota to move quickly if it wants to build Lexus models there.
Nissan Motor Co and Toyota have each recently revealed plans to boost capacity, much of which will be used to produce electric cars. 
Alan Kang, a Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive, thinks localizing production is exactly what Lexus needs to start narrowing the big sales gap with German premium brands. 
Mercedes-Benz, for example, last year sold about 610,000 vehicles, compared to 130,000 for Lexus during the same year, according to LMC.

""If Lexus doesn't want to remain a niche, it needs to start investing more,"" Kang said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean appeals court said on Friday it found the chairman of Lotte Group guilty of charges including bribery and breach of trust, but suspended his jail term, setting him free.
A lower court had sentenced Shin Dong-bin in February to two years and six months in prison for his role in an influence-peddling scandal that roiled the country and led to the ouster of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye.
Shin appealed and the Seoul High Court on Friday upheld his conviction, but suspended the jail sentence for four years, freeing him after more than seven months in detention. 
Shin was convicted for providing 7 billion won ($6.20 million) to two foundations controlled by the former president's close friend in return for favors to win a duty free license.
The Seoul High Court said in its decision that Shin's crime resulted from a request by the former president.
""It could have been difficult for Shin to directly decline President's request as she was the country's highest power,"" the court said. 
Lotte Group said it welcomed the court's decision to release its chairman. 
""Lotte will strive to contribute to the country's economy and to become a firm that takes full social responsibility,"" it said in a statement. 
Samsung (KS:005930) Group's de-facto leader Jay Y. Lee was also convicted of corruption in the same bribery scandal. 
But he later became a free man back in February after the appeal court suspended his sentence.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd estimated third-quarter operating profit jumped by a fifth to a record high, with its semiconductor unit bolstered by robust demand from data centers and gains in production yields. 
But sharp price slides for some types of chips have brought an end to a two-year super cycle of tight supply and soaring demand, and analysts expect the July-September quarter will mark a peak in earnings for the South Korean tech giant.
Graphic: Samsung Electronics's operating profit growth to slow - https://tmsnrt.rs/2zKzlQI
Competition from cheaper Chinese made phones as well as higher marketing costs have also meant that an imminent rebound for Samsung's mobile unit is unlikely.
""Falling chip prices will pressure profits while its smartphone shipments are not satisfactory and will continue to crimp margins,"" said Song Myung-sup, a senior analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
Third-quarter results for the world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones were, however, impressive. Preliminary operating profit climbed 20.4 percent to 17.5 trillion won ($15.5 billion) on a 4.8 percent gain in revenue, in line with market expectations.
The firm did not elaborate on its performance and will disclose detailed earnings in late October.
Chips account for nearly 80 percent of Samsung's operating profit and Samsung has benefited from a surge in data centers for cloud computing that has spurred spikes in prices for DRAM chips. DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks, are its main memory product.
It has also made gains in production technology that allow it to make smaller and faster chips per silicon wafer.
But prices for NAND chips, used for longer-term data storage, have tumbled as supply swamps demand. Prices for DRAM are expected to follow suit, albeit at a much slower pace with some analysts saying Chinese data center demand will lend support.
Market tracker DRAMeXchange predicts an average price decline of 5 percent for DRAM products in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, steeper than its previous estimate of declines of as much as 3 percent. 
Samsung is forecast to still book decent operating profit growth of 12 percent in the fourth quarter, Refinitiv data shows. But that is seen dropping to minimal profit growth in the first half of 2019 followed by small profit declines in the second half.
Shares in Samsung rose 0.2 percent on Friday afternoon, while the broader market fell slightly. The stock has lost 12 percent so far this year on concerns about chip prices, underperforming the broader market which has declined 8 percent.
While income levels for Samsung's business divisions are yet to be disclosed, analysts expect its mobile business will struggle to deliver profit growth for the next two quarters.
It is working on bringing phones with bendable screens to market but they are not expected to become a huge profit driver. 
""Its mobile division will continue to look bad. Samsung's upcoming foldable phones are not going to be meaningful in terms of sales, more of a symbolic move in terms of innovation,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at BNK Securities.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 12:37AM ET</span>","After market rout, signs point to even higher bond yields","By Richard Leong
(Reuters) - A bond market rout that drove yields through key levels has some investors prepared for another leg that may finally declare an end to a three-decade-long bull run. 
The $15 trillion Treasuries market tanked on Wednesday with the 10-year and 30-year yields racing to seven-year and four-year highs, respectively. Traders again dumped U.S. government debt on Thursday following upbeat economic data and hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials, and yields - which move inversely to prices - hit new multi-year highs.
“The last man standing was the 30-year, and it has definitively broken above a multi-year base that should over time carry us to significantly higher yields,"" said Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, who manages $123 billion. 
Some key levels that investors are now laser focused on are around 3.50 percent for the 30-year and 3.25 percent for the benchmark 10-year. The 10-year and 30-year yields hit 3.232 percent and 3.3920 percent, respectively, on Thursday.
Technical signals suggest bond yields may rise further, especially on the longer-dated debt, and at least stall the likelihood the yield curve would invert as the Fed will likely push short-term rates higher.
Some of the bearish indicators included a surge in open positions in Treasury and interest rates future and in bond market volatility, which spiked to its highest level since June on Thursday.
""Wednesday’s breakouts now have analysts rushing to historical charts to indicate likely upside yield objectives,"" said Karl Haeling, vice president at Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg. 
Treasury yields blew past key technical levels in the initial phase of the selloff, begetting more selling that drove the 10-year yield to a seven-year high. 
The market rout continued into early Thursday before selling ebbed on a pullback in Wall Street stock prices and in advance of the government's monthly jobs report due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday.
Investors are hesitant in calling the end of the bull market for bonds, as whenever yields hit technical levels opportunistic buyers flood in. Some analysts reckoned the two-day selloff is overdone and can reverse quickly if Friday's jobs figures, particularly on wages, fall short of forecasts.

NEXT YIELD LEVELS
Gundlach has had his eye on the 30-year yield, predicting that two closes above 3.25 percent in a row would be a bearish sign for the bond market. The market on Thursday closed above that level for a second day in a row. 
The next technical level traders are looking for the 30-year to hit would be 3.39-3.40 percent area, and then 3.50 percent. 
Traders are also focused on the benchmark 10-year, with psychological support being 3.25 percent, the top-end level of most analyst forecasts for 2018. 
They will also monitor whether the 10-year and 30-year yields would test 3.125 percent and 3.25 percent before the end of the week.
The U.S. bond market will be closed on Monday for the U.S. Columbus day holiday.

STEEPER YIELD CURVE 
With worries receding about an imminent yield curve inversion, traders are eyeing the 2-to-10-year part of the curve with a resistance level above 33 basis points as key. They point out that after that there is no strong technical support before around 50 basis points.
Back in August, the yield curve touched its flattest level in more than a decade, stoking concerns it will invert. 
Such a move has been a reliable indicator that the economy is heading into a recession since the last century. The past three U.S. downturns were preceded by periods when the yield curve inverted 12 to 18 months earlier.

BEARISH ALREADY
Analysts will be watching data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is released every Friday, on investors' positioning on bond and rates futures before Wednesday's selloff.
In the 10-year T-bond area, speculators including hedge funds already accumulated a record net level of short bets on Sept. 25. On the other hand, fund managers built a record amount of positions that 10-year Treasury values will appreciate.

43,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",Lenovo Plunges 23% as Tech Wreck Bleeds Into Asia,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. slumped the most in almost a decade Friday, one of the multiple casualties from mounting investor concern about the risk of business with American customers in face of U.S. scrutiny of IT security.
As investors digested a Bloomberg News report that Beijing had hacked American computer networks using a microchip built by its spies, benchmark stock indexes tumbled across Asia. Taiwan’s Taiex index led declines in the region, retreating as much as 2.5 percent while counterparts in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea helped drag the MSCI Asia Pacific Index to a fifth day of losses. Lenovo slumped as much as 23 percent.
“Electronics produced in China may be viewed unsafe due to this news, and tech shares are falling in general because of that,” Ray K W Kwok, an analyst at CGS-CIMB Securities Hong Kong Ltd., said of the Bloomberg story.
Read here how China used a tiny chip to infiltrate almost 30 U.S. companies
The news of an investigation of altered motherboards became the latest sign of deteriorating relations between the U.S. and China, which were already embroiled in a months-long trade war. A speech Thursday by Vice President Mike Pence criticizing China across multiple economic, commercial and diplomatic fronts only added to the negative tone.
Beijing-based Lenovo, one of the world’s top PC makers, didn’t immediately reply to calls and emails seeking comment. Chinese markets and offices are closed for a week-long holiday.
ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., a Chinese communications-gear maker that’s been hit by American sanctions, tumbled as much as 14 percent in Hong Kong trading.
Semiconductor stocks around the world had already been under persistent pressure this year on concerns the cyclical industry has peaked amid flagging smartphone sales. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was down 1.8 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in Taipei.
Lenovo could be particularly vulnerable because it generated more than 30 percent of its revenue from North America and 75 percent from outside China in the most recent fiscal year.
It has built up its foreign sales through acquisitions, particularly from International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp. The company bought IBM’s PC business in 2005, including the ThinkPad notebook brand, and then agreed to buy its low-end server business in 2014. It also acquired Motorola (NYSE:MSI) Mobility from  Google Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOGL)., now known as Alphabet Inc., in 2014 in a $2.9 billion deal to bolster its smartphone business.
“The hack report has nothing to do with Lenovo, but since Lenovo sells PCs and severs there, some investors may have concerns on a sentiment level,” said Dennis Guan, a senior analyst at eFusion Capital. “It’s just too hard to predict how things will develop.”

Short-selling turnover soared to almost 18 percent of the total value of shares traded in the city Thursday, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show. Such dominance has only been once in the past 20 years, in May 2016. The Hang Seng Index closed 1.7 percent lower to cap its worst three-day rout since early February, when a U.S. volatility spike sent shockwaves across global markets.
Bears are returning to target the city’s equities and currency after being blindsided by a painful short squeeze last month, with this week’s declines putting the Hang Seng gauge on course for its worst year since 2011. Concern that a trade war will aggravate an economic slowdown in China is weighing on the city’s stock market, while a currency peg with the U.S. means the city will be forced to follow the U.S.’s tightening path.
The Hang Seng gauge fell into a bear market last month, following benchmarks on the mainland. Hong Kong’s bad week sets the tone for stocks across the border in China, where trading will reopen Monday after a week-long holiday break.
The Hang Seng Index was down 0.3 percent at 9:45 a.m., taking its loss this week to 4.5 percent, the worst on a closing basis since February.
With at least 14 percent of their outstanding shares sold short, Great Wall Motor Co., BYD Co. and Angang Steel Co. are among the favorite targets for bears in Hong Kong. Their shares have lost more than 4 percent this week, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data.

Samsung said in a filing that July-September profit likely gained 20.4% from the same period last year. The company will disclose detailed earnings in late October.
In China, markets remain closed for a week-long holiday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index extended losses and traded 0.9% lower.
J.P. Morgan lowered its rating for Chinese equities to neutral from overweight as it believed the escalating trade war between the countries will further hurt China's economy next year.
""A full-blown trade war becomes our new base case scenario for 2019,"" emerging market strategist Pedro Martins Junior said in a note to clients. ""There is no clear sign of mitigating confrontation between China and the US in the near term.""
Separately, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that relationship between the U.S. and China is ""probably as poor as"" it was before the Nixon administration opened up ties more than four decades ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors dumped U.S. government debt funds during the latest week, Lipper data showed on Thursday, pulling the most cash from those funds since March 2016 and exacerbating a bond selloff that spooked markets.
Nearly $1.7 billion hemorrhaged out of U.S.-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested primarily in Treasury bonds during the seven-day period through Oct. 3, according to the Refinitiv research service.
Bond investors are growing restless as signs of inflation build and the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks to its plan of containing prices by hiking interest rates.
""The Street fears they might accelerate the interest rate program that they're on right now,"" said Pat Keon, senior research analyst at Lipper.
With potentially inflationary U.S. tariffs already taking effect, data on Wednesday showed U.S. service sector activity hit a 21-year high and ADP private payrolls data for September was also strong. Monthly U.S. jobs data is due on Friday.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields leapt to their highest since May 2011.
Fund investors were quick to adjust, raising stakes in lower-grade corporate credit. Those bonds are expected to hold up better than government debt when rates are rising, as long as the economy keeps growing. High-yield bond funds attracted $1.4 billion during the week, the most since July, Lipper said.
Oil prices, meanwhile, are more than $10 higher than they were at the beginning of the year, another sign of the price pressures building but also a help to energy companies that have issued debt in recent years to bring that crude to market. U.S. benchmark oil futures settled at $74.33 per barrel on Thursday, up from around $60 in January.
Inflation-protected bond funds posted $544 million in withdrawals, the most in any week since June 2013, suggesting some fund investors are focused more on rising rates than inflation. These types of bonds only protect against the latter.
Stock fund investors repositioned on the move in rates, too.
Real estate funds recorded $700 million of withdrawals, the most since June, according to Lipper. The sector depends on debt financing that becomes more expensive when rates rise. 
And investors pulled $1.7 billion from bank sector funds, the most since January 2015. Higher rates help banks, but only when there is enough of a gap between short- and long-term lending rates from which they can profit. Healthcare and Japanese stocks drew more cash in the latest week.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 09:04PM ET</span>",Gucci boss reassures staff over looming era of slower growth,"By Sarah White and Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - The head of Gucci has reassured shop staff over a looming slowdown in the pace of sales growth after a revenue explosion at the  Kering  (PA:PRTP)-owned label, according to an internal video message seen by Reuters. 
Italy-based Gucci - the biggest earnings driver at the French luxury conglomerate - has outperformed most of its peers since 2016 thanks to a flamboyant makeover under designer Alessandro Michele. 
The boom has lasted longer than many fashion analysts expected, even as rivals invest in competing brands. 
Marco Bizzarri, Gucci's chief executive since 2015, said in a message to store employees they should not be daunted by any sign of a slowdown or variations in daily performances, which he said would be normal after rapid growth and at a time when year-ago comparisons are growing tougher. 
""I am here today to reassure you in the sense that Gucci is stronger than ever,"" Bizzarri said in the video message, adding Gucci was maintaining its competitive advantage over ""any other brand in the arena.""
Kering executives had already flagged to market watchers a ""progressive normalization"" of sales growth in 2018. 
The nearly four-minute-long video was presented to staff in the past week following Gucci's catwalk show in Paris, which was highlighted by Bizzarri in his comments.
A copy of the video was shared with Reuters by a person who had received it in the fashion industry.
Kering declined to comment. 
""ENJOY THE RIDE""
Gucci, like its rivals, has been carried by strong demand from Chinese consumers. Comparable sales at the label increased 40.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. 
That was a touch below forecasts following better-than-expected 48.7 percent growth in the previous three months, but still a faster pace than rivals like LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton, a brand Gucci wants to overtake one day as it aims to increase annual sales to 10 billion euros, from 6.2 billion euros ($7.15 billion) in 2017.
""We need to recognize the fact that at a certain point we're going to slow down, we cannot keep on growing 50, 60 percent per month, it's impossible,"" Bizzarri said in the video, adding that growth was still ""exceptional"" and telling staff to ""enjoy the ride"". 
""I'm happier now than I was two years ago, I'm very very confident,"" Bizzarri said.
Kering's shares have risen more than 20 percent this year, driven in large part by Gucci's strong performance. Its Saint Laurent and Balenciaga brands are riding high too, though Gucci accounts for over 70 percent of group profits. 
Gucci is investing in e-commerce and store facelifts to keep growing the brand, as well as building up areas like cosmetics and perfumes to maximize revenue from non-core products.
Quirky runway styles have helped it attract younger shoppers at a time when not all luxury firms have profited from a benign industry backdrop. Yet Gucci's distinctive look could make it vulnerable to brand fatigue, analysts have said. 

Broader market worries about a potential slowdown in China rattled luxury stocks from LVMH to Kering and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) on Thursday.

The warehouse club retailer's shares fell as much as 3 percent after the bell, with the company saying it is reviewing its internal control over financial reporting.
The company's gross margin fell 35 basis points to 10.92 percent in the fourth quarter on higher gas prices and investments. 
Costco has been spending heavily on its online business and delivery operations and offering same-day and two-day grocery delivery with Instacart. 
""We're not only investing in price, we're investing in infrastructure,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts, adding that the retailer would be ""doubling down"" its spending on IT and fulfillment centers.
Despite this, comparable online sales in the quarter grew just 26.2 percent, its slowest in a year as the company faces stiff competition from bigger rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which entered the grocery business with the acquisition of Whole Foods last year.
The retailer, which has been lowering prices, said the company continues to earn more from credit card transitions and hike in membership fee as well as benefiting from tax cuts.
Adjusted same-store sales rose 7.2 percent, beating estimates of a 6.4 percent rise. 
Net income attributable to Costco rose to $1.04 billion, or $2.36 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 2.
Net sales rose 5 percent to $44.41 billion. Analysts on average expected the company to post a profit of $2.36 per share on revenue of $44.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Bloomberg cited 17 unidentified sources from intelligence agencies and business to support claims that Chinese spies had placed computer chips inside equipment used by about 30 companies and multiple U.S. government agencies, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a written request for comment. Beijing has previously denied allegations of orchestrating cyber attacks against Western companies.
Security experts who have worked for government agencies and large corporations told Reuters that they were surprised by the stark discrepancy between the claims in the Bloomberg article and the strongly worded denials from Apple and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services. Some said that certain allegations were plausible, but that the strong denials from companies cited in the piece left them with doubts about whether the attacks had happened.
""There is no truth"" to claims in the story that Apple found malicious chips in its servers in 2015, the said in a statement. ""This is untrue,"" Amazon said in a blog post. 
Bloomberg defended its reporting. 
""Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.""
The report said that a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army infiltrated the supply chain of computer hardware maker Super Micro Computer Inc (PK:SMCI) to plant malicious chips that could be used to steal corporate and government secrets. 
Super Micro Computer shares fell 38 percent to $13.26 in Pink Sheet trading. 
San Jose, California-based Super Micro strongly denied that it sold servers to customers contained malicious microchips in the motherboards of those systems. It said it has never found any malicious chips, had not been informed that such chips were found by any customer, and never been contacted by government agencies on the matter.
Bloomberg reported that Amazon uncovered the malicious chips in 2015 when examining servers manufactured by a company known as Elemental Technologies which Amazon eventually acquired. 
The investigation found that Elemental servers, which were assembled by Super Micro, were tainted with tiny microchips that were not part of their design, Bloomberg said. Amazon reported the matter to U.S. authorities, who determined that the chips allowed attackers to create ""a stealth doorway"" into networks using those servers, the story said. 
AWS told Bloomberg it had reviewed its records related to the Elemental acquisition and ""found no evidence to support claims of malicious chips or hardware modifications."" 
Bloomberg also reported that Apple in 2015 found malicious chips in servers it purchased from the hardware maker, citing three unidentified company insiders.
Apple denied the account, saying it had investigated Bloomberg's claims. 
Representatives with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. A U.S. National Security Agency spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment.
While the companies disputed the facts in the story, security experts noted that there is growing concern that hackers could launch cyber attacks by inserting malicious chips into hardware sold to government agencies and businesses. 

""Extended, complex, global supply chains create a risk for malicious cyber activity that companies must take into account,"" said Michael Daniel, chief executive of the non-profit Cyber Threat Alliance.

53,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jobs Report Will Dominate the Day
The September employment report is clearly the big event for the market tomorrow.
The market recently reminded everyone that rising interest rates aren’t good for stocks. A strong payrolls report, especially if wage growth appears to be in check, could light a fire under yields again and really hit equities.
The Labor Department will release the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 185,000 last month, down from a rise of 201,000 in August. The jobless rate is expected to tick down to 3.8%.
Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% in September, a 2.8% gain year on year.
2. Will Bond Yields Keep Jumping?
The cumulative jump in bond yields drubbed stocks today and the jobs numbers will likely dictate whether they keep rising tomorrow.
Bond price started to drop in earnest this week after some respite in the standoff between Italy and the EU over Italy’s budget eased the flight to safety that was supporting Treasury prices.
A batch of very strong economic numbers, including strong private payroll growth and services activity gave the selloff some momentum. And Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s indication that the FOMC could move beyond a neutral level for rates was the icing on the cake, leading to anticipation of more rate hikes and pressuring bond prices even more.
The yield on the 10-year topped 3.2% today, a level that it hasn’t seen since 2011.
Bonds underperform in a rising rate environment as the yields on other investments climb and look better in comparison.
But bond guru Bill Gross said the selloff was also caused by a dearth of international buyers.
“Euroland, Japanese previous buyers of 10yr Treasuries have been priced out of market due to changes in hedge costs,” Gross said on Janus Henderson’s twitter account.






3. Tesla and Costco Fall After Hours
Individual issues may be taking a backseat to the macro influence, but there will still be some story stocks to keep an eye on.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still facing a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over misstatements about production and profitability targets, Fox Business reported, citing SEC sources.
The stock ended down more than 4% following the report and fell further in after-hours trading.
And Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) fell about 2.5% after hours, despite reporting a profit that matched expectations on sales that were slightly better than forecasts.
Costco said in its earnings report that it identified a “material weakness” in its financial reporting process.
“The weakness relates to general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes,” Costco said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks stumbled on Thursday as U.S. Treasury yields continued their ascent to multi-year highs on the latest round of strong economic data, building concerns for an acceleration of inflation.
The Dow suffered its first decline in six sessions, while both the S&P and Nasdaq had their worst day since June 25. 
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) climbed to a seven-year high of 3.232 percent, marking its largest daily jump since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Data on jobless claims and factory orders were the latest in a round of strong economic reports this week, putting the focus squarely on Friday's payrolls report for September.

""The follow-through on the Treasury rates today, actually the follow-through worldwide on Treasuries, has a big part to do with this,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
""And just in general, so many of these sectors have been so hot it may be time to take a little break,"" he added.
Financials (SPSY) were one of the few bright spots on Wall Street, rising 0.71 percent. Banks <.SPXBK>, which typically benefit from rising rates, gained 0.81 percent. 
Thursday's data, which showed jobless claims fell to a near 49-year low, followed comments this week from several Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, that underscored the strength of the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 200.91 points, or 0.75 percent, to 26,627.48, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 23.9 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,901.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 145.58 points, or 1.81 percent, to 7,879.51. 
Equities have struggled over the past year when interest rates climbed faster than investors were anticipating.

Among the biggest drags on the S&P were the so-called FANG group of stocks, which were among shares that helped propel the Nasdaq to its recent record high. Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) sank 2.8 percent and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) slumped 3.6 percent.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  lost 1.76 percent, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), shed 2.22 percent. Both companies denied a Bloomberg report their systems had been infiltrated by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese intelligence.
""Investors are concerned. Are more parts of the global technology supply chain hacked?"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
Market participants will be looking closely for signs of wage growth in Friday's jobs number, especially in light of anecdotal indications of rising wages such as Amazon's raising its minimum wage to $15 earlier this week.
Despite the pullback, U.S. stocks remain near record levels, raising some concern about valuations with the quarterly earnings reporting season about to begin.
Among gainers, Constellation Brands (N:STZ) rose 5.38 percent after the Corona beer maker raised its full-year profit forecast and topped Wall Street's estimates for second-quarter sales and profit.
Eli Lilly (N:LLY) shares gained 4.02 percent after the company's experimental diabetes drug showed promise in a mid-stage trial.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.55-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

There were 831 stocks hitting new 52-week lows across all U.S. exchanges, the most since stocks were beginning to pull out of correction territory on Feb. 9, versus 92 new 52-week highs.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Western European car sales fell 23 percent in September on emissions tests: LMC,"PARIS (Reuters) - Western European car sales dropped 23 percent in September, according to LMC Automotive data, in the wake of a summer discounting splurge that preceded tougher new emissions rules now keeping some models out of showrooms.
Registrations fell to 1.05 million cars last month from 1.36 million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Thursday. Its numbers are based on national sales data and estimates for some of the smallest markets.
The new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to halt deliveries of some models that had yet to be re-certified.
""The factors affecting the market are multifaceted, with backlogs in cars being tested under WLTP leading to the removal from sale of several popular models,"" said LMC analyst David Oakley.
VW, Renault and  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) had led a sales surge in August, as carmakers boosted discounts and registrations of their own vehicles to be sold as nearly new on the used car market.
Citi analysts calculate that VW Group's sales fell by half in September across Europe's five biggest markets -- Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain -- while Renault's dropped 28.7 percent and Fiat Chrysler's 32.1 percent.
According to French market data supplied by industry newsletter AutoActu, models worst hit by September's slump included the Volkswagen Golf and Touran; Renault's Espace and Kadjar; alliance partner Nissan's (T:7201) Qashqai SUV; and FCA's Fiat Tipo and Jeep Renegade.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of Western European sales plunged 39 percent from August to 11.26 million cars last month, LMC said - adding that VW model approval delays had contributed to market declines in Germany and the UK.
Total sales fell 30.5 percent in Germany, 20.5 percent in Britain, 12.8 percent in France and 25.4 percent in Italy, according to data published in recent days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A black former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) broker who filed a lawsuit accusing the bank of racial bias must pursue his claims in private arbitration, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan ruled that the former broker, John Lockette, was bound by a company policy requiring employees to arbitrate all claims, including discrimination claims.
""We are pleased with the court’s decision in this case,"" Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Susan Siering said in an email. ""The firm is strongly committed to non-discrimination and looks forward to addressing this dispute on the merits.""
Linda Friedman, a lawyer for Lockette, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Lockette, who was hired by Morgan Stanley as an assistant vice president in wealth management in 2013, sued the company in February.
The New Jersey resident said he was given negative performance reviews, denied raises and bonuses, deemed too ""verbose,"" and subjected by a supervisor to the nickname ""Johnny"" because of his race.
Lockette also said one supervisor insisted that he join a special program to prepare for the Series 7 broker examination because blacks' ""intellectual weakness"" left them ""inherently less capable"" of passing, the complaint said.
He said the discrimination culminated in his firing in August 2016. He sought compensatory and punitive damages, back pay, and an injunction against further discrimination.
Morgan Stanley filed a motion seeking to send the case to private arbitration, pointing to a May 20, 2015 email in which Morgan Stanley employees were told that the company was expanding its arbitration policy.
The email said that employees could opt out, but would be deemed to have agreed to the policy if they did not do so before a given deadline and continued working for the company.
Lockette said he never got the email, and so never agreed to arbitration, but Koeltl ruled that his ""mere denial of receipt"" was not enough to escape the policy under New York law.

The case is Lockette v Morgan Stanley et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-00876.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Third Point demands Campbell Soup board records,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC has demanded access to a trove of records from Campbell Soup Co, ranging from board meeting minutes to financial documents, as it ratchets up a campaign to replace the company's board of directors, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Third Point's move offers an example of the legal tools shareholder activists are increasingly using to boost their chances of winning proxy contests against corporate boards.
Such maneuvering could prove crucial in this case, given Third Point, which owns 5.65 percent of the canned soup maker, faces challenges in wooing some key shareholders. Descendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined 42 percent stake in the company, representing a major hurdle.
Third Point gave the U.S. company five days to provide it access to several, typically confidential, documents, pertaining to its recently completed strategic review, its mergers and acquisitions activity, and succession planning for its chief executive, according to Third Point's ""demand letter,"" dated and delivered to Campbell Soup on Wednesday.
In the letter, the hedge fund cites a New Jersey statute that gives shareholders the right to review company documents, provided they demonstrate a ""proper purpose"" for looking at the records. This sets the stage for a legal battle with Campbell Soup, should it refuse access to the records.
Campbell Soup, based in Camden, New Jersey, did not respond to a request for comment on how it would respond to Third Point's demands. 
In a press release it published on Thursday to urge shareholders to back its board, the company said that it ""strongly objects to Third Point’s aggressive and short-sighted tactics"".
Third Point declined to comment.
Campbell Soup shares were up 1.2 percent at $36.94 in early morning trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $11.1 billion.
Last month, Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees to replace all twelve of Campbell's directors, alleging the company has been mismanaged for years. The company's share price is now 30 percent lower than it was 20 years ago, Loeb said, adding that executives failed to explore all strategic options, including the sale of the company. 
Campbell has disputed this, arguing that its recently concluded strategic review considered every possibility. 
The company has said it currently plans to sell only its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, as it focuses on improving its operational performance. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Jeff Dunn, the former president of Campbell's fresh food unit, is leading a consortium of investors that is in talks to buy that division for between $500 million and $700 million.
DECISIONS ON ACQUISITIONS
Third Point said it needs to see Campbell documents to determine whether board directors or employees violated their fiduciary duty. In its letter, Third Point seized on comments made last month by Campbell's interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin.
McLoughlin, who took over when CEO Denise Morrison exited abruptly in May, had said the firm relied too much on acquisitions and lacked a culture of accountability, that led to poor execution.
""These admissions demonstrate that shareholders are entitled to the records of the company's decision-making processes to investigate this unquestionable mismanagement and further instances of wrongdoing,"" according to Third Point's letter.
Among the things Loeb wants to find out is how the company went from saying that its $6 billion acquisition of Snyder's-Lance would be accretive to earnings only to reverse itself and say it would be modestly dilutive to earnings.
""It is unfathomable that Campbell management could improperly represent to shareholders that the largest acquisition in the company's history would be accretive and just five months later admit that they blew it,"" the letter said.
Third Point is also asking for details about what the board planned to do after Morrison stepped down, including hiring a headhunter and any information on potential CEO candidates. 
""Given Ms. Morrison's disastrous performance, the board should have been acutely focused on trying to identify a qualified replacement well before her separation,"" the letter said.
Campbell, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
It is not clear if any company would buy Campbell in its entirety. Kraft Heinz Co has considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, sources have told Reuters, but there is no sign of any recent approach from the company.
PLEDGED SHARES
Third Point's records request also covers any information related to board director Bennett Dorrance, who has held his seat since 1989 and was granted a waiver to stay after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 72. 
Third Point is interested in finding out why Dorrance, a grandson of former company chief John Dorrance, has not moved more quickly to reduce the loans he took for which he pledged roughly $500 million of his Campbell shares as collateral.
Pledging or loaning out shares creates questions about whether the shares can be voted and if ""directors' interests are truly aligned with those of shareholders,"" the letter said.
Campbell said on Thursday it will hold its annual shareholder meeting, where investors will vote on the board directors, on Nov. 29. It is not clear whether any legal dispute over Third Point's demand for company documents would be resolved by then.

Investors who hold Campbell shares as of Oct. 9 will be eligible to vote at the shareholder meeting, the company said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Juul Labs, the e-cigarette maker at the heart of a U.S. crackdown on youth vaping, has filed patent infringement complaints in the United States and Europe against what it said were copycat rivals.
The complaints follow the seizure this week by U.S. health regulators of more than 1,000 pages of documents from Juul Labs about its sales and marketing practices, as they investigate growing e-cigarette use among young people that threatens to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
Juul, which controls nearly three quarters of the U.S. e-cigarette market, filed a complaint on Wednesday with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) naming 18 entities, most of them based in the United States or China, accusing them of developing and selling products based on its patented technology. 
(Special Report: Juul copycats flood the e-cigarette market, despite FDA rule - https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vaping-regulation-juul-specialreport/high-nicotine-e-cigarettes-flood-market-despite-fda-rule-idUSKCN1M418W)
The complaint, made public on Thursday, asks the ITC to prevent the importation of the products into the United States and their sale. 
The company said its UK subsidiary also filed a complaint in Britain against French company J Well France SAS, alleging that its Bo line of e-cigarettes infringed its UK patents. 
J Well France, also named in the US complaint, was not immediately available to comment. 
Silicon Valley-based start-up Juul gained prominence in the United States in just a few years, helped by its high nicotine content and sleek, flash-drive sized device. Its breakneck growth and popularity in high schools across the country has attracted scrutiny from government officials and regulators. 
It also sparked a wave of lower-priced rivals.
""The rapid proliferation of products infringing on our intellectual property continues to increase as our market share grows,"" Kevin Burns, Juul's chief executive officer, said in a statement.
""Protecting consumers and preventing underage use are critical priorities, and we will take decisive action where available to restrict illegal copy-cat products that undermine our efforts.""
Juul said many of those rival products appear to be sold with little or no age-verification processes and appear to target young people with flavors such as ""bubble bubble"" and ""sour gummy"". 
Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg said a ban on Juul lookalikes would further strengthen the position of Juul and other companies in the e-cigarette space, which include  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS), Imperial Brands (L:IMB) and Altria (N:MO), by allowing for consolidation of the market. 
""The reality is the US e-cigarette market is largely grey and the knock-off players in question ... exist and compete for share of wallet,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) said on Thursday its new two-in-one diabetes drug was successful in lowering blood sugar and reducing weight, sending its shares to a record high and weighing on those of arch-rival  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb).
The novel drug targets two key gut hormones at the same time, and could pose a threat to currently available single-hormone drugs, which form a large and growing part of Novo's business.
Lilly's treatment reduced blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients by up to 2.4 percent and produced an average weight reduction of up to 12.7 percent in a mid-stage study by targeting the GLP-1 and GIP hormones.
The trial results set a new industry gold standard versus marketed GLP-1s, including Novo's Ozempic for both blood sugar lowering and weight loss, Citi analyst Andrew Baum said.
Lilly's shares were rose 6.5 percent to a record high of $115.68 in early trading, while those of Novo fell nearly 8 percent.
Novo's existing GLP-1 products include Victoza and Omzepic, and the company is also developing an oral version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic.
Lilly said it intends to complete its late-stage study for the drug in late 2021, and is also evaluating the drug for treating obesity, among other conditions.
BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the treatment provides Lilly with a reasonable shot at the large obesity market and should meaningfully strengthen the company's position in the rapidly growing GLP-1 market.
About 30 million adults in the United States have diabetes, with 90 percent to 95 percent of them suffering from type 2 diabetes.
Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, and weight loss as little as 5 percent of the total body weight has been found to help improve type 2 diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight, according to American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.
Lilly's wide portfolio of diabetes drugs, including GLP-1 drug Trulicity, contributed at least 38 percent to its total sales of $6.36 billion in the latest reported quarter.

""With Trulicity representing a core growth driver for Lilly and competitive concerns regarding Ozempic and oral semaglutide causing an overhang on shares over the past year, we see today’s results as a clear positive for the Lilly story,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note.

Tilray’s plan to sell debt that can be converted into shares follows equity and equity-linked sales by others in the budding industry including Innovative Industrial Properties Inc., India Globalization Capital Inc. and Canopy Growth Corp. Buzz about marijuana has propelled cannabis-related stocks higher, leading to a 26 percent gain in the sector’s first exchange-traded fund this year.
Tilray shares are trading at more than nine times the price fetched in its July initial public offering and the $400 million debt sale could raise roughly four times as much cash. Shares fell 5 percent in extended trading on Wednesday after the sale was disclosed, likely pleasing short sellers who have been swarming the space.
Innovative Industrial, a REIT that leases to the medical cannabis industry, launched its second equity offering of the year Wednesday evening. The sale’s terms are more aggressive than the firm’s January deal, which offered buyers a bigger discount to the prior closing price.

95,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",GM and Honda are joining forces on self-driving cars with a $750 million Honda investment making GM Cruise worth $14.6 billion," General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced Wednesday that it has allied with Honda to pursue a shared self-driving future.
Honda will invest $2 billion over 12 years in the collaboration with GM's Cruise autonomous division, with an additional $750 million equity investment that brings Cruise's valuation to $14.6 billion.
GM acquired San Francisco-based Cruise in 2016 for an all-in price of $1 billion. A recent joint investment from  GM and SoftBank took the unit's valuation to $11.5 billion.
The GM-Honda partnership will develop what the companies called a ""purpose-built autonomous vehicle"" for Cruise, intended to provide the carmakers with global scale and possible commercial applications. GM and Honda had previously announced a collaboration on battery development.
""This is the logical next step in General Motors and Honda's relationship, given our joint work on electric vehicles, and our close integration with Cruise,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement.
""Together, we can provide Cruise with the world's best design, engineering and manufacturing expertise, and global reach to establish them as the leader in autonomous vehicle technology — while they move to deploy self-driving vehicles at scale.""
On a conference call with reporters after the announcement, Barra added that the partnership would enhance GM's vision of a world with ""zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion"" — a key agenda that she has been advancing as GM's head.
GM and Cruise have focused on a fully integrated hardware and software solution to the challenge of establishing an autonomous ride-hailing and -sharing network that can operate in urban environments.
The deal has led to the rollout of a fully integrated autonomous electric car — the tech is being built into Chevy Bolt electric vehicles — that is being fleet-tested in San Francisco, Detroit, and Phoenix, with New York City scheduled to follow this year.
Commercialization  will arrive in 2019, according to GM's president, Dan Ammann, and Cruise's CEO, Kyle Vogt.
""With the backing of General Motors, SoftBank and now Honda, Cruise is deeply resourced to accomplish our mission to safely deploy autonomous technology across the globe,"" Vogt said in a statement.
""The Honda partnership paves the way for massive scale by bringing a beautiful, efficient, and purpose-built vehicle to our network of shared autonomous vehicles.""
Ammann declined to provide specific details on the nature of vehicle and its design, but on a conference call with he media after the news was announced, he said that the collaboration would bring the ""next evolution in the future of transportation,"" with a platform ""free from having to think about a driver at the wheel.""
""It's the true future of mobility,"" he added.
The announcement indicates that Cruise, which up to this point was operating exclusively with a fleet of Chevy Bolts, will see its technology integrated into platforms designed and engineered by Honda. Vogt said that Cruise's learnings from the Chevy Bolt autonomous deployment laid the groundwork to pursue the next stage of the process with the Honda collaboration.
This is a not-unfamiliar move in the global auto industry, as automakers look to share costs by working together on mutually beneficial technologies.
Ammann said that the development of the vehicle would be a fully joint effort between GM, Cruise, and Honda's global teams, and GM said that the vehicle will be manufactured by carmaker. The Cruise Chevy Bolts are built in Michigan, and Honda has a significant manufacturing footprint in the US South, as longstanding US-based design, engineering, sales, and marketing resources.
The announcement, following on the GM-SoftBank deal, represented a salvo fired across the bow of technology firms with self-driving aspirations.
""The future of transportation belongs to today's automakers,"" Brian Moody, the executive editor of Autotrader, said in an email.
""All the talk of tech companies stealing transportation is nonsense. Today's automakers have the scale, knowledge and R&D dollars, plus they know how to manage a broad network of suppliers and can work with policy officials to get things done.""
GM shares traded up almost 6% in pre-market action on Wednesday, to $35. The stock closed at $33 on Tuesday.

96,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 09:25AM ET</span>",Elon Musk can help pick his replacement as chairman of Tesla — despite complaints he already has too much sway over its board,"Elon Musk may soon be out as chairman of Tesla, but he'll be able to pick his successor and serve with that person on the electric car company's board.
The  settlement agreements Musk and Tesla reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission don't include any kind of bar on Musk's continued service as a director of the car company. The agreements, copies of which Business Insider obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, also do not include any provision that would bar him from voting his shares in favor of or against nominees to the Tesla's board.
That means that despite being forced to step down as chairman as part of those agreements, Musk could continue to have a lot of sway over the body that is supposed to oversee him as CEO. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, holding some 22% of the company's outstanding shares at the end of last year.
""Musk is still the CEO and his friends still control the board, so tell me what really changed,"" said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in an interview with Business Insider.
The settlements were related to Musk's infamous ""funding secured""  tweets regarding a potential move to take Tesla public. The SEC charged that he made those statements on Twitter knowing or having reason to know that they were false and misleading. After Musk initially rejected a settlement offer from the agency, which the SEC responded to by  suing him, Tesla and its CEO accepted revised settlement agreements that are somewhat harsher.
Under those agreements, which still have to be approved by a federal court, Tesla agreed to replace Musk with an independent chairman and to name two new independent directors. Tesla agreed to name a new chairman within 45 days of the settlement, and to name the new directors within 90 days.
The agreements implicitly allow Musk to be involved in both of those sets of choices. They don't include any provision that would prohibit him from voting, as a director of Tesla, on its new chairman or its new directors. And they don't include any bar on him taking part in a shareholder vote on the new board members.
The settlements also allow Tesla to name as its chairman one of its existing board members, rather than one of the new directors its been ordered to add. The company's current directors, which include Musk's brother, Kimbal, have come under repeated fire  for being too deferential to and not adequately overseeing Musk.
""The SEC stayed away [from] the broader corporate governance and management issues,"" Turner said. 
Also as part of the settlements, Musk and the company will each pay a $20 million fine to the SEC. However, in what could be seen as a win for shareholders, the agreements essentially require Musk and the company to pay the fines out of their own funds. Neither can ask that they be paid out of the company's insurance policies.
Additionally, the agreement requires its board to create within 90 days a permanent committee comprised solely of independent directors that will oversee the implementation of the settlement SEC and set guidelines for top executives' communications with the public. The agreement also requires Tesla to hire or designate a securities law attorney to ensure that posts made by Musk and other executives to Twitter follow SEC disclosure rules.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","J&J, Arrowhead in gene-silencing drug deal worth up to $3.7 billion","By Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:ARWR) said on Thursday Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) would develop and market its gene-silencing Hepatitis B treatment and buy a minor stake in a deal that could be potentially worth more than $3.7 billion, sending its shares surging 20 percent.
Under the deal, J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit will obtain a worldwide license for Arrowhead's ARO-HBV drug and an option to collaborate on up to three new RNA interference (RNAi) drugs, which use gene-silencing technology.
J&J's investment comes a month after Arrowhead released data from an early trial testing ARO-HBV, dubbed ""revolutionary"" by analysts who also said the company was positioned to develop a functional cure for Hepatitis B.
It also follows the first U.S. approval for an RNAi drug - Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' (O:ALNY) Onpattro - in August that affirmed the gene-silencing class of drugs as a new frontier in the field of medicine.
J&J will make a $75 million equity investment in Arrowhead at $23 per share, a premium of about 24 percent to the stock's Wednesday close. Arrowhead will also get $175 million upfront, the company said in a statement. 
Arrowhead is also eligible to receive up to $1.6 billion in milestone payments for the Hepatitis B license and about $1.9 billion in option and milestone payments for the three additional treatments.
B.Riley FBR analyst Madhu Kumar compared the deal to the one French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) inked with Alnylam in 2014 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi-alnylam/sanofi-to-buy-12-percent-of-alnylam-expands-rare-disease-drug-deal-idUSBREA0C07K20140113?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews, adding likewise for Arrowhead the agreement is ""a demonstration of Big Pharma validation of their technology"".
Arrowhead said proceeds would be used to fund other treatments under development. The company is currently testing drugs for metabolic disorders, lung disease and cancer. 
""I view (the deal) as a pivot to transitioning from a small biotech company to a large pharmaceutical company,"" Chief Executive Officer Christopher Anzalone told Reuters. 
Pasadena, California-based Arrowhead uses its proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM) technology to develop RNAi medicines that treat diseases by targeting and silencing specific genetic material, thereby blocking the production of disease-causing proteins.
Hepatitis B, which affects an estimated 257 million people, is a life-threatening viral infection that attacks the liver and patients risk death from cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Arrowhead's shares pared some gains and were up about 8 percent at $20.02 in premarket trading. The company's market value has jumped five-fold since the start of the year.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",High stakes: Risk in Nasdaq's Nordic power market boomed before default,"By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos
OSLO (Reuters) - Risk levels in Nasdaq's (O:NDAQ) Nordic commodities market had more than doubled in the six months prior to a top trader's default in November, the result of a rapid accumulation of bets amid soaring electricity prices, the exchange told Reuters.
Nasdaq conducts daily stress tests calculating market risk, adjusting every quarter a member-funded buffer to shield the market from breaking down in case of defaults like the one that caused a 114 million euro ($132 million) loss in September.
But the stress tests, which are not made available to traders, may be insufficient, some of them told Reuters, asking for more transparency and better risk control.
On March 1, the default fund amounted to just 74 million euros. Had the level stayed unchanged, Einar Aas, the trader who defaulted, would have hit the market with a loss the buffers couldn't match, triggering a deeper crisis.
Seeing higher risk levels, Nasdaq on June 1 increased clearing members' default fund requirement to 133 million euros, and on Sept. 1 upped it again to 166 million euros.
These were the only two occasions on which members were warned of the increased risk Nasdaq identified prior to the default, aside from regular market notices.
""The increase in stress values was primarily driven by two factors: a general increase in the price levels in the power markets which directly feed into increased stress numbers, and increased underlying exposure (increased size of positions) among the members,"" Nasdaq said.
Aas had triggered alerts in the stress tests due to his large positions but was not the only trader to do so, it added.
Investors had significantly increased their positions over six months, Nasdaq said, and while the size itself was no cause for concern, it coincided with a fall in liquidity, making it hard for individual traders to exit positions.
On Sept. 10, when spreads between Nordic and German power contracts widened sharply, an event Nasdaq later described as a ""black swan"", Aas was unable to unload his portfolio.
A systemic collapse was avoided, Nasdaq said, thanks to the stress tests that caused the buffer's readjustment.
RISK AND TRANSPARENCY
Betting that Nordic-German spreads would shrink - the opposite of what happened - had been common, traders said. Others avoided big losses as they managed to close their positions due to their smaller size.
""We had a position that included the spread that we closed one week before what happened ... It should come together but it continued to widen. If you are a trader you either put more money in it or you sell,"" portfolio manager Per Svenonius at Sweden's Modity Energy said.
But while more defaults were avoided, traders said they were unhappy with Nasdaq's handling of the matter and level of transparency, and that the exchange had underestimated risk.
BKK, Norway's second-largest power firm as measured by retail customer base, told Reuters: ""The incident shows that Nasdaq's risk assessments for individual participants are insufficient."" 
Sweden's Sheperd Energy called for stricter rules, saying Nasdaq had miscalculated risk.
""It is not OK for Nasdaq to have one player holding about 50 percent of the open interest in (the contract for) Q1 2019. It is very dangerous,"" portfolio manager Arne Oesterlind said.
""They have to make better stress tests,"" he added.
Following the default, Nordic regulators launched investigations that are still ongoing, while Nasdaq imposed stricter collateral demands.
Asked whether Nasdaq was considering publishing stress tests daily, a Nasdaq spokesman said: ""We are considering our actions in our current review of the situation."" Previously Nasdaq said it was considering reshaping maximum allowed positions per member.
Einar Aas did not respond to requests for comment.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 08:37AM ET</span>","Dollar and global bonds track surge in Treasury yields, stocks sag","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - A rise in U.S. Treasury yields to their highest levels since mid-2011 pulled global bond yields higher across the board and boosted the dollar on Thursday, while stocks sagged in response.
An influential survey of the U.S. services sector showed activity at its strongest since August 1997, sparking speculation that the payrolls report on Friday could also surprise.
Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that economic outlook was ""remarkably positive"" and that rates might rise above ""neutral"" also helped the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury climb to 3.18 percent on Wednesday. 
Yields extended those gains on Thursday, having spiked to 3.2325 percent overnight, posting their steepest daily increase since the shock outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. It last traded at 3.2135 percent. [US/]
""The market is pricing in an additional 0.47 percent of rate increases in 2019 (nearly two hikes) compared to the Fed’s median projection of 0.75 percent (three hikes),"" wrote Bill Merz, Minneapolis-based director of fixed income at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 
""The difference in market versus Fed expectations must be reconciled via lower Fed expectations or the higher market expectations. We anticipate further upward pressure on bond yields, because the Fed is unlikely to waver materially from its near-term path.""
The rise in U.S. yields helped lift yields across Asia and Europe in response, while shares in emerging markets slipped. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favorable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.7 percent, with South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan all down.
Even the Nikkei eased half a percent, as rising yields offset the boost to exporters from a weaker yen. 
EMini futures for the S&P 500 also lost 0.4 percent in European trade (N), while European stocks last traded down 0.7 percent. (EU)
Euro zone bond yields rose sharply, tracking their U.S. counterpart, while the ""trans-Atlantic spread"" between United States and German 10-year bond yields hit a three-decade high of around 275 bps. [GVD/EUR]
Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the region, hit a 4-1/2 month high of 0.55 percent before settling at around 0.53 percent, still up six basis points on the day.
""If the Fed is to hike rates beyond the neutral level, the underlying case is that the economy is doing very well - and if the U.S. economy is doing very well, that has spillover effects the euro zone,"" said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht.
""This will make it easier for the ECB to raise rates in 2019; and you will see this impact yields in the euro zone, especially at the long end,"" he added.
The exception of the day was Italy, where borrowing costs dropped for a second day, after the government said it would cut budget deficit targets from 2020 and reduce its debt over the next three years.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and said this would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021.
The estimates for 2020 and 2021 were lower than those initially reported, bringing further relief to bond markets rattled by the new government's plans to ramp up spending.
Italy's two-year bond yield was last down 2 basis points at 1.234 percent.
In currencies, the dollar gave up some of the gains that took it to a six-week high against a basket of peers, to stand up 0.1 percent on the day. [FRX/]
Oil prices slipped from four-year highs, pressured by rising U.S. inventories and after sources said Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise crude output. [O/R] 
Brent eased 0.2 percent to $86.13 a barrel on Thursday, while U.S. crude also fell 0.1 percent to $76.28 a barrel.

Gold prices moved in a narrow range, last trading up 0.3 percent at $1.200.52 per ounce. [GOL/]

102,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>","Facebook, responding to lawsuit, says sex trafficking banned on site","By Dan Whitcomb
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday in response to a lawsuit accusing it of not doing enough to protect users from human traffickers that it works internally and externally to thwart such predators.
""Human trafficking is abhorrent and is not allowed on Facebook. We use technology to thwart this kind of abuse and we encourage people to use the reporting links found across our site so that our team of experts can review the content swiftly,"" a spokeswoman for Facebook said in a written statement.
A Texas woman, identified in court documents as Jane Doe, sued Facebook in Harris County District Court in Houston this week, claiming that she was lured into the sex trade at age 15 by a man who ""friended"" her and that Facebook did not do enough to verify the user's identity or warn her that sex traffickers were lurking on the platform. 
""Facebook also works closely with anti-trafficking organizations and other technology companies, and we report all apparent instances of child sexual exploitation to NCMEC (the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children),"" the company's spokeswoman said.
Jane Doe claimed in the lawsuit that she was fooled by the sex trafficker who messaged her on Facebook in 2012 because he appeared to know several of her real-life friends. 
She said she agreed to meet him when he offered to console her after a fight with her mother, but instead he beat and raped her, then posted her picture on the now-shuttered classified ads website Backpage.com to be prostituted. 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAW
Backpage.com was shut down in April by federal authorities after a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the website was used primarily to sell sex.
Backpage.com and several of its former employees, including two of its founders, were also named as defendants in Jane Doe's lawsuit. 
Attorneys for Backpage.com and the former employees have not replied to requests from Reuters for comment.
The lawsuit came months after the U.S. Congress passed the bipartisan anti-trafficking bills called Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, collectively known as SESTA-FOSTA. 
The legislation is aimed at making it easier to prosecute owners and operators of websites that facilitate sex trafficking.
SESTA-FOSTA was signed into law by President Donald Trump in April, days after seven Backpage.com executives were indicted in federal court on prostitution and money laundering charges. 

The legislation includes a statute meant to close a loophole in the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Communications Decency Act that protected internet service providers from liability over content posted by its users.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four industry groups representing major internet providers and cable companies filed suit on Wednesday seeking to block California's new law to mandate net neutrality rules, which they say are complex, burdensome and harmful to innovation.
The groups represent companies including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR). The lawsuit came after the U.S. Justice Department on Sunday filed its own lawsuit to block the new law.
The lawsuit was filed by the American Cable Association; CTIA - The Wireless Association; NCTA - The Internet & Television Association; and USTelecom - The Broadband Association. It called California's law a ""classic example of unconstitutional state regulation"" and urged the court to block it before it is set to take effect Jan. 1. 
""We oppose California’s action to regulate internet access because it threatens to negatively affect services for millions of consumers and harm new investment and economic growth,"" the four groups said in a statement.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that the lawsuit was brought ""by power brokers who have an obvious financial interest in maintaining their stronghold on the public's access to online content."" He added his office will do all it can to defend ""a free and open Internet"" for California's 40 million consumers.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Sunday in a statement that the ""the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy.""
This marked the latest clash between the Trump administration and California, which have sparred over environmental, immigration and other hot-button issues.
In December, the Federal Communications Commission said in repealing the Obama-era rules that it was pre-empting states from setting their own rules governing internet access.
The Trump administration rules were a win for internet providers but opposed by companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Under President Donald Trump, the FCC voted 3-2 in December along party lines to reverse rules that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization.
In August, 22 states and a coalition of trade groups representing major tech companies urged a federal appeals court to reinstate the rules. The states argue that the FCC cannot pre-empt state rule because it is not setting any limits on conduct by internet providers.

A federal judge on Monday set a Nov. 14 hearing in Sacramento on the Justice Department lawsuit.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) -  ICICI Bank Ltd  (NS:ICBK) chief Chanda Kochhar, who has been mired in controversy for months, resigned on Thursday after seeking an early retirement and will be replaced by Sandeep Bakhshi, the Indian private lender said.
Kochhar is the third high-profile woman banker in India to step down in recent months, following Arundhati Bhattacharya who retired from the  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) a year ago and Shikha Sharma who is set to exit after almost ten years atop  Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK) in December.
Her exit also comes at a time when the banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is driving a push for better governance and leadership changes at lenders that have racked up some $150 billion in bad loans. 
""There is now additional pressure from RBI to show that banks are better governed,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm InGovern.
ICICI has been in the grips of a controversy for months over allegations that Kochhar had favored Videocon (NS:VEDI), a consumer electronics and oil and gas exploration company, in the bank's lending practices. Videocon's founders had an investment in a renewable energy company founded by Kochhar's husband.
Bakhshi, the former head of ICICI's life insurance arm, took the helm of the bank on an interim basis in June, after Kochhar went on leave pending the completion of a probe into the alleged conflict of interest. 
The bank said the ""inquiry instituted by the board will remain unaffected"" by Kochhar's exit, adding that some of her benefits would be subject to the outcome of the probe. 
The board had initially backed Kochhar, calling the nepotism allegations against her ""malicious and unfounded"", but later instituted the probe into the matter in June. 
ICICI shares rallied as much as 5.8 percent after Bakhshi was confirmed as CEO for a five-year term on Thursday. 
""This removes the element of uncertainty and will be positive for the stock,"" R. Sreesankar, co-head, institutional equities at Indian brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher, said. 

Kochhar, 56, had headed ICICI, India's third-largest lender by assets, since May 2009. She is also stepping down from the board of directors of the bank's units, ICICI said.

The CMA said Lloyds had failed to send annual reviews, which have been required by the regulator since 2011, to around 14,000 of its PPI customers. 
The reviews set out how much customers need to pay and their right to cancel the policy. Some of the reviews that were sent by the bank also contained incorrect figures, the CMA said. 
Lloyds, one of the worst offenders in Britain's costliest mis-selling scandal, had already breached a 2011 order by the CMA outlining how PPI providers should operate six times previously. 
""We are disappointed that Lloyds has again failed to provide these important reminders or provide accurate data to its customers,"" Adam Land, the CMA's senior director of remedies, business and financial analysis, said in a statement. 
""These are serious breaches.""
The bank, which has already paid out over 18 billion pounds ($23.37 billion) in compensation over mis-sold PPI and had hoped to have drawn a line under the scandal, said it was writing to affected customers. 
""Whilst we have resolved the cause of the issue, we are extremely sorry for any inconvenience caused,"" a spokesman said in a statement. 
Under the new directions issued by the CMA, Lloyds will need to provide more detailed information on its compliance with the CMA's order, report breaches within 14 days and appoint an independent body to review its compliance systems each year.
It will also have to strengthen its monitoring and take steps to ensure its systems remain robust during migrations.

With the peak holiday shipping season fast-approaching, global package delivery giant FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) is paying retirement-age pilots bonuses of $40,000 - and potentially as much as $110,000 - to keep them flying into next year, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter and a contract seen by Reuters. 
The bonuses, outlined in the latest pilot contract and previously unreported, reveal that a wave of pilot retirements, global pilot shortages and rising cargo demand fueled by the growth of global e-commerce are straining the world's largest air delivery fleet. 
Any problem in maintaining capacity for FedEx, which many economists consider a barometer of U.S. economic strength, disrupts supply chains at a time when they are already being destabilized by international trade tensions.
FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), which is trying to recruit hundreds of pilots this year but is not paying bonuses, play a crucial role in global supply chains from aerospace to retail, particularly during the holidays when average daily delivery volumes can double.
FedEx spokeswoman Bonny Harrison declined to comment on pilot pay or its use of bonuses to manage the timing of retirements. She did point to details of a pilot recruitment campaign it launched publicly in April and said FedEx had about 5,000 aviators on its payroll.
""FedEx Express is well staffed with pilots at this time, however we're always looking toward the future,"" Harrison said.
Two senior FedEx managers familiar with the strategy told Reuters the company offered cash bonuses to retain retiring pilots through the holiday shipping surge that stretches from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in November through year-end. 
FedEx and UPS had record holiday peak business in 2016 and 2017, and plan to hire a total of 155,000 temporary workers for the peak season to help to deliver products bought from retailers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) to consumers' doorsteps. 
The National Retail Federation expects 2018 U.S. holiday retail sales in November and December to increase as much as 4.8 percent to $720.89 billion compared with a year ago. 
FedEx expects to lose about 150-200 of its roughly 5,000 pilots this year - and around the same number annually for the foreseeable future - as more approach age 65, the federally mandated pilot retirement age, one of the sources said.
The FedEx pilot contract seen by Reuters, signed in late 2015, includes a calculation that allows for bonuses of up to $110,000 per pilot. The two sources told Reuters they were aware of pilots collecting bonuses this year of $40,000 to $50,000, though the total number of payouts was unclear. 
These bonuses are calculated based on a portion of a pilot's salary over the 24 months prior to his or her retirement date, the contract says. To get the bonus, a pilot has to provide at least 12 months' notice of the day he or she will retire on Dec. 31 of a given future year.
Flying for FedEx is the highest-paying job among U.S. carriers, with 30-year pilots making roughly $300,000 not counting overtime or bonuses, industry sources said.

'ALREADY FEELING IT'
The bonuses are the latest sign of fallout from a global pilot shortage, which is already squeezing the operations of passenger airlines and now pressuring FedEx as it looks to cash in on the revival of the global air cargo market after a prolonged slump. [L3N1SM1DR]
Each day, roughly a third of global trade by value - or about $17.5 billion worth of products from smartphones and televisions to wine and vaccines - travel by air, according to the International Air Transport Association, a lobby group.
Both FedEx and UPS ordered billions of dollars worth of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co freighters earlier this year in a move to modernize their fleets and meet rising demand. 
Last November, FedEx also ordered 80 new turboprops for its smaller partners - known as ""feeder"" airlines - that carry packages from major facilities like its ""SuperHub"" at Memphis International Airport to smaller cities or rural areas where widebody jets do not fly.
Not having enough pilots means not flying jetliners as often as business plans dictate, or moving more freight by slower or costlier means, like ship or truck. 
Dallas, Texas-based Ameriflight, one such feeder airline for FedEx and UPS, is taking matters into its own hands after its pilot headcount fell this year beneath the number of planes in its fleet.
While trying to recruit new pilots through social media and paid advertising, Ameriflight spokeswoman Jamie Smith said that packed pilot schedules in recent months have forced it, on occasion, to pay for costlier charter flights or reject FedEx cargo. This forces FedEx to find another carrier or send freight by truck, which takes longer.
""(FedEx and UPS) are already feeling it on our end,"" Smith said.
RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGNS
Separate from the pilot bonuses, FedEx launched the ""Purple Runway"" program in April to bulk up its ranks, recruiting college graduates with pilot licenses for jobs with its feeder airlines.
The goal is ""to ensure a full pipeline of pilots for us and the industry at large,"" FedEx Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told an audience in March at Mississippi's Delta State University, the first school in the program. The speech and the program were not reported by national media. 
UPS has a similar recruitment program dubbed ""FlightPath"" and was working to recruit between 200-300 pilots this year, but is so far not paying bonuses, a spokesman said. 
The pilot shortage is worsening as major U.S. trucking firms - including FedEx and UPS fleets - are already grappling with a chronic truck driver shortage that has raised shipping costs and hurt profits across corporate America. 
Trip Miller, Managing Partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital Partners, a long-time FedEx shareholder, said the pilot shortage will hit FedEx hardest in about 3-to-5 years.

""We live in a world where 2-day delivery is becoming much more the norm,"" Miller said. ""The pilot shortage doesn't mean 'we won't be able to get your cargo from point A to point B' – it'll mean 'we can't get your packages there as quickly or, if we do, you're going to pay more.'""

108,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 06:48AM ET</span>","Toyota, SoftBank in first-ever alliance, target self-driving car services","By Naomi Tajitsu and Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) are teaming up to develop self-driving car services, signaling deepening alliances between top automaker and tech firms as the global race to develop autonomous cars intensifies.
Japan's biggest automaker and its most influential tech firm will jointly develop a platform to operate self-driving vehicles which can be used as mobile shops, hospitals and other services as they envision a future in which fewer people drive their own vehicles.
The tie-up shows that even big, well-funded firms want to share costs and expertise in pursuing promising but risky automotive technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance. 
The joint venture will start small with initial capital of 2 billion yen ($17.5 million). SoftBank will own just over half of the business, which will initially focus on Japan and eventually go global. 
""SoftBank alone and automakers alone can't do everything,"" said Junichi Miyakawa, chief technology officer at SoftBank Corp who will be CEO of the new company. ""We want to work to help people with limited access to transportation.""
The partnership will see Toyota and SoftBank work together to develop the automaker's multi-purpose mobility service based on its ""e-Palette"" concept announced earlier this year, in which Toyota plans to produce the hardware and software for convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels. 
The joint company will be called MONET, short for mobility network, and will roll out an autonomous driving service using e-Palette by the second half of the 2020s, the companies said. 
SoftBank will provide technology to collect and analyze transportation data to ensure cars are efficiently dispatched when and where they're needed, they said.
""Toyota is hoping to increase its revenues by combining its own data with the data and expertise which SoftBank has culled from its mobile phone operations,"" said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities. 
""The new company will enable SoftBank to widen its partner network, and it could be hoping to take a lead in developing platforms (for new transport services).""
A slew of automotive technology-related deals and discussions have already resulted in myriad pairings between global automakers, ride-hailing companies and major tech firms.
Honda Motor (T:7267) said on Wednesday it would invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, in which SoftBank is also an investor.
On the same day,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) said they may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services.
NUTS AND BOLTS 
The partnership between the two Japanese companies reflects SoftBank's growing influence in the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, which has been accelerated by its investments via the almost $100 billion Vision Fund. 
It is also a vote of confidence from SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has been critical of Japan for lagging overseas rivals, in Toyota's vision for the future of cars. 
""He has an image of the future,"" Son told a media briefing, referring to Toyota President Akio Toyoda. ""Automobiles are becoming a cluster of semiconductors, not screws, bolts and nuts.""
While both firms have been independently developing technologies for self-driving vehicles and car sharing, and each have investments in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], Grab and Didi Chuxing, this is first time they have come together.
Toyota Executive Vice-president Shigeki Tomoyama said the partnership came after SoftBank's widespread presence in the ride-hailing industry became apparent - it holds major stakes in the ride-hailing firms it had invested in and played a consolidating role in that industry. 
Toyoda joked about rumors that the two companies did not get along, and recalled rejecting a business proposition from Son 20 years ago, when SoftBank had yet to make its name as one of the world's largest technology investors. 

""We are trying to take traditional car making into new fields,"" he told reporters. ""We realized that SoftBank shares the same vision when it comes to the future of cars, so it's time that we partner together.""

Zalando hopes that offering beauty products will help counteract a decline in average order size which has weighed on its profitability, saying that 70 percent of customers who order cosmetics also buy fashion items.
Zalando, founded in Berlin in 2008, ventured into selling branded beauty products for women online in Germany in March, and now offers more than 7,000 products from more than 150 brands. In July, it opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in Berlin, selling beauty products.
From Tuesday, it is adding 1,500 men's skin, body, beard and hair grooming products from 25 brands including House 99 from former soccer star David Beckham and Clarisonic from L'Oreal (PA:OREP).
Zalando said it would also extend the full beauty range to Austria and Poland before Christmas.
Last month, Zalando cut its 2018 outlook for a second time in as many months, saying a long, hot summer had taken its toll, wiping as much as 20 percent off the value of its shares.
The retailer is facing increased competition in the online fashion market from the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN), ASOS (L:ASOS) and traditional retailers like H&M (ST:HMb), which have also been expanding in cosmetics. 

Zalando sees big potential for cosmetics as only 5 percent of beauty sales are currently online compared to about 15 percent for fashion.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>",Danske Bank faces U.S criminal inquiry over suspicious Estonian accounts,"By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) faces a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice over a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch, increasing long-held investor fears. 
Denmark's largest bank said on Thursday that it had ""received requests for information from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in connection with a criminal investigation relating to the bank's Estonian branch"".
The bank, which this week appointed Jesper Nielsen as interim chief executive to handle the crisis in the short term 
after the resignation last month of Thomas Borgen, said it was cooperating with the U.S. authorities.
Shares in Danske Bank fell by three percent to 160 Danish crowns, their lowest level since January 2015 and a 33 percent decline so far this year, as its investors and customers digested the U.S. investigation and the bank's decision to halt a share buyback program to bolster its capital.
The mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen, said the Danish capital was looking into ending its cooperation with Danske Bank as a result of the unfolding scandal. 
Shareholders have fretted for months over the possibility of U.S. authorities investigating whether Danske Bank broke U.S. rules in allowing payments through its Estonian operation because of the potential for significant penalties.
""We think a fine of $6 billion, unlikely in our view given no sanctions/terror violations have been uncovered as yet after investigating high-risk customers, is already reflected in the price,"" Jefferies analyst Kapilan Pillai said in a note. 
France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) reached a record $8.9 billion settlement with U.S. authorities in 2015 to resolve claims that it violated sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.
Many of the non-resident accounts at Denmark's Estonian branch were held by entities or individuals in Russia, which is the subject of U.S. sanctions.
Banks doing business in Estonia handled more than $1 trillion in cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, the country's central bank said on Wednesday.
Sweden's  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) said on Thursday there were ""no ongoing investigations"" into its anti-money laundering practices. Nordea (HE:NDAFI), the Nordic region's biggest bank, also said it is not under investigation over alleged money laundering in the Baltics. 
WIDENING NET 
In a sign of the impact criminal and regulatory investigations in Estonia, Denmark, Britain and now the United States are having on the lender, Danske Bank said it would end its share buybacks after reassessing its capital targets.
It had initially planned to buy shares back worth 10 billion Danish crowns ($1.5 billion) under the program, which should have run until February next year. It had repurchased shares worth 6.8 billion as of the end of last week.
This followed an assessment by Denmark's Financial Services Authority which said Danske Bank's compliance and reputational risks had risen. It did not mention the U.S. inquiry in a 12 page follow-up report published by Danske Bank.
The FSA said in May that Danske Bank's Pillar II capital requirements should rise by 5 billion Danish crowns but has now ordered it to double this to a minimum of 10 billion crowns.
The bank raised its CET1 capital ratio target to around 16 percent from a 14-15 percent target and its total capital ratio to be above 20 percent from an earlier target of above 19 percent.
By end of the second quarter the bank's CET1 ratio stood at 15.9 percent and its total capital ratio stood at 21.6 percent.
""It is a signal from our side that we would rather be on the safe side, rather than being seen on the other side, when it comes to capital,"" Morten Mosegaard, Danske Bank's interim chief financial officer and chief of staff told Reuters.
Last month the bank said in an internal report commissioned by Borgen that payments totaling 200 billion euros, many of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The findings of the report led to Borgen taking ""ultimate responsibility"", although he says he was cleared from a legal point of view, and prompted renewed action by regulators.
The Danish bank's board has asked Denmark's FSA to approve the appointment of its head of wealth management Jacob Aarup-Andersen as its new chief executive, Danish online media Finans reported, citing several unnamed sources. 
The FSA is due to make a decision next week, Finans reported. The FSA and Danske Bank declined to comment.

Politicians in Europe are calling for stricter measures to prevent money laundering after Dutch financial group ING (AS:INGA) was fined 775 million euros last month after admitting criminals had been able to launder cash through its accounts.

115,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Bond Bears Popping Champagne Say U.S. Yields Have Room to Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- A week after Treasuries mysteriously rallied in the wake of the Federal Reserve lifting its long-term interest-rate forecast, short sellers in the $16 trillion market have reason to celebrate.
The bond selloff deepened Thursday after data Wednesday on U.S. private-sector jobs bolstered the case for the Fed to keep raising rates into 2019, sending 10-year notes down the most in more than a year. Thirty-year Treasury yields pushed above the 3.25 percent level that fixed-income veteran Jeffrey Gundlach identified as a “game changer.”
“Solid data releases, higher oil prices and a technical backdrop that suggests there are not a lot of obstacles for yields to continue to push higher will have many wondering how far this new push higher can go,” said Rodrigo Catril, a Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd.
With an American economy in good shape and equity prices flirting with record highs, 10-year yields appear to be breaking out of the range of about 2.8 percent to 3.1 percent that’s lasted for months. Next up on the potential-catalyst list is Friday’s payrolls report, which gets even more focus given the emphasis Fed officials are placing on data.
Short sellers were already positioned for more pain in the Treasury market. Speculative net short positions on 10-year notes climbed to a record, the most recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed. An update to those figures comes Friday.
“In hindsight we wish we were even shorter on U.S. rates,” said Raymond Lee, a fund manager at Kapstream Capital Pty in Sydney. “My view was that U.S. yields were going to go up -- maybe to 3.25 percent -- but I didn’t think it would be this quick.”
Ten-year yields reached as high as 3.23 percent on Thursday, handily above the peak in May, and the highest since 2011. It’s also above where most analysts had expected them to end the year, with the median estimate at 3.10 percent in a Bloomberg survey.
Read our research roundup of U.S. rates strategists’ views
Aside from data, there’s another dynamic at work: the Fed’s accelerating reduction of its balance sheet. It’s now letting $50 billion a month of its bond portfolio run off without replacement. Along with an escalation in U.S. borrowing requirements -- the federal deficit hit $898 billion in the 11 months through August -- that’s a lot more supply to digest.
“That gradual withdrawal of liquidity is causing yields to rise,” Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Tokyo Thursday. “We look for 10-year Treasury yields to hit 3.5 percent at some point -- later this year, early next year -- and I think that’s going to be a real problem for stock markets.”
Others, including Macquarie Group Ltd.’s Viktor Shvets, say ballooning debt levels will keep a lid on yields. “Yields will have to stay very low, primarily because we’re overleveraged,” Shvets, the bank’s head of Asian strategy, told Bloomberg TV in Hong Kong. “There’s just too much debt in the global economy.”
Back on Sept. 19, Gundlach said two closes above 3.25 percent on 30-year bond yields would mark a significant milestone. The Thursday session could be key, for him at least, after the Wednesday close at almost 3.34 percent.
Yields: On the march! 10’s above 3% again, this time without financial media concern. Watch 3.25% on 30’s. Two closes above = game changer.

Another reason yields might trend higher is market-based measures of inflation have been steady for most of this year, according to Greg Gibbs. That suggests investors don’t see inflation exceeding Fed officials’ 2 percent target on average over the next decade, even as commodity prices climb and wage pressures build.
“The fact that they haven’t risen yet may point to further upside risk for yields,” said Gibbs, founder of Amplifying Global FX Capital Pty. in Breckenridge, Colorado, who previously worked on the foreign-exchange desk at Australia’s central bank.
For Bill Gross, dimming demand from foreign investors is adding to the pain as hedging costs rise. At the heart of this phenomenon is the swelling cost to convert payments from euro and yen into dollars.
Read more on why Gross is blaming hedging costs.
Meantime, chart levels may support the bearish view on Treasuries, after yields broke out of their 30-year downtrend. That set off “technical alarm bells” for some investors, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
For Marvin Loh, whose career in finance began in the 1980s when yields topped 15 percent, it’s important to remember that past. “There is still room for higher real yields from a historical perspective,” said Loh, a global strategist at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp. in Boston.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday as defensive stocks came under pressure after strong U.S. data lifted global yields and bolstered expectations for rate hikes in the world's biggest economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index was down 0.6 percent by 0844 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) declined 0.4 percent and the UK's FTSE (FTSE) fell 0.8 percent. 
Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. services sector activity raced to a 21-year high in September, lifting Treasury yields to their highest since mid 2011. That in turn also boosted euro zone government bond yields on Thursday. 
""The Treasury yield is commonly seen as the risk-free rate for investing, so an increase tends to be negative for other asset classes including shares,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 
Defensive companies including consumer and healthcare stocks were the main drag on the STOXX 600. Rising yields make their steady dividend streams less appealing. 
Brighter economic prospects also weighed on the sector, which had been in demand this summer on worries that trade wars could slow global growth.
Shares in big multinationals  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS), Nestle (S:NESN) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) were down between 0.5 and 3.8 percent. 
Utilities (SX6P), which tend to be penalized by rising yields also because of their high level of debt, fell 1.5 percent. 
In contrast, financials tend to benefit from rising rates and bond yields, which help banks earn fatter margins on their traditional lending business. 
German lenders Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) rose 1.9 and 1.5 percent respectively, as German 10-year bond yields hit a 4-1/2 month high. 
Italian banks were choppy as investors monitored developments in Rome, where the government is trying to finalize budget details after clashing with the EU over its deficit targets. 
After opening lower, the Italian banking index (FTIT8300) turned higher and rose 0.9 percent.
 Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) fell 3.6 percent after news it was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over a 200 billion euro money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch.
""They are a perfect example of how regulators come down hard on banks who appear to have broken the rules,"" said Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets.

Among top movers on the STOXX was Danish maker of diagnostic devices Ambu (CO:AMBUb), which fell 6.6 percent after a strategy update, while British pharmaceutical firm BTG (L:BTG) rose 6.4 percent after it upgraded its sales forecast.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 05:08AM ET</span>","Nissan, RBS join chorus of warnings over disorderly Brexit","By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Nissan (T:7201) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (L:RBS) have became the latest companies to warn about damage to the economy if Britain fails to secure a trade deal before leaving the European Union.
Less than six months before Britain is due to exit the bloc, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a proposal for economic ties that pleases EU negotiators and both sides of her divided Conservative party.
The government has stepped up planning for a so-called no-deal Brexit when the world's fifth-largest economy leaves the EU on March 29, 2019, a step that could spook financial markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond.
Nissan, which operates the country's largest automotive factory, said leaving without a deal would have ""serious implications"" for Britain's manufacturing industry.
In the two years since the Brexit vote, Nissan has been restrained in public about the referendum. But its warning now shows the growing alarm among business executives. 
""Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like,"" Nissan said in a statement.
""We urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade,"" the company said.
BREXIT UNCERTAINTY
RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said Britain's economy might fall into recession without a deal.
McEwan said companies were scaling back investment due to the uncertainty and RBS was more cautious about lending to the retail and construction industries in particular as Brexit approached.
""Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I'll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it's really bad I'll invest elsewhere - that's the reality of where we are today,"" McEwan told the BBC.
If Britain fails to agree a deal with the EU then the country would move from seamless trade with the world's largest trading bloc to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals. 
Britain's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said last month that tariffs of 10 percent under WTO rules would add an average of 3,000 euros ($3,445) to the cost of British-built cars sold in the EU if fully passed on to buyers.
Carmakers are worried that port and road delays could slow the movement of finished cars and parts, crippling output and adding costs, if Britain fails to reach an agreement.
Nissan said in 2016 it would build its next generation Qashqai SUV and a new X-Trail model at its Sunderland plant in northern England, a major boost to the government just a few months after Britain voted to leave the EU.
A source told Reuters that the company had received a letter from the government promising Nissan extra support if Britain's departure from the EU hit the competitiveness of the plant.
Japan's ambassador to the Britain, Koji Tsuruoka, also issued a blunt warning to the government after meeting British ministers in February.
""If there is no profitability of continuing operation in the UK - not Japanese only - no private company can continue operation ...It's as simple as that,"" he said.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 04:16AM ET</span>",Honda to invest $2.75 billion in GM's self-driving car unit,"By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
WARREN, Mich (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) will invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, to jointly develop autonomous vehicles for deployment in ride services fleets around the world.
This comes months after Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984) made a multibillion-dollar commitment to Cruise. That puts Cruise in a league with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo unit in terms of resources and aggressive plans to launch commercial services.
Honda has also been in talks with Waymo about a possible collaboration for two years. While no deal has been announced, an agreement between the two to discuss integrating Waymo's self-driving technology into Honda vehicles still stands, a spokeswoman for the automaker told Reuters.
Honda, which has lagged many of its rivals in developing self-driving vehicles, is paying $750 million upfront for the equity stake in GM's Cruise and will contribute another $2 billion over 12 years in development work and fees, the companies said on Wednesday.
The deal calls for Honda to provide engineering expertise, and extends cooperation between the pair in a technology that has enormous costs and risk but no market-ready products.
Other global automakers are forging similar alliances to share the uncertainty and huge price of developing technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance.
Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and SoftBank said on Thursday they were teaming up to develop car services that rely on self-driving technology.
In May, SoftBank said it would buy stakes in Cruise totaling 19.6 percent for $2.25 billion.
Where SoftBank is primarily a financial partner, ""we view Honda as a strategic investor"", sharing in vehicle, systems and business development with GM, RBC analyst Joseph Spak wrote in an investor note.
In a blog post early Wednesday, Cruise Chief Executive and co-founder Kyle Vogt joked: ""Honda is joining the party. They’re bringing chips, dip, and $2.75 billion.""
Vogt told Reuters that Cruise and Honda would design a vehicle intended to be autonomous rather than the modified sedan with a steering wheel and driver controls that it is working on.
""We're still shooting for 2019 to have the first version or first wave of vehicles that come out on our own platform. This is what comes after that,"" he said.
2019 REMAINS THE GOAL
Honda's investment boosts the value of Cruise to $14.6 billion, about a third of GM's $48 billion market cap. GM acquired the San Francisco-based startup in March 2016 for a reported $1 billion.
By comparison, analysts have pegged the value of Waymo as high as $175 billion.
In a media briefing on Wednesday, GM President Dan Ammann said 2019 ""remains the goal"" for GM Cruise to launch a self-driving ride services fleet.
He added: ""The longstanding relationship we have with Honda will allow us to move very quickly in ramping up our efforts.""
GM shares closed up 2 percent on Wednesday. Honda shares were little changed on Thursday.
In January, GM filed a petition seeking U.S. approval for a fully self-driving car, one without a steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal, to enter the automaker's first commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019.
Ammann declined on Wednesday to provide a more specific timeline for the vehicle.
GM has been ""very selective"" in its approach to investors in Cruise and ""we will evaluate other investment opportunities as they come along"", he said.
Ammann later told analysts: ""We're moving as quickly as we can to get to the point where we can initially deploy the technology and then scale it ... This is an effort that requires very, very significant resources to pull off.""
Ammann said Honda will contribute its engineering know-how and will help GM Cruise build a global ride services business.
Honda executive Seiji Kuraishi said: ""This investment is based on a shared vision and their (GM's and Cruise's) superior technologies in this area.""
GM Cruise has a test fleet of more than 100 self-driving versions of the Chevrolet Bolt, rebadged as Cruise AV.
GM CEO Mary Barra said the automaker is still focused on testing self-driving vehicles in San Francisco before expanding to other markets.
RUSH FOR TIE-UPS
GM Cruise and Waymo are often described as leading the pack of technology and auto companies competing to create self-driving cars and integrate them into ride services fleets.
Waymo has agreements with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] to buy and equip tens of thousands of vehicles with its self-driving systems.
Other automakers are exploring similar tie-ups to help mitigate risk and cost, according to Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs, who said the GM-Honda deal ""demonstrates that global partnerships like these ... are necessary to take on these expensive ventures that likely will not return a profit in the near term.""
BMW (DE:BMWG), which has a development partnership with suppliers  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Aptiv PLC (N:APTV) and Magna International (TO:MG), expects some rivals and ride services companies to join its consortium for developing self-driving cars as auto industry profits come under increasing pressure, board member Klaus Froehlich said on Tuesday.
At the Paris Auto Show on Wednesday, the heads of  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) said the two companies may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services.

The GM-Honda announcement extends a partnership that includes joint development of electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020. In June, Honda also said it would buy advanced batteries from GM in a move that could significantly reduce the cost of future electric vehicles at both automakers after 2020.

The changes to overall asset allocation involved boosting government bonds to a 1 percent active weight from minus 2 percent last month, and cutting corporate bonds to a minus 8 percent weight from a prior minus 5 percent.
“A decent credit underweight as a macro hedge against our still bullish asset allocation stance” is warranted, especially given risks from Italian political stress and the U.S. tariffs on China, strategists led by John Normand wrote in a note Wednesday. “Credit spreads have tightened significantly since the beginning of September so we believe the entry point is currently attractive for re-entering a significant credit underweight.”
The strategists augmented the macro hedge with more local ideas, such as EUR/CNH risk reversals and an overweight in health care versus financials in emerging-market equities to protect the model portfolio against potential fallout from a U.S.-China trade war. They also suggest guarding against Italian and Brexit risks via an underweight positive in European equities versus emerging-market and U.S. stocks.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Italian banks face twin challenges of capital and funding,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - A spike in Italy's bond yields has put the country's banks under renewed pressure, raising the specter of capital shortfalls just as challenging refinancing deadlines near.
Domestic government bonds account for 10 percent of Italian banks' total assets, making them vulnerable to a rise in Rome's debt costs under the anti-austerity government.
Caught in the bank-sovereign ""doom loop,"" Italian banks replaced fleeing foreign investors during the euro zone debt crisis of 2011-2012, buying up Italy's bonds. They similarly stepped up purchases of domestic debt in May and June during a market sell-off of Italian assets, before lowering them in August as prices steadied.
But as the yield premium Italian bonds pay over safer German Bunds rose, banks lost on average 40 basis points of their core capital in the second quarter and another 8 bps in the third, analysts say. 
When the new coalition's spending plans first emerged in mid-May, the Italian-German spread was just 130 bps. It climbed above 300 bps this week after the government unveiled deficit goals that increase the borrowing needs of a country that has the world's third-largest public debt pile.
An increase to 400 bps would force some lenders to tap investors for cash, the head of the Italian traders' association Assiom Forex, Luigi Belluti, warned last week. 
Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) was among the worst-hit in the second quarter, losing precious capital it needs for a bad loan clean-up. Capital erosion also complicates turnaround efforts at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), bailed out by the state last year.
REGULATORY PRESSURE?
Italian banks have been restructuring in recent years, raising capital to fund disposals of bad debt and cutting costs. But loan losses and negative interest rates hurt earnings and mean returns do not cover their cost of equity.
Market stress is meanwhile driving up the cost of funding.
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), one of Italy's strongest banks, in March paid 1.83 percent to issue a 10-year bond  that traded on Wednesday at 3.12 percent.
Intesa is the only lender to have raised unsecured funds since the May turmoil, selling five-year debt at a hefty 2.15 percent in August.
Traders say the market has now frozen up again. 
That is an issue for banks such as Monte dei Paschi and Carige (MI:CRGI) which need to replenish their second-tier capital with hybrid debt, and could become a problem across the sector if the hiatus is prolonged. 
With 240 billion euros in cheap longer-term funds from the European Central Bank, of which they have been the biggest takers, Italian banks have no immediate liquidity concerns.
They have not suffered deposit flights and could easily continue to shield their net interest income and get to the end of the year without selling bonds.
But market access is crucial.
""If the dearth of wholesale issues we're currently observing were to last for another three to six months it would become a real problem: regulators want banks to be able to tap markets whenever they need to,"" said Francesco Castelli, head of fixed income at Banor Capital.
Italian banks had an average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) -- one of two key liquidity indicators monitored by supervisors -- of 171 percent at end-2017, well above the required 100 percent, according to the Bank of Italy.
The LCR ratio measures assets a bank can promptly sell for cash and suffers if rising interest rates erode their value. 
Larger-than-average liquidity buffers may reflect regulatory pressure, Castelli said, adding supervisors would probably want banks to keep those reserves intact when they start replacing ECB funds with regular debt.
SHARING THE PAIN
Refinancing needs will become more pressing next year.
Starting from mid-2019 Italian banks will have to exclude from their net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the second key liquidity indicator monitored by regulators, 140 billion euros in longer-term loans that mature in June 2020.
Even before the latest flare-up in Italian yields, rating agency Moody's warned that Italian banks would see funding costs rise as they repaid those ECB funds, pressuring earnings.
Italian banks must also refinance by 2020 roughly half of 267 billion euros in bonds they had outstanding in February.
They have traditionally relied on customers to buy debt but stricter financial rules introduced after the global crisis of 2007-2008 and tax changes in Italy since 2012 now make retail funding more difficult. 
In a further funding challenge, banks will have to comply with new European rules on debt and capital that can be wiped out to absorb potential losses.
""There is a phase-in period from January 2019, but if they don't start issuing efficiently next year banks might face difficulties meeting the requirements,"" said Cristiano Tommasi, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy. 
UniCredit (MI:CRDI), which has specific such requirements as Italy's sole globally systemically important bank, has so far met only around one third of its 2018 funding plan.
Lenders have passed onto customers only one-fifth of a 100 basis point increase in yield premiums, but they may soon have to share more of their pain with borrowers. 
""If bond spreads keep rising, sooner or later we'll have to increase lending costs,"" a senior Italian bank executive said.

133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 11:21PM ET</span>",Powell Says Fed May Lift Rates to Levels That Restrain Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve may eventually raise interest rates to levels where they begin to restrain economic growth though that’s still some ways off, Chairman Jerome Powell said.
“Interest rates are still accommodative, but we’re gradually moving to a place where they’ll be neutral,” neither holding back nor spurring growth, Powell said Wednesday at an event in Washington hosted by The Atlantic magazine and the Aspen Institute. “We may go past neutral. But we’re a long way from neutral at this point, probably,” he added.
The central bank raised rates last week for the third time this year, lifting its target range to 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Since then, stock prices have flirted with fresh record highs and the yield on 10-year Treasuries has reached the highest since 2011.
Fed policy makers peg the long-run neutral rate at 3 percent, according to the median projection of officials released after last week’s meeting. An updated dot plot of their interest rate forecasts shows them raising rates slightly above that level by the end of next year.
“The practical way we can navigate between moving too fast and moving too slow is to move gradually,” Powell said.
In his fourth public speaking engagement in a week, Powell repeated his upbeat assessment of the economy a day after drawing attention to the “extraordinary times” the U.S. is experiencing with low, steady inflation alongside very low unemployment.
The U.S. is experiencing “a remarkably positive set of economic circumstances, and we’re working hard to try to sustain the expansion and keep unemployment low and keep inflation right on target,” he said Wednesday. “There’s really no reason to think that this cycle can’t continue for quite some time.”
Asked what keeps him up at night, Powell said “basically everything. Nobody wants a central banker who sleeps well.”
While the Fed doesn’t detect a buildup of financial instability now, the next crisis is likely to be sparked by something different than the financial meltdown a decade ago, he said. A cyber attack “or some sort of global event” are potential triggers, he said, adding “the world is full of risks.”
Several other Fed officials spoke earlier Wednesday, each offering support for additional interest-rate increases, though differing on the need for another hike this year.

That’s the forecast by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) economists led by Helen Qiao, showing how manufacturing powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan will be caught up in the U.S. and China trade war.
Even countries less exposed to China’s supply chain, such as Australia and India, will feel the brunt given the uncertain sentiment among businesses and consumers, Qiao wrote in a note.
China’s $12 trillion economy will now likely slow to 6.1 percent in 2019 from an originally expected 6.4 percent, according to BAML. It forecasts growth of 5.4 percent for the Asia Pacific region as a whole next year, down from its original outlook for 5.7 percent.
That matters because the Asia Pacific region accounts for more than 60 percent of global growth, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is due to release fresh forecasts next week and Managing Director Christine Lagarde has already warned of materializing economic risks.
Critically, Asia’s policy response will face limitations. That’s because ongoing interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve means there’s less scope for central banks to ease policy.
They face a choice of raising rates to support their currencies and keep pace with the Fed, or lower rates to stoke growth -- and the risks that come with that.
""Unlike China, most APAC countries have limited room to ease on the monetary side as the U.S. continues to tighten,"" the BAML economists wrote.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Britain says Russian military intelligence behind host of global cyber attacks,"By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain accused Russian military intelligence on Thursday of directing a host of cyber attacks aimed at undermining Western democracies by sowing confusion in everything from sport to transport and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
In a British assessment based on work by its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Russian military intelligence (GRU) was cast as a pernicious cyber aggressor which used a network of hackers to spread discord across the world.
GRU, Britain said, was almost certainly behind the BadRabbit and World Anti-Doping Agency attacks of 2017, the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the theft of emails from a UK-based TV station in 2015.
""The GRU’s actions are reckless and indiscriminate: they try to undermine and interfere in elections in other countries,"" said British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
""Our message is clear - together with our allies, we will expose and respond to the GRU’s attempts to undermine international stability,"" Hunt said. Britain believes the Russian government is responsible for the attacks.
Though less well known than the Soviet Union's once mighty KGB, Russia's military intelligence service played a major role in some of the biggest events of the past century, from the Cuban missile crisis to the annexation of Crimea.
RUSSIAN CYBER POWER?
Though commonly known by the acronym GRU, which stands for the Main Intelligence Directorate, its name was formally changed in 2010 to the Main Directorate of the General Staff (or just GU). Its old acronym - GRU - is still more widely used.
It has agents across the globe and answers directly to the chief of the general staff and the Russian defense minister. The GRU does not comment publicly on its actions. Its structure, staff numbers and financing are Russian state secrets.
The GRU traces its history back to the times of Ivan the Terrible, though it was founded as the Registration Directorate in 1918 after the Bolshevik Revolution. Vladimir Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has said GRU officers used a nerve agent to try to kill former double agent Sergei Skripal, who was found unconscious in the English city of Salisbury in March. Russia has repeatedly denied the charges.
After the Skripal poisoning, the West agreed with Britain's assessment that Russian military intelligence was to blame and launched the biggest expulsion of Russian spies working under diplomatic cover since the height of the Cold War.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB spy, said on Wednesday that Skripal, a GRU officer who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 foreign spy service, was a ""scumbag"" who had betrayed Russia.
Britain said the GRU was associated with a host of hackers including APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Pawnstorm, Sednit, CyberCaliphate, Cyber Berkut, Voodoo Bear and BlackEnergy Actors.
""This pattern of behavior demonstrates their desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences,"" Foreign Secretary Hunt said.
The United States sanctioned GRU officers including its chief, Igor Korobov, in 2016 and 2018 for attempted interference in the 2016 U.S. election and cyber attacks.

""Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a Russian military intelligence organization, knowingly engages in significant activities that undermine cybersecurity on behalf of the Russian government,"" the U.S. Treasury said in March.

The action was taken against Favale, who is a senior vice president of talent for CBS Television Studios, after CNN reported on allegations made by nine unnamed sources on Wednesday.
""I'll never forget the day he told me he got four erections while watching Jennifer Hudson rehearse,"" a female former CBS executive told CNN.
Favale was a senior programing executive on the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" and ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""
“The comments reported in this (CNN) story are offensive and not consistent with the standards we expect from our executives or the culture we want at CBS,"" CBS said in an emailed statement. 
""The network investigated a complaint for inappropriate language that was received in January 2016, and corrective action was taken,"" CBS said. ""However, since concerned voices are speaking up nearly three years later, additional review is warranted.  Mr. Favale has been placed on leave while we look into this situation further.”
Favale was not immediately reachable for comment to Reuters, but in a statement to CNN, he said ""Allegations that I have ever retaliated against anyone in any fashion are 100 percent false.""
""I have spent my entire career working at comedy shows, where there has always been a wide latitude to make transgressive jokes while preparing the program. While we make a lot of jokes, these jokes attributed to me, whether said in rehearsals or production meetings, are being taken out of context and were not said in the way being presented here,"" he said.
FOLLOWS MOONVES DEPARTURE
The latest report comes weeks after Leslie Moonves stepped down as Chairman and Chief Executive of CBS following a series of allegations of sexual harassment and assault from 12 women documented in two investigations by the New Yorker magazine in July and September this year.
An investigation by two law firms hired by an independent committee in CBS's board of Moonves continues. 
At stake is a $120 million severance payment to Moonves that could be withdrawn if the board decides Moonves could be fired for cause.
One CBS employee told CNN that she was excluded from meetings after complaining about Favale's inappropriate language. The employee eventually left the company.
One person familiar with the complaints against Favale told Reuters Favale was warned about his behavior in 2016 and the company had received no other similar complaints about his conduct before or since then.

Current and former CBS employees said Favale's remarks span 2015 to 2018.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Barnes & Noble opts for strategic review after takeover interest,"(Reuters) - Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) Inc said on Wednesday it would explore strategic options after several parties, including founder-chairman Leonard Riggio, showed interest to buy the bookseller, sending its shares up as much as 24 percent in extended trading.
The No.1 U.S. book store chain also adopted a plan to thwart any hostile bid after it found a rapid accumulation of stocks by parties that the company said it could not identify.
The plan would prevent any party from accumulating 20 percent or more of its common shares by automatically offering preferred shares at a 50 percent discount to other shareholders.
Riggio, who holds the largest stake of 19.24 percent according to Refinitiv data, has committed to vote in favor of any transaction recommended by the special committee formed to review strategic options, the company said.
The New-York based company has been struggling with declining sales for years as consumers increasingly move online. Even the company's Nook e-book reader has been largely overshadowed by Amazon's Kindle and other tablets.
Nearly a month ago, investor Richard Schottenfeld disclosed a higher stake of 6.9 percent in the bookseller and said he had discussed with Riggio about a possible sale.
Schottenfeld sees better business from the bookseller's 629 stores by moving away from music and DVD sales to high-margin toys and games ahead of the holiday season and in the wake of Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy, a filing in August showed.
Schottenfeld did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Guggenheim Securities LLC acted as financial adviser and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP was its legal adviser.

The company's shares were up 22 percent at $6.65 in after-market trading.

159,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 04:28PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Layoffs, Jobless Claims Data on Tap
Following today’s better-than-expected payroll numbers from ADP, the market moves on to the second round of employment data before the final official September jobs report.
At 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), employment services firm Challenger release its figures on September jobs cuts. Layoffs came in at 38,500 in August.
Initial jobless claims arrive, as always, at 8:30 AM ET.
On average, economists expect that weekly claims for first-time unemployment benefits edged down to 211,000 from the week before.
Financial stocks propelled the overall market today. The strong jobs numbers and a better-than-expected ISM services number pushed the 10-year yield up to levels not seen since 2011, helping banks.
2. More Fodder for Fed Heads
Fed speak continues as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Randal Quarles will be heading to Capitol Hill.
Quarles will speak at the Senate Banking Committee on ""Implementation of the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act.""
He’ll start speaking around 9:15 AM ET.
With yields bouncing higher today, the chance of a Fed rate hike in December rose close to 80%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
There will also be factory orders numbers for August coming at 10:00 AM ET. Economists are predicting a rise of 2.1%, compared with a drop in July.
3. Does Constellation Brands Have More Cannabis News?
In earnings reports tomorrow, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), the maker of Corona beer, will release numbers before the bell.
Analysts are forecasting a profit of $2.61 per share on sales of about $2.25 billion. But beyond the numbers, investors will be looking to see if there are any more details about its investment in the cannabis sector.
The beverage company sparked the huge rally in cannabis stocks when it announced a further investment in  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) and more details of plans could spur more speculation of deals in the sector.
After the bell, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) will report its latest earnings.
On average, analysts predict the company will earn $2.36 per share on sales of about $44 billion.
While slow and steady growth has been the name of the game for the stock, any signs of when it could issue another special dividend would be welcome news to investors."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. holiday sales in 2018 will increase 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent boosted by a strong economy but will be slower than a year ago when consumer spending surged to a 12-year high, according to a forecast from a leading retail industry group.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) said holiday sales growth will be higher than an average increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years but slower than the 5.3 percent growth witnessed a year earlier when consumer spending grew the most since 2005 and was boosted by tax cuts. 
""Last year's strong results were thanks to growing wages, stronger employment and higher confidence, complemented by anticipation of tax cuts that led consumers to spend more than expected,” NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said. 
""With this year's forecast, we continue to see strong momentum from consumers as they do the heavy lifting in supporting our economy,"" he said.
The combination of more jobs, improved wages, tamed inflation and an increase in net worth all provide the impetus to spend, he added.
The trade body also said there are continued concerns about an escalating trade war with China but it is optimistic about consumers' propensity to spend.
The retail trade group said it expects sales for the last two months of the year between $717.45 billion and $720.89 billion, excluding autos, gasoline and dining out. Holiday sales in 2017 were $687.87 billion. 
NRF's forecast is one of the most closely watched benchmarks ahead of the holiday season, when retailers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Stores Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) generate an outsized portion of their profits and sales.
The last two months of the year can account for 20 percent to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers.
The NRF forecast follows other estimates from companies like AlixPartners, which says sales will grow in between 3.1 percent and 4.1 percent as ""2017 will be a tough year to follow."" Forecasts from companies like Deloitte and PwC expect holiday retail sales to grow around 5 percent. 

NRF also said Wednesday that it expects seasonal employment by retailers to reach between 585,000 and 650,000 jobs, up from 582,500 in 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a record high for a second day after economic data boosted Treasury yields and lifted financial stocks. 
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls jumped by 230,000 jobs in September, the largest gain since February, while a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed services sector activity hit a 21-year high in September. 
The data helped yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) hit its highest level in over seven years at 3.179 percent and the two-year yield (US2YT=RR) touched its highest level in more than a decade as expectations for a rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve in December firmed.
The rise in yields helped boost financials, which in turn put the S&P 500 within striking distance of a record. Financials were also aided by signs Italy would cut its budget deficit and lower its debt in the coming years, easing a concern that had pressured global stock markets.
Financials (SPSY), which have underperformed the broader market this year, rose 0.78 percent, on track for their best day since Sept. 20. 
""Yesterday you saw Treasuries rally based on a little bit of that fear from overseas but now you are seeing that balloon popping to go along with the numbers we have here,"" said Mark Kepner, equity trader at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. 
""The employment data was quite strong, the ADP report, that was definitely high on everybody’s radar as to what it is going to be on Friday."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 56.05 points, or 0.21 percent, to 26,829.99, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.35 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,924.78 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 24.19 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,023.74.
Traders now see a 78.8 percent chance of a 25 basis point hike at the December meeting of the Fed, up from 77.4 percent a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool. 
Utilities (SPLRCU), off 1.80 percent and real estate <.SPLRCR>, down 1.61, were leading the decliners, as higher bond yields made shares of high-dividend paying companies less attractive.
Major indexes had begun to lose steam heading into the latter stages of trading, however, and were well off their session highs. 
General Motors (N:GM) rose 2.4 percent after Honda Motor (T:7267) said it would invest $2 billion over 12 years in the U.S. carmaker's Cruise self-driving unit.
Michael Kors (N:KORS) rose 3.1 percent after Citi upgraded the stock on expectations its recent purchase of Italian fashion house Versace would boost performance. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.72-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The expansion of Dubai's second airport, Al Maktoum International, to handle 120 million passengers a year by 2025 has been delayed, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
The airport, which opened to passenger traffic in 2013, aims to be one of the worlds' biggest, but now only handles a fraction of Dubai's passenger traffic.
Five sources told Reuters that the expansion had been delayed. They did not say why it was delayed or for how long. Two of the sources said the project was being redesigned.
Dubai secured a $3 billion loan last year to develop the airport, which is named after Dubai's ruling family.
That loan has yet to be used, said one source. The second stage of financing, which was to be backed by foreign credit agencies, has been delayed indefinitely, two sources said.
State-owned Dubai Airports declined to comment directly on the delay. It said its aim was to ""continuously"" update masterplans for Al Maktoum International and main airport Dubai International ""to embrace the latest thinking in technology, processes and customer-friendly service design principles"".
Dubai's Department of Finance, which raised the $3 billion loan last year in a consortium, declined to comment.
The capacity expansion was supposed to pave the way for it to replace Dubai International, currently the world's busiest for international travelers, and to become the new base of airline Emirates.
Al Maktoum International has already faced delays. A smaller capacity increase is a year behind schedule and is expected to be finished this year. 
Dubai expects to spend around $36 billion on the Al Maktoum International project and the Dubai World Central aviation complex where it is located. 
The airport is being built in phases and is expected to eventually handle more than 200 million passengers year, more than twice the current capacity of primary airport Dubai International where Emirates is based.
No timeline for the Al Maktoum airport target has been announced.
Dubai Airports said in 2016 it was expanding Dubai International to handle 118 million passengers a year by 2023, 18 million more than its initial cap in case the development of Al Maktoum International was delayed.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Merger talks started in spring between Canadian oil companies Husky, MEG","By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian oil companies  Husky Energy Inc  (TO:HSE) and  MEG Energy Corp  (TO:MEG) discussed a possible merger for months, and one major MEG shareholder expressed interest early, before Husky was rebuffed and launched a hostile bid this week, according to a Husky filing. 
Husky, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing, announced on Sunday a cash-and-stock offer for MEG in a deal valued at C$6.4 billion ($4.99 billion). MEG, whose investors include Chinese state-owned oil producer CNOOC Ltd (HK:0883), said it would evaluate the offer.
The timeline, laid out in Husky's 114-page shareholder circular issued late on Tuesday, shows that MEG faced investor pressure to sell before talks fizzled with MEG's hiring of Chief Executive Derek Evans.
MEG is under pressure from large debt and a deep discount on Western Canadian heavy crude due to transportation constraints that has hampered any rebound in Canada's oilpatch.
Discussions started May 9, Husky's filing showed, when Husky CEO Rob Peabody invited MEG Chairman Jeff McCaig to a meeting where they discussed a combination.
On May 31, Peabody met with Dan Farb, a MEG director and partner with Highfields Capital, which owned 9.9 percent of MEG. Farb told Peabody he was open to a sale if it included a ""significant premium"" for MEG investors, the filing said.
The next day, Peabody met again with McCaig and MEG interim CEO Harvey Doerr, and told them Husky intended to pursue a combination, preferably with MEG's cooperation.
McCaig sent an email to Peabody on June 18, advising Husky that MEG would not disclose non-public information about MEG, and suggested that any written proposal should be sent to him.
By July 24, Farb was fed up with MEG and quit the board after only eight months, saying it failed to put the interests of the company and shareholders first.
Husky's pursuit of MEG continued, though. On Aug. 8, Peabody sent McCaig a written proposal to buy MEG for C$11 per share. McCaig said he would respond, but later that day, MEG hired Evans, an experienced oil executive, as CEO.
The discussions ground to a halt after Peabody and a Husky senior vice-president met on Aug. 20 with McCaig and another MEG director. MEG refused the offer.
Peabody left the meeting believing MEG ""would not be open for further discussions,"" the filing said.
Highfields did not immediately respond to a request for comment. MEG declined to comment.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Eyes on the Prize: First jobs of famous photographers,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A photograph can capture the mood of a nation or seminal moments in history in a single frame.
Think of the image of an unarmed African-American woman in a flowing dress standing in front of two officers in riot gear at a 2016 Black Lives Matter rally in Louisiana, or the lone protester in front of tanks in Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in China in 1989. 
The people behind the lens have invariably worked hard to get there. For the latest in Reuters’ First Jobs series, we talked to well-known photographers about what they learned from their humble beginnings.
Joe McNally
Photographer for National Geographic, LIFE, Sports Illustrated (https://portfolio.joemcnally.com/index)
First job: Busboy
I worked at a place called B. Altman & Co, an elegant store which had a reputation for catering to a high-class crowd. At the White Plains, New York branch they had a coffee shop and restaurant known as the Charleston Gardens, and I worked as a busboy and dishwasher there on Thursday nights and weekends.
It was hard work, and a true education. Back in the day it was always an interesting crew working in the back of restaurants - real characters and roustabouts, many with substance-abuse problems. Hauling tubs of filthy dishes around and scrubbing them was never fun and never easy, but that's the restaurant business.
I made minimum wage, around $3 an hour, and tried to put away money for college - or for possible dates, even though I never managed to get any. It was extremely hard work, but I had no qualms about it, and I liked getting a paycheck. One important lesson I took away: Never mix a vat of coleslaw when you have band-aids on your fingers. They tend to come off somewhere in the coleslaw.
Pete Souza
Former Chief Official White House photographer, author ""Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents” (https://www.petesouza.com/)
First job: Delivery boy
I delivered newspapers for the New Bedford Standard-Times in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. My older cousin gave up his paper route, and asked if I could do it. My mom thought it was too much work for a 10-year-old, because we lived way outside of town and I rode my bike, so it was basically a two-hour job every day. Plus I had asthma.
I got a percentage of each paper, which was not very much, and spent it on sports magazines and penny candy. The cool thing was that every summer, the newspaper ran competitions to see who could increase the number of subscriptions the most. Since my area had a bunch of summer houses, I would win the competition every year. Once I won tickets to see the football team, then called the Boston Patriots, who actually played that season in Fenway Park.
What I took away from that job was the work ethic, responsibility, consistency. You couldn't take days off, no matter how you were feeling. I also remember the customers who never paid me. I would just eat that money, because I was too shy to go and knock on their doors.
Bruce Weber
Fashion photographer (https://www.bruceweber.com/)
First job: Menswear photographer
Back in the early '70s I decided I wanted to go into photography, and started photographing people at a loft I had down in Manhattan's Little Italy. I showed my work to Menswear magazine, which was published by Fairchild, and they gave me a job shooting their spring and summer fashions.
I didn't have anything or anybody: No hairdresser, no makeup artist, no stylist, no assistant. All I had were two Nikon bodies, three lenses and my favorite light meter. The model agency sent a gentleman called Mike Edwards, who looked a lot like James Dean. I didn't even have a car to look for locations, but thankfully Mike had a '57 Chevy Bel Air convertible with turquoise trim.
I didn't have money to book places, either, but it turned out Mike's dad owned the pink palace that was the Beverly Hills Hotel. I was almost kicking myself at how lucky I was. Eventually Mike moved in with Priscilla Presley, and we used to have great evenings together talking about Elvis. He later wrote in a book that one of the best times of his life was being photographed in that Chevy Bel Air.
The lesson I learned from all that is, even if your heart is beating really fast, if you are doing what you love, you just have to jump in that pool and swim.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Hedge fund Olympic Peak plans to short AT&T bonds,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Olympic Peak Management's founding partner said on Wednesday he planned to short AT&T's debt when the fund launches in January, citing increasing competition and high leverage that may ultimately lead to a credit ratings downgrade.
Todd Westhus told the Sohn Conference in Tel Aviv that the telecoms giant's debt was misperceived as risk free while its main businesses and fundamentals were weakening, even as the U.S. economy grows.
The company benefits today from an unsustainable price premium relative to T-Mobile and its business and consumer wireline operations are losing market share, he said.
Westhus said potential negative catalysts for the bonds were a ratings downgrade from an investment grade 'BBB/Bb2' to high yield, a dividend cut, acquisitions that would leverage its balance sheet, and a recession.
A spokesperson for AT&T (NYSE:T) said the company had a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (core earnings) ratio of 2.9 times as of the second quarter and continued to expect the ratio to be in the 2.5 times range by the end of 2019. 
""AT&T continues to expect to return to historical debt levels by the end of 2022,"" the spokesperson said. ""AT&T will use cash after dividend payments to pay down debt.""
Westhus formerly worked at Perry Capital, which was shut in September 2016 after almost 28 years. 
He has $300 million in anchor capital from investors including the co-founders of Perry, Richard Perry and Paul Leff, and Marc Lasry from Avenue.

""We are continuing to raise money into our launch on January 1, 2019 and will close the fund at $750 million,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.

192,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>","Now's the time to buy Italian bonds, says this $2.4 trillion wealth manager","Amid the market panic surrounding Italy over the last week, the chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management says now's the time to buy. 
It's a contrarian call: ""We are opening an overweight position in two-year Italian government bonds versus cash,"" Mark Haefele, who works at the $2.4 trillion wealth management arm of the Swiss banking giant, said on Wednesday. ""The recent sell-off presents investors with an attractive opportunity."" Fears had been mounting in Italy over the brewing budget crisis, which could set the country and its leadership on a collision course with the European Union over excessive spending. Bond yields soared -- the country's benchmark 10-year bond is near its highest level since 2014.
Rising yields correspond with falling prices for bonds, and according to one of the world's most prominent wealth management firms, those falling prices represent a opportunistic way in. 
Here's Haefele's reasoning: 
""While we believe that Italy's credit rating is likely to be downgraded by one notch, the country is likely to retain an investment grade rating for at least the next 12 months, and we believe there is only a very low probability that Italy will default within the next two years. Just 13% of the government's bonds need to be rolled over by the end of 2019, so higher yields only gradually increase the cost of debt.""
Still, Haefele urges caution. He warns against investing in longer-dated Italian debt, while saying investors should not concentrate their portfolios on Italian bonds.
""There are risks associated with the position,"" he said. ""Italian yields could be pushed higher by escalating tensions between Italy and the European Commission, a breakdown of the current Italian coalition, or the departure of Finance Minister Giovanni Tria."""
193,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 09:48AM ET</span>",Some Tesla board members reportedly want James Murdoch to take over as chairman,"Some members of Tesla’s board of directors have proposed 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch take over the role of chairman following Elon Musk's settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to  relinquish his top boardroom role, the  New York Times reported late Tuesday.
Murdoch — son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch – has served on the board since 2017, but hasn't yet volunteered himself for the role of chairman,  James B. Stewart reported, citing people familiar with the board's discussions. No serious discussions have occurred, according to the paper.
As part of his  settlement, Musk has 45 days to vacate his role as chairman of Tesla’s board, which has  come under fire in recent months by critics who think it should exercise more enough control over the sometimes-erratic billionaire. While considered independent by Tesla, Murdoch may not be everyone on the board's top choice.
In May, proxy advisor Glass Lewis and union pension fund CtW Investment Group both urged shareholders to  vote against Murdoch’s re-election as director, citing his implication in scandals at 21st Century Fox subsidiaries Fox and New Corp, as well as a lack of relevant automotive or green technology experience.
In an interview Monday, Glass Lewis’ head of environmental, social, and governance research explained why an independent chairman was so important for Tesla’s board.
""The board has a duty to shareholders to ensure that they are exercising their fiduciary oversight of the company, including the leadership and management,"" Courteney Keatinge, director of ESG at the proxy advisor, told Business Insider.
""That's why we're looking for independent directors because we want to make sure that they are looking for the interest of shareholders and not the interest of themselves.""
Murdoch, who owns roughly 10,000 shares of Tesla worth about $3.03 million at Wednesday’s price, also serves on the boards of Sky, TrueX Media, 21st Century Fox, New Corp, and Yankee Global Enterprises, as well as a handful of arts organizations, according to Bloomberg data. 
Following the SEC's regulatory action against Musk, Tesla's board said it remains fully confident in his leadership. 
""Tesla and the board of directors are fully confident in Elon, his integrity, and his leadership of the company, which has resulted in the most successful U.S. auto company in over a century,"" the board said. ""Our focus remains on the continued ramp of Model 3 production and delivering for our customers, shareholders and employees.""
Tesla shares were up less than 1% early Wednesday. They have fallen about 3% this year.

The U.S. investment bank now holds 1.5 percent of DIA directly and 14.3 percent through derivatives, a filing with Spain's market regulator CNMV showed.
A long economic crisis helped boost DIA's market share but it has struggled since an economic rebound put more cash in Spaniards' pockets.
It has lost more than two thirds of its market value since its 2015 peak.
Last week, shareholder LetterOne, controlled by Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman, stoked speculation it might launch a takeover bid after it informed the regulator it had raised its stake to 29 percent.

Under Spanish law, an investor must launch a full takeover bid once its stake reaches 30 percent stake.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>",Impatient patients turn to online 'buyers club' for new drugs,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - Frustrated by delays in new medicines reaching their own country, a small but growing number of patients are turning to an online broker that bills itself as a legal version of the Dallas Buyers Club.
While regulators warn of the risk of buying drugs online, the Amsterdam-based Social Medwork sees its network of trusted suppliers as filling a gap in the market for the latest drugs against diseases such as cancer, migraine and multiple sclerosis.
Now it is looking to raise its profile and expand, by signing up former EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes to its supervisory board and securing 1.5 million euros ($1.73 million) in new funding from the Social Impact Ventures capital fund.
Like Ron Woodroof, the 1980s AIDS patient in the movie ‘Dallas Buyers Club’, patients who cannot get the drugs they want through local healthcare systems are using the organization to self-import medicines from abroad.
But while Woodroof had to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border, the Social Medwork's customers can place orders online legally, as long as they have a prescription and a doctor's letter stating that the drug is strictly for personal use.
In the past 18 months, the group, which is registered with the Dutch Ministry of Health as a medicines intermediary, has supplied more than 3,000 patients.
They include British migraine sufferer Senty Bera, 43, who recently used the system to buy Aimovig, a new monthly migraine injection from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Novartis, the first in an improved class of drugs that target a chemical involved in triggering attacks.
""My quality of life was so poor I thought it was worth trying and it is working brilliantly,"" Bera said.
As yet, Aimovig is not approved for use within Britain's state health service - though Bera hopes it will be soon - but its reputation means it is one of Social Medwork's top-sellers, despite a price tag of 698 euros for two autoinjectors.
A spokeswoman for Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed there were no formal restrictions on importing such medicines for personal use.
In the past, informal drug-buying networks https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-buyers-clubs-idUSKBN1310FA have helped supply cheap generic versions of treatments for HIV and hepatitis C. But the Dutch group, which charges a fee of around 6 percent, claims to be the only organization focused on newly approved branded drugs.
With customers in 70 countries, its line-up includes new cancer drugs that are U.S.-approved but not yet available elsewhere, as well as medicines for chronic disorders, such as Roche's new multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus.
Founder Sjaak Vink says the Internet means patients are increasingly aware they may be waiting months or even years for novel drugs following a first approval elsewhere.
""We really need to bridge this gap because this situation is ridiculous,"" he said in an interview.
Vink said he was inspired to found the organization by delays in European availability of Merck & Co's innovative cancer immunotherapy Keytruda.
Today, his group has customers in Australia, the Middle East and Asia, as well as major European markets such as France, Italy, Germany and Britain, where drug delays could worsen if Brexit disrupts supply lines.
Given relatively speedy U.S. approvals, there are currently fewer customers in America, although there was a spike in U.S. demand last year for Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug Radicut/Radicava, which was approved first in Japan.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Investors save billions as funds cut fees, fight for market share","By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. investors will save billions annually in mutual fund fees as money managers keep chopping them in a widening war for market share.
Boston-based Fidelity Investments rocked the industry this summer by offering no-fee index funds. Some analysts see a future with negative fee index funds, where investors get paid a small amount for investing money. 
Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson calls the fee cuts a democratizing force for small investors. “Mom and pop are getting what large institutions get,” he said.
The big cuts have come at index funds. Now big drops are likely at actively managed stock and bond funds, whose expense ratios have remained relatively high despite a seismic shift of money into cheaper index funds and exchange-traded funds since the Great Recession.

The outflow is already pressuring the bottom lines of money managers dependent on actively managed funds, and the squeeze will intensify as their fees continue dropping, executives said. 
“It is inevitable that active management sees this reality of investors going to lower cost products,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. “They will bring down pricing to being only modestly above index funds versus being significantly higher.”
Even a fee decline of only hundredths of a points translates into huge investor savings on a U.S. fund asset base of more than $22 trillion. Investors saved about $4 billion in 2017 as overall asset-weighted fund fees dropped to 0.52 percent from 0.56 percent. The 8 percent annual decline was the biggest since research firm Morningstar Inc started tracking those fees in 2000.
Al Blest, a self-employed general contractor in St. Louis, started weeding out expensive mutual funds from his portfolio two years ago after reading a book that detailed how fees can erode retirement savings.
""It amounts to a lot of money over time,"" Blest said. ""The fee base is the first thing I look at when I consider buying a mutual fund. You want as much as that money going in your own pocket.""
Since the end of 2009, annual expenses on stock mutual funds have dropped to 0.59 percent of assets from 0.87 percent, according to the Investment Company Institute in Washington D.C. For workers tucking away $20,000 a year in a 401(k) account, the lower expense rate means they would have nearly $100,000 extra in their accounts after 30 years. That assumes an annual rate of return of 6.41 percent.
MORE PAIN AHEAD?
Funds run by stock pickers have endured massive net withdrawals since the end of 2015, totaling $560 billion, according to Morningstar research. Popular bond funds have been hit, too. The $35 billion Templeton Global Bond Fund's (O:TPINX) annual management fees have dropped 48 percent to $163 million over the past three years, fund disclosures show.
Parent company Franklin Resources Inc (N:BEN) has been on the ropes from heavy withdrawals. Its stock is down 26 percent over the past 12 months, even while the S&P 500 index gained 16 percent. The company declined to comment.
Stock analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) see more pain for the industry, especially among mid-size money managers, such as Waddell & Reed Financial Inc  and Janus Henderson Group plc. The two firms’ fee income will decline 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively, during the next three years, according to Morgan Stanley's base case forecast. Waddell & Reed and Janus Henderson did not return messages seeking comment.
Fund executives expect to see more consolidation among struggling asset managers.
“We’ve never been more active than we are now in terms of assessing (M&A) opportunities,” said  Great-West Lifeco Inc  (TO:GWO) Chief Executive Paul Mahon during an Aug. 1 conference call. Great West owns Boston-based Putnam Investments, which had a $6 million operating loss in the second quarter.
Tom Hoops, head of business development at  Legg Mason  Inc (N:LM), said his company has spent the past five years adding new investment strategies, such as emerging markets and private equity, via acquisition.
To combat withdrawals, mutual fund heavyweights like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (N:TROW) have shifted billions of dollars into collective investment trusts, which are cheaper than mutual funds, but offer the same investment strategies and portfolio managers. CITs cost less because they are not regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That means they do not have to provide prospectuses or install independent boards of directors, removing layers of expense.
Fidelity’s $135 billion Contrafund (O:FCNTX), run by Will Danoff, charges an expense ratio of 0.74 percent. The expense ratio on the Contrafund CIT is 42 percent less. Workers invested in retirement plans offered by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Inc, for example, already are getting discounted fees on Contrafund CIT assets totaling $26 billion, regulatory filings show.
Besides shifting money into CITs, T. Rowe said it has carried out direct fee reductions and expense caps on many of its investment strategies, said Flemming Madsen, T. Rowe’s head of product. And the company has introduced lower cost share classes for its mutual funds, a move being adopted throughout the industry.
CFRA’s Rosenbluth said a downturn in the stock market could accelerate fee compression in the fund industry. “With a 9-year bull market, some fund firms haven’t seen their way to bringing prices down,” he said.

204,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Epic Airbus-Boeing Fight Signals Long U.S.-China Trade War Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- For the better part of two decades, the U.S. and EU have battled at the World Trade Organization over aircraft makers Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and Airbus SE.
Complaints and counter-complaints alleged illegal government subsidies. Rulings by the arbiter of global trade were followed by more grumbles and threats of duties. And still the arguments rage on with no sign of a resolution.
Now as America and China engage in a volley of tariffs, the inability of the U.S. and EU to resolve their dispute offers a key lesson for the burgeoning trade war: It’s going to be long and hard-fought.
While President Donald Trump has talked mostly about the trade balance, the conflict with China runs deeper. The U.S. has pitched it as a battle over the technology industries of the 21st century -- and President Xi Jinping’s explicit strategy to transform China into a global leader in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and new-energy vehicles.
That’s a direct challenge to the U.S., which charges that Beijing is using methods such as forced technology transfers and illegal government support to pursue its goals. The problem, when it comes to seeking a resolution, is that Xi’s Made in China 2025 strategy is central to China’s ambitions. It’s one thing to persuade a country to buy more soybeans or import more cars. It’s another to get it to negotiate away its economic future to a strategic rival.
""The success of Airbus was seen as critical to European industrial strategy, and the EU simply wasn’t going to be dissuaded,"" said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations specializing in U.S. economic competitiveness, trade, and immigration policy. ""China is in much the same position.""
Beijing rejects the U.S. charges and has warned that it won’t negotiate with ""a knife at its throat."" Wang Shouwen, vice commerce minister, said recently that Beijing doesn’t force technology transfers but that it does reserve the right to require foreign companies operating in certain sectors to enter joint ventures with domestic firms, as allowed under WTO rules.
In any case, Beijing is hardly the first to support key industries. Governments in Japan and South Korea did the same to direct their nations’ economic emergence, while Germany’s ""Industry 4.0"" plan adopted in 2013 served as the inspiration for Made in China 2025.
WTO Battle
And then there’s the U.S. and EU. Their 14-year fight ranks among the longest and most expensive in the WTO’s 23-year history. The U.S. launched the first salvo in 2004, with the WTO ultimately finding that the EU provided Airbus with subsidies in violation of WTO rules. Meanwhile, the EU had filed its own case that resulted in a ruling that U.S. federal and state tax-incentive programs unfairly benefited Boeing.
Both sides say they’ve complied with the WTO rulings -- and they are now fighting over whether they actually have. The EU has said it removed the offending subsidies, but in May the WTO ruled that the EU had failed to eliminate them for several Airbus wide-body jet models. The U.S. has threatened retaliatory tariffs.
Later this year, a separate WTO panel will deliver its decision on whether the U.S. has complied with the terms of a 2012 ruling that its tax breaks gave Boeing an unfair advantage.
In other words, the saga continues.
‘No Precedent’
Though the Trump administration has used the WTO to pursue some of its complaints against China, it sees the Airbus-Boeing dispute as demonstrating that the WTO is plodding, ineffective and ultimately broken. Trade hawks in Washington D.C. prefer unilateral tariffs to punish China.
The U.S.-China dispute is expected to be much more complicated than the U.S.-EU battle, given China’s governance system, state-directed development model and lack of transparency, said Stephen Olson, research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a former U.S trade negotiator.
""Developing clear and enforceable trade rules on what is permitted and not permitted is immensely complicated, as evidenced by the longstanding U.S.-EU dispute over Airbus and Boeing,"" Olson said. ""The issues raised by the Made in China 2025 plan are an order of magnitude more complex.""

208,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 06:27AM ET</span>",Aston Martin skids on market debut,"By Dasha Afanasieva
LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in luxury automaker  Aston Martin  (L:AML) fell as much as 6.5 percent on their market debut in London on Wednesday as investors and analysts raised concerns over its ability to deliver an ambitious roll-out of new models. 
The company, which last year made its first profit since 2010 and has gone bankrupt seven times, had priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a market capitalization of 4.33 billion pounds ($5.63 billion). 
The shares fell to as low as 17.75 pounds and were down 5 percent at 0935 GMT.
Aston Martin has plans to launch a new model every year from 2016 to 2022.
""(It) has very aggressive growth plans. The execution of that growth needs to be flawless - nothing eats cash more than a car company when the cycle turns. There is concern that it's more cyclical than the commentary has been,"" said James Congdon, managing director of cashflow returns specialist Quest.
""The banks have done a good job for their client - but there's no bounce."" 
MITIGATING RISK
Aston Martin - full name Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc - expects to produce around 7,100 to 7,300 cars in 2019, and 9,600 to 9,800 cars in 2020. It aims to increase production to 14,000 cars in the medium term, helped by new models and improving its manufacturing process. 
The company is investing all of its cashflow to try to achieve this, leaving nothing for dividends or paying down debt. 
""In terms of execution risk - this is what I've done for all of my career. I'm an engineer: we mitigate risk,"" Chief Executive Andy Palmer, who has led a turnaround plan at the company since 2014, told Reuters.
Palmer played down risks to the business from Britain leaving the European Union, even as other car manufacturers step up warnings over a disorderly Brexit.
He said Aston Martin was ""relatively well insulated"" from the effects of Brexit because Europe is not its biggest market and it may actually benefit from exporting with a cheaper pound.
However, 60 percent of its parts are imported from the EU and will be hit by tariffs if there is no trade deal.
""Obviously we'd all prefer no tariffs to be frank, no doubt, but the industry has to learn to adapt and it always has adapted to changes,"" Palmer said. 
VALUATION
In 2017, Aston Martin had adjusted earnings before tax interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 206.5 million pounds, up from 100.9 million pounds in 2016.
Its closest stock market comparable is  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), which listed in 2015 and trades at an enterprise value (debt plus equity) of 22.2 times EBITDA, according to Refinitiv data. 
Based on this metric and Aston Martin's net debt of 538.8 million pounds, the British carmaker was priced at 23.6 times EBITDA on its debut. 
Depending on its relative price performance, Aston Martin might make it into the FTSE 100 (FTSE), becoming the first carmaker in Britain's blue-chip index since Jaguar. 
Its shareholders, which include Italian investment firm Investindustrial and a group of Kuwait-based investors, sold a quarter of the company's stock in the initial public offering (IPO). The company did not raise any money for its own purposes. 
Aston Martin's weak debut is the latest blow to Europe's IPO market. British crowd-lending platform Funding Circle  is down more than 20 percent since it floated last week. 
A banker familiar with both deals, who did not want to be named, said: ""This is brutal. The IPO market stinks for growth stocks which do not have an earnings track record.""

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JP Morgan (N:JPM) were joint global coordinators for the Aston Martin IPO. Lazard advised.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Music Entertainment, which owns China's most popular music apps, has filed for a U.S. IPO seeking funds to develop content and new services, in what is expected to be one of the biggest U.S. listings by a Chinese company this year.
The music arm of tech giant Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), which plans to list either on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, set a placeholder amount of $1 billion for registration purposes. Sources said last month it was hoping to raise $2 billion.
With streaming apps QQ Music, Kugou, Kuwo as well as karaoke app WeSing, Tencent Music is China's largest online music platform boasting more than 800 million monthly active users.
It is often compared to  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT), but the Chinese firm offers more in the way of socially interactive services that makes it profitable while its Swedish counterpart is not.
Music-centric social entertainment services, which include virtual gifts and premium memberships, accounted for just over 70 percent of the $1.65 billion in revenue it made in 2017, its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.
Profit after tax came in at $199 million. The filing also showed that only 3.6 percent of Tencent Music users pay for music. 
For the first half of this year, revenue jumped 92 percent to $1.3 billion while profits after tax climbed roughly fourfold to $263 million.
By comparison, Spotify, with which it has a cross shareholding deal, lost 90 million euros ($104 million) in the second quarter of this year on revenue of 1.3 billion euros.
The number of Tencent Music shares to be sold were not disclosed and potential valuations were unclear. Spotify is now valued at $31 billion, with shares gaining about 8 percent since its U.S. debut in April.
Chinese companies have raised $7.5 billion in U.S. markets so far this year, the biggest amount since 2014, according to Refinitiv data.
These include video streaming company iQiyi (O:IQ), which raised $2.4 billion, electric vehicle startup Nio Inc (N:NIO) which raised $1 billion, and online group discounter  Pinduoduo  (O:PDD) which raised $1.63 billion.
Tencent Music's IPO comes as the global music industry gets back on track with more listeners streaming music through smartphone apps compared to a few years ago when the market was dominated by pirated music.
Its apps have over 20 million tracks from both international and domestic music labels, the filing said, while millions of users go to the karaoke app WeSing daily.
WeSing allows people to have karaoke parties in virtual singing rooms, challenge each other in sing-offs and sing duets with celebrities or other users.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the lead sponsors of the deal.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Marathon Oil looks to exit North Sea, joining other U.S. rivals","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) has launched the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas fields, a document seen by Reuters showed, the latest U.S. firm to retreat from the basin to focus on onshore shale production at home.
The sale includes stakes in the BP-operated Foinaven fields in the west of Shetland area as well as interests in the Brae complex northeast of Aberdeen, according to a sales document seen by Reuters.
The process, launched this week, is being run by Jefferies and bids are due by December. The assets could fetch up to $200 million, according to two banking sources.
Marathon Oil joins several companies including  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) that have sought to pull out of the North Sea in recent years as they focus operations on rapidly expanding shale production.
Marathon Oil spokeswoman Lee Warren declined to comment directly on the sale but said ""portfolio management is an ongoing and integral element of our successful business model as we continue to simplify and concentrate our portfolio to our highest return opportunities with a focus on our differentiated position in the U.S. resource plays."" 
The company, which produced around 419,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, will invest over 90 percent of its 2018 capital in U.S. shale production, according to its website.
The North Sea, one of the oldest offshore basins that started production in the 1970s, has undergone a broad change of guard in recent years as veteran producers have been replaced by smaller, often privately-owned companies, which say they can squeeze more oil and gas out of the fields.
According to the sales document, Marathon's North Sea assets have a total production of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a resource of 31 million barrels and are expected to produce $85 million of cash flow in 2019.
Marathon holds a 40 percent stake in the Brae Area complex, one of the oldest in the basin, as well as stakes in pipelines. One of the complex's platforms, Brae Bravo, is being dismantled after production ceased in recent years in what is known as decommissioning.
The Foinaven area comprises of two producing fields, Foinaven and Foinaven East, in which Marathon holds 28 percent and 47 percent interests respectively, the document said.
Marathon agreed to sell its Libyan assets to France's Total earlier this year for $450 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro bounced off six-week lows on Wednesday, European shares rose and Italian bonds rallied as some of the worries that have rippled across markets this week were soothed by signs Rome was amenable to cutting budget deficits and debt in coming years.
A report in the Corriere della Serra newspaper -- later confirmed to Reuters by a government source -- said the deficit would fall to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the 2.4 percent earlier outlined. 
That brought relief to markets which had fretted that Italy's decision to expand budget deficits well beyond what was agreed by a previous government would deepen its debt problems while stoking conflict with the European Union, whose officials have already expressed concerns.
The euro, which had hit a six-week trough of $1.1506 after suffering five straight days of losses, firmed 0.3 percent while Italian borrowing costs eased off 4-1/2-year highs, after jumping 50 basis points since budget details emerged last Thursday. 
Two-year yields fell 15 bps.

""It's all about Italy today. The news about a possible reduction in budget deficits has been positively taken by all markets, and the euro is back up too -- that's the main risk parameter for euro crisis concerns,"" said Bernd Berg, global macro and FX strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Zurich.
A pan-European equity index opened a quarter percent higher, while the Milan bourse jumped more than one percent. The moves were led by an initial 3.1 percent bounce in Italian banks. The banks' huge government debt holdings make them particularly vulnerable to bond selloffs and has pressured Italian stock markets for months.

The moves pushed down the premium investors demand for holding Italian risk relative to that of safer Germany to around 290 bps, down from a five-year high over 300 bps on Tuesday and sapped some demand for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the dollar and Swiss franc.
The euro jumped half a percent to the franc and 0.4 percent to the yen. Analysts noted however that other southern European markets, Spain and Portugal, which were caught up in Greece's 2010-2011 crisis, had been resilient to spillover from Italy this year. 
""Contagion has been far more subdued than in the past and that's an important signal. I expect policymakers to latch on to that as proof (Italy's crisis) is self-imposed and not a reflection of what's happening as a whole in the weaker (euro zone) countries,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier in London.
He added that Italy's high yields -- two-year bonds there pay 1.3 percent versus zero in Portugal -- were also enticing some investors. 
Wall Street too appeared set for a firmer open, with futures for the S&P 500 the Dow up around 0.2 percent.
Broader world market sentiment remains jittery though, partly because of the bellicose rhetoric still emerging from the coalition government in Rome, but also due to fears that a Sino-U.S. tariff row would escalate once China reopens after a week-long holiday.
While U.S. President Donald Trump agreed a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, a controversial clause in the trilateral agreement, forbidding similar deals with ""non-market"" countries, was seen as raising risks for Sino-U.S. talks. 
Volatility in U.S. tech shares is also making investors wary, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) down almost 6 percent in the past three sessions after disclosing its worst security breach ever. 
World shares were flat near two-week lows while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent and Japan's Nikkei closed 0.7 percent lower. 
China's financial markets are closed and will resume trade on Oct. 8. That's the day Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend G-20 meetings, meaning news could emerge on the trade front.
The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of major currencies, pulled back from six-week highs of 95.744. 
Emerging currencies derived some relief from the weaker dollar but the Indian rupee hit a new record low and the Indonesian rupiah touched a more than 20-year low, as oil prices near four-year highs weighed on importing nations' finances.
Indonesian authorities stepped in to support the currency and India is expected to raise interest rates this Friday.
Turkey's lira also weakened one percent to the dollar as the country, another oil importer, posted data showing inflation at more than 25 percent. That increases pressure on the central bank to raise rates again after a whopping 625 bps move in August.
Woodman Asset Management's Berg said however the worst looked to be over for Turkey, adding: ""the currency has appreciated and the central bank has hiked rates aggressively so...toward the end of the year, inflation numbers should stabilize and to me, the worst of the currency crisis is over.""

Brent crude inched up to $84.89 per barrel, close to four-year highs of $85.45 touched earlier this week.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 04:54AM ET</span>",Italian stocks lead Europe as budget deficit fears quelled,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Italian stocks turned from a drag into a boost for European markets on Wednesday as signs the government would target a lower budget deficit quelled investors' fears of a damaging showdown with the European Commission.
Italian bank stocks (FTIT8300) jumped as much as 3 percent after government bond yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021.
Still in the thrall of developments on the Italian front, the leading euro zone stocks index (STOXX50E) and the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 0.3 percent with bank stocks (SX7P) the best-performing, up 0.8 percent.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) outperformed, up 0.5 percent with the banks index last trading up 0.7 percent.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) were among the top gainers, up 2.6 percent each, while  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), UBI Banca (MI:UBI), and Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) also rose as much as 5 percent.
Banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, suffer the most from selloffs in the bond market and the index saw its fifth consecutive day down on Tuesday before news the government was aiming for a lower budget deficit.
""Any indication from the government that may deny such indications and lead to a step up in confrontation will negatively affect BTP spreads,"" said Unicredit analysts.
""The situation remains fluid and mood can make sudden U-turns, depending on a rather unpredictable news flow.""
Outside politics, Oslo-listed aluminum firm Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) was the biggest faller, tumbling 13.6 percent after announcing it would shut all output from its Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil.
""This is a very serious event for Norsk Hydro, potentially leading to severe losses,"" said a trader.
 Grifols  (MC:GRLS) shares fell 6 percent after UBS analysts cut the stock to sell from neutral, saying competitive risks are rising.
""Fc Rn inhibitors, a new class of drug we expect to launch in 2021, threaten to replace up to 20 percent of Grifols sales,"" said analysts at the Swiss bank. 
 Tesco  (L:TSCO) shares fell 8.5 percent after Britain's biggest retailer reported first-half profits which missed analysts' forecasts.
""Good like-for-like (sales), but weak bottom line points to margin destruction,"" said a trader. 
Shares in French tech consultancy Altran (PA:ALTT) jumped 9 percent to 8.12 euros, at the top of the STOXX after Kepler Cheuvreux analysts upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"" with a price target of 10 euros.
Kepler analysts said they see no risk for liquidity, and that Altran's current share price values its global design and engineering company Aricent at roughly 0. 
The stock, down 40 percent in the third quarter alone, is a popular short, amplifying any positive moves as short-sellers unwind their positions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) is considering a multi-billion dollar investment at its Singapore refinery, the company's largest, ahead of new global shipping fuel regulations starting in 2020, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
""We are currently assessing a multi-billion project in our integrated manufacturing facility here in Singapore,"" Matt Bergeron, vice president of Asia Pacific Fuels Business at Exxon, said at a bunkering conference.
""Should the project proceed, we plan to implement proprietary technologies that will convert lower value by-products into cleaner higher value products including 0.5 percent sulphur fuels that we believe will be the compliant option for the vast majority of the marine sector,"" Bergeron said. 
The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is introducing new rules on marine fuels from 2020, limiting the sulphur content to 0.5 percent, from 3.5 percent currently, to curb pollution produced by the world's ships.
The shipping and oil refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were announced in 2016.
Exxon's Singapore refinery is the company's largest, with a capacity of about 592,000 barrels a day. Singapore is also home to the oil giant's biggest integrated petrochemical complex.
""We have already made significant investments at a number of other refineries around the world in order to increase our production capacity of cleaner fuels with lower sulphur content,"" Bergeron said. 
Exxon in September announced it was planning to spend more than $650 million to upgrade the UK's largest oil refinery, Fawley, on England's south coast.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","With Hemlibra, Roche seeks to break into tight hemophilia circle","By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) is breaking into hemophilia A treatment, a $10 billion global market dominated by rivals who have cultivated close ties to sufferers of the genetic bleeding disorder.
Roche's Hemlibra, on sale since late 2017 for patients with resistance to existing treatments, is widely expected to win the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's blessing for use in nearly all patients this week. The FDA declined to comment.
First-half sales were just 57 million Swiss francs ($58 million).
To hit $5 billion global annual sales that some analysts forecast, Hemlibra must wrest business away from hemophilia giants like  Shire  (L:SHP), Bayer (DE:BAYGn),  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and Octapharma, whose ""clotting factors"" are now standard for people who lack proteins that stop bleeding.
These companies have long sponsored patient groups, summer camps, even kayak trips on the Pacific Ocean, as part of efforts to build loyalty they hope will slow an exodus from their products once new drugs like Roche's arrive.
Roche is convinced word of mouth in the hemophilia community, backed up by its studies showing that Hemlibra shots may be more effective and must be administered less frequently than infusions of clotting factors, will overcome any current allegiances.
""I'm not familiar with what the other companies are telling the patients,"" said Dr. Gallia Levy, who heads Roche's Hemlibra program.
""What I do know is that I've seen a lot of patients telling other patients what is happening in their lives. Those sorts of stories mean the most to the patients.""
As part of Roche's initial marketing campaign for Hemlibra, it has produced videos of hemophilia patients participating in daily activities, including riding bikes, in spite of their serious illness.
One video shows the consequences of failing to get appropriate treatment, featuring a Serbian man who suffered joint bleeds as a child and now must use crutches.
Hemophilia A has become one of medicine's most lucrative diseases, despite just 20,000 patients in the United States and several hundred thousand worldwide. It almost always affects men, passed down by a mutation on the X chromosome from their mother. 
In 2016, the U.S. government alone spent some $2 billion on hemophilia A therapies, data from its Medicaid and Medicare insurance programs show. 
Shire's Adynovate clotting factor runs at $537,000 annually, although costs for severe patients can hit several million dollars. 
Roche has priced Hemlibra at $482,000, hefty but a level the independent U.S. pricing group ICER has said could cut overall hemophilia treatment costs significantly.
Traditionally a cancer drugs maker, Roche is turning to rare diseases like hemophilia to replace revenue from its older medicines whose expiring patents have exposed the company to unprecedented generic competition.
Hemophilia represents the largest market for rare diseases and is expected to grow above 7 percent per year through 2022, Evaluate Pharma has forecast.
'RELUCTANT TO SWITCH'
In August, Roche defeated a challenge from Shire aimed at delaying Hemlibra's broad introduction. 
Shire fears losing 30 percent of its $2.4 billion annual clotting factors sales to Hemlibra in the short term, court documents show. However, it also indicated it expected patient allegiances to at least mitigate losses.
""Patients have loyalty to the brand and to manufacturers, and physicians are reluctant to switch due to risks,"" according to Shire testimony cited in the U.S. federal court judge's ruling.
Clotting-factor makers have fostered this loyalty, in part, by sponsoring summer camps for patients and their families. Camp Red Sunrise in Idaho's Rocky Mountains, sponsored by Shire and Bayer, among others, is free. Another Shire-sponsored retreat, Missouri's Camp Notaclotamongus, costs $25.
In September, Switzerland-based Octapharma sponsored a free sea kayaking expedition for 10 hemophilia patients on Washington State's Puget Sound, offering a chance to see pods of orca killer whales.
Shire, Bayer and Octapharma did not respond to requests for comment on their efforts to boost ties to patients.
Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, runs PharmedOut, a project that scrutinizes the influence the drug industry has on the practice of medicine. 
A 2016 paper she co-authored described hemophilia's corporate-patient links and how companies use gifts, financial opportunities and one-on-one marketing to advance their commercial interests. 
Hemophilia is unique, Fugh-Berman said, since patients play a bigger role in their treatment decisions than elsewhere in medicine where doctors more often call the shots.
""Industry's relationship with individual patients or health care providers is always about selling specific targeted products,"" Fugh-Berman told Reuters, adding tight corporate links to patients could hamper discussion including over drug prices, even among patient groups with the best of intentions.
""Taking money from industry prevents them from asking hard questions,"" she said. 
The National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), like nearly all hemophilia patient groups, gets money from companies including Roche to pay for education, research and programs.
But a spokesman said the group had strict rules that forbid advocating for a given product. ""We are focused on ensuring patients receive access to the treatment that their physician determines to be the most appropriate,"" he said by email. 
Michelle Rice, the NHF's head of external affairs and the mother of a hemophilia patient, said convincing everyone in the hemophilia community to quickly switch therapies will be difficult, despite benefits promised by new drugs.
That is in part because of the disease's tragic history. Many hemophilia patients died after acquiring HIV and hepatitis through tainted blood products in the 1980s.
""We lost about 10,000 people in our community,"" Rice said. ""They're not inclined to just jump to the next bright shiny thing, unless they see a real potential advantage.""
When her son was born 28 years ago, Rice said, there were just a handful of therapies available. 
Now, there are some two dozen approved products, with more in the pipeline as hemophilia's potentially rich returns lure companies to pursue new approaches.
France's Sanofi (PA:SASY), which this year bought Biogen's (O:BIIB) hemophilia business, is working with U.S.-based Alnylam (O:ALNY). Novo Nordisk has an alternative to clotting factors in the works, too. 
And experimental one-time gene therapies now being tested by BioMarin (O:BMRN), Spark Therapeutics (O:ONCE) and Sangamo (O:SGMO) would be very expensive, but could end indefinite infusions or injections.
This could threaten reliable cash flows for clotting factor makers as well as pose a challenge to Hemlibra.
Despite existing relationships between patients and companies, Spark's Chief Operating Officer John Furey said scientific and financial arguments should win the day.
If gene therapy helps patients and reduces overall costs for insurers, Furey said, ""we'll be able to persuade the community this is a very good option for them.""

225,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 01:47AM ET</span>",'A tale of two hurricanes' for September U.S. new car sales,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted a hefty drop in U.S. new vehicle sales for September, caused in part by a decline in sales in areas hit by Hurricane Florence and a tough comparison to the previous September when consumers rushed to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) bucked the trend for the month, reporting a 15 percent jump in U.S. sales, led by increases in sales of its lucrative Jeeps - especially its Cherokee and Compass models - and Ram pickup trucks.
The solid performance put FCA's total sales ahead of longtime No. 2 U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) for the month of September.
Hurricane Florence flooded large parts of North Carolina and South Carolina last month, leaving residents to deal with the deluge instead of shopping for new cars.
Sales in September 2017 were boosted by major replacement demand for water-damaged vehicles following Hurricane Harvey, which had flooded parts of southeastern Texas in August that year.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales (SAAR) for September hit 18.1 million units in September 2017 - the highest sales pace since 2005.
Despite the sales decline versus the same month in 2017, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the SAAR of U.S. car and light truck sales for September came in at 17.44 million vehicles - the highest sales pace since November 2017. This was above the SAAR of 16.9 million units expected by analysts.
After a strong first half of the year, U.S. new auto sales are expected to dip in the second half of 2018, as rising interest rates in particular translate into higher monthly car payments and push more Americans toward buying used vehicles.
U.S. consumers last month continued a longstanding trend of abandoning passenger cars for larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs.
""September was a bloodbath for cars,"" Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs told reporters on a conference call. ""They dropped like a rock.""
Ford Motor Co (N:F) on Tuesday reported an 11.2 percent drop in sales, with declines in every major category. Sales of sedans were down nearly 26 percent.
Ford also posted a decline of nearly 9 percent for sales of its best-selling, and highly profitable, F-Series pickup trucks and a 2.7 percent drop in sales of SUVs.
In a conference call with analysts and reporters, Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve referred to September as a ""tale of two hurricanes.""
""Hurricane Florence was a big factor this month,"" LaNeve said, adding that post-storm recovery efforts were ""moving quickly.""
General Motors Co (N:GM) said its third-quarter sales were down 11.1 percent versus the same period in 2017. Earlier this year, the No. 1 U.S. automaker stopped reporting monthly sales, arguing that a 30-day snapshot did not accurately portray market trends.
Sales were down at all of GM's major brands, with particularly sharp decreases for passenger cars.
""Our brands are very well-positioned for the fourth quarter when our next wave of new products start shipping in high volume,"" Kurt McNeil, GM U.S. vice president for sales, said in a news release.
GM has high hopes for all-new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said its U.S. new-vehicle sales fell 10.4 percent in September. Sedan sales at the Japanese automaker were off nearly 28 percent. That included a 17 percent decline for its flagship Camry midsize sedan, which was completely redesigned with the aim of increasing market share.
Toyota's SUV and pickup truck sales were down 0.3 percent for the month.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) reported a 12.2 percent drop in sales for September, with a 35.7 percent decline in passenger car sales more than offsetting a 6.6 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.
Sales of Nissan's best-selling vehicle, the Rogue crossover, fell 10.6 percent in September.
""It was a tough comparison for sales year-over-year, but otherwise the month was very solid for us with some bright spots,"" said Billy Hayes, the automaker’s vice president for regional operations in North America. ""We're still extremely bullish and we're feeling very good about the rest of the year.""
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said sales were off 7 percent in September, as a 19 percent decrease in passenger cars outmatched a 6.3 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.
Monthly sales of the automaker's completely revamped Accord dropped by 15 percent.
Ford shares closed 1.3 percent lower at $9.20 on Tuesday. GM shares were down 2.6 percent at $33.30 and FCA shares dipped 0.6 percent to close at $17.88 in New York trading.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is heading to North Korea for another round of talks as the U.S. hopes to get Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons, according to reports on Tuesday
The news came after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted to meet with the North Korean leader again soon. The two leaders had the first-ever summit in June.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell gave a speech in Boston on Tuesday and said he is confident that low unemployment would not force the U.S. central bank to hike rates aggressively.
“The rise in wages is broadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth and therefore does not point to an overheating labor market,” Powell said on Tuesday. “Further, higher wage growth alone need not be inflationary.”
Overnight, U.S.-listed retailers underperformed after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) raised the minimum wage for all its employees. European shares also fell on worries of Italy’s budget confrontation and risk of a debt crisis in the EU.
Italian 10-year bond yield jumped to 4-1/2 year highs after EU officials expressed concerns about Italy’s budget plans.
""Budget details are still unavailable but the real anxiety surrounds the medium-term path of spending and debt. There is no evidence to suggest the sell-off has run its course,"" ANZ analysts said in a note to clients.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors in Minas Gerais state said on Tuesday they reached a final compensation deal with mining companies Samarco, Vale (SA:VALE3) and BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) regarding a 2015 dam burst, Brazil's largest ever environmental disaster.
According to a statement from prosecutors released late on Tuesday, the deal allows for compensation payments to start to relatives of the 19 people killed in the disaster, as well as to people who lost their houses and other properties.
No financial details of the deal were disclosed in the short statement on Tuesday, but the chief prosecutor in the city of Mariana will hold a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the agreement.
Brazil's worst environmental catastrophe happened when a dam designed to hold back mine waste from the Samarco iron pellets operation in Mariana burst, leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo states.
Another deal had been reached by the mining companies and prosecutors in regions hit by the disaster away from Mariana, where victims found that offer insufficient. With this last settlement, companies might be able to prepare to resume operations in the region more than two years after the accident.
Vale has said it expects the Samarco unit to resume operations in 2018 or early next year, but has pushed back forecasts several times.
The mine still needs permits to reopen, and the lack of a clear timeline makes it harder for the controlling companies to renegotiate the debt Samarco will carry from the disaster.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp Corp (T:6753) unveiled its long-awaited move into the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) market on Wednesday as the Apple Inc (O:AAPL) supplier looks to catch rival  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930).
Sharp will offer OLED panels in its new smartphones later this year and plans to sell the screens to other manufacturers, although it has signaled it is wary about a rapid expansion in OLED as momentum for the thinner but more expensive screens slows.
The move comes as the Osaka-based electronics maker, a major supplier of iPhone liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, continues its recovery after being bought two years ago by Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317).
Sharp's OLED smartphones will initially go on sale in Japan, by far its major market after it slashed its overseas smartphone business. The company has not yet reached any deals for sales to other smartphone makers, a spokeswoman said at a launch function in Tokyo.
Sharp has so far invested 57.4 billion yen ($505 million) to produce OLED panels in western Japan, less than a third of the planned 200 billion yen investment that was announced by Foxconn at the time of its acquisition in 2016.
Sharp executives have said a shift from conventional LCD screens to more flexible OLED screens has been slower than expected due to high prices, making the firm cautious about aggressive OLED capacity expansion in the near term.
""The momentum for OLED panels is waning compared to a year ago and is unlikely to pick up immediately,"" senior Sharp executive Katsuaki Nomura told reporters in July.
The slower acceptance of pricier OLED panels has also offered some relief to  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740), another iPhone LCD screen supplier lagging behind Samsung and  LG Display  (KS:034220) in OLED technology.
Japan Display has said it may push back the start of OLED commercial production, currently scheduled for 2019, while seeking a partner to help finance the launch of a mass production line. Analysts say it typically costs more than 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion) to start a mass production line.
""To our surprise, our clients are not moving away from LCD panels,"" Chief Financial Officer Takanobu Oshima said in August.
South Korea's Electronic Times reported earlier this year that Apple has decided to use OLED screens in all three new iPhone models planned for next year, compared to two OLED models this year.
But industry sources have told Reuters that Apple would not entirely abandon low-cost LCD screens at least for next year. 
Still, analysts say the OLED panel market could pick up again if improvements in production efficiency at Korean and Chinese panel makers lead to lower costs. OLED panels offer richer colors than LCDs and allow for foldable phones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co has not convinced U.S. regulators it is doing enough to repay 600,000 drivers who were wrongly pushed into buying auto insurance, a leading bank regulator said on Tuesday.
""We are not comfortable where we are with them,"" Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency, said at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.
In a statement, the bank declined to comment on Otting's remarks specifically, but said it was working with regulators to repay drivers.
""We regret how this issue has impacted our customers,"" the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said in a statement. 
Otting's office this summer rejected Wells Fargo's plan to repay customers who were pushed into unnecessary auto insurance and told the bank it must do more to find and compensate every driver who was hurt, Reuters reported in September. 
The rejection was the latest setback for Wells Fargo which has been rocked by two years of scandals over its sales practices.
In September 2016, the bank paid a $190 million fine after admitting employees had opened perhaps millions of phony customer accounts to hit sales goals.
In April, the bank paid a $1 billion fine to U.S. regulators for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses and promised to make sure customers were repaid.
Drivers who bought a car with a loan from Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for ""forced-place"" policies. The bank enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, officials have said.
The OCC does not have a deadline for when it must approve the plan, but Wells Fargo cannot finish its work without that all-clear from regulators.
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz asked Otting when Wells Fargo customers should expect a refund for the faulty charges.

""I don't have the particular date in front of me,"" Otting said, but he said he trusts OCC employees to push the bank to get the job done correctly.

(Reuters) - A federal judge has ruled that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) must defend itself at a trial over allegations it knew foreign workers at its California assembly plant were threatened with deportation if they reported an injury and worked long shifts that violated forced labor laws.
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, in San Jose, California, dismissed most of the seven claims against Tesla on Monday, but allowed two claims to survive, paving the way for the plaintiffs to seek documents and witnesses to build their case.
The decision comes as Tesla is under pressure to turn a profit and days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk stepped down as chairman to settle allegations by regulators that he misled investors.
Tesla has been plagued with safety complaints brought by workers, allegations that Tesla denies. Workers say that long hours and pressure to deliver vehicles quickly takes a toll, and some have pushed for a union.
Tesla said it investigated the allegations and broke ties with a subcontractor, ISM Vuzem, that it said did not live up to its expectations. ""We've also since improved our supplier contracts and policies to better stop bad behavior,"" it said in a statement.
According to the lawsuit, Gregor Lesnik of Slovenia came to the United States on a B-1 visa and worked 250 hours per month for less than $950, well below minimum wage. It also alleges that foreign workers were threatened with deportation or reduced pay if they reported injuries or became ill. 
The 2016 lawsuit by Lesnik and Stjepan Papes of Croatia seeks class action status on behalf of foreigners with B-1 visas working at construction sites at U.S. auto plants.
Tesla was one of several automakers named as defendants, but the only one that was not dismissed from the case because plaintiffs only alleged to have suffered threats of deportation at Tesla's plant in Fremont, California. 
Koh denied a motion to dismiss for two Tesla subcontractors, Eisenmann Corp and ISM Vuzem because they operated at the same plant.
Eisenmann and Vuzem did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Koh said her ruling was based on a ""generous reading of the at times incomprehensible"" lawsuit, but also said the allegations against Tesla and Eisenmann were ""uncharacteristically specific.""
Koh rejected arguments that Tesla and Eisenmann were not liable because the alleged abuses were committed by Vuzem. Koh said a party that benefits financially from another's abuses also bears liability.
The claims she dismissed alleged violations of the False Claims Act, Fair Labor Standards Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 08:24PM ET</span>",America to buzz as phones get 'presidential alert' test Wednesday,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send messages to more than 200 million U.S. cellphones on Wednesday testing a previously unused presidential alert system that aims to warn the public in the event of a national emergency.
The test message was originally scheduled for September but was pushed back to Wednesday at 2:18 p.m. EDT. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which will send the alert, said the messages would bear the headline “Presidential Alert,” and that phones will make a loud tone and have a special vibration.
The test has been scheduled to ensure that the alert system would work in the event of a national emergency. The message will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” A separate alert on TV and radios will be issued at 2:20 p.m..
The tests have drawn a lot of attention on social media in part because of President Donald Trump's propensity for sending tweets to his 55 million followers. 
On a conference call, government officials told reporters that Trump would not personally trigger the alert -- from his phone or any other device -- and emphasized that no president could ""wake up one morning and attempt to send a personal message.""
The test alert will be sent by a device similar to a laptop from a FEMA laboratory.
An actual alert would be used for an impending missile attack or other national emergency. 
Then-President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 requiring FEMA to create a system allowing the president to send cellphone alerts regarding public safety emergencies.
Federal Communications Commissioner Mike O'Rielly told reporters on Tuesday that an April 5 regional test of the emergency alert system in the Washington area showed some potential issues. 
He said some people did not receive alerts on some devices during that test. ""We're trying to analyze that,"" O'Rielly said.
The country's wireless emergency alert system has issued over 36,000 alerts for situations such as missing children, extreme weather and natural disasters since 2012, but never a presidential directive.
Cellphone users can opt out of natural disaster or missing children alerts, but not presidential alerts.  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said nearly all of its mobile phone handsets are capable of getting alerts.

Government officials estimated that the alert would reach upwards of 225 million U.S. cellphones, or around 75 percent of all phones. They said a person on a call lasting 30 minutes may not get the alert as with phones with an active data connection.

(Reuters) - J. C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) on Tuesday hired Jill Soltau, former chief executive officer of privately held fabric and crafts retailer Joann Stores, to the top job, effective mid-October.
Shares of the company, which hit a record low last week when its chief financial officer quit, rose about 10 percent in after-market trading.
Soltau has served in senior level positions at Sears (O:SHLD) and Kohl's (N:KSS) in a career spanning over 30 years, the company said in a statement.
The appointment comes five months after its former CEO Marvin Ellison left the company to join home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) and Soltau is tasked to resurrect J. C. Penney's declining sales as shoppers increasingly move toward online shopping.
""The new CEO has an uphill battle to resurrect the brand ... hopefully, she will focus on merchandising to the core customer and addressing the sole problem at the company, which has been apparel,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said.
J.C Penney, which has seen its annual sales decline in the last three years, reported a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss and cut its full-year profit forecast in August.
""If she can fix apparel, she will help stabilize the company's profit margins, which have been under substantial pressure for the past few years,"" Grom said. 

Paul Brown, chairman of J. C. Penney's search committee said Soltau's turnaround work at prior companies as well as her experience in apparel and e-commerce made her an ""ideal fit"" for the company.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 06:29PM ET</span>",FDA seizes documents from Juul in latest e-cigarette crackdown,"By Ankur Banerjee and Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it seized more than a thousand pages of documents from Juul Labs related to the company's sales and marketing practices after a surprise inspection, the latest clampdown on e-cigarette companies.
The FDA said last month it was considering a ban on flavored e-cigarettes from Juul and others as the agency grapples with an ""epidemic"" of youth e-cigarette use that threatens to create a new generation of nicotine addicts.
Retail sales of Juul grew more than seven-fold from 2016 to 2017, according to a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By December, Juul comprised nearly 1 in 3 e-cigarette sales nationally, it said. The CDC study of retail sales did not include online sales or sales at “vape shops.”
Juul has about 72 percent of the U.S. market for e-cigarette sales, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). 
""Juuling,"" along with ""vaping,"" has become a common term for e-cigarette use by teenagers on social media and at U.S. high schools. E-cigarettes vaporize a liquid that contains nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush. 
The inspection, completed on Friday, followed a request in April for documents that would help the agency better understand the high rates of use and appeal among youth of Juul products.
The FDA also said it conducted inspections of several of Juul's contract manufacturing units earlier this year.
""We've now released over 50,000 pages of documents to the FDA since April that support our public statements,"" Juul Chief Executive Officer Kevin Burns said in a statement, adding the meeting with the regulator was constructive and transparent.
""We want to be part of the solution in preventing underage use, and we believe it will take industry and regulators working together to restrict youth access"".
The FDA's regulation of e-cigarettes has come under the spotlight as Juul's popularity surged.
U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Lisa Murkowski in a letter on Tuesday urged the FDA to immediately ban child-friendly e-cigarette flavorings and restrict online sales of nicotine products.
“While it remains unclear whether e-cigarettes can actually help adults quit smoking cigarettes, it is abundantly clear that tobacco companies are developing and marketing e-cigarette flavors that appeal to, and addict, children,” the senators wrote. 
In July, Durbin, a Democrat, and Murkowski, a Republican, introduced legislation that would place restrictions on e-cigarette flavorings that appeal to children like gummy bear, chocolate cupcake and tutti fruitti. 
Along with the Juul phenomenon, a new wave of lower-priced Juul knockoffs are showing up at convenience stores, vape shops and online, despite an FDA rule that banned the sale of new e-cigarettes after August 2016 without regulatory approval. 
Startups and major tobacco firms have launched more than a dozen new high-nicotine devices with Juul-like designs since the FDA imposed the deadline, according to a Reuters review of the companies' online advertisements, social media posts and public statements.
Shares of tobacco companies, including Philip Morris (N:PM), Altria (N:MO),  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB), jumped after the FDA announcement.
Juul's flash-drive-like device is recharged via a USB port. The device comes with cartridges, or pods, of nicotine-based liquids in flavors like mango, creme and mint — that critics say appeal to minors. 
The newest liquid blends from Juul and its imitators - called ""nicotine salts"" in the industry - contain a compound called benzoic acid, which lowers the pH level of the liquid.

That reduction allows users to take in more nicotine without a bitter taste, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

, (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) shares have been the S&P 500’s rock star gainer this year, but a recent slide signals some investors are hedging their bets that it can make major inroads in the server computer chip market dominated by  Intel Corp  (O:INTC). On Tuesday, AMD was the top decliner and Intel the top gainer on the S&P 500. The company has a steep hill to climb to live up to the hopes that had pushed its shares up as much as 228 percent last month from last year's close, the biggest percentage gain of any S&P 500 company. AMD fell more than 7 percent on Tuesday and is now down almost 15 percent from the 2018 high hit in mid-September. Before Tuesday, the company was trading at 51 times expected earnings for the year-ahead, a valuation that left some analysts skeptical about the potential for more gains. 
Eleven analysts recommend buying AMD's stock, while four advise selling and 16 have neutral ratings, according to data from Refinitiv.
After ending 2017 at just $10.38, AMD shares last month reached $34.14, their highest since May 2006. That was impressive for a company that in 2015 some analysts viewed as a bankruptcy risk due to falling demand for personal computers. 
A 5 percent drop in the chipmaker's shares on Friday hinted at how vulnerable the stock may be. 
Investors have been betting that AMD can win over new clients with competitive chip offerings while arch-rival Intel wrestles with supply problems and delays in developing its next-generation chip manufacturing process. 
AMD has a lot of room to expand its low single-digit percentage share of the server market. But some analysts say it will take longer than investors realize to build share in the server market. 
""We'd agree with AMD bulls that it's done a much better job of executing on its product road map but executing on products and gaining market share are different things,"" said Ruben Roy, analyst for MKM Partners, which has a ""hold"" rating on AMD stock and a $20 price target. 
""With valuations reflecting the best possible scenario, we think that there could be better opportunities coming up if there are hiccups,"" said Roy.
He sees AMD increasing its share of the server market to about 8 percent from in 2019 from 3 percent. AMD has said it expects to end 2018 with mid-single digit server market share and to be on a path toward a double-digit share.   
Wall Street analysts expect earnings per share of 47 cents for 2018 and 67 cents for 2019 on revenue growth of 25.7 percent in 2018 and 9.6 percent in 2019 according to Refinitiv. 
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who rates AMD ""hold"" and has a $16 price target on the stock, says its growth so far has been too dependent on its graphics chips, which face stiff competition from rival Nvidia (O:NVDA).
On top of delays to its 10 nanometer manufacturing technology, which would allow it to make smaller chips, Intel has suffered from leadership uncertainty as it seeks a new chief executive after Brian Krzanich resigned in June.

""To their credit, AMD has taken total control of the narrative from Intel. Maybe they did too good a job,"" said Rasgon.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 05:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon explores sale of U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets - sources,"By David French and Jessica Resnick-Ault
(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) is exploring the sale of many of its U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, as higher prices prompt the world's largest publicly traded oil company to review its portfolio, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Major oil companies have been looking to concentrate development operations in a few key areas. Irving, Texas-based Exxon is focusing on promising acreage in offshore areas such as Guyana and Brazil and onshore in the Permian basin of Texas. 
Exxon has asked a small number of parties to gauge their potential interest in the company's Gulf assets, ahead of deciding how to proceed, according to two of the sources, adding that any sale would likely happen next year.
The company is considering selling deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico that currently produce about 50,000 barrels per day of oil, one of the sources added. The company has stakes in Gulf assets that produce the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day and 730 million cubic feet of gas daily, according to company data. 
Exxon produces the equivalent of about 2.2 million barrels of oil daily. While Exxon is the most valuable publicly traded oil company, it is only the ninth-largest operator in the Gulf, trailing heavyweights like Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) and  BP  Plc (L:BP), along with smaller Gulf-focused independent oil companies like Fieldwood and Talos.
The Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production, has become overshadowed by shale formations onshore and by new offshore plays like Guyana, where Exxon's giant Liza field is expected to produce 120,000 barrels per day of crude in its first phase.
""Exxon Mobil continually reviews its assets for their contribution toward meeting the company’s operating needs, financial objectives and their potential value to others,"" a spokeswoman for Exxon said in a statement.
""We remain committed to conducting business in the U.S. Gulf region, as we have for more than 100 years.""
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Exxon's positions in the Gulf of Mexico include a 50 percent stake in development of the large Julia oil field, and a 47 percent stake in the Hadrian South natural gas field, which it operates. The company also has a 9 percent piece of Heidelberg field and 23 percent of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC), according to Exxon's latest annual report.
Exxon's partners in developing many of these sites could have a contractual right of first refusal on any opportunity to acquire Exxon's interest, one of the sources said.
Exxon has sold 29 leases or stakes in leases to other companies since 2014, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. 
The company has not acquired any leases from other companies in that period. In the last 10 federal lease sales of oil acreage, Exxon has bid on 28 leases, compared with rivals like BP, which has bid on 52 leases. 
Exxon shares were up 0.7 percent to $86.42 each on Tuesday. Shares have risen 6.5 percent this year, trailing broader equity averages.
Qatar, which has a number of partnerships with Exxon, including in Brazil, would be well positioned to make an offer for the Gulf of Mexico assets, the sources said. Exxon has an extensive partnership with Qatar, including partnering with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] to develop the world's largest non-associated natural gas field off that country's coast.
Qatar Petroleum also bought a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon's affiliates in Argentina in June, giving Qatar access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country.
Qatar Petroleum's chief executive told Reuters in May that the company was expanding its upstream business and assets abroad, particularly in the United States.
Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) holding smaller stakes.
It could not be established whether Qatar will indeed make an offer. Qatar government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

This week,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) agreed to sell its North Sea holdings off the shore of Britain.

The ADP private-sector payrolls numbers will be out at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
On average, economists expect that September payrolls rose to 187,000 from 163,000 the month before.
At 10:00 AM ET, the ISM will release its measure of September services activity.
The ISM non-manufacturing PMI is expected to have ticked down to 58.1 last month from 58.5 in August.
2. Lennar Reports Ahead of Trading; Pier 1 After
Homebuilder  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) reports earnings before the bell.
Analysts expect that the company earnings slipped from its profit in the year-ago period to $1.18 per share. Sales are expected to come in around $5.6 billion.
Investors will be looking to see if, like KB Home (NYSE:KBH), Lennar is seeing more strong demand, but for lower-end homes where inventory is limited.
Shares of Lennar have struggled this year and are down sharply from a high in January.
After the bell, struggling retailer  Pier 1 Imports  (NYSE:PIR) issues results. After posting a small profit in the same quarter a year ago, analysts expect the company lost 60 cents per share on sales of about $360 million.
Any upside surprise would be welcome for a stock that is languishing at a level not seen since 2009.
3. API Inventories Gain Underwhelms
Oil prices could resume their march higher tomorrow after inventory numbers this afternoon showed a smaller-than-expected rise last week.
The API said crude stockpiles rose by 907,000 barrels, down from a build of 2.9 million barrels the week before. That was lower than the 1.5 million barrel rise some energy analysts were predicting.
Official inventory data will be released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration tomorrow.
Oil prices took a breather today after a 3% rise Monday on concerns that oil producers won’t be able to make up for supply that will be lost when sanctions go into effect against Iran on Nov. 4."

239,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>","Toys 'R' Us lenders cancel auction, plan to revive brand","(Reuters) - The top lenders of Toys 'R' Us have decided to cancel the bankruptcy auction of its brand name and other intellectual property assets and instead plan to revive the Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us brand names, a court filing on Monday showed.
The bankrupt retailer's debtors aim to open a new Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us branding company that maintains existing global license agreements and can invest and develop new retail shops. 
The lenders also plan to expand its international presence and further develop its private brands business.
The bids were not superior to the plan to revive the brand as it did not offer ""probable economic recovery"" to creditors as well as benefits to stakeholders who would maintain the brands under the new independent U.S. business, the court filing showed. 
Toys ""R"" Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September last year, hoping to restructure some $5 billion in debt, much of which stemmed from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005.
But the company changed course in March, saying it would sell its operations in Canada, Asia and Europe, and shut down in the United States.

Under the intellectual property auction, the company had planned to sell its assets, including the brand names of Toys 'R' Us, Babies 'R' Us, registry lists, website domains, Geoffrey the Giraffe and other assets.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>","Amazon raises minimum wage to $15, urges rivals to follow","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Tuesday it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees from next month, giving in to critics of poor pay and working conditions at the world's second most valuable company.
The increase pushes Amazon's lowest wage above that at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) It is almost $3 shy of the average for a non-management worker in warehousing in the United States.
The online retailer also said it would now lobby in Washington D.C. for an increase in the federal minimum wage and urged its competitors to follow its lead as the union-led ""Fight for Fifteen"" movement pushes for higher remuneration.
Amazon's move comes when U.S. unemployment is at a near two-decade low as retailers and shippers compete for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season.
Several companies, including  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) and Macy's, have announced hiring to staff stores and handle holiday sales and delivery.
""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement.
The pay increase, effective from next month, will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees in the United States as well as over 100,000 seasonal employees who will be hired across the country this holiday season, the company said.
Christine Owens, executive director at advocacy group National Employment Law Project, said Amazon's call for changes at the federal level was a ""significant"" move.
""At $7.25, the federal minimum wage is a poverty wage. Having major, profitable employers like Amazon join the fight could help finally unstick it,"" she said.
Amazon, which became the second company after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to cross $1 trillion in market value last month, currently pays around $11 per hour. Analysts said the raise would cost it $1 billion or less annually but would be offset by a recent $20 increase in the cost of its Prime memberships.
""You've got a company that can't attract and keep labor because their wage rates are at the bottom of the pay scale, generally speaking,"" said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which closely tracks Amazon's fulfillment operation. 
""This is Amazon waking up and smelling the coffee.""
Amazon also said it was ending some restricted stock unit grants as it raised wages for hourly warehouse and customer service employees. 
The company's shares closed down 1.6 percent at $1,971.31 on Tuesday.
WORKER STRESS
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders credited Amazon on Tuesday for doing the ""right thing"" and called on other corporations in fast food, airlines and retail industries to follow the retailer in raising wages.
Amazon has long been criticized for tough conditions in its fulfillment centers and for its demanding work culture. 
That has included several fatalities, including one in 2013 when a conveyer system crushed a temporary worker in a New Jersey warehouse, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 
A separate OSHA investigation found that Amazon exposed some workers to stress from repeated exertions, bending and standing for up to 10 hours at a time. 
Like several of the big U.S. tech firms, Amazon is also facing increased official scrutiny over how much tax it pays.
""With the Trump administration having previously taken aim at Bezos and Amazon, they need to be proactive to position themselves positively in the court of public opinion,"" said Tom Gimble, CEO of recruiting firm LaSalle Network. 
""With many municipalities raising minimum wage over the next few years to approaching $15 per hour, this was not really a stretch for them to do that.""
Target Corp raised its minimum hourly wage last year to $11 and promised to raise it to $15 an hour by the end of 2020, while the world's largest retailer Walmart raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour earlier this year, even as both struggled with high transportation and raw material costs.
Amazon said it would increase its minimum wage for all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees.

Amazon also raised its minimum wage in Britain to 10.50 pounds ($13.59) an hour for all employees in the London area and 9.50 pounds an hour for staff in all other parts of the country, effective from Nov. 1.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Tesla worried by China tariffs even as deliveries surge,"By Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) announced record quarterly car production on Tuesday but warned of major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs that would force it to accelerate investment in its factory in Shanghai. 
In July, China raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent amid a worsening trade war with the United States. Tesla said the combination of tariffs and transportation costs was hurting Tesla sales in the world's biggest electric car market, sending shares down 2 percent to $304.37.
""Taking ocean transport costs and import tariffs into account, Tesla is now operating at a 55 percent to 60 percent cost disadvantage compared to the exact same car locally produced in China,"" the company said. 
The California-based electric carmaker, emerging from several months of turmoil stemming from its tweeting Chief Executive Elon Musk, said it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter, a 50 percent jump from its prior quarter as the company strives to master volume production.
Tesla has scrambled to get the Model 3 into the hands of customers, many of whom have been waiting since early 2016. Vehicles have piled up in lots around California awaiting transport, and Musk said last month that Tesla had moved from ""production hell to delivery logistics hell."" 
Tesla delivered 83,500 cars, including 55,840 Model 3 sedans, which topped Wall Street forecasts. 
As the quarter drew to a close on Sept. 30, Musk invited Tesla owners to volunteer at delivery centers to help new owners picking up their Model 3s, answering questions and giving vehicle overviews. 
Tesla reduced the number of Model 3s in transit to customers to 15 percent of total Model 3s delivered from 60 percent in the second quarter, a figure watched by analysts as an indicator of future revenue and of Tesla's efficiency. 
But the company in its release did not reiterate Musk's oft-repeated promise that Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in both its third and fourth quarters. Tesla is expected to release quarterly financial results next month.
Musk wrote in an email to employees on Saturday the company was ""very close to achieving profitability"" but for that it must stabilize a brutal ramp-up in output whose targets it has consistently struggled to meet. 
Tesla has been burning cash and holding out the promise that churning out Model 3s at volume and a profit could ease its crunch. The figures announced on Tuesday did not specify profit margins for the new car, although Tesla sold mostly higher-priced variants. 
""Bottom line is cash is tight,"" wrote Gene Munster, head of research at brokerage Loup Ventures, who estimated that Tesla needs $1.5 billion to sustain operations. It ended the second quarter with about $2.3 billion. ""This is a step in the right direction, but more work remains."" 
Tesla also is recovering from a fight with U.S. securities regulators over whether Musk misled investors when he tweeted in August that he was considering taking the company private and had secured funding. 
Tesla and Musk reached a settlement on Saturday where the billionaire will step down as the company's chairman but remain as chief executive.
On average, Tesla produced about 4,000 Model 3s per week during the quarter. It first hit a goal of building 5,000 vehicles in a week at the end of June, and had hoped to reach a new target of making 6,000 Model 3s per week by the end of August. 
CHINA PLANS
Amid the worsening of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, Tesla said it was speeding up construction of its Shanghai Gigafactory but provided no details.
Musk in July landed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new combined auto and battery plant in Shanghai, its first outside the United States and a key to doubling its global capacity. Local debt, he said, would finance the factory, which Tesla estimated would cost about $2 billion.
Tigress Research analyst Ivan Feinseth said Musk ""continues to downplay"" the need for cash to fund projects beyond the China plant.

""I believe he will need to raise additional money even if he is profitable for this quarter as he as projected,"" said Feinseth, citing the cost of the upcoming electric semi-truck and the Model Y SUV.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The whistleblower who helped reveal suspected money laundering at Danske Bank will consider an invitation from an EU parliament committee, his lawyer said on Tuesday, adding there is a ""good chance"" he will attend a hearing next month. 
The European Parliament said on Tuesday it would invite the whistleblower to testify on Nov. 21 before its special committee on financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance.
Last week, Danish newspaper Berlingske named the whistleblower as Howard Wilkinson, a former head of Danske Bank's trading business in the Baltics.
Danske reported last month that 200 billion euros ($235 billion) of payments moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 - an amount equivalent to 10 times Estonia's GDP. It said many of the transactions it had analysed appeared suspicious.
Wilkinson's lawyer Stephen Kohn of U.S.-based Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto said he had not yet received the invitation. Wilkinson is not obliged to accept the European Parliament's invitation.
""There is a good chance he will attend the hearing,"" Kohn told Reuters, adding that terms would have to be agreed with Danske Bank.
Wilkinson, a Briton, signed a non-disclosure agreement with the bank when he left in 2014.
The Danish bank faces criminal investigations in Denmark and Estonia and Britain's National Crime Agency said it was examining the use of UK-registered companies related to suspected money laundering at Danske.
Wilkinson is not obliged to accept the European Parliament's invitation. Normally such a hearing would be public and broadcast live, committee spokesman Jeppe Kofod told Reuters.
""I fully understand his concerns about reprisals. Therefore, I am also open for his testimony to be delivered in a way that is safe and secure for him,"" Kofod said.
The hearing would allow committee members to pinpoint exactly where Danske and the Danish and Estonian financial watchdogs failed, he said.

""That would allow us as legislators to tighten up the relevant EU legislation and strengthen the supervision of the banks and national supervisory authorities so that we hope in the future to avoid the range of huge money laundering scandals that have hit Europe recently,"" Kofod said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) on Tuesday said it will acquire Eloquii, a fashion startup that sells plus-sized clothing, for an undisclosed amount as it continues to look for ways to appeal to younger shoppers and differentiate from rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Eloquii, a four-year-old startup, sells apparel starting at size 14 through its own website and through five of its own stores. Walmart, the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, said Eloquii has seen its revenue grow by three times since 2015, without giving more details. 
Plus-size apparel is part of a $21 billion market and represents one of the fastest growing segments in women's apparel, Walmart said in a statement. More than half of women between the ages of 18 to 65 in the United States wear size 14 or higher, the retailer said.
""These customers have been historically underserved, with clothing limited by its lack of fashion, lack of fit, or both,"" Walmart said. 
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has previously acquired smaller digital brands like Modcloth and Bonobos to complement its online assortment.
Eloquii CEO Mariah Chase, the startup's management team and 100 employees will continue to be based in Long Island City, New York, and Columbus, Ohio. They will join Walmart's U.S. e-commerce team, reporting to Andy Dunn, senior vice-president of digital consumer brands at Walmart U.S. eCommerce.
""We are laser focused on developing a portfolio of direct to consumer brands with a unique assortment you can't find anywhere else,"" Dunn said in a separate blog post on Tuesday. 
The Eloquii brand was first created by retail chain The Limited in 2011 but was discontinued a little over a year later. A team of employees with help from an outside investor bought the brand and relaunched it in 2014. 

Walmart said the deal is expected to close this quarter.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 01:15PM ET</span>","Intel helps Wall Street shrug off Italy woes, sends Dow to record","By Medha Singh and Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks shrugged off a weak start to climb higher on Tuesday, as Intel boosted technology stocks and pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record high.
Intel (O:INTC) jumped 5.1 percent, but analysts could not find a new trigger, with some suggesting that the stock was reviving Friday's rally after the chipmaker assuaged concerns over its business.
The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index (SOX) climbed 1.20 percent, its strongest gain in what is set to be a four-day rally, while technology stocks (SPLRCT) rose 0.48 percent.
Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, compared with only three gainers earlier in the session. The materials index (SPLRCM) was up 0.53 percent, while the communication services index (SPLRCL) rose 0.19 percent.
""We're having a relatively benign market on either side of the spectrum, but specifically in terms of rotation we're having a large-cap play today and you are seeing small caps down modestly,"" said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.
At 12:31 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.49 percent, at 26,780.56, easing after hitting a record high of 26,793.35. The S&P 500 (SPX) was up 0.16 percent, at 2,929.15, while the Nasdaq (IXIC) was little changed at 8,041.40.
But, underscoring the influence of large-cap stocks, declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The smallcap Russell 2000 index (RUT) was off 0.59 percent. Smaller names had been seen as more immune to trade pressures and had dropped on Monday after the NAFTA deal was salvaged.
Also holding on to their losses were financials (SPSY), which shed 0.3 percent as U.S. lenders followed their Italian peers lower after a senior lawmaker in one of Italy's ruling parties said most of the country's problems would be resolved if it readopted a national currency.
Those comments, which added to concerns over Italy's coalition's proposal last week of a budget with a higher-than-expected deficit target, pressured world stocks and weighed on Wall Street earlier in the day.
""Some of the flat-modestly lower sentiment could be a spillover from the situation in Italy and with banks being hit rather hard there is some potential spillover,"" said Larson.
The defensive utilities (SPLRCU) sector was the biggest gainer among sectors, rising 1.4 percent.
The laggards included Facebook (O:FB), falling more than 1 percent for the third session in a row amid continuing calls to use legislation to force technology firms take responsibilities for online security seriously.
PepsiCo (O:PEP) fell 0.9 percent as disappointing margins due to higher commodity and transport costs overshadowed a quarterly profit that beat estimates.

The S&P index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 94 new lows.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. military comes to grips with over-reliance on Chinese imports,"By Phil Stewart and Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Pentagon-led review ordered by President Donald Trump has identified hundreds of instances where the U.S. military depends on foreign countries, especially China, for critical materials, U.S. officials said.
    The study is expected to be released in the coming weeks and aims to lessen the U.S. military's reliance on foreign countries and strengthen U.S. industry. 
    Among the study's conclusions will be a determination the United States is too dependent on foreign suppliers for a range of items including some micro-electronics, tiny components such as integrated circuits and transistors, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
    These kinds of essential components are embedded in advanced electronics used in everything from satellites and cruise missiles to drones and cellphones.
The focus on China reflects an effort under Trump to address the risks to U.S. national security from Beijing's growing military and economic clout. Pentagon officials want to be sure China is not able to hobble America's military by cutting off supplies of materials or by sabotaging technology it exports.
The report could add to mounting trade tensions with China, bolstering the Trump administration's ""Buy American"" initiative, which aims to help drum up billions of dollars more in arms sales for U.S. manufacturers and create more jobs.
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesman, did not comment on the contents of the report but told Reuters the study would make recommendations ""to ensure a robust, resilient, secure and ready manufacturing and defense industrial base.""
China, which has also become the main supplier of many of the rare earth minerals used by the United States, will be given special emphasis in the report, said the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
    A January analysis from the United States Geological Survey said the United States produced no rare earth minerals in 2017 while China accounted for 81 percent of global mine production. Rare earth minerals are used in magnets, radars and consumer electronics. 
Aside from the risk that a foreign power could cut off vital supplies needed to keep the U.S. military up and running, other risks include the threat of sabotaged equipment or espionage. 
The Pentagon has long fretted that ""kill switches"" could be embedded in transistors that could turn off sensitive U.S. systems in a conflict. U.S. intelligence officials also warned this year about the possibility China could use Chinese-made mobile phones and network equipment to spy on Americans. 
    When the study is released, it will not provide a detailed inventory of all of the weaknesses in the supply chain. These will be in a classified annex.
A U.S. official said the report will also examine U.S. shortcomings that contribute to purchases from foreign companies, including roller-coaster U.S. defense budgets that make it difficult for companies to predict government demand. Another weakness is in U.S. science and technology education. 
BOLSTERING U.S. INDUSTRY
    Advocates of the study say it is a late but critical look at ways to address America's loss of manufacturing, whose toll on national security gets far less attention than the jobs lost, and the political wave that it created in rust-belt states that helped elect Trump president in 2016.
    ""People used to think you could outsource the manufacturing base without any repercussions (on national security). But now we know that's not the case,"" said one U.S. official familiar with the report, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
    One aspect of the report's recommendation is expected to be ensuring profitability for niche U.S. producers of critical components in American weaponry.
    Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, has publicly spoken in recent weeks about the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950, which allows the U.S. president to incentivize domestic producers of critical materials through purchase commitments and other guarantees.
    Lord said the government should step in to offer such support if businesses would be unable to ensure a ""reasonable profit.""   
The U.S. Government Accountability Office offered one example in a report last year about how the U.S. military had to fund a U.S. factory in 2014 to produce the chemical Butanetriol, used in the Hellfire air-to-surface missile.
For the previous six years, the military relied on China for the chemical.

Munich prosecutors are investigating Stadler and another member of Audi's senior management for suspected fraud and false advertising related to illegal emissions by its cars and manipulation of vehicle tests.
The departure of Stadler came as the German government presented a plan to cut pollution from diesel vehicles in the country's continuing efforts to negotiate the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal that surfaced three years ago.
Stadler is leaving his posts as management board member of the Volkswagen group and as CEO of Audi with immediate effect, VW said in a statement.
He had been suspended after he was taken into custody in mid-June on suspicion of interfering with an emissions investigation. Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement.
Both VW and premium brand Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.
""Mr. Stadler is (leaving) because, due to his ongoing pre-trial detention, he is unable to fulfil his duties as a member of the management board and wishes to concentrate on his defense,"" VW said in its statement on Tuesday.
PIECH CONFIDANT
Following his arrest, Munich prosecutors said that Stadler, the most senior active VW official to be remanded in custody since the scandal broke, was being held on fears he might hinder their investigation.
Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group's controlling Piech clan.
A statement from acting Audi chief Schot thanked Stadler for his 11 years at the helm, noting that the company had almost doubled its sales in that time and that Stadler had also pushed for development of electric cars.
Peter Mosch, works council chief and deputy head of Audi's supervisory board, said the move gave the company more clarity for the future.
In July Volkswagen recruited BMW (DE:BMWG) engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it to shake off the scandal.

A source familiar with the matter said that severance payment terms for Stadler would depend on the investigators' findings. Stadler's VW contract was due to run to the end of next year and his Audo CEO contract to the end of 2023.

The decision to move ahead with one potential supplier, expected to be confirmed ahead of a Nato conference this week, will likely spark a backlash from parts of the defense establishment as it has been done without a competitive process, according to the report.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","LVMH watch brands to attend Baselworld 2019, changes needed for 2020","ZURICH (Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH's (PA:LVMH) watch brands will be present at the next edition of the Baselworld watch fair in March, the outgoing head of its watch division told CNN Money Switzerland, adding the world's biggest trade show needs to make changes in 2020.
""We already decided that we would attend (in 2019), I decided that before retiring"", Jean-Claude Biver who hands over responsibility for LVMH's watch brands TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith to Stephane Bianchi at the end of the month, said in an interview available on CNN's website on Tuesday.
He said the decision to attend had been made together with other Swiss watch brands, such as Rolex and Patek Philippe. 
Swatch Group (S:UHR) announced this summer it would no longer attend the fair that has been criticized as being too expensive and inefficient and already lost half of its exhibiting brands in 2018.
""We want to take advantage of 2019 to see together with the organizers what Basel 2020 could be. What are our wishes, our constraints (...) If we can manage that together with the fair, there is no reason we wouldn't stay,"" said Biver who is staying non-executive chairman of the LVMH watch division.
""If we cannot find solutions (...), probably we'll leave,"" Biver said, adding the fair needed to take place at the beginning of the year instead of March and prices for exhibiting brands, but also for hotel rooms in Basel, needed to come down. 
""I agree with Swatch Group that the fair has never adapted to the 21st century, it is true.""
The rival Geneva watch fair, dominated by Richemont brands, has so far been seen as benefiting from Baselworld's problems. Last week, however, Geneva also saw independent brands Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille announce their exit from the show from 2020.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>",Shell's LNG Canada seen as tip of megaproject iceberg,"By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - The launch of a massive liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Canada has finally fired the starting gun on a wave of plan approvals around the world, needed to avoid a supply crunch after 2020.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said it would export LNG from Western Canada by 2025 after approving a $14 billion project, hot on the heels of Qatar's commitment last week to expand its facilities. 
The two announcements, adding 37 million tonnes a year (mtpa) to the 290 million tonnes traded in 2017, are just the start of project approvals - known as final investment decisions (FIDs) - that have been waiting in company drawers while LNG prices recovered from a three-year slump.
""We believe 2019 could be the busiest year of LNG FIDs ever,"" Wood Mackenzie's director of North America gas, Dulles Wang, said. 
Despite a slump in global LNG prices between 2015 and 2017, many had long worried there would be a global supply gap at some point after 2020 due to broadly fast-rising demand and the lack of new export projects to produce corresponding supply.
Several projects that had been touted for years, such as Shell's LNG Canada venture, were put on the backburner. 
LNG prices began climbing last winter and have since broadly stayed at four-year highs, seasonally, driven by China's policy-dictated shift to gas away from coal.
""If you look at the demand curve and the supply coming on stream, there are simply not enough projects that are being sanctioned or under development to meet demand by 2023-24,"" Shell's chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, told reporters on Tuesday.
Shell's vote of confidence in these new market conditions now gives credence that projects with capacities of around 175 mtpa will be approved by the end of next year as planned, with most expected to be running by 2024.
Aside from these, projects with another 51 mtpa in the United States have already been approved and are expected to start operations between now and the end of 2021. 
Forecasts vary, but LNG demand is expected to jump to about 360 mtpa by 2023, the International Energy Agency has said, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie is projecting 450 mtpa.
""There needs to be 200 mtpa LNG capacity authorized by 2025 to meet future demand – this is a colossal boom, a 42 percent expansion on the entire capacity installed since 1962,"" Bernstein analysts said in a research note.
""Ultimately, this is the start of a major LNG investment wave,"" Bernstein said. 
Qatar Petroleum said it would build a fourth mega train, or production facility, with capacity of 32 mtpa to bring its supply to 110 mtpa by early 2023, more than twice China's consumption today and enough to feed China's demand that year.
Other large project approvals on the horizon include Novatek's Arctic LNG-2 project with 19.8 mtpa capacity after the Russian gas company's Yamal export facility started operations smoothly and quickly at the end of last year.
Two projects are planned in Mozambique backed by different commercial models: Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobil's, like LNG Canada, does not make use of long-term offtake agreements to finance it. The other is more conventional, operated by Anadarko.
A host of U.S. approvals are also anticipated, including from Tellurian for the 27.6-mtpa Driftwood project in the first quarter of next year, which is seen as a potential industry disruptor because of its LNG supply pricing models.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (N:C) plans to boost the United Arab Emirates' role as an offshore booking center and is working towards a full banking license in Saudi Arabia, helping to propel its regional growth, a senior executive told Reuters.
Growth in the Middle East and Africa region is expected to be above the market average of around four percent in 2018 and 2019, driven by both countries, Atiq Rehman, Citi's Chief Executive of Middle East and Africa, said in an interview.
""We are focused on what we can do within the UAE and very focused on what we can do from the UAE,"" he said. ""We want to grow our business here and make it into a regional offshore booking center for a lot of our loans.""
More of the bank's multinational corporate clients were using the United Arab Emirates as a center for their business in Middle East and Africa, he said.
He said since the bank began booking loans from the UAE a year or two ago, the growth had been exponential.
""Instead of London and New York we are booking them here as there's a lot of benefit from doing so because of costs, time zone management and there's a good set of regulations here,"" he said.
""My vision is to turn the UAE into a proper booking center for all sorts of transactions, not just for loans but derivatives, trade and all.""
Brexit will lead to some opportunities to grow Citi's offshore booking business in the UAE but there were also the openings from the number of transactions in the region, he said.
Growth for Citi in the Middle East and Africa would also be led by Saudi Arabia, where the bank was working towards applying for a full banking license, he said.
More than a dozen foreign banks have license to operate branches in Saudi Arabia, battling for business resulting from the kingdom's efforts to ease its reliance on oil revenue.
Citi ended a five-decade presence in Saudi Arabia in 2004 but in 2015 won permission to invest directly in the local stock market and in January this year gained approval to begin investment banking operations.
Since then, it has picked up more advisory deals and other business there, he said, adding Citi would like to add custody and brokerage services in the future, but not retail banking.

Citi operates in 25 markets in the Middle East and Africa. The region contributes around 7 percent of the bank's global net income, he said.

The review was prompted by weakness in GE's power business, Moody's said.
GE said on Monday it would take a roughly $23 billion charge to write off goodwill in its power division and would fall short of its forecast for free cash flow and earnings per share for 2018 due to weakness in the business.
The company also ousted CEO John Flannery, replacing him with board member Larry Culp, who is known for turning around industrial equipment supplier Danaher Corp (N:DHR).
While the latest change was an additional concern for the review, which will be addressed within a few weeks, a potential downgrade of the long-term ratings of GE and GE Capital may not be limited to one notch, Moody's said.
GE shares reversed course and fell about 2 percent to $11.85 in morning trading.

The company's shares gained as much as 16 percent on Monday, but are still down about 31 percent for the year.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 10:26AM ET</span>","PepsiCo beats on international strength, North America beverage rebound","(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) posted stronger-than-expected profit on Tuesday, boosted by beverage sales in North America that rose after a year of declines and as investments in marketing and developing new products for emerging markets paid off.
Shares of the company were up nearly 1 percent in early trading.
The sales rebound in North America came as PepsiCo expanded its portfolio with more non-carbonated drinks and sparkling water, launching brands such as Lifewtr and Bubly, while adding healthier options to its sports drink line Gatorade. 
The company also boosted advertising behind its trademark colas - Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero - to claw back market share from larger rival  Coca-Cola Co  Inc (N:KO). 
North America beverage sales rose 2.3 percent in the third-quarter ended Sept. 8, but were short of analysts' average estimate of a 5 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Frito-Lay, the company's snack division, saw sales rise 2.6 percent in North America. 
Faced with lagging demand for sugary sodas and salty snacks in its home market, PepsiCo has over the years shifted to building scale in emerging markets, where organic sales rose 10 percent in the quarter, helped by marketing and new product launches in Mexico, India and China.
""We continued to see very strong operating performance from our international divisions, propelled by developing and emerging markets,"" Indra Nooyi said in a statement. 
Nooyi will step down as Pepsi's chief executive officer on Wednesday, handing the reins to company President Ramon Laguarta. She will stay on as chairman until early 2019. 
PepsiCo said it now expects its full-year organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and forex impact, to grow at least 3 percent, up from a prior forecast of 2.3 percent rise. 
The company, however, expects a stronger dollar to hit full-year core earnings per share by one percentage point.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $2.50 billion, or $1.75 per share, in the third quarter, from $2.14 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.59 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.57.
Net revenue rose 1.5 percent to $16.49 billion. 
Analysts on average had expected revenue of $16.36 billion.

283,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 09:37AM ET</span>",Elon Musk is out as Tesla's chairman — but some big questions for the board still remain,"After a dramatic weekend, Elon Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla's board and pay a $20 million fine  to settle a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding his failed bid to take the electric-car maker private in August.
But even with Musk out, there are still some major issues facing Tesla's board of directors, according to Glass Lewis, one of the largest and most influential proxy advisor firms. The firm had previously raised its concerns ahead of  Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in May — but many of its recommendations were not passed.
In an interview with Business Insider, Glass Lewis' head of environmental, social, and governance research explained why the SEC settlement pushes Tesla's board into uncharted waters, and that many of these problems would have been more easily fixed if it had gone about them on its own time.
""It gets challenging when it gets to this point,"" Courteney Keatinge, head of ESG at Glass Lewis, told Business Insider on Monday.
""Once a company has had so many scandals and there are leadership issues, it can get challenging to change that dynamic. This would have gone over easier if it were something the board had determined on its own with the support of Elon Musk. Ultimately, this is getting at what we think is best for the company and for shareholders.""
Still, many of the board seats are held by directors that Glass Lewis says aren't adequately independent. Tesla discloses two directors — Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal — as non-independent, meaning they have connections that could deem them insiders. Two others, however, deserve this distinction and contribute to Glass Lewis' concerns: Antonio Gracias and Brad Buss.
""What's particularly concerning regarding director Gracias, is that he is on the audit committee which is a committee we really want unquestionably independent directors to be sitting on,"" Keatinge said. Gracias is the CEO of Valor Management, a private-equity firm that has received past commitments from a revocable trust owned by Elon Musk. Additionally, VMC has been paid consulting fees by Tesla in the past, Glass Lewis said.
Brad Buss has served on Tesla's board since 2009, when he served in various executive roles at SolarCity, including CFO until until 2016 when the company was acquired by Tesla. The company considers him independent, but Glass Lewis says this connection makes him unfit for the board's audit committee.
To be fair, the duo's connections on paper don't necessarily mean Gracias and Buss can't vote independently in the board room. ""What's important to remember is that boards are a big group of people,"" Keatinge explained. ""And there are differently personalities and traits that people have. However, we're not in the board room, so it's hard for us to understand how the board is working if there is an actual check on Elon Musk and his behavior.""
Even if Musk's removal as chairman is a wake-up call for shareholders, replacing nearly half of the directors won't be something investors can do in a single vote thanks to the staggered terms used by Tesla.
""Not every director is up for election every year, which serves to entrench the board,"" Keatinge said. ""So shareholders were not able to vote on whether or not they should continue to remain on the board and will serve a three-year term.""
A Tesla spokesperson pushed back against Glass Lewis' analysis in an email late Tuesday, pointing to the company's proxy statement which says all board members with the exception of Elon Musk are ""independent directors"" as defined by Nasdaq's listing standards. 
Going forward it all comes down to who the board chooses to replace Musk as chairman.
""Things can change drastically even in a year,"" said Keatinge.
""It will depend on what Elon Musk's relationship and what the board member's relationship with the independent chair looks like and that's really going to determine how effective this individual can be. It is an entrenched board and there are a lot of personal ties to Musk, so its hard to tell if they will that director the deference it will require."""

285,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Italy Contagion Fears Bubbling Beneath Surface of Apparent Calm,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest collision between Italy’s markets and politics is beginning to fuel concern that shock waves could spread to elsewhere in Europe.
As Italian bond yields climbed toward multi-year highs, the euro extended losses and the region’s equities slumped, while haven assets such as German bunds and the Swiss franc rallied.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned that the risk of a wider impact of the Italian turmoil has increased, even as markets in Spain and Portugal -- seen as a key barometer for any debt contagion to Europe’s periphery -- have so far shown little sign of anxiety.
Budget official Claudio Borghi’s comments that the common currency is “not sufficient” to solve the country’s fiscal problems have rekindled worries that a breakup of the world’s largest trade bloc is still a possibility. He later denied that the country’s populist government had any plans to leave the euro.
“European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Alessio Rizzi wrote in a research note. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen.”
Markets were firmly in risk-off mode Tuesday, with demand rising for popular risk hedges. Italy’s two-year bonds took the brunt of the selling pressure, flattening the country’s yield curve. The cost of protection against a potential credit default by the nation rose and traders priced in a greater premium for three-month money-market borrowings over overnight loans.
Euro, Yields
The euro dropped by as much as 0.6 percent Tuesday to $1.1505, a six-week low. Italian 10-year yields climbed 14 basis points to 3.44 percent, re-testing a May 29 peak that was a four-year high. The spread over those on their German peers breached 300 basis points for the second time this year.
Still, there’s little sign yet of a contagion effect across peripheral euro-area bonds. Ten-year yields in Spain and Portugal were little changed at 1.53 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively. Similar rates in Greece climbed nine basis points to 4.31 percent.
The yield premium investors demand on benchmark Italian bonds over Spain has hit a seven-year high and is climbing toward a record 202 basis points reached in 2011. Strategists at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA including Jaime Costero expect the spread to widen further, as Spanish debt retains its appeal amid little spillover impact from Italy’s market volatility.
“Political developments in Italy are still center-stage and will probably continue to remain the most critical driver for the euro for the time being,” analysts at UniCredit SpA wrote in a note. “Still, contained contagion in the bond markets implies that the budget talks are still perceived as a “local” issue. The market behavior suggests to us that the Italian developments are likely to just add “noise” to the common currency at the moment, but are not seen as grave enough to trigger a heavy sell-off.”
‘Fade the Pop’
Strategists at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA led by Valentin Marinov remain bullish on the euro as they see most of the Italy-related negativity already priced in, and with continued support from the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy normalization. Even as Italy’s bonds and stocks saw increased volatility in recent months as the country’s Five Star Movement-League coalition drew up their deficit targets, the shared currency had been relatively resilient.
The Italian economy’s underlying strength may mean it’s time to ease out of risk-off hedges despite political risks, according to Mizuho International Plc.
“The protection trades are ramping up,” head of European rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. But “this is a great opportunity for investors to fade the pop in some structures. Most obvious, to us, is to fade the rally in German bonds outright, as we do not think this flare-up between Italy and the EU will drag on the euro-area economy.”
‘Sore Point’
For others, Italy’s euroskeptic government is just the embodiment of the the populist sentiment taking root across Europe, which could threaten the bloc’s future and weigh on the euro for the months or even years to come.
Borghi, head of Italy’s lower house budget committee and a well-known euroskeptic, said in an interview on Radio Anch’io that “Italy, with its own currency, would be able to resolve its problems.”
“The comments about Italy having its own currency have touched a sore point,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank International. “While the return of the lira would be almost impossible and hugely inflationary even if it could happen, the fact that the remarks can be read as anti-EMU sentiment are worrisome.”

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African construction firm Group Five (J:GRFJ) will cut more jobs as it seeks to trim loss-making divisions, it said on Tuesday, highlighting an industry-wide slump in its home market that has left many companies fighting for survival.
South African construction companies have been hit hard in recent years as stagnant economic growth has hobbled public infrastructure spending, prompting some of them to file business rescues, similar to chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States.
Group Five is going through a restructuring in which it has closed multiple non-profitable businesses in its local construction unit and cut 602 permanent staff in the 2018 financial year.
It is cutting more jobs in its money-losing Engineer, Procure and Construction (EPC) division, which already lost 175 employees last year.
The EPC business suffered an 82.3 percent slump in revenue to 386.9 million rand ($26.91 million) in the 2018 fiscal year, which also widened the operating loss at group level.
""Numbers of workers to be retrenched are still a work in progress right now but the main areas affected will be our EPC business as we continue to resize for the current market,"" said Chief Executive Themba Mosai.
Group Five posted a full-year operating loss of 1.4 billion rand compared with 718 million rand loss the prior year, due to higher costs from the delayed Kpone power project in Ghana.
Mosai was cautiously optimistic about President Cyril Ramaphosa's plan to launch a 400 billion rand fund aimed at re-igniting infrastructure spending even as the sector has suffered delayed payments of some government contracts.
The fund is part of a long-awaited stimulus package seeking to revitalise an economy that recently slipped into recession.
""The partnership between private sector and the government is important to bring infrastructure development into the country,"" said Mosai. ""The fact that the government is focused on that means that we can deliver quite a lot of infrastructure in a short space of time.""
Mosai also said that the downsized local construction business was on the right path to return to profit in the 2019 financial year.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",StanChart Kenya's CEO says sluggish credit growth not sustainable,"By Duncan Miriri
NAIROBI (Reuters) - An annual private sector credit growth rate of less than 5 percent cannot sustain Kenya's required economic development, the CEO of  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Kenya (NR:SCBK) said on Tuesday. 
The government should consider repealing its cap on commercial rates in the long run to boost credit growth, which plunged to close to zero from double digit expansion after the cap was imposed in September 2016, Lamin Manjang told Reuters.
The cap, at four percentage points above the central bank's policy rate, was a bid to lower credit costs. 
An attempt by Finance Minister Henry Rotich to repeal the cap in June was blocked by lawmakers in August.
""The rate cap is still unfortunate. Obviously, the overall credit growth in the market is still below 5 percent which is really not sustainable. It is not optimal,"" he said during an interview in his office.
""In the long run it is better to have market forces determine interest rates.""
Lawmakers have removed a floor on commercial deposit interest rates, which had been set at 70 percent of the central bank rate, a move that Manjang said was a ""step in the right direction.""
He said it would help lenders to boost their margins, without providing details. 
Bank sector earnings rebounded in the first half of the year after being pummeled by the cap and other factors including a drought and election jitters last year, Manjang said.
He attributed the turnaround to stable economic fundamentals, cost reduction, proper management of the risks posed by the rate cap, as well as investments in digital channels aimed at boosting cost efficiency.
StanChart Kenya expects to maintain its performance in the second half of this year, after revenue grew in the first half and profit surged by close to a third, Manjang said.
The bank's wealth management business, which offers customers investment products such as mutual funds and fixed income, was growing at 30 percent per year, he said. 
The wealth management business, which also includes insurance policies, accounts for a fifth of the bank's annual revenue from retail banking.
The bank plans to roll out an enhanced version of its mobile banking application by the end of the year, allowing customers to complete tasks such as opening accounts and applying for loans without the need to visit a branch, Manjang said.
The enhanced app, which was successfully rolled out in Ivory Coast earlier this year as Standard Chartered set its sights on the retail market in the west African nation, is part of a $1.5 billion investment in digital channels announced by parent Standard Chartered [STANB.UL].
""The need for branches has become less,"" Manjang said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year bond yield soared to a 4-1/2 year high on Tuesday after an Italian lawmaker said that most of the country's problems would be solved by ditching the euro, deepening market concerns over its public finances.
The comments by Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League party, pushed the spread (IT10YT=RR) (DE10YT=RR) between Italian and German yields to the widest in more than five years, briefly hitting 302 basis points and as euro zone officials warned of a return to crisis days, the Italian/Spanish yield gap was at its widest over any closing price in the last 20 years.
The reference to the possibility of Italy leaving the euro jolted a market already shaken by a budget proposal last week that put Rome on a collision course with Brussels.
Borghi on Tuesday clarified that the government had no intention of leaving the euro and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy is totally committed to the currency.
This bought some calm to bond markets, with Italian yields pulling away from their highs, but borrowing costs remained elevated as concerns about the fallout from Italy's 2019 budget plans lingered.
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated Italy would not change its budget deficit targets.
""Fundamentally, investors know Italy's government is not going to turn on its commitments, so you are still going to have a fiscal policy that is inappropriate, given Italy's debt metrics,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
Italy's 10-year government bond yield (IT10YT=RR) hit a 4-1/2 year high of 3.44 percent, before pulling back to 3.36 percent -- still up 7 basis points on the day. 
Italy's two-year bond yield was up 5 bps at 1.42 percent and five-year yields briefly jumped 21 bps to 2.77 percent, both hitting their highest in about four months. (IT2YT=RR) (IT5YT=RR)
Trading volume in two-year BTP futures in the last two days is the heaviest since May .
""In this environment when everyone is nervous, these comments just add to the risk-off sentiment,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Christoph Rieger. ""It smells clearly like the crisis days,"" he added, referring to the euro zone debt crisis of 2010-2012, when the breakup of the bloc was a possibility.
Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker comparing Italy with Greece. 
ITALIAN BANKS, EURO HIT
The euro fell to a six-week low at $1.1505 (EUR=) after Borghi's comment and shares in Italian banks (FTIT8300), whose government bond holdings make them sensitive to political developments, fell as much as 3.9 percent to their lowest in 19 months on fears a bond sell-off would cut their capital ratios, raise their funding costs and hamper efforts to cut bad loans. 
The bank index was down 0.8 percent, with shares in Italy's largest lenders  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) both falling more than 2.5 to multi-month lows.
The cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign debt and the debt of the country's largest lenders also rose sharply. 
The Italian government is to finalize the 2019-2021 budget program later on Tuesday, Di Maio said.
""Neither the EU or Italy is incentivized to compromise it seems, at least in the opening gambit of the talks,"" said Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. 
He said Italy's 10-year borrowing costs could reach 4 percent by the end of the year.
Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields fell as investors retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such as Germany, Netherlands and Austria. 

Germany's 10-year bond yield slipped three bps to 0.44 percent (DE10YT=RR), while Spanish and Portuguese bond yields (ES10YT=RR) (PT10YT=RR) were little changed - showing no signs of contagion from the Italy bond sell off.

PARIS (Reuters) - Carmakers ratcheted up their Brexit warnings on Tuesday, with France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) both saying UK production would suffer if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.
With less than six months before Britain is due to quit the EU on March 29, businesses are increasingly alarmed about the lack of agreement over future trading relations and the possibility of tariffs, delays at ports and extra red tape.
The car industry, one of the few British manufacturing success stories of recent decades, is particularly at risk given the thousands of parts, engines and finished models that move between Britain and the continent every day.
BMW boss Harald Krueger told the Paris Motor Show that he sees a ""50:50 chance"" of a disorderly, or 'hard', Brexit and that this would lead the company to shift more production of its Mini vehicles - currently focused on its Oxford plant in southern England - to the Netherlands.
""I told (UK Prime Minister) Theresa May and the European Union that if there is a hard Brexit, both sides are losers. We will no longer fulfill trade agreements and then we are forced to build the car in the Netherlands,"" Krueger told journalists.
Carlos Tavares, the head of  Peugeot  and Opel maker PSA Group, which has two factories in Britain, also said a no-deal Brexit would be damaging.
""My plan is to tell Mrs May and Mr Barnier (the EU's chief Brexit negotiator) that a no-deal (Brexit) is not acceptable,"" he told reporters.
Such an outcome would have ""significant consequences"", he added without elaborating.
Dieter Zetsche, head of German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), also told the Paris event that scenarios involving a disorderly Brexit were ""highly worrying"".
The executives' comments come as the British prime minister said she was preparing to make a new offer to the EU in an effort to break the Brexit talks deadlock.
The various Brexit complications come against the backdrop of a range of challenges facing automakers, including the rollout of costly electric vehicles, tougher emissions rules and potential disruption to trade from the rise of protectionism.
Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which warned last month that the wrong kind of Brexit could cost tens of thousands of car jobs, told Reuters it had not made a decision whether to build electric cars in its home market because of uncertainty over future trading relations.
Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance that has a large assembly plant in northeast England, also complained about the lack of clarity.
""We are in a situation where everybody is frozen,"" he said.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>","Japan car makers welcome North America trade deal, but U.S. export curbs a risk","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota, Nissan and Mazda welcomed on Tuesday the revised North America trade deal that left Japanese automakers unscathed but they may face a bumpy ride when Washington and Tokyo hold new talks on over $40 billion of annual U.S. auto imports from Japan. 
The United States and Canada reached an agreement on Sunday to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement after Washington had forged a separate trade deal with Mexico in August.
The updated deal effectively maintains the auto industry's current footprint in North America, and spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S. national security tariffs on their vehicles.
Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261), which ships cars to the United States from Mexico and Japan, called the deal a ""big step forward"". Nissan Motor Corp (T:7201), which makes the cars it sells in the United States locally as well as in Mexico, Japan and other countries, said it was ""encouraged"" by the agreement.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Japan's biggest automaker, said it was ""pleased"" that a basic deal was reached. Other automakers were not immediately available for comment.
While the deal has removed the risk that the disintegration of the pact would have posed to automakers, bigger risks loom large for Japanese firms as a chunk of the roughly 7 million cars they sold in the U.S. last year were shipped from Japan, and a trade deal between Washington and Tokyo has yet to be agreed. 
The United States and Japan last week agreed to begin fresh trade talks, with U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to address Japan's $69 billion trade surplus, of which nearly two-thirds comes from auto exports.
Washington is also investigating the possibility of slapping 25 percent tariffs on auto imports on national security grounds, although it has agreed with Japan to put any new tariffs on hold during the talks.
Analysts say the United States may take a tougher stance on auto imports from Japan than from its neighbors.
""If Japan requests an exemption from the 25 percent tariffs under consideration, Washington could propose a more strict cap on imports than it agreed to with Mexico and Canada,"" said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities.
""That would be a risk.""
This could be a big blow to Japan, as the United States is a key source of revenue for Japanese automakers including Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co (T:7267).
The U.S. market accounts for a quarter or more of their annual global vehicle sales, and of their total U.S. sales, and depending on the automaker, as much as half of those was shipped from Japan last year.
A side letter to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as the new deal agreed on Sunday is called, states that Mexico and Canada would each get a tariff-free passenger vehicle quota of 2.6 million annual export units, well above their current export levels. 

""I don't think that will happen in the case of Japan,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama, adding that U.S. automakers, which sell very few cars in Japan, would stand to lose little from any trade barriers with Japan.

The company’s struggling North American beverage unit returned to growth in the third quarter, helping the company beat earnings estimates as the longtime chief executive officer hands the reins to deputy Ramon Laguarta on Wednesday. The maker of Mountain Dew and Tostitos also got a boost from its Frito-Lay unit, the salty-snack powerhouse that has buoyed Pepsi amid a drop in soda consumption.
“The portfolio continues to work very well,” Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in an interview.
A lower tax rate helped boost core earnings per share to $1.59, 2 cents above the average prediction from analysts. Pepsi warned that full-year core earnings per share would be $5.65, down from its prior expectation of $5.70, citing the strong dollar.
PepsiCo’s shares were little changed in early trading Tuesday. They had fallen 7.7 percent this year through Monday, while Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. rose 0.8 percent.
Amid its recent slump, Nooyi has vowed to fix the beverage unit. The key business has been a sore spot for Pepsi as consumers increasingly turn away from sugary drinks. In addition to pursuing cost cuts to boost profit, Nooyi has diversified the company’s portfolio, adding healthier options to adapt to changing preferences.
In the quarter, Pepsi’s key drinks business got a boost from core brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Still, operating profit slipped 14 percent in the quarter as the unit continued to be battered by higher aluminum and freight costs.
Frito-Lay is also paying more to transport its products, part of a broad hike in freight expenses that has hampered U.S. consumer companies. Pepsi is raising prices on its drinks and snacks to offset the higher costs, Johnston said. He added that Pepsi imports some aluminum from Canada and is still trying to ascertain whether the new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will lower prices.
The company said that increased marketing spending this year amid intense competition with Coca-Cola had started to pay off with higher sales. Pepsi will continue with its increased advertising spending as it tries to fend off its longtime rival, according to Johnston.
“We always want to make sure we’re spending competitive,” he said. “Advertising matters in beverages.”
Nooyi announced in August that she would step down as CEO, ends a 12-year run at the helm of the food and beverage giant. She’ll remain chairman until early 2019. Born in India, she was PepsiCo’s first woman CEO and also its first foreign-born CEO.
In one of her final acts as CEO, Nooyi agreed to buy fizzy-drinks dispenser SodaStream International Ltd. for $3.2 billion, giving a company synonymous with sugary sodas a way into the homes of more health-conscious consumers.
Laguarta, who is from Barcelona, will take over a company that generates more than half of its revenue from food. Plano, Texas-based Frito-Lay dominates the chip aisle, with old favorites like Ruffles and Doritos. Salty snack foods have maintained their popularity, even as tastes change in other areas.
Sugary beverages, on the other hand, have clearly lost momentum. Shoppers are pursuing healthier drinks, sending overall soda consumption to its lowest level in more than 30 years.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:36AM ET</span>",German diesel deal runs into opposition from carmakers,"By Holger Hansen
BERLIN (Reuters) - Owners of older diesel cars in polluted German cities should be able to choose between trade-in incentives and a hardware upgrade for their vehicles, German coalition parties agreed but the car industry swiftly raised objections.
After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of Tuesday that they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the worst affected cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans.
In their initial responses, manufacturers appeared to favor encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles rather than carry out costly adjustments known as retrofits.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) had agreed to help with hardware retrofits but some details still need to be discussed while BMW (DE:BMWG) has refused such retrofits, German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said on Tuesday.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes cars, has said it could consider hardware retrofits but would concentrate on trade-in incentives of up to 5,000 euros ($5,755), Scheuer told a news conference.
""We are talking about a significant billion (euro) contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,"" said Scheuer.
Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown.
""We are creating the framework to avoid driving bans but we expect the car industry to offer possible retrofits and trade-ins,"" German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said.
""My impression is that the car industry has a big interest in restoring the image of diesel.""
""END OF ERA""
Environmental group Greenpeace said the German government had failed to provide a solution for the diesel crisis and accused the industry of exploiting the situation.
""The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,"" it said.
The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is Euro 6.
France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said earlier on Tuesday it was offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives of up to 10,000 euros to trade in their cars for newer ones.
""We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,"" Renault Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight.
""It’s the end of the game,"" he added.
There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4 standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5 million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from the German KBA transport authority.
Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather than a trade-in.
PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Opel unit rejected hardware retrofits, arguing they were economically not sensible and the technology not fully developed.
The German courts have paved the way for city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed European safety levels.
The city of Hamburg banned older diesels from two of its roads in May, and a ban in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is due to take effect next February.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Ghosn turns to Japanese to deflect Renault-Nissan succession question,"By Joseph White
PARIS (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, head of the world's largest automotive alliance by sales, gets a lot of questions about who could replace him, and at the Paris auto show on Tuesday he used a fresh way to postpone an answer.
""I'm in nemawashi mode,"" Ghosn told reporters at a briefing at Renault's stand at the show, using a Japanese term for engaging a group of people to reach consensus on a course of action. 
Ghosn said the deliberations would take into account ""what kind of organization, legal structure ... we need to put in place to ensure the sustainability of the alliance.""
Ghosn, 64, has said he plans to remain as  Renault  chief executive and CEO of the alliance until 2022. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, he said answers about succession and potential changes to the cross-shareholding structure of the three main partners should come by June 2020, the midpoint of his term.
France's Renault SA (PA:RENA), and Japan's Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), are joined by cross shareholdings and shared activities such as purchasing and technology development. 
They operate separately in global markets, in certain cases as rivals. Together, the companies are on track to sell more than 11 million vehicles this year, Ghosn said.
Ghosn was instrumental in forging the Renault-Nissan alliance two decades ago, taking a then-unconventional approach to engineering economies of scale without a full merger. His record gives him ""legitimacy in every one of these companies,"" he said. He is chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi.
The future management and capital structure of the alliance has been a subject of increasing speculation among investors. 
Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Since 2016, Nissan has held a 34 percent controlling stake in its smaller Japanese rival, Mitsubishi. 
Complicating matters for Ghosn and the other shareholders is the French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault. Earlier this year, people familiar with the companies said Nissan was in talks to acquire the French government stake, but a deal never materialized. 

German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) also has a number of joint vehicle and technology partnerships with members of the alliance. Ghosn and Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche are scheduled to discuss their partnerships at a Paris auto show press conference on Wednesday.

Effective Nov. 1, the U.S. wage increase to $15 an hour applies to more than 250,000 current employees along with 100,000 more seasonal workers who will be hired during the holidays, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement. The hourly minimum wage in the London area will rise to 10.50 pounds ($13.60), and 9.50 pounds in the rest of the U.K., affecting some 37,000 current and seasonal employees, according to a separate statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks fell worldwide and European assets sold off on Tuesday after anti-euro comments from an Italian lawmaker dented the single currency and sent Italy's bond yields to multi-year highs.
A boost to investors' risk appetite from the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact proved short-lived with the MSCI world equity index falling back 0.4 percent, its biggest loss in a month. 
The leading index of euro zone stocks lost 1 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.7 percent, tracking Asian stocks lower and extending losses as Italian assets came under renewed stress.
U.S. futures also traded down 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent.
Claudio Borghi, the economics spokesman of Italy's ruling League party, said in a radio interview that most of the country's problems could be solved by having its own currency. 
His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German yields to the widest for more than five years.
Shares in Italian banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low, falling as much as 2.8 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB tumbled 1.2 percent.
Clarifying his remarks later, Borghi told Reuters that Italy's government has no intention of leaving the euro. However, the specter of a euro zone breakup and stern words from EU officials about Italy's budget kept markets on edge.
Euro zone banks also dropped 1 percent as the comments reignited investors' anxieties about contagion in the euro zone from Italy's higher-than-expected budget deficit plans, which the government set out on Thursday. 
""While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said.
""We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy.""
The euro extended losses to fall 0.6 percent to its lowest since Aug. 21 at $1.1504 and was last trading at $1.1509.
The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy's debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European Union's.
""The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great fudges - think of the case of Greece,"" the Saracen global income and growth fund's manager, David Keir, said. 
""But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading. The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,"" he said.

The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. 
The trade pact helped the dollar index rise 0.4 percent to 95.718, its highest since Sept. 4.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - A consortium led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on Tuesday bought a 41 percent stake in Moldova's largest bank, aiming to bring more transparency to a financial system recovering from a $1 billion fraud. 
The EBRD and two private equity firms bought shares in Moldova Agroindbank, which controls 30 percent of the market and whose shares had been frozen by regulators and put up for auction to strategic investors. 
The sale is a further step in meeting the requirements of Moldova's international backers, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to root out corrupt practices and make the ownership of lenders more transparent. 
""For Moldova this deal is a very important event. Three years ago the banking sector was not transparent, but now it is a completely different situation,"" Francis Malige, the EBRD's Managing Director, Financial Institutions, told Reuters. 
""And now the MAIB will also have transparent shareholders ready to apply the right principles for its development.""
Along with the EBRD, the consortium is made up of Vilnius-based Invalda and Horizon Capital, which manages funds which provide financing to businesses in Ukraine and Moldova. Together they paid the equivalent of 23 million euros. 
Moldova plunged into economic and political crisis after the disappearance of $1 billion from three banks with opaque ownership structures, including Moldova Agroindbank, between 2012-2014.
Known locally as the ""theft of the century"", the scandal triggered street protests, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union froze aid, the leu currency plunged to record lows and inflation climbed into double digits.
With the EBRD's support, earlier this year Romanian lender Banca Transilvania (BX:ROTLV) bought a minority stake - 39.2 percent - in Victoriabank, the second of three banks involved in the scandal.
Moldindconbank, the third, has been under the central bank's control since October 2016 and the authorities also hope to sell 63.89 percent of its shares to a foreign investor. 
Moldova Agroindbank's assets are worth 22 billion lei ($1.3 billion). Its shares have been sold at 1,059 lei per share ($62.7). 

""First of all, we want to see proper management in these banks,"" Malige said. ""They will have to achieve such an institutional strength to prevent the repetition of the situation that has been in the banking system of Moldova in recent years.""

""I told (UK Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Union that if there is a hard Brexit, both sides are losers. We will no longer fulfill trade agreements and then we are forced to build the car in the Netherlands,"" Krueger told journalists at the Paris Motor Show.
""Hard Brexit is currently not our main scenario but we are preparing for it. We see a 50:50 chance."" 
BMW currently builds most of its Mini vehicles at a plant in Oxford, southern England, but relies heavily on components imported from BMW's German plants. Oxford made about 60 percent of the 378,486 Minis produced last year.
If Britain tumbled out of the EU without a deal on March 29, Oxford's status as the main global exporting hub for Mini would be put at risk, Krueger said.
When asked whether a hard Brexit would make the Netherlands the main exporting hub for supplying customers in the European Union, Krueger said: ""Yes.""
BMW has quietly built up Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar as a new export base for its Mini brand.
At VDL Nedcar, staffing levels have jumped to about 7,200, from around 4,500 last year and 1,450 in 2014. 
By contrast, staffing levels at BMW's British plant have remained relatively stable over the same period, with just over 4,500 people working on building Minis in Oxford.
Sales in Britain have already suffered amid the uncertainty over the future, Krueger said.
BMW Group as a whole continued to see double-digit sales growth in China in August and September, despite increased geopolitical tensions between China and the United States.
Europe remains a difficult market where demand has been distorted by manufacturers flooding showrooms with cars before the onset of stricter emissions standards, known as the WLTP rules.

""European sales are not being driven by market demand, but by WLTP distortions. These will last between six and nine months,"" Krueger said.

Backers of Brexit say Britain should ditch some EU financial rules, such as caps on banker bonuses, in order to keep the City of London competitive as a global financial center.
""The FCA does not see the UK's withdrawal from the European Union as an opportunity to join a race to the bottom in regulatory standards – quite the contrary,"" Charles Randell, chair of the Financial Conduct Authority, told an industry event.
Some UK lawmakers have said the FCA and its sister regulator, the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority at the Bank of England, should have a formal objective of maintaining competitiveness, meaning new financial rules must not be overly burdensome.
Randell said this could imply some very difficult trade-offs with its existing objectives.
""How much loss of competition should we tolerate to ensure that a sector is competitive? How much loss of consumer protection? How much loss of market integrity?""
""I believe that if we deliver our existing statutory objectives of making our markets work well, consumer protection, competition and market integrity, then there should be nothing to stop the firms we regulate from making money and growing in global markets.""

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as anti-euro rhetoric from a senior Italian lawmaker spooked investors, sparking a sell-off in the country's sovereign bonds and sending shares in their banks to a 19-month low.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), whose large government bond holdings makes them sensitive to political stress, fell as much as four percent after the head of the lower house's budget committee said Italy would be better off out of the euro zone.
Banks (SX7P) were the biggest sectoral fallers in Europe, helping drag the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index down 0.4 percent by 0807 GMT after hitting its lowest lowest level in more than two weeks. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.5 percent.
The lawmaker's comments came after euro zone officials warned Italy that its plan to borrow billions of extra euros to fund spending pledges could tip the bloc back into crisis. In response, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said Italy would not change its budget deficit targets.
""We expect months of scrutiny on the budget by Italian institutions, the European Commission and rating agencies,"" said Matteo Ramenghi, CIO for Italy at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""Investors are likely to retain a cautious approach until further visibility on fiscal policy emerges,"" he added. 
Shares in Italy's biggest banks,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI), both fell around 1.8 percent. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the increase in Italian government bond spreads could impact banks' CET1 capital adequacy ratio by 8 basis points on average in the third quarter.

Strength among oil stocks (SXEP) , up 0.4 percent, on the back of rising crude prices helped limit the losses, while autos (SXAP) also rose as the Paris auto show got underway. 
Among heavyweight companies,  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) fell 2.1 percent after a downgrade from HSBX, while Philips (AS:PHG) also dropped more than 2 percent after a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) downgrade.
Shares in  Royal Mail  (L:RMG) hit an all-time low, down 6.9 percent as brokers cut their price targets on the stock following a surprise profit warning on Monday due to worse than expected pressures on letter volumes and productivity. 

The STOXX 600 has fallen 1.7 percent so far this year due to worries over a trade war between the US and China and concerns over political stability in the region, as worries over Italy and Brexit mount. Banks have fallen 16 percent year to date.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>","From sukuk to warrants, Iran works to deepen capital markets","By Bernardo Vizcaino
(Reuters) - Iran is developing a range of new financial products, from Islamic bonds to warrants and insurance-linked securities, in an effort to give local firms more funding options as sanctions put pressure on the economy.
The Iranian rial has plunged 70 percent against the U.S. dollar in the free market this year, inflation has risen and foreign trade has been disrupted after Washington repudiated an agreement on Tehran's nuclear program and reimposed sanctions.
But Iran's financial system has been able to ride out past periods of sanctions, and officials say they are working on new products to stimulate capital markets activity. All the products are structured to obey Islamic principles, such as a ban on interest payments.
The capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Organisation, said it had started work on a new structure for Islamic bonds.
The sukuk will use an agency format known as wakala, which is widely used in Asia and the Middle East but not yet offered in Iran, said Majid Pireh, senior Islamic finance expert in the SEO's research, development and Islamic studies department.
""This will be a new financing instrument for companies,"" Pireh said by telephone, adding that regulations could be ready in six to nine months.
Wakala sukuk pay a variable rate, giving them equity-like features compared with other sukuk in Iran, which pay fixed rates, he added.
The SEO also plans to introduce warrants -- contracts giving the option to buy underlying shares at a later date -- following the earlier introduction of put and call options. The SEO's religious board is reviewing a proposal for warrants, which must be structured to obey Islam's ban on pure monetary speculation.
""The derivatives market has a lot of room to grow. Options were introduced in 2013, but the first trades were done in 2016,"" said Payam Afzali, managing partner and head of investment banking at Tehran-based Kian Capital Management.
Warrants may not attract major investment in the short term but could be used to make bonds and equities more appealing to investors, he added.
Meanwhile, the SEO is considering whether to introduce insurance-linked securities so that domestic insurers can offload some portfolio risk in the capital markets, Pireh said.
ILS are typically tied to natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and offer high yields; investors can lose their principal if a catastrophe loss is triggered.
They could serve as an alternative to reinsurance cover, which is scarce as sanctions mean Iran is shut out of global reinsurance markets such as Lloyd's of London.
In August, the SEO published rules for crowdfunding, which allows start-ups to collect small sums of money from many individuals as an alternative to bank loans. An official at an Iranian securities exchange said several applications to conduct crowdfunding exercises were under review.
There are also proposals to develop sukuk that are convertible into equity and lengthen the maturities of sukuk to 10 or 20 years. Most debt issuance in Iran currently carries four- or five-year tenors, the official said.

But the official added that the sanctions were making it impossible to develop some financial products. A proposal for foreign currency sukuk was submitted to the central bank, but Iran's lack of access to the SWIFT global payments network caused the idea to be scrapped.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 02:11AM ET</span>","Samsung Electronics third-quarter profit seen at record, but peaking, as chips shine","By Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) is set to post a hefty jump in third-quarter profit to record levels after its chip unit put in a sterling performance on demand from data centers and improved production yields.
The July-September quarter is, however, expected to mark a peak in earnings as a two-year super cycle of tight supply and soaring demand comes to an end, with prices of some types of chips already sliding sharply.
The world's top memory chipmaker, due to report preliminary results on Oct. 5, is forecast to book an 18 percent surge in operating profit to 17.2 trillion won ($15.5 billion), a Refinitiv poll of 15 analysts showed. Revenue is seen climbing 3.7 percent. 
That handily beats operating profit growth of 6 percent in the previous quarter when its Galaxy S9 device missed sales targets and competition from cheaper Chinese-made phones ate into margins for its mobile business.
The big boon for Samsung has been a spike in prices for DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks at once and are its main memory product. DRAMeXchange estimates the average price of server DRAM rose 14 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, as companies build data centers for cloud computing.
But prices for NAND chips, used for longer-term data storage, more than halved in the same period as supply swamped demand. Those drops are expected to accelerate, while most analysts also predict DRAM prices will begin to decline.
""Starting in the fourth quarter, I expect DRAM prices to fall by around 10 percent. That will hurt Samsung's operating margin,"" said Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Investment & Securities. 
While Samsung is forecast to still book decent operating profit growth of 12 percent in the fourth quarter, analysts predict minimal profit growth in the first half of 2019 followed by profit declines, albeit small ones, in the second half, Refinitiv data showed.

Even so, Samsung is expected to weather drops in DRAM chip prices better than rivals due to gains in production technology that allow it make smaller and faster chips per silicon wafer.
""Even though the average selling price will decline next year, Samsung’s memory chip business will still have solid profits due to cost-saving measures,"" said Avril Wu, senior research director at DRAMeXchange.
While its chip unit accounts for nearly 80 percent of operating profit, Samsung will also benefit from a rebound in prices for large displays, as well as increased orders for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays after Apple Inc (O:AAPL) launched new iPhones.
Samsung's display unit is expected to post about 812 billion won ($730 million) in quarterly operating profit, down 19 percent from a year earlier but more than five times the prior quarter.
It will, however, have to deal with more competition next year as rivals from China and South Korea have started or plan to begin mass production of small-sized flexible OLED panels.

Its mobile division will see operating profit drop for a third quarter in a row, hurt by sluggish demand for smartphones as the market matures. Marketing costs for its new Galaxy Note series also pressured mobile earnings, analysts said.

U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a news conference on the new trade deal later in the day in Washington.
“It is a great deal for all three countries,” Trump wrote on Twitter Monday. He added that the new deal could solve the many “deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA, greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduce Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations closer together in competition with the rest of the world.”
In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.6% by 9:40PM ET (01:40 GMT) as traders returned from a long weekend. China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component are closed for holidays through the week.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index stood at 50.8 in September versus 51.3 in August, data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed over the weekend. Analysts previously expected a median estimate of 51.2 in September. Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing PMI also declined to 50 from 50.6, the lowest since May 2017.
“The further slowdown in China’s official manufacturing PMI in September reflects the intensifying impact of the U.S.-China trade war on China’s manufacturing export sector,” said Rajiv Biswas, APAC chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore. “The near-term outlook for the Chinese manufacturing export sector remains weak, albeit the Chinese government may apply some further stimulus measures to support growth.”
Meanwhile, the official service PMI picked up to 54.9 in September, data revealed.
“The government’s support policy will start to have an impact in the fourth quarter, which could offset the damage of the trade war,” said Gao Yuwei, a researcher at Bank of China Ltd.’s Institute of International Finance in Beijing. “The efforts to shore up infrastructure investment has been driving up construction activity, and services industries normally perform better in the third and fourth quarter.”

351,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Emerging Markets Ripe to Rally in 2019 as Trade Truce on Horizon,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market assets are poised to rally next year as protectionism between the U.S. and China eases, according to some of the world’s largest money managers.
The trade breakthrough reached Sunday by the U.S., Canada and Mexico is helping generate optimism about a truce between the world’s two largest economies next year as tariffs take their toll on both countries. That could spell relief for assets from Argentina to Turkey and Brazil that have been battered by the escalating feud between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.
The deescalation with China may come in the middle of 2019, according to Mohammed Apabhai, the head of Asia trading strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets in Hong Kong. By then, the Trump administration will have maxed out tariffs on more than $500 billion in Chinese goods and retaliatory measures by Beijing could start to hurt the U.S. economy and stocks. Neither country wants that, so they could be pressured to make a deal, he said.
Any good news on trade means “emerging markets will bounce quite hard,” Apabhai said.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing flared last week after the Trump administration’s 10 percent tariff on about $200 billion of Chinese goods took effect. Xi’s government responded with duties of its own on $60 billion in U.S. products, adding to concern that there will be no near-term resolution for the trade war. In fact, the Chinese have said they prefer to delay talks until the U.S. midterms conclude in November, putting greater stakes on a potential Trump-Xi meeting at the G-20 summit in Argentina later that month.
While talks between the two sides figure to be more contentious than those with North American negotiators, the new Nafta pact shows it’s possible for the Trump administration to resolve disputes even amid sour personal relations.
“The breakthrough with Canada will put fresh pressure on China, which is facing a clear weakening of its manufacturing sector,” said Stephen Dover, the head of equities at Franklin Templeton in San Mateo, California. “I think the U.S. and China will be back at the negotiating table later this fall, with signs of progress on market access for key American sectors such as financial services.”
‘Economic High’
U.S. economic expansion will slow to 2.5 percent next year from 2.9 percent in 2018, according to the median forecast of more than 60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, while China’s will decelerate to 6.3 percent from 6.6 percent.
The dent on growth in both economies as well as pressure from consumers and business groups could hasten a trade deal, according to Teresa Kong, the head of fixed income at Matthews Asia in San Francisco. Almost 69 percent of U.S. businesses operating in China oppose using tariffs as a weapon, while just 8.5 percent support them, a survey of 434 respondents in April and May by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed.
“When the repercussions start to take a toll on the economy, Trump might consider pulling back,” said Kong, adding that a decline in the S&P 500 Index would probably be the leading indicator.
That’s similar to the view of Chen Wenling, the chief economist at Beijing-based China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a think tank led by retired senior officials.
“The trade war can’t last long given the impact on U.S. consumers,” she said. “The U.S. is riding an economic high given the positive impact from the tax cut and the stock market rally, but it’s a distorted view.”
Trump will also be gearing up for his 2020 reelection race and the prospect of a deal that could be branded as a win for the U.S. business community may be too tantalizing to pass up, according to analysts and investors.
Rally Time
That would be welcome news for emerging-market fund managers, who’ve watched stocks slump into a bear market and currencies from Argentina to Turkey to India slide to record lows this year on the backdrop of a strong dollar, rising U.S. interest rates and escalating trade disputes.
“Any indication that the U.S. and China are resolving trade differences would likely be good for EM assets,” Asian stocks in particular, said Kathy Jones, the chief fixed income strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in New York.
High-yield emerging-market debt would likely get a boost from easing trade tensions after this year’s underperformance, according to Shamaila Khan, the director of emerging-market debt at AllianceBernstein in New York.
That said, the general consensus in Washington and Beijing is that trade will remain a key cog in their long-term strategic rivalry, so a truce may not last.
“It’s plausible that an agreement can be reached some time next year on a narrow set of issues,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, the chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, the asset manager’s think tank in New York. The outlook for emerging markets will depend on the growth momentum in the U.S., Europe and China, she said. “As long as these regions keep growing at a healthy clip, EM should be fine.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Auto parts output in Mexico will jump about 10 percent over the next three years as automakers scramble to adhere to stricter content rules laid out in a new North American trade deal, a top industry executive said on Monday.
The United States and Canada reached an agreement on Sunday after weeks of tense bilateral talks to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico and the United States first brokered a bilateral accord in late August.
The new trilateral deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), will raise the minimum North American content threshold for cars needed to qualify for duty-free market access to 75 percent from 62.5 percent.
""Carmakers, especially Asian and European carmakers, will have to invest more in tools, in North American components to comply with the new content rules,"" Oscar Albin, head of Mexican auto parts industry association INA, said in an interview.
The so-called rules of origin dictate what percentage of a car needs to be built in North America in order to avoid tariffs in the trade deal.
General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Honda Motor co (T:7267) all build autos in Mexico.
""The American carmakers already have a very well-established footprint in the United States and Mexico"" and will more easily adhere to the stricter content rules, Albin told Reuters.
The new rules should boost auto parts production from about $90 billion annually at present to ""around $100 billion"" over the next three years, he added. In the course of that period, the sector should add about 80,000 new jobs, Albin said.
Stocks in auto parts firms were lifted by the deal.
Shares in Nemak (MX:NEMAKA), the auto parts unit of Mexican industrial conglomerate Alfa (MX:ALFAA), closed up by more than 8.5 percent. Stock in Mexican auto parts maker Rassini (MX:RASSNICPO) rose by more than 4.5 percent.
""The United States and Canada will also grow since the three countries will benefit (from the new agreement),"" said Albin.
The deal set a five-year transition period once the accord enters into force to meet the new content requirements.
That looked like a tough deadline, Albin said.
""I think (time) is a bit short because any adjustment or change of the supply (chain) for cars already being assembled is practically impossible,"" he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump had put creating more manufacturing jobs at the heart of his desire to rework NAFTA.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Big Four accounting firms can invest in technology that will raise standards beyond what could be achieved by smaller rivals, the head of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said on Tuesday, defending the top firms against UK calls to be broken up. 
British lawmakers want the country's competition watchdog to consider forcing PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte, the four accounting firms that check the books of most blue chip companies globally, to separate out their audit and consultancy operations.
This, the lawmakers said earlier this year, would provide a better focus on raising standards to ensure auditors flag company difficulties before collapses like at retailer BHS and outsourcer Carillion in Britain.
""Various people are providing this relatively easy answer to split up the firms, but we do not support it,"" PwC global chairman Bob Moritz told Reuters.
PwC, which employs over 250,000 people, will have invested a billion dollars on ""Cloud"" computing by 2019, a huge sum that firms outside the Big Four would find hard to match. 
Such advanced technology will mean harvesting far more data from a company to ensure accounts face tougher ""checks and balances"" to meet the criticisms over audit standards from policymakers, Moritz said.
Any intervention in the market must be ""well thought out"" given it would be watched closely by the rest of the world, he added.
Moritz was speaking as PwC announced record annual revenues of $41.3 billion for its year ended June 30, making it the second largest accounting firm in the world, behind Deloitte, whose latest annual revenues topped $43 billion.
Moritz said the focus was on PwC being a ""balanced"" firm: ""I don't want to be number one just for the sake of growth.""
PwC was hit by a record 6.5 million pound ($8.5 million) fine in June from Britain's Financial Reporting Council after it failed to flag significant doubts over the future of BHS.
Moritz said PwC made mistakes and had taken responsibility for its actions, but authorities should not rush to carve up the sector because of them.
The industry has already met with Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to offer temporary, voluntary limits on how many big listed companies a Big Four accounting firm could audit in a bid to help smaller rivals expand.
The CMA has yet to respond.
""The challenge is whether or not the other firms have the skills, capability and staff to do those audits as well,"" Moritz said.
""There is nothing abusive in the competition that's happening,"" he said, adding there was a need for the Big Four to have more ""scalable and credible competitors"".

So far, attempts in Britain to persuade companies to ""rotate"" their accountant every decade have ended up creating a Big Four merry-go-round.

BOSTON (Reuters) - An investor who previously helped oversee U.S. natural gas trading at Citadel has set up his own hedge fund, a person familiar with the plans said on Monday.
Ron Ozer, who worked as a portfolio manager and co-head of U.S. natural gas trading at Citadel, has launched Statar Capital LLC to focus on natural gas trades. He worked at Citadel, which currently manages $30 billion, from July 2015 to April 2017. 
Ozer's New York-based fund has raised roughly $140 million in assets from family offices and institutional clients, the person who was not authorized to speak publicly about the private fund's plans said. A spokesman for Statar declined to comment.
Statar is starting to trade at a time the United States is awash in natural gas and prices are not expected to rise any time soon. 
Other energy trading funds have closed this year amid shrinking profits and market volatility, including Houston-based Velite Capital, which was once one of the most-profitable U.S. natural gas trading shops but began winding down operations two months ago.
Many commodities-focused hedge funds lost out on trades in energy betting on higher prices in February, a report from industry tracker Eurekahedge showed. More intense regulation on trading, fueled in part of Dodd-Frank legislation, has also prompted many funds to pull capital from physical commodity market trading.
Ozer began his career on Wall Street as a natural gas trader at hedge fund DE Shaw where he worked from 2008 to 2014.
Terrence Brennan joined Ozer as Statar's chief operating officer from Trajectoire Capital Group where he was also chief operating officer.
Hedge fund industry returns have been muted over the last years prompting some big investors to turn their backs on these portfolios. 
Data from Hedge Fund Research shows that fewer hedge funds were launched in the second quarter of 2018 than a year ago, marking the lowest number of quarterly launches since shortly after the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009. 
But data also suggest that fewer hedge funds are going out of business this year than in past years when the number of liquidations outpaced the number of launches.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) ousted Chief Executive Officer John Flannery in a surprise move on Monday, replacing him with outsider and board member Larry Culp, and said it would take a roughly $23 billion charge to write off goodwill in its power division, primarily from a large 2015 acquisition.
The struggling energy, health and transportation conglomerate also said it would fall short of its forecast for free cash flow and earnings per share for 2018 due to weakness in its power business, something analysts had expected.
GE shares jumped 7 percent to close at $12.09 as investors bet that Culp could re-energize the GE brand and more quickly transform its portfolio. The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 (SPX). The shares had more than halved since Flannery, a three-decade GE veteran, became CEO in August 2017 to replace Jeff Immelt, who had led GE since 2001. With a market capitalization below $100 billion as of Friday, GE was worth less than a fifth of its peak value a generation ago.
GE Power's falling profits last year forced GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. 
GE's board, meeting in the last few days, unanimously picked Culp as its new CEO. Culp, 55, who was named to GE's board in February, was CEO of industrial equipment supplier Danaher Corp (N:DHR) from 2000 to 2014, helping grow the company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while also growing earnings.
Some analysts said that GE Power likely missed financial targets for the third quarter, contributing to Flannery’s ouster. GE, scheduled to report results on Oct. 25, declined to comment.
The broad strategies are likely to be similar because the plan laid out by Flannery was made in conjunction with heavy involvement from the board, which included Culp, said Gabelli & Co analyst Justin Bergner.
SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF
GE's board was unhappy with the pace of the company's turnaround under Flannery, and when the size of the writedown in the power plant division, which makes electric generating equipment, became apparent, the board was persuaded to seek a new CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. 
However, GE will not be changing its announced breakup plan, which calls for spinning off healthcare and shedding its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes (N:BHGE), the source added.
Culp indicated that he will tackle the company's problems aggressively. ""We will move with urgency. ... We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE,"" he said in a statement.
The troubles in the power plant unit have been intensifying, as Reuters reported in July, with the news that one of its most valuable clients, Saudi Arabia, was lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work. 
GE doubled down on fossil fuels in 2015 under Immelt with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group  Alstom  SA's (PA:ALSO) power business. The deal expanded GE's exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power. It added employees, dozens of factories and service centers at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.
""The board is signaling to the market that we are not going to give anyone free reign like we did with Jeff Immelt,"" said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar.
The power division's outlook appeared to worsen last month when GE said several power plants equipped with its newest turbines had to be shut down because of a part failure. 
Changing CEOs ""won't fix short-term problems at power, but Larry, as an outsider, will be able to make the difficult decisions on cost,"" said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research in New York. ""GE is bloated and its culture is destroyed.""  
Davis said the stock price has probably already adjusted to expectations of no contribution from power.
A slimmed down General Electric - a 126-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power -- will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.
In June, GE lost its spot in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) after over a century.
""Investors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered. However, these problems were not created under [Flannery's] tenure,"" CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said in a note. ""The market seems to be welcoming a change in leadership but the new CEO will be facing many of the same problems.""
GE said the power division's goodwill balance is about $23 billion and the impairment charge would eliminate most of it. The non-cash charge primarily relates to GE's acquisition of power assets from Alstom in 2015, GE said.
GE's long stock slide means the once-largest U.S. industrial company is now only sixth in terms of market capitalization, behind  Boeing Co  (N:BA), 3M Co (N:MMM), Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and others.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>","One year later, Las Vegas honors 58 killed in mass shooting","(Reuters) - As white doves flew overhead - each tagged with a name of one of the 58 people killed a year ago on Monday when a sniper opened fire in Las Vegas - loved ones gathered at sunrise to remember victims of the largest mass shooting in modern American history.
Governor Brian Sandoval commended his state for its struggle to heal and recover at the commemoration ceremony held at an outdoor amphitheater.
""From that day of Nevada infamy, we have become #VegasStronger,"" he tweeted after the ceremony.
Gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, fired over 1,100 rounds from his 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people at an outdoor country music festival on Oct. 1, 2017, in the massacre that also wounded over 800 people. He then killed himself before police stormed his room.
At the daybreak ceremony one year later, friends and family members of those slain or wounded bowed their heads for 58 seconds of silence before a choral group sang ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and the air filled with the mournful strains of bagpipes.
""On October 1st, our city was jolted into darkness,"" Mynda Smith, whose sister Neysa Tonks, a 46-year-old mother of three, was among those gunned down, told the remembrance ceremony.
""None of us will ever be the same after that night. However, none of us were alone,"" Smith said, recalling the massive response of citizens donating blood, aiding the injured and feeding families stunned by the violence. ""We found love that came from so many that were there to help us."" 
SYMPATHY FROM MGM RESORTS
MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay and drew criticism for countersuing victims to seek immunity from damage claims, expressed solidarity and sympathy on the anniversary of the gun violence.
Across the country, iHeartRadio's country music stations held a moment of silence at 10:05 a.m. PDT. The shooting erupted a year ago at 10:05 p.m. PDT.
Country singer Jason Aldean, who was performing at the Route 91 Harvest festival when Paddock opened fire on the crowd, posted an image of a historic Las Vegas street sign and the emblem for the Route 91 festival. ""Thinkin about our Route 91 family today. #vegasstrong,"" Aldean wrote.
An investigation into the shooting concluded in August without discovering a motivation for the shooting.
Paddock used ""bump stock"" devices to accelerate the rate of fire from his semiautomatic rifles, effectively turning them into machine guns, which are legal under U.S. law.
Within days of the shooting, National Rifle Association leaders urged the U.S. government to review the law, drawing criticism from some members who viewed it as a betrayal of the powerful gun lobby's principles.
On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had submitted a proposed ban on bump stocks to the Office of Management and Budget for review.
President Donald Trump, asked about bump stocks at a news conference on Monday, said his administration would try to ensure the devices would be illegal within a matter of weeks. 

""We're knocking out bump stocks,"" Trump said. ""Bump stocks are done – I told the NRA.""

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Monday it plans to stop building its Focus compact cars in Argentina in May 2019 as it seeks to stem losses from its operations in South America.
Ford said it will continue to build Ranger compact pickups at its Pacheco plant in Argentina, which employs about 3,440 people. A spokesman said it was ""too early"" to say if there would be layoffs at Pacheco once the Focus ceases production, but the company was in talks with the union that represents workers at the plant.
Once one of Ford's most popular models, the Focus will no longer be built in the Americas after 2019, although it is expected to continue in production in China and Europe, where redesigned versions were just introduced. 
Ford said South American customers, like their counterparts in North America, are increasingly choosing SUVs and crossovers over traditional passenger cars like the Focus.
The U.S. automaker, meanwhile, is discussing joint vehicle development with Germany's Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) in Europe and South America.
Last week, Pablo Di Si, chief executive for Volkswagen in Latin America, told Reuters the companies are studying a partnership in Brazil and the talks are ""advancing positively.""
In a statement on Monday, Ford said it is evaluating ""multiple alternative investment projects"" in South America, where ""a significant redesign of our business model is required to determine where and how we should participate"" in the market. 
VW currently builds a Ranger-size pickup called the Amarok at its own plant in Pacheco and said last year that it plans to add a new SUV, the Tarek, in 2019.
Ford may add one or two new crossovers to its Pacheco plant in 2021-2021, according to a supplier source familiar with the automaker's plans.
The two companies previously shared vehicle development and assembly in South America in a joint venture called Autolatina, that was dissolved in 1995.
General Motors Co (N:GM), the No. 1 U.S. automaker, said earlier this year it was planning for long-term profitability in South America, built on the back of draconian cost cutting and the introduction in 2019 of the same low-cost vehicles it is developing for Chinese consumers.

Ford earlier this year stopped building the Focus in Michigan, blaming declining U.S. demand for passenger cars. In late August, it also scrapped a plan to import a version of the next-generation Focus from China because of the prospect of higher U.S. tariffs.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",New U.S. FAA rules on airplane seat size may not create more leg room,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill that will regulate minimum seat size on U.S. passenger airplanes for the first time is unlikely to lead to more leg or elbow room for cramped flyers, airline consultants said.
The U.S. Senate is taking up on Monday the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, which funds the agency for five years and sets other travel measures. Final passage is expected on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Current rules say airlines must be able to evacuate passengers within 90 seconds of any emergency and do not set specific requirements on seat size or the space between other seats. If passed, the new rules would require a minimum standard based on a safety review. 
Flyer advocacy groups have demanded new rules to make air travel more comfortable, but experts said safety rather than comfort would likely continue to drive the standard.
Currently, seat pitch - the distance from one seat back to the next - on low-cost carriers  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) and Frontier Airlines is among the industry's tightest at 28 inches (71 cm). The average for other mainline economy seats is 31 inches. 
But because the FAA has previously approved operations such as Spirit and Frontier's, it is unlikely to now call the 28-pitch unsafe, said Samuel Engel, vice president of aviation at consulting group ICF.
""It's a mistake to imagine this legislation will have a big impact on airlines or consumers,"" Engel told Reuters.
In July, the FAA said in response to a petition filed with a federal appeals court that it would not regulate seat size.
Airlines' margins could suffer if they had to reconfigure planes to create more space.
Frontier declined to comment and Spirit did not reply. 
The FAA could decide the rules only apply to future aircraft and would have at least until late 2019 to write the rules, officials said.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) are configuring many of their newest aircraft at 30 inches, while adding premium economy seats at 34 inches.
Among other measures in the FAA reauthorization, airlines must increase flight attendants' required rest time, which may create a need for more cabin crew and reduce airlines' flexibility to recover from delayed flights, ICF's Engel noted.
The bill also requires the FAA to establish domestic landing and takeoff standards on noise for supersonic jets, a move that could kickstart the fledgling U.S. supersonic jet industry despite resistance by European nations that want tough rules on noise.

369,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:55PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Pepsi Profit Expected to Climb
While earnings season doesn’t really pick up until the middle of the month, the names on the lighter calendar are bigger.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), known for its cola but driven more by its snack business now, will report results before the bell tomorrow.
On average, analysts are expecting that the company earned $1.57 per share. Sales are expected to edge up just slightly to about $16.4 billion, suggesting that analysts expect margins to strengthen to boost earnings.
Shares of Pepsi have been climbing since a low in May, but are down year to date.
2. Powell Speaking Midday
The economic calendar is also sparse tomorrow. The ISM New York business conditions index arrives at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
But at 12:00 PM ET, the market will get remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Powell will speak at the 60th National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting in Boston.
It’s only been a short time since Powell gave his press conference after the Fed decided to boost rates. But that won’t stop investors from parsing his remarks for any clue on the probability of another rate hike in December.
Right now, traders are pricing in about a 77% chance of another rise, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
3. Oil Rally Still Running
Oil prices will be closely watched tomorrow to see if they can lift energy stocks further.
The S&P Energy Sector index rose about 1.5% today as crude continued to rally on worries that there will not be enough supply to make up for a loss of Iranian exports.
Both Brent and WTI are up about 25%, on average year to date, on worries that neither the combined forces of Russian and Saudi Arabian production or the sheer dynamism of U.S. shale, which flooded the world with cheap oil between 2014 and 2017, will be enough to counter the projected global shortfall in supply from November. Many analysts now think $100 for Brent might be possible by the year end or in early 2019.
After the bell tomorrow, the API will release its latest weekly figures on inventories. Stockpiles came in at about 2.9 million the previous week."
370,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:33PM ET</span>",Thomson Reuters closes deal with Blackstone,"By Matt Scuffham
TORONTO (Reuters) -   Thomson Reuters  Corp  (TO:TRI) (N:TRI) said on Monday it had completed the sale of a majority stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX).
The news and information provider agreed in January to sell a 55-percent stake in the business, which provides data and news primarily to financial customers, in a deal which values the total F&R business at about $20 billion.
The transaction is Blackstone's biggest bet since the 2008 financial crisis and pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Bloomberg's eponymous terminals are the market leader in providing traders, bankers and investors with news, data and analytics.
It also gives Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, an ally as it seeks to reinvigorate a business facing challenges from a shrinking and budget-conscious customer base.
Thomson Reuters retains a 45-percent stake in the F&R business, which has been renamed Refinitiv, a name derived from the 160-year-old Reuters brand with the objective of enabling ""definitive action in financial markets.""
The business will be led by David Craig, previously head of the F&R unit, who became CEO of Refinitiv following completion of the deal.
Thomson Reuters said it received about $17 billion in gross proceeds at the closing, out of which it plans to return $10 billion to shareholders. As part of that process, the company launched a $9 billion share buyback in August. The tender offer is scheduled to close on Tuesday.
From the remainder of the proceeds, the company said it would redeem $4 billion of debt, keep $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet to fund acquisitions, and use $1 billion to cover expenses related to the transaction.
Following the deal, Thomson Reuters had said it expects its legal business to account for 43 percent of its revenue. 

Reuters News will remain a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. Under the terms of the deal, Refinitiv will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years to secure access to its news service, equating to almost $10 billion.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>","NAFTA replacement deal lifts Dow, S&P; Nasdaq negative","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 began the fourth quarter on a positive note on Monday, after a last-minute deal to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact helped ease trade worries, although major indexes finished off their session highs.
Canada and Mexico accepted more restrictive commerce in the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will make it harder for global automakers to build cars cheaply in Mexico and aims to bring more jobs to the United States.
Industrial stocks, and more specifically auto and rail-related shares rose.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) gained 0.8 percent, while General Motors Co (N:GM) advanced 1.6 percent. Among railroads, Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) rose 2.9percent.
The industrial sector (SPLRCI), sensitive to trade developments in recent months, was up 0.9 percent, its best day in five weeks. 
""It is good news not only for NAFTA and North America in general but a lot of market participants are really viewing this as a positive for future negotiations, especially with China,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
""It is short on detail but the market seemingly doesn’t care, I am definitely interested in seeing exactly what the details are."" 
The biggest boost to the industrials, however, was  General Electric  Co (N:GE), which rose 7.1 percent and was set for its best day in three-and-a-half years after replacing Chief Executive John Flannery with board member Larry Culp, who, investors hope can transform the company's portfolio more quickly.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 192.9 points, or 0.73 percent, to 26,651.21, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 10.61 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,924.59 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 9.05 points, or 0.11 percent, to 8,037.30.
October is traditionally one of the tougher months for the S&P, although LPL Financial's senior market strategist Ryan Detrick points out the S&P 500 has averaged a 3.3 percent return during October in midterm election years. 
Aside from industrials, the materials (SPLRCM) and energy (SPNY) sectors also rose more than 1 percent. Energy stocks got a boost as crude oil prices hit their highest level since 2014 on a combination of the new trade agreement and U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Small-cap stocks were under pressure, with the Russell 2000 (RUT) off 1.39 percent. Smaller names had been seen as more immune to trade pressures and the index is now off nearly 4 percent from its Aug. 31 high. 
The defensive real estate <.SPLRCR> and utilities (SPLRCU) sectors led the decliners. 
Still gains, faded late in the session and the Nasdaq was negative, weighed down by declines in  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) off 1.2 percent and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), down 1.8 percent. 
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares soared 17.3 percent as signs it had met targets for quarterly production numbers added to relief at Chief Executive Elon Musk's settling a lawsuit with regulators that could have forced him out.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.88-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 84 new lows.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>",DaVita unit to pay $270 million to resolve Medicare payments probe,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A medical care unit of  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA) has agreed to pay $270 million to resolve claims it provided inaccurate information about patients that caused Medicare Advantage plans operated by private insurers to obtain inflated payments from the government.
The civil settlement with HealthCare Partners Holdings, which Denver-based DaVita acquired in 2012 and is in the process of selling to UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH), was announced on Monday by the U.S. Justice Department.
HealthCare Partners did not admit wrongdoing. DaVita in a statement said the $270 million will be paid for out of escrow funds that it required HealthCare Partners' former owners to set aside when DaVita acquired it in 2012.
According to court papers, HealthCare Partners, a California-based independent physician association, contracted with insurers to provide medical services to Medicare Advantage patients.
More than one-third of Medicare recipients receive benefits through Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers, who the government pays a predetermined monthly sum for each person they cover based on individual diagnostic traits.
Under this part of Medicare, the healthcare program for the elderly, the government makes so-called ""risk adjustment"" payments based on data it receives regarding the health status of a patient covered by a Medicare Advantage plan.
The case stemmed from a broader investigation into data that insurers who operate Medicare Advantage plans submit to receive ""risk adjustment"" payments. The probe has already led to the U.S. Justice Department suing UnitedHealth in a similar case. 
The Justice Departments said HealthCare Partners instituted practices that led insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans to submit incorrect information about patients' diagnoses and obtain inflated payments, which the company shared in.
HealthCare Partners also scoured patients' records for diagnoses its medical providers failed to record which it then submitted to the insurers for use in obtaining increased Medicare payments, the Justice Department said.
Those allegations stemmed from a whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2009 against various insurers and, later, HealthCare Partners by James Swoben, a former employee of an insurer that did business with DaVita, the Justice Department said.
His lawsuit, pending in federal court in Los Angeles, was filed under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government's behalf to recover funds paid out based on fraudulent claims.
The government may intervene in such cases. For his role in bringing the case, Swoben will receive nearly $10.2 million, the Justice Department said.

The case is U.S. ex rel. Swoben v. Secure Horizons, et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 09-5013.

Volcan Investments, the family trust of Vedanta chairman and founder Anil Agarwal, announced a roughly $1 billion buyout offer for Vedanta Resources in July.
On Monday, the cancellation of the listing was confirmed at a final London shareholders' meeting.
Outside the meeting in central London, campaign group Foil Vedanta and representatives of the Tamil Nadu community took part in protests, chanting ""looter polluter,"" banging drums and holding banners. 
India's environment court has said an independent committee will decide on whether to allow Vedanta to reopen a copper smelter, which was shut by the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu on environmental grounds.
Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of the plant and disconnected its power supply in May following protests that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them.
In London, Vedanta is involved in ongoing appeal proceedings after the London Court of Appeal last year awarded nearly 2,000 Zambian villagers the right to sue Vedanta Resources in the English courts over alleged pollution in Zambia.
Foil Vedanta handed a report to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in London itemizing the alleged pollution and human rights abuses it says Vedanta has committed.
Vedanta has denied it is responsible for pollution or human rights abuses. It declined to comment on the Foil Vedanta report.
The FCA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Vedanta has said buying out the London listing, which is dwarfed by Vedanta's Indian operations, would simplify the company's structure and that the Indian market was now deep enough to raise capital. 

It has also said it sees huge potential in its Indian heartland and on Monday said it was investing $4.1 billion to boost oil output in the desert state of Rajasthan to more than 400,000 barrels per day.

""I have to say my prognosis is that it is quite unlikely that we will be able to achieve international agreement in anything like a sensible time scale,"" he said at an event on the sidelines of the Conservative Party annual conference. 
""Because of Mr Trump's tax reforms these now look like companies that will be paying U.S. tax in the future and suddenly we find our U.S. colleagues are not quite so interested in engaging in this debate."" 
He said a planned British digital services tax, mooted earlier in the day as something Britain would do if no international agreement was possible, was aimed at global giants, not at growth companies. 

""We're clear that we're not talking here about the very many, very successful growth businesses here in the UK, we're talking about the global digital giants who derive huge value from data gathered from UK consumers and from content uploaded by UK consumers,"" he said.

U.S. authorities are investigating whether the bank violated Iranian sanctions after 2007, when it said it would no longer do business with Iran. The bank has already paid $667 million for sanctions violations before that year. 
""We continue to cooperate fully with the investigation into our historical sanctions compliance, and are engaged in ongoing discussions with U.S. authorities,"" a StanChart spokeswoman said in a statement. 
""While we do not comment on the substance of those discussions, we look forward to resolving these legacy issues.""
The Bloomberg report said the size of the fine was a preliminary assessment based on some of the communications between the bank and regulators, and that final discussions had not yet begun. 
The bank itself warned in its most recent annual report that resolving the U.S. probe could mean ""substantial monetary penalties."" This could be another setback for StanChart, which is trying to boost profitability after years of restructuring.
The bank's shares were down 3.3 percent at 1557 GMT.
StanChart, which has operations across Asia and Africa, has been investing in compliance and financial crime prevention after facing a series of penalties and regulatory investigations, including in Nigeria, Angola, Dubai and Hong Kong.
It has been subject to a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States since 2012. The DPA was extended in 2014 and again earlier this year. It is due to expire in December.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",Electric cars cast growing shadow on profits,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers. 
Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
""What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of  Peugeot , Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (DE:BMWG), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday.
On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros.
PRICED TO PUSH
After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2.
Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.""
Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
Volkswagen and Mercedes parent  Daimler , which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
COST GAP
Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
Mass-market electrics such as the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Zoe and Nissan (T:7201) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (O:TSLA) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify investment at all - it's all regulation.""
Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.
""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), a major manufacturer of electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot even though the market doesn't exist.""
SCALE EFFECTS
Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen.
Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,"" Salvat said.
German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

Three months since predicting the world economy would grow 3.9 percent this year and next, Lagarde signaled in Washington that she is no longer quite so optimistic. The fund will update its World Economic Outlook on Oct. 9 ahead of opening its annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia.
“Six months ago, I pointed to clouds of risk on the horizon,” Lagarde said, according to her prepared remarks. “Today, some of those risks have begun to materialize.”
While Lagarde acknowledged the global expansion is still the fastest in seven years, recent data suggest a cooling.
Lagarde said protectionist rhetoric was turning into “actual trade barriers,” spreading uncertainty among businesses and consumers. A strengthening U.S. dollar and tightening financial conditions have increased challenges for many emerging markets, she said.
Greek Legends
Lagarde called on countries to resolve their trade disputes, warning that the fracture of corporate supply chains could have “devastating” effects. “History shows that, while it is tempting to sail alone, countries must resist the siren call of self-sufficiency -- because as the Greek legends tell us, that leads to shipwreck,” she said, without naming countries that are putting up new barriers.
Lagarde has repeatedly warned that an all-out trade war could curb growth at a time when the world is enjoying the broadest upswing in years. But the U.S. and China aren’t backing down, leaving no end in sight to what could be a long and bruising dispute.
President Donald Trump slapped tariffs last month on $200 billion in Chinese goods, bringing the total to $250 billion. Beijing retaliated by imposing duties on $60 billion in U.S. products, raising its total to $110 billion. China also rejected a U.S. offer to hold another round of formal negotiations.
The U.S. at the same time is moving forward with new trading agreements. A deal to revise the U.S.’s trilateral trade pact with Canada and Mexico was announced on Sunday after Trump last week signed a revised trade agreement with South Korea.
Trade Deals
Finance ministers from the Fund’s 189 members nations will convene next week in Indonesia hoping to find common ground on trade -- a challenging task since Trump took office, promising to rip up trade deals he views as unfair and promote an “America First” approach to foreign policy.
Lagarde warned nations to guard against “fiscal and financial turbulence.” She said global public and private debt has reached a record $182 trillion, up almost 60 percent from 2007. Emerging markets and developing countries are being pinched as central banks raise interest rates in advanced economies, she said.
“That process could become even more challenging if it were to accelerate suddenly,” she said. “It could lead to market corrections, sharp exchange rate movements, and further weakening of capital flows.”
Lagarde called on governments to rebuild trust in institutions and policymakers, which has eroded as growth failed to lift the standards of living of ordinary people. Since 1980, the top one percent of income earners have captured twice as much of the gains from growth as the bottom 50 percent, she said.
“In too many cases, workers and families are now convinced that the system is somehow rigged, that the odds are stacked against them,” she said.

This time, it’s the relentless rally in companies with healthy fundamentals from low debt to high profitability -- dubbed quality stocks -- driven by investor appetite for defensive assets across the U.S. and Europe.
The investing style has boomed this year during bouts of risk aversion spurred by Italy’s fiscal tremors and tighter monetary policy to late-cycle angst.
Now, this corner of the quantitative kingdom no longer provides refuge because it’s become crowded and pricey, according to Sanford C Bernstein & Co.
“Quality factors are well bid so may not be as defensive as people expect,” strategists led by Inigo Fraser Jenkins wrote in a Monday note.
In Europe, buying the most profitable equities and shorting the least returned 2 percent in September, compared to a 0.2 percent gain for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. In the U.S., a market-neutral version of the strategy posted its best month since May 2017, trading at its highest price in more than two years.
Exchange-traded funds tracking the investing style are also packing a bigger punch.
The iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF absorbed $456 million, the biggest monthly pull since listing in 2013. European-listed vehicles saw $196 million, the most since the inception of the major quality funds in 2014.
For Nomura’s Masanari Takada, it’s a wake-up call. Rising demand for defensive assets is now casting a shadow over the post-crisis bull run in developed-market stocks.
“The quality factor has been outperforming the value factor since the end of September,” Takada wrote in a Monday note. “Most equity participants are now shifting their stances to ‘reality check’ mode.”
The hunt for top-notch balance sheets is likely to intensify.
Take the Russell 2000. One-fourth of the index is now posting negative earnings -- a level that typically occurs on the eve or during recessions, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Among mid-caps, leverage levels are nearing all-time highs, the data show.
Bernstein strategists, for their part, are telling money managers to adopt a defensive stance, citing a slowing business cycle that typically helps reliable firms to outperform.
But rather than buying shares that hit all of the quality metrics, they suggest targeting individual attributes that are still reasonably priced, such as low leverage.
“We expect quality will continue to be a rewarded attribute,” Bank of America equity strategists, including Jill Carey Hall, wrote in a Friday note. “As is typically the case later in the cycle, and where high quality stocks have been re-rating vs. low quality stocks after decades of fiscal and monetary stimulus buoying valuations for the latter.”

Lahore, Pakistan (Reuters) - Islamabad has cut the size of the biggest Chinese ""Silk Road"" project in Pakistan by $2 billion, Railways Minister Sheikh Rasheed said on Monday, citing government concerns about the country's debt levels.
The megaproject to revamp the colonial-era line stretching 1,872 km (1,163 miles) from Karachi to the northwestern city of Peshawar was initially priced at $8.2 billion, but wrangling over costs has led to delays.
The changes are part of Islamabad's efforts to rethink key Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in Pakistan, where Beijing has pledged about $60 billion in financing but the new government of populist Prime Minister Imran Khan appears to be more cautious about the Chinese investment.
""Pakistan is a poor country that cannot afford huge burden of the loans,"" Rasheed told a news conference in the city of Lahore. 
""Therefore, we have reduced the loan from China under CPEC for rail projects from $8.2 billion to $6.2 billion,"" he added, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Rasheed said the government remains committed to the Karachi-Peshawar Main Line-1 (ML-1) project but added that he wishes to further reduce the cost to $4.2 billion from $6.2 billion. 
Islamabad has balked at the financing terms and has pushed for deeply concessional loans for ML-1. It also invited third countries to join or for the Chinese to be investors in the project through the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model that would rely less on debt.
The United States has criticized BRI projects, warning that the loans could turn into debt traps for poor countries unable to pay them money back. Beijing denies the claims, saying the loans are a win-win situation for both countries.
""CPEC is like the back bone for Pakistan, but our eyes and ears are open,"" Rasheed said. 

The ML-1 is the spine of the country's dilapidated rail network, as well as the biggest source of revenue. Pakistan's rail system has struggled to break even for decades as passenger numbers plunge, train lines close and the vital freight business nosedives.

The elevators-to-submarines group last week unveiled plans to split its elevators, car parts and plant engineering units into Thyssenkrupp Industrials.
The remaining business, to be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials, will initially hold a minority stake in the new entity but plans to sell all of it. 
""The sooner the better,"" Guido Kerkhoff said, adding that Thyssenkrupp Materials would sell at the highest possible price as soon as the market could absorb it.
The corporate split still requires shareholder approval, which is expected by early 2019.

The move bears similarity to E.ON's (DE:EONGn) spin-off of Uniper (DE:UN01), in which the German utility kept a minority stake which it said could be sold on the open market. It was ultimately acquired by Finnish peer  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM).

409,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Three new cars in Paris tell the story of an industry in flux,"By Joseph White
PARIS (Reuters) - Three new vehicles debuting at the Paris car show this week will show investors and consumers the challenges facing the global auto industry as it grapples with the biggest technological changes in a century.
A new BMW 3-series sedan, the latest in a line of cars that defined the concept of a premium sports sedan, will aim to reinvigorate a range that has ceded ground to SUVs and electric drives, while the Mercedes GLE marks an attempt to take an SUV to a new level, with some autonomous driving features. 
And the  Peugeot  e-Legend concept stands for what automakers need to do next, and fast: design electrified vehicles that are both appealing and profitable.
The new generation BMW (DE:BMWG) 3-series sedan will immediately fight for attention with a different car bearing the ""3"" designation - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) electric Model 3. 
Tesla's Model 3 is now out-selling the BMW model in the United States, although the BMW 3 remains the bigger seller by far worldwide. 
Tesla's all-electric car challenges BMW and other traditional premium brands for technological leadership with software that can be constantly upgraded to improve the car's performance and driver experience, and to add features.
The new BMW 3-series will also fight for attention in Paris - as in the marketplace - with the worldwide shift to SUVs. That phenomenon will be represented by the new generation of the Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) GLE sport utility, among other models.
CONFLICTED RESPONSE
The new GLE, which goes on sale next year, will come with a new, 48-volt electronic suspension system that can vary the shock absorbing function at each wheel, individually. Inside the cabin, drivers and passengers can view information on two 12.3- inch screens. 
The GLE also takes another step toward automating the process of driving, with a system that can steer and vary the speed of the car within a marked lane up to 37 miles per hour. The GLE can effectively pilot itself in rush hour traffic jams.
Mercedes will offer in the GLE a 48-volt electrical system that gives the vehicle an electric boost away from stops. That offers a modest reduction in fuel consumption at a time when regulators worldwide want automakers to eliminate their oil-burning, internal combustion technology and go all-electric. 
The GLE highlights the auto industry's conflicted response to the regulatory and consumer pressure to dump diesel technology and accelerate the shift to all-electric vehicles. 
Petroleum-fueled SUVs such as the Mercedes GLE generate the bulk of profits for global automakers. All-electric Tesla gets praise for its innovation, but is scrambling to show a profit in the third quarter after a tumultuous year.
FANTASY CAR
The challenge for established automakers is to design electric cars compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay a profitable premium to own them.
Legacy automakers have tended to produce electric cars that are drab, small or strange. 
PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Peugeot e-Legend concept aims to break that pattern with a battery-powered homage to the 1968 Peugeot 504 that looks like it could have starred in a late 1960s French New Wave movie.
While not destined for production, the e-Legend does reflect a dilemma facing automakers like PSA - and its track-racing boss Carlos Tavares - over how to reconcile connected, autonomous cars with more traditional product traits such as driving pleasure, where their expertise really lies.

While the Peugeot fantasy car is self-driving, it can also be driven manually, or flipped into a ""sharp"" autonomous mode that accelerates and steers more aggressively - because, as the company said in promoting the concept, ""boredom is not part of our DNA"".

411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Global Factories Feel the Pain From Trump's War on Free Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- Factory activity plunged from Asia to Europe in September, reflecting how few countries are left unaffected by a U.S.-led shake-up of international trade policies.
Chinese manufacturers said output took a hit amid the worst contraction in export orders since 2016, leading similar trends across Taiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Confidence continued to plummet at Japanese firms, while euro-area factory output struggled as companies voiced concerns over global protectionism.
The data come just as the U.S. starts to make headway on trade talks with some of its major partners -- with the exception of China. President Donald Trump agreed on a renegotiated trade pact with Canada and Mexico this weekend, signed a deal with his South Korean counterpart last week, and is opening talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In contrast, he has expanded tariffs to $250 billion of Chinese goods and warned of more to come.
In Europe, leaders are engaged in a delicate balancing act of working with the U.S. to address common complaints while also trying to convince Trump to roll back tariffs he imposed this year and dissuade him from instating more.
Even so, the region’s companies are taking on less work amid trade risks, says IHS Markit, which compiles gauges of economic activity, adding that some indicators suggest the worst might be “yet to come.”
“There’s still some broader issues to do with trade and a lot of those will extend to the U.S.-China trading relationship,” Janet Henry, HSBC global chief economist, told Bloomberg Television. “Still, there’s possible disruption to supply chains that may come through. Looking at it from a European perspective and an Asian one, the big way that the concerns about trade is impacting is on investment sentiment.”
In China, two gauges of manufacturing activity worsened in September. The one which better reflects sentiment among smaller, private firms is flirting with contraction for the first time since May 2017. With little room for optimism on external demand, the outlook for China’s economy hinges increasingly on the effectiveness of targeted stimulus measures being rolled out this year in the form of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
Bloomberg Economics’s early indicators on China’s economy foreshadowed the pullback, showing that the outlook deteriorated in September. The report gives an advance picture of what’s happening in China by aggregating the earliest-available indicators on business conditions and markets.
In Japan, analysts say many companies are keeping a close eye on possible consequences of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, the country’s biggest trading partners. While concerns may have contributed to the third-quarter decline in manufacturing confidence, the recent decision by the U.S. to hold off on imposing tariffs on Japanese auto exports could support sentiment in the next survey.
The euro area has seen output slide to the weakest pace in two years, and lower levels of business optimism and order growth are signs that a recent decline in backlogs of work might continue.
IHS Markit and the Institute for Supply Management will release gauges for the U.S. later on Monday."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers on Monday gave new details about the sensor system their startup company, Aeva Inc, is making to help self-driving cars see the world around them.
Aeva was founded by Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk, who both left Apple's Special Projects Group that houses the iPhone maker's self-driving car work. Aeva is working on a device that would help cars sense the road, vehicles, pedestrians and other surroundings several hundred yards ahead. It would be a critical link in self-driving technology including software and controls made by others. 
At a San Francisco warehouse last week, Aeva's device was mounted on a white Audi sport-utility vehicle parked on a mock road. In real time, it captured images of Aeva workers whizzing about on kick-scooters, with the workers' images changing color as they moved toward or away from the vehicle.
In other self-driving car systems, such data comes from separate sensors from different suppliers. Radar measures speed, so-called ""lidar"" measures depth and standard cameras capture digital images the car's computer can analyze. The streams must be blended in a step called ""sensor fusion.""
Aeva aims to combine those functions in one device and skip the external ""fusion"" step. Its device has sensors for motion, depth, speed and reflected light and contains an artificial intelligence chip that weaves it together.
""Because we've created this technology from the ground up, we have unique access to the data from deep inside the hardware,"" Salehian told Reuters in an interview.
Aeva enters a crowded field of sensor firms selling to automakers. One of Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) new Audi sedans features a laser scanner from  Valeo  (PA:VLOF). BMW Group has paired with Israeli startup Innoviz Technologies around a new sensor. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co invested $75 million in longtime lidar maker Velodyne.
Established firms have the most sensors on the road right now, said Angelos Lakrintis, an autonomous vehicles analyst with Strategy Analytics. But ""there is still some time"" for newcomers to win over automakers because self-driving cars will not hit roads en masse until the mid-2020s, he said.
Automakers are sensitive to cost. Some depth sensors use pricey bespoke laser chips. Aeva would not reveal what chips it uses or its final costs but said it has avoided expensive parts.

""We do not need high-powered lasers anymore,"" Rezk told Reuters. ""We're using laser sources and sensors that are already in mass manufacturing.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Philip Morris Korea Inc. said on Monday it has filed a lawsuit against the South Korean government, demanding the disclosure of information on a recent test that concluded electronic cigarettes contain harmful substances. 
Seoul's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in June after a study that up to five cancer-causing substances were found in the heated smoking devices, and the level of tar discovered in two products, including Philip Morris' (N:PM) iQOS, exceeded that of regular cigarettes. 
The ministry's announcement ran counter to the U.S.-headquartered company's claim that its electronic gadget is less likely to cause disease than traditional cigarettes, citing studies conducted in Germany, Japan and China. 
Philip Morris said it raised a suit with the Seoul Administrative Court after the ministry declined the firm's request for the disclosure of data used in the test, which also involved British American Tobacco's (L:BATS) Glo, and South Korea-based KT&G Corp.'s (KS:033780) lil. 
A ministry representative said that the agency ""will follow legal procedures as required.""
The company said the government study wrongly centered on tar, which is only applicable to smoke created by regular cigarettes, while the electronic devices do not generate smoke. 
""Due to the focus on tar, the ministry's study resulted in encouraging customers to stick to conventional cigarettes instead of choosing products that contain sharply lower levels of harmful compounds,"" Brian Kim, corporate affairs director of the tobacco maker, said in a statement. 
The smoking gadgets have seen a spike in popularity since they launched in South Korea last year. 

Sales of the devices hit a record of 30.4 million units last May, with their collective stake reaching 10 percent for the first time, but have fallen to around 9 percent until August due to the drug agency's study, according to Seoul's finance ministry.

Read, however, failed in his efforts to pull off two mega deals, with plans to buy British drugmaker AstraZeneca (L:AZN) in 2014 and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (N:AGN) in 2016 both falling through. 
Bourla, 56, was appointed chief operating officer at the start of this year, after leading the drugmaker's Innovative Health business, which recorded revenue of $31.4 billion in 2017.
""This looks like a well-considered transition thus I’m not convinced it will herald a major change in strategic thinking, particularly as Ian will still stay on as chairman,"" Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said.
The appointment comes at a time when drugmakers are facing intense scrutiny over drug pricing, with regulators and the Trump administration aiming to lower prescription drug costs. 
In July, Pfizer said it was deferring drug price increases for no more than six months after a conversation between Read and President Trump.
Pfizer's shares, which have risen about 160 percent since Read took over as CEO in December 2010, were trading up 0.36 percent at $44.23 before the bell.
""It's been an honor to serve as Pfizer's CEO for the past eight years,"" Read said. ""However, now is the right time for a leadership change, and Albert is the right person to guide Pfizer through the coming era."" 

Last week, rival Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) said it would amend a policy to allow its head, Kenneth Frazier, to remain CEO beyond 2019 when he was expected to retire.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 07:24AM ET</span>",Your Money: How to factor in cost when applying to college,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Picking the right college is not just a matter of finding a good fit for a student's talents and interests, but it also should involve what a family can reasonably afford.
As U.S. high school seniors prepare their college wish lists for yet another round of the admissions process, more parents than ever are scrutinizing the price tags. A recent T. Rowe Price survey on ""Parents, Kids & Money"" found that 74 percent of parents would be willing to send their kids to a less expensive school to avoid debt, compared to 61 percent last year.
Figuring out what a family can afford starts with filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which opens on Oct. 1. This federal form computes an expected family contribution that many colleges will use to determine aid.
There are other factors that affect a student's total financial package and some families turn to admissions experts like Peter Van Buskirk to help them sort through their individual situations. A 25-year veteran admissions officer from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Van Buskirk is now director of student advocacy at Revolution Prep, a national group that provides academic support to students and maintains the website bestcollegefit.com.
Reuters spoke with Van Buskirk about what families need to know about finding the best college fit that they can best afford. 
Q: How do you know if a college is a good fit? 
A: The best college will always be the one that values you for what you have to offer. They see what you have done in school and life and is excited about admitting you and will give you what you need – even financially. 
Q: How important are admissions officers in the process of the financial package? 
A: You should look at them as investors. They are faced with prospect of filling limited numbers of seats from a vast body of applicants. They look at it as return on investment. If you want assistance of a certain amount, their need for return on investment goes up.
The financial aspect is not kept separate. There's real accountability.
Q: How can a student tell how much the admissions officer values them?
A: It’s hard to know in exact terms. I talk about selectivity. I also talk about leverage. In the exchange, it will be the party that has the leverage who controls the conversation. The highly selective schools have the leverage all the time. They can choose one out of 20, so it becomes a lottery.
In a situation where a student’s credentials put them at the top of process, then the student has more leverage. Parents and students need to be realistic. If they say, 'My kid needs to go to an Ivy,' it can be great education but not necessarily the best fit.
If they manage expectations, they will put themselves in situations where they will be valued, then the institution will do what it can to make sure they enroll. They can’t cover everyone with aid but it will go to the students they care about most. 
Q: What is most important for families to communicate to schools? 
A: Colleges are trying to predict the likelihood that you will enroll. Now colleges are tracking students by the number and type of contacts they have with the institution. Some do it with science, some do it implicitly.
They don’t want to give places away to students applying whimsically. They want them to know the institution and have done a careful self-assessment. You have to know where you are applying and what you want to study.
Q: Do the odds get better if you apply to more schools? 
A: It's terrible logic. The prospects of getting in are not additive. It just increases the likelihood you will be frustrated.
Q: When should cost enter the equation?
A: At the very beginning. Make sure you are choosing the college because it meets your expectations. We’re not paying tuition to sit at football games. 

Be thoughtful about the way you put your list together. I can’t tell you how often I talk to students and do a very intensive personality and diagnostic interview. I want to know how they think about themselves. Later we talk about colleges.

The Gulf airline was the launch customer for both A350 models and said in February it could switch some of its existing order of A350-900s to the bigger A350-1000.
""Since taking delivery of the world’s first A350-1000 in February 2018, we have been extremely pleased with the aircraft's performance, which has prompted us to update our original order,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said in a statement. 
State-owned Qatar Airways has upgraded the order amid a political dispute in the Arab region that has forced the airline to increase operational costs by flying longer routes.
Qatar Airways has been banned from the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain since June 2017 as a result of those countries cutting ties with Qatar.
The upgraded order will come as a relief to Airbus, which is betting on the A350-1000 to contain any market pressure from rival Boeing (N:BA) which is developing its new model 777 twin-engined jet.
The A350-1000 is designed to seat 366 people and competes head-to-head with Boeing’s profitable 777. Airbus says the lightweight A350-1000 is 25 percent more efficient than the most popular current version of the 777, the 777-300ER.

Qatar Airways is the top A350 customer with 76 on order, which now includes 42 A350-1000s with a list price of $367 million. Airbus said that in Qatar Airways' configuration, the A350-1000 features 44 more seats than the A350-900.

TOKYO (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) President Rob Kapito said on Monday he expects the U.S. stock rally to continue beyond next year, as there are fewer shares available for investors because of increased company buy-backs and dwindling public offerings.
""Recently, given the economic backdrop and tax reform, companies have maintained a lot of cash on their balance sheets. And they have used that cash to buy back their stocks and raise dividends,"" Kapito told reporters in Tokyo.
The co-founder of the world's largest asset manager, with $6.3 trillion in assets under management, added that the drying up of the IPO market is another factor contributing to a shortage of shares.
Fewer shares to buy ""drives prices high', he said. 
Asked how long he thinks the rally can last, Kapito told Reuters ""Quite a long time - beyond next year. I'm very optimistic.""
Major U.S. stock indices hit record highs in recent weeks are hovering not far from those levels despite worries about trade wars.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) appointed an interim chief executive on Monday as it sought to reassure investors rattled by a $235 billion money laundering scandal and looking for a new leader.
Jesper Nielsen, the head of Danske Bank's domestic banking business, will take on the running of the bank while a replacement is found for Thomas Borgen, who resigned last month but was not originally going to leave with immediate effect.
""The bank cannot move on with rebuilding the trust in the bank before he (Borgen) is gone,"" said Jens Munch Holst, chief executive of MP Pension, which holds Danske Bank shares, said.
Borgen quit after an internal inquiry found that payments totaling 200 billion euros, many of which Danske Bank said were suspicious, had been moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
""I agree with the board that it is best for all parties that the chief executive is someone who can help follow decisions through to the end, and as I have resigned, that is not me,"" the 54-year-old said in a statement emailed to Reuters. 
Borgen, who was in charge of Danske Bank's international operations, including Estonia, between 2009 and 2012 and became CEO in 2013, said last month that while he was cleared from a legal point of view, he held ""ultimate responsibility"".
Denmark's largest bank said Borgen has been relieved of his duties, while Nielsen will continue to work as Head of Banking DK and is not a candidate for the permanent CEO position.
""We are of the opinion that, with the situation the bank is in, it is best that the executive director is also part of the bank's future,"" chairman of the bank Ole Andersen said.
He added that finding a new CEO was progressing as planned, but a spokesman for the bank declined to estimate when a new CEO could be announced, or whether the appointment of an interim CEO meant that the board has widened the search for a new CEO.
British shareholder adviser Hermes EOS has urged the bank's board to explore suing senior executives over the money laundering scandal, the Financial Times reported on Monday.
Hermes EOS said it wanted the bank to emulate German engineering conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), which sued several senior managers, including former chief executives and chairmen, over a large bribery scandal, the newspaper reported.
Hermes EOS did not respond to requests for comment.
Denmark's MP Pension said it will hold a meeting with Danske Bank this week and will ask ""a series of critical questions to make sure the bank is doing what it can to clean up to ensure that a money laundering case will never happen again"".
In another top level departure, Danske Bank said its chief legal adviser had also resigned.
""I have taken part in many of Danske Bank’s key cases in the past five years, and I feel it is time to move on in my career,"" Group General Counsel Flemming Pristed said.
""The recent Estonia case in particular has been very demanding, and it is a good time for me to stop now that a new CEO is to be appointed and the findings of the bank’s internal investigations into the matters at the Estonian branch have been announced,"" Pristed said in a statement.
NAMES IN FRAME
Danske Bank has not named any potential permanent replacements for Borgen, but the head of its Wealth Management unit Jacob Aarup-Andersen has been named by some analysts and media including Danish online media Finans as a likely new CEO, although some say that at 40 he is too inexperienced.
Aarup-Andersen took up his role in April following a two-and-a-half year stint as Danske's CFO, and before that two years as CEO of its pension fund Danica.
After having obtained a master's degree in Economy at University of Copenhagen in 2002 Aarup-Andersen worked in London's financial district for amongst others Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for ten years before he returned to Denmark for a job as Chief Portfolio Manager at Danske's Capital unit in 2012.
Others mentioned by analysts and media outlets as possible candidates are the CEO of Danish mortgage lender Nykredit, Michael Rasmussen, the Head of European Fixed Income and Commodities at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Jakob Horder, and Annika Falkengren who is the former CEO of Swedish bank SEB (ST:SEBa) and a partner in Swiss bank Lombard Odier.

Morgan Stanley and Nykredit declined to comment, while Lombard Odier did not immediately respond.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 05:19AM ET</span>",Fast and serious: Vietnam's first domestic car manufacturer bets big,"By James  Pearson  (LON:PSON)
HAIPHONG, Vietnam (Reuters) - At a time when auto companies in the developed world are facing a squeeze on their profits from cash-rich tech firms, Vietnam is betting car-making can be a ticket t o a more prosperous economy, just as it was for the likes of Japan and South Korea.
VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest conglomerate  Vingroup JSC  (HM:VIC), is set to become the country's first fully-fledged domestic car manufacturer when its first production models built under its own badge hit the streets next August.
""Where else in the world can you do this with this sort of speed?"" said Shaun Calvert, vice president of manufacturing at VinFast Trading and Production LLC, looking out over an area of factory floor where nine months earlier there was only sea.
Calvert was speaking on a recent tour of the company's new plant, a sprawling island complex in the northern Vietnamese port town of Haiphong, where the two models will be built. 
From a standing start, VinFast will have the capacity to produce 250,000 cars annually in the next five years or so, equivalent to 92 percent of all the cars sold in Vietnam last year, according to data collated by the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers' Association (VAMA).
Vingroup says it only embarked on creating VinFast a little over a year ago and has earmarked about $3.5 billion for the project.
""We are driving the rapid expansion of the domestic automobile market so we are absolutely focused on winning here first,"" CEO Jim Deluca said ahead of the Paris Motor Show this week, where VinFast will reveal its first export markets.
""We're looking to expand both within ASEAN and outside.""
Most cars sold in Vietnam are foreign brands assembled in the country from kits. But a series of free trade agreements have reduced import duties and are opening up the market. A 30 percent import tax on cars from other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries was scrapped this year.
ELECTRIC SCOOTERS
Vingroup already dominates the real estate market in Vietnam with Vinhomes, has entered the healthcare market with Vinmec, runs a chain of supermarkets called Vinmart, and entertains tourists at Vinpearl resorts.
""There's probably 4 million customers today who are associated with Vingroup in one way or another so it's a huge brand, it's an aspirational brand, and those customers are ready for a domestic VinFast product,"" said Deluca.
In a country synonymous with the motorbikes that zip around the clogged streets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, VinFast will also produce 250,000 electric scooters a year alongside the 250,000 cars, in an ambitious production target that's set to eventually increase to 1 million units each a year. 
VinFast has also started on the development of a battery electric vehicle with Germany's EDAG Engineering (DE:ED4), to be introduced in the future, Deluca added.
""We felt on the car portfolio it was best to start with an internal combustion engine and then soon after that launch the battery electric vehicle,"" said Deluca. ""From an infrastructure perspective, it's a lot easier to charge a scooter than it is an automobile.""
The speed with which VinFast has moved has partly been possible due to a reliance on off-the-shelf parts.
VinFast's first two models, an SUV and a small sedan, are being built on a frame from BMW (DE:BMWG). The components have been engineered by Canadian firm Magna International's (TO:MG) Magna Steyr, while design work has been done by Italian design house Pininfarina (MI:PNNI).
""That gives us the ability to move very, very quickly and to come out with a vehicle that is 100 percent ours and looks like no other vehicles that are on the road today,"" Deluca said.
""NATIONAL PRIDE""
The company has also imported foreign expertise. At least five of the VinFast leadership team, including Deluca and Calvert, are veterans of General Motors Co (N:GM). 
In June, the U.S. automobile giant agreed to transfer full ownership of its Hanoi factory to VinFast for the Vietnamese firm to produce small cars under a GM global license from 2019.
But, despite the institutional experience VinFast has acquired, a move into the highly competitive automobile industry is not without significant risks.
Local auto assembly companies have tried - and failed - in Vietnam to sell home-grown models to the masses. Regionally, companies such as Malaysia's Proton or Australia's Holden have struggled to gain traction outside their home countries.
""The key question is why the world needs yet another car brand in a era when hardware is commoditising,"" said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd and a former Chrysler executive.
""The fact that they have outsourced design and manufacturing and are relying on foreign R&D tells me they are following a traditional path that may not be competitive in an era of digital mobility services."" 
Bui Ngoc Huyen, chairman of Vinaxuki, which tried to establish a domestic automaker but ceased production in 2012 before its first car was officially launched, said Vingroup's deep pockets should help, but warned that building a brand would take time.
""You have to move from producing small and cheap cars to luxury ones,"" he said. ""It will take several years for a new carmaker to fine tune its products and win the confidence of consumers. It will take between 10 and 20 years.""
Deluca said VinFast's early models would be ""very affordable"" to lure local buyers, but declined to give details of pricing.
But in Vietnam, where hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets with flares and flags to celebrate moderate success after under-23 football games, VinFast is banking on an additional competitive edge

""We think national pride is a tremendous advantage for VinFast,"" said Deluca. ""What we're doing here is something special for the men and women of Vietnam"".

430,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Aston Martin narrows $6 billion IPO range after investor response,"By Kate Holton and Dasha Afanasieva
LONDON (Reuters) - Luxury British carmaker Aston Martin has cut the upper end of its initial public offering price range to 20 pounds per share, giving it a potential market value of up to 4.6 billion pounds ($6 billion), following mixed feedback from investors.
Aston Martin had initially set a range of 17.50 pounds to 22.50 pounds per share, but said on it Monday it had narrowed this to 18.50 pounds to 20 pounds and that it had enough bid interest to cover all the shares being sold at this level. 
""Feedback was mixed,"" said one person familiar with the deal saying investors were worried about the execution of the roll out of new models but were impressed by the management. 
""Bottom of the range is the only level that might work.""
Aston Martin, famed for making the sports car driven by fictional secret agent James Bond, said it expected to close the IPO books at midday London time on Tuesday. 
Bankers say that IPOs generally need twice as many bids as shares on offer to be successful. 
Several multi-billion European IPOs got off to a cautious start last week when crowd-lending platform Funding Circle  traded down on its debut while Swiss packaging company SIG Combibloc  booked gains. 
On Monday, German brake systems maker Knorr-Bremse also said it had attracted bids for all shares on offer in its initial public offering planned for later this month.
Based on around 57 million shares being sold, a free float of 25 percent, the listing would give the company a market capitalization of up to around 4.6 billion pounds. 
Depending on where it prices within the range, Aston Martin may just make it into the FTSE 100 after its flotation and will be the first car maker in the blue-chip index since Jaguar.
The company is selling around 25 percent of its stock in the first IPO by a British carmaker for decades.
The flotation follows a sale of shares by its main owners, Kuwaiti and Italian private equity groups.

""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of the fourth quarter,"" wrote Peel Hunt strategist Ian Williams, adding the deal ""may offer encouragement that the other global trade disputes can settled satisfactorily.""
Ryanair (I:RYA) was the worst performer, down 7.5 percent after it cut its forecast for full-year profit and said there could be worse to come if recent coordinated strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.
The low-cost carrier's fall weighed on the wider sector (SXTP) which was one of the only ones in the red, down 0.6 percent.

Germany's  Linde  (DE:LING) posted the highest rise, climbing 6.3 percent after it received approval for its proposed $83 billion merger with Praxair (NYSE:PX) PX.N from the Chinese antitrust authorities. 
French supermarket group  Casino  (PA:CASP) was up 0.3 percent after it said it had agreed to sell some property assets for 565 million euros ($655 million) to reduce debt levels that have worried investors.
Italian banks (FTIT8300) were up 0.5 percent after suffering their worst fall in about two years on Friday on fears the populist government's decision to increase its deficit target could threaten the long-term sustainability of its sovereign debt. 
On Sunday, Italian daily La Repubblica reported that the European Commission was set to reject Italy's budget plans in November and open a procedure against the country's public accounts. 

The Milan bourse was up 1 percent, making it the best performer among European trading centers, as it rebounded from a 3.7 percent drop on Friday.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:37AM ET</span>",Indonesia quake survivors await help as death toll climbs,"By Athit Perawongmetha
PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp.
The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet).
Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages.
President Joko Widodo told reporters getting those people out was a priority.
""The evacuation is not finished yet, there are many places where the evacuation couldn't be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive,"" Widodo said.
""We'll send as much food supplies as possible today with Hercules planes, directly from Jakarta,"" he said, referring to C-130 military transport aircraft.
The disaster agency said later more heavy equipment and personnel were needed to recover bodies.
One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said.
""We don't know how many victims could be buried there, it's estimated hundreds,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.
All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where authorities were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified.
However, nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored.
Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off.
The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million.
Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked.
""It's devastating,"" she told Reuters by text.
Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said the situation in another of the affected districts, Sigi, was dire.
""My volunteers found 34 bodies buried under tsunami debris ... missing children who had been doing a bible camp,"" she said.
Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation's five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region.

FUEL AND RICE
Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges.
A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while a stream of residents headed out.
One aid worker spoke of growing lawlessness and threats of violence among survivors seeking fuel.
The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesia's logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice.
The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery.
Military aircraft were bringing people out of Palu, where crowds were waiting at the airport.
One official told Metro TV it was hoped up to 1,500 people could be taken out every day, with children, women and the injured the priority. Media footage showed chaotic scenes with officers struggling to keep order.
Indonesia, which is on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday, and why more people in coastal areas had not moved to higher ground after a big quake, even in the absence of an official warning.
Disaster agency spokesman Nugroho told reporters on Sunday none of Indonesia's tsunami buoys, one device used to detect waves, had been operating since 2012. He blamed a lack of funds.
The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty.
However, officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force.

The head of Indonesia's investment board said Widodo had agreed to accept international help and he would coordinate private-sector assistance from around the world.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 03:16AM ET</span>","Sunk costs: Airports taking action against rising seas, storms as climate changes","By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global airport operators, faced with rising sea levels and more powerful storms as the climate changes, are starting to invest in measures including higher runways, seawalls and better drainage systems to future-proof immovable assets.
In early September, a seawall at Japan's Kansai International Airport built on a reclaimed island near Osaka, was breached during Typhoon Jebi. 
The runway was flooded and it took 17 days to fully restore airport operations, at a high cost to the region's economy as well as the dozens of airlines that canceled flights. 
Major airports in Hong Kong, mainland China and North Carolina were also closed due to tropical storms last month.
Such incidents highlight the disaster risks to investors and insurers exposed to a sector with an estimated $262 billion of projects under construction globally, according to Fitch Solutions.
""There is a kind of one-way direction with regards to the frequency and severity of climate change-related events,"" said Fitch Solutions Head of Infrastructure Richard Marshall. ""If people aren't taking that seriously, that is a risk.""
Fifteen of the 50 most heavily trafficked airports globally are at an elevation of less than 30 feet above sea level, making them particularly vulnerable to a changing climate, including rising sea levels and associated higher storm surges. 
""You see it at individual airports that are already seeing sea rise and are already dealing with water on their runway,"" Airports Council International (ACI) Director General Angela Gittens said, citing examples in island nations including Vanuatu and the Maldives. 
""But even in some of these mature economies they are having more storms, they are having to do more pumping. My old airport in Miami is in that scenario."" 
A draft copy of an ACI policy paper reviewed by Reuters and due to be released this week warns of the rising risks to facilities from climate change. It encourages member airports to conduct risk assessments, develop mitigation measures and take it into account in future master plans. 
The paper cites examples of forward-thinking airports that have taken climate change into account in planning, such as the $12 billion Istanbul Grand Airport on the Black Sea, set to become one of the world's largest airports when it opens next month.
INVESTOR INTEREST
Debt investors in particular have high exposure to airports, most of which are owned by governments or pension funds. Ratings agency Moody's alone has $174 billion of airport bonds under coverage.
Earl Heffintrayer, the lead analyst covering U.S. airports at Moody's, said the risk of climate change became apparent to investors after Superstorm Sandy closed major New York airports for days in 2012. 
Sandy led to the cancellation of nearly 17,000 flights, costing airlines $500 million in revenues and disrupting operations around the world, according to a 2017 presentation by Eurocontrol on climate change risk. 
Investors are increasingly asking about mitigation plans at low-lying airports like San Francisco and Boston as they look to invest in bonds with terms of up to 30 years, Heffintrayer said.
San Francisco International Airport, built on reclaimed land that is slowly sinking, has completed a feasibility study on a $383 million project to make the airport more resilient to sea level rises on its 8 miles (12.9 km) of bay front shoreline by 2025. 
""We are seeing a lot more thought going into protection against flood damage, catastrophe, making sure that the storm drains around the airport are fit for purpose,"" said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon. ""There definitely is a lot more thought going into potential further worsening in weather conditions further down the line.""
TAKING ACTION
Singapore's Changi Airport (CHAP.UL), which has analyzed scenarios out to 2100, has resurfaced its runways to provide for better drainage and is building a new terminal at a higher 18 feet (5.5 meters) above sea level to protect against rising seas.
Moran said such steps were prudent and would provide comfort to insurers.
""If you were to look at Singapore, if something was to happen at Changi in terms of weather-related risk, Singapore would have a problem,"" he said. ""There isn't really too much of an alternative.""
Singapore expects sea levels to rise by 2.5 feet (0.76 meter) by 2100. Changi Airport declined to comment on the cost of the extra protection. 
ACI, Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's were unable to provide Reuters with an estimate of the global cost of climate change protection at airports. The protective action is often folded into larger refurbishment and expansion projects, ratings agency analysts said.
In Australia, Brisbane Airport [BAIRP.UL] and located on reclaimed land on the coast at just 13 feet (4 meters) above sea level, is constructing a new runway 3.3 feet (1 meter) higher than it otherwise would have done, with a higher seawall and better drainage systems as sea levels rise.
Paul Coughlan, the director of Brisbane Airport's new runway project, said the incremental cost of such moves was relatively low - for example the seawall cost around A$5 million ($3.6 million) more than without taking into account sea level rises - but the potential benefits were big.
""At the end of the day, whether you are a believer in climate change or a disbeliever, doing a design that accounts for elevated sea levels, more intense rainfall, flooding considerations, that is just prudent,"" Coughlan said. 
""If you build it into your design philosophy from day one, you don't pay that much of a premium and you have bought a lot of safeguards.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, U.S. stock futures and many share markets gained on Monday after the United States and Canada forged a last-gasp deal to salvage a trilateral trade agreement in North America.
While analysts delved into the details of the pact, which is to be called United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), most investors reacted favorably, believing that getting a deal is better than no deal.
""Investors will likely view the latest agreement positively, a sign that trade disputes are easing outside China-U.S. talks,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Most European shares are expected open higher, with financial spread-betters looking for 0.4 percent gains for France's CAC (FCHI) and Germany's DAX (GDAXI). In Britain, the FTSE (FTSE) was seen slipping 0.1 percent.
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) gained 0.5 percent while Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.5 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was soft, falling 0.25 percent. China's financial markets were closed for a holiday, as was Hong Kong's stock exchange.
Casting a shadow in Asia, two surveys showed on Sunday that growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September as domestic and export demand softened.. 
The private Caixin/Markit factory Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.0, the lowest reading since May 2017, in a stark reminder that the trade disputes are starting to have real consequences on the economy.
""The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China recently has likely weighed on purchasing managers' sentiment as reflected by softer readings in trade-related sub-indices,"" wrote economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""Deterioration of PMI in September is in line with our expectation that coincident growth indicators will get worse before getting better. As U.S.-China trade conflict intensifies, we expect China's policymakers to step up monetary and fiscal easing to soften the blow from higher tariffs,"" they added.
In Japan, the Bank of Japan's tankan survey showed business confidence among Japan's big manufacturers has worsened in the September for three quarters in a row - for the first time since 2008-2009.
The world's share markets had rallied in September on hopes that China and the United States will eventually work out a deal on trade, but plans for talks around the end of the month collapsed after the two sides launched more tit-for-tat tariffs.
In the currency market, the Canadian dollar rose more than 0.5 percent to a four-month high of C$1.2814 to the U.S. dollar .
The Mexican peso also gained more than 0.6 percent to 18.54 per dollar , its highest since early August.
As risk appetites improved, the yen  softened 0.2 percent to 113.96 per dollar, its lowest since mid-November last year.
The euro was dogged by worries about a rise in Italy's fiscal deficit after the Italian government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with Brussels.
The common currency traded at $1.1608 (EUR=), having lost 1.2 percent last week and off three-month high of $1.18155 touched a week ago.
Oil prices gained, with international benchmark Brent hitting a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as other key exporters increased production.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler set to unveil new management structure,"MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) new boss Mike Manley is expected to unveil his revamped management team on Monday which will aim to keep the carmaker independent and a contender in the industry's race to develop self-driving and electric cars. 
Manley took over in July after long-time chief Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died after succumbing to complications from surgery. British-born Manley has since pledged to carry through a strategy Marchionne outlined in June to keep FCA ""strong and independent"".
One of Manley's key decisions will be the appointment of FCA's next European chief who needs to tackle a region where profitability is below that of peers, many workers are stuck in furloughs and various plants run at below capacity.
Pietro Gorlier, chief operating officer of FCA's components business, is expected to be chosen for the job, two sources familiar with the matter said.
FCA declined to comment. 
The carmaker's previous European chief Alfredo Altavilla left after FCA appointed Manley as Marchionne's successor. 
As head of the components unit, Gorlier has also led Magneti Marelli, the parts unit that FCA may either spin off or sell. 
Japan's Calsonic Kansei has been in talks with FCA about buying the unit, other sources have said, but no binding agreement has been reached and the deal could still fall apart. 
Choosing an Italian as head of Europe might soothe some fears in Italy that FCA could weaken its link to Fiat's roots. 
In his last strategy unveiled in June, Marchionne had vowed to convert Italian plants to churn out Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Maseratis instead of less profitable mass market vehicles to preserve jobs and boost margins. Europe will also become a big part of its electrification drive.
FCA will copy in Europe what worked in the United States, where it retooled plants to build pricier SUVs and trucks in a move since emulated by bigger rivals Ford (N:F) and GM (N:GM).
Manley is expected to have fewer direct reports than his predecessor, one of the sources said. 
He is also expected to name some managers for the North American operations, notably those who will succeed him at the helm of Jeep and RAM, the two brands that have been driving profits in recent years and remain at the core of growth plans.
Harald Wester, current chief technical officer and former head of Alfa Romeo and Maserati, will be given a role in that region, one of the sources said, without giving details. 
Manley and his team have big shoes to fill: Marchionne achieved what many thought impossible, most notably his huge gamble just over a decade ago when he set in motion the marriage between the then-ailing Fiat with bankrupt U.S. rival Chrysler. 
It is now the world's seventh-largest carmaker and is debt-free, but not without challenges ahead. 

FCA cut its full-year profit outlook in July, blaming a weaker-than-expected performance in China, a market that represents one of the new CEO's immediate headaches.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 01:14AM ET</span>",Why Brazil's business elites are warming to a far-right flamethrower for president,"By Tatiana Bautzer, Marcela Ayres and Christian Plumb
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's business class is quietly rooting for far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro to win the nation's highest office this month, fearful of a return to leftist rule in Latin America's largest economy.
The nation's currency and equity markets have increasingly rallied in lock-step with favorable poll numbers for Bolsonaro, a firebrand congressman better known for his broadsides against gays and Afro-Brazilians than his embrace of free markets. Over a 27-year legislative career, Bolsonaro has voted repeatedly to preserve state-owned monopolies and against reforming Brazil's bloated public pension system.
But his selection of a respected University of Chicago-educated banker, Paulo Guedes, as his economic advisor is good enough for many investors and business owners. Some view Bolsonaro as the least worst alternative in a race that is shaping up as a showdown between the far right and far left.
Pollsters are predicting a second-round run-off between Bolsonaro and former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, candidate for the leftist Workers Party, or PT, who has been surging in the polls. Many economists blame statist policies of the PT, which ruled Brazil for much of the past 15 years, for tipping Brazil into a deep downturn, whose vestiges are still weighing on the economy. 
Luciano Hang, the owner of the privately-owned department store chain Havan, is one of few executives to openly support Bolsonaro, whose unabashed admiration for Brazil's former military dictatorship and frequent denigration of women and minorities have alienated large swaths of the electorate. 
Still, Hang estimates that ""more than 80 percent"" of people in a 300-member business council to which he belongs are backing Bolsonaro now that more moderate candidates in a crowded presidential field appear to be fading.
""Business people and entrepreneurs throughout Brazil in all segments of the public favor Bolsonaro and will actively campaign for him,"" Hang said.
Bolsonaro's growing acceptance among Brazil's business elites underscores how a polarized political landscape is driving moderates to extremes, and how markets are unsettled by a wide-open and unpredictable race. Those jitters have already slowed the country’s M&A and IPO markets to a crawl and last month sent Brazil's currency, the real, to a record low against the dollar.
Bolsonaro is the current front-runner among 13 presidential candidates heading into the first round of balloting slated for Oct. 7, with 27 percent of the likely vote, according to a survey last week from polling firm Ibope.
But whether he ultimately prevails remains to be seen. If no candidate wins a majority on the first ballot, as is predicted, the top two vote-getters will face off in a final round of voting on Oct. 28, when the same poll shows Bolsonaro losing to Haddad by 4 percentage points.
Haddad, an economist, has been meeting with major investors to quell fears about a PT return to power. Known for his bookish, calm demeanor, Haddad has played up his orthodox positions on inflation, exchange rates and deficits.
Still, he has acknowledged he would dump the labor and spending reforms of unpopular outgoing President Michel Temer. And he has made it clear his administration would run state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) or Petrobras as a development vehicle and scuttle the proposed sale of Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial jet business to  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
Haddad recently tweeted that the market was ""an abstract entity that terrorizes the public.""
SUPER MINISTER
Corporate admirers of Bolsonaro, meanwhile, point to his choice of advisor Guedes as a reason to tune out their candidate's divisive rhetoric, authoritarian leanings and wildly shifting views on Brazil's economy. Bolsonaro, for example, once suggested that ex-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be gunned down for privatizing former government enterprises including iron ore miner Vale.
In contrast, Guedes, currently the head of asset management firm Bozano Investimentos, is a fierce advocate of privatizing Petrobras and government-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3). 
If elected, Bolsonaro has promised to make Guedes a kind of super minister in charge of finance, planning and trade, with wide latitude to set economic policy. 
Guedes has held a series of meetings with investment banks, corporate chieftains and international investors to coax them onto the Bolsonaro bandwagon. The banker has also met with members of the Finance Ministry at least three times in an effort to signal continuity with Temer's reform agenda, including changes to the country's insolvent pension system.
""Paulo Guedes indeed gives Bolsonaro's candidacy a lot of credibility,"" said Claudio Pacini, head of Brazilian stock trading at U.S. broker INTL FCStone in Miami. ""Together with the fear of the rise of the left, the two things mitigate in Bolsonaro's favor.""
SHAKY ALLIANCE?
But some question how long the Bolsonaro-Guedes partnership might last even if the candidate is elected.
""Bolsonaro is a recent convert to pro-market liberalism - that's not his thing, it's never been his thing,"" said Monica de Bolle, director of Latin American studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington. 
Such doubts were heightened last month when Guedes proposed reviving an unpopular financial transactions tax known as the CPMF to raise badly needed revenue. That idea was swiftly shot down by Bolsonaro from the hospital where he has been convalescing. He was stabbed by a mentally disturbed assailant at a campaign rally last month.
Guedes canceled at least two planned public appearances soon after, fueling speculation that he had been effectively muzzled by the campaign for the time being.
Guedes declined to comment about the disagreement. But de Bolle of SAIS sees turbulence ahead.
""It seems obvious that Paulo Guedes wouldn't last in a Bolsonaro government,"" she said.
Many also wonder how effectively Bolsonaro might govern if elected. In nearly three decades in Congress, he has not authored a single significant piece of legislation. His Social Liberty Party, the ninth party to which he has belonged, has only a smattering of votes in Brazil's legislature. He would need to forge alliances with other parties to get anything done, a task at which he has little experience.
“The government is broke and Bolsonaro has no allies to push for budget cuts, and not even a history of pursuing them,"" said a senior banker at one of Brazil's top lenders. 

For the business community, the banker said, a vote for Bolsonaro is a choice between “the awful and the extremely awful.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - PNC Bank, a large lender in the eastern United States, has a new strategy for expanding into additional U.S. markets, digital-only savings accounts that pay high rates to attract customers and deposits that are accompanied by a carefully limited number of branches.
In a move into the Dallas and Kansas City markets, the bank will spread what it calls an ""ultra-light"" set of ""solutions centers"" across each city so that there is an office within a 30-minute drive of 80 percent of the population, Karen Larrimer, head of PNC Retail Banking, said in an interview with Reuters.
""People want the physical locations to go to if they have questions,"" Larrimer said. That is true even though some 80 percent of PNC's current customers report visiting branches no more than once each year, she said. ""I think it is a factor of trust.""
PNC's strategy shows another way that U.S. banks are trying to navigate cost pressures and customer reliance on mobile phones as they compete for deposits.
 Citigroup  Inc, (N:C) for example, is using its mobile banking app to attract deposits nationally without opening any branches outside of the six cities where it has offices.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has also been experimenting with a digital-only account called Finn, which it introduced in October in St. Louis, where it has no branches.
But JPMorgan is also is opening about 60 new Chase branch offices in each of three markets it is entering: Washington, Philadelphia and Boston. That is about half as many full-service branches as it would have deployed before digital banking caught on.
PNC Bank is a unit of PNC Financial Services Group Inc, (N:PNC) the eighth-biggest U.S. banking holding company by assets. It has about 2,400 branches in 19 states and Washington, D.C.
To attract new customers, PNC will in the next few days begin to offer a digital-only high-yield savings account in the new cities and elsewhere outside of its current markets, Larrimer said.
The accounts will pay 2.2 percent interest, a rate that Larrimer said is intended to put PNC among the five highest found in internet searches. ""We will stay highly competitive,"" she said.
PNC will boost the rate to 2.25 percent for people who also open one of its ""Virtual Wallet"" digital accounts that offer debit cards and tools for tracking personal spending.

Citigroup executives have said they will not pay top rates to avoid attracting ""hot money"" deposits from people who switch banks for higher rates.

(Reuters) - California will require publicly listed companies with headquarters in the state to have at least one woman on their boards of directors by end of 2019, under a bill signed into law on Sunday.
The law would mandate at least two female directors by the end of 2021 if the company has five directors and three women if the company has six or more directors. Violators face fines of at least $100,000 and up to $300,000 for multiple violations of the statute. 
""Given all the special privileges that corporations have enjoyed for so long, it's high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the 'persons' in America,"" California Governor Jerry Brown said in a statement announcing the bill's signing. 
Silicon Valley tech companies started disclosing workforce diversity figures in 2014, but progress at the top has been slow, underscoring the challenge of transforming cultures that critics say are too homogenous, white and male dominated.
Companies including Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) are headquartered in California and will each need to add at least one more woman to their boards by 2021 to meet the law's requirement.
Companies have faced scrutiny in recent years on the composition of board directors and workforce diversity, with investors pushing to get more women onto boards.
""There have been numerous objections to this bill and serious legal concerns have been raised ... nevertheless, recent events in Washington, D.C. - and beyond - make it crystal clear that many are not getting the message,"" Brown said.
On Friday, President Donald Trump, under pressure from moderates in his own party over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, ordered an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, including by a California professor.
The move came after an extraordinary hearing in which Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford detailed a 36-year-old sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. 

The bill signed by Brown highlighted a six-year study conducted by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) of more than 2,000 companies worldwide that showed having women on boards was linked to improved business performance for key metrics, including stock performance.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 06:36PM ET</span>",SEC’s focus on U.S. corporate bosses pays off with Musk settlement,"By Liana B. Baker and Michelle Price
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A high-profile settlement with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk exemplifies a recent push by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go after executives and not just their companies, securities law experts said.
In the last week, the SEC announced charges or penalties against eight corporate officials at six companies, including Tesla. The SEC pursued each on different grounds, but securities lawyers said they highlight a shift to an emphasis on personal wrongdoing that has accelerated under Jay Clayton, an appointee of U.S. President Donald Trump who has served as SEC chairman since May 2017.
""Clayton is focused on holding individuals liable and not just corporate entities,"" said Mary Hansen, co-chair of the white collar defense and corporate investigations practice at Drinker Biddle, who worked in the SEC's enforcement division for eight years.
""The public wants to see our law enforcement, whether it be civil or criminal, hold those individuals responsible. That's what is driving this focus on individual liability.""
The SEC brought action last week against the former president and chief financial officer of LendingClub Asset Management, Renaud Laplanche and Carrie Dolan, and the former CEO and CFO of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Gregory Wasson and Wade Miquelon. 
In Tesla's case, the SEC fined Musk $20 million and forced him to step down as chairman to settle charges he committed securities fraud in tweets saying he was considering taking the electric carmaker private. Tesla itself was also fined $20 million.
""Holding individuals accountable is important and an effective means of deterrence,"" Clayton, a former corporate lawyer at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, said in statement on Saturday. Some Democratic lawmakers had expressed concerns during Clayton's confirmation process that his ties to Wall Street would create conflicts and weaken oversight.
In 2016, 73 percent of the SEC's standalone actions involved charges against one or more individuals, according to its own data. That rose to 80 percent in the six months after Clayton took over.
CALLS FOR INDIVIDUAL PROSECUTIONS
The SEC's focus on personal culpability has roots in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Few Wall Street executives were criminally prosecuted for their involvement, triggering calls by lawmakers and the media to hold more individuals accountable for corporate wrongdoing.
Proving individual wrongdoing and malicious intent is more difficult and resource-intensive than identifying compliance lapses at companies, legal experts said, explaining the SEC's previous reluctance to pursue such cases. 
""There is a terrible deterrent effect if you lose because it lets people know you can just fight off the regulators. That's a bad message to the markets,"" said Minor Myers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and expert on corporate governance.
But political support from both Republicans and Democrats to go after individuals has emboldened the SEC. 
Despite their traditional allegiance to the corporate world, Republicans have supported charges against executives, looking to uphold individual accountability and protect big employers and public company shareholders. 
And Democrats have been hungry for prosecutions of those who they consider to be the corrupt fat cats of corporate America.
To be sure, pursuing individuals remains a risky legal strategy for the SEC. With more to lose, including large disgorgements, fines and lifetime bans, executives are more likely to fight back in court, sucking up SEC resources. 
The SEC suffered a high-profile defeat in the insider trading case of flamboyant billionaire Mark Cuban in 2013 when he was cleared by a Texas jury of using a private tip to avoid a big loss on his 2004 sale of internet company shares. 
One of the lawyers Musk tapped to defend himself against the SEC, Latham & Watkins LLP's Christopher Clark, also advised Cuban on his defense.
But as the SEC scores more legal wins and settlements such as one the with Musk, its enforcement officers feel emboldened to pursue even more cases against individuals, legal experts said. 

""There is a huge appetite for going after people at the top of the pyramid. Those are the people you want to deter. Also, going after CEOs who have engaged in wrongdoing is a way for the SEC to generate a lot of political capital,"" said Myers.

ESSEN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) acted to end its leadership and strategy crisis on Sunday, as its supervisory board filled its two top management posts and approved plans to split the German conglomerate in two.
The move follows months of turmoil at the elevators-to-submarines group, including a profit warning and pressure from activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott, and paves the way for the company's largest restructuring in decades.
Bernhard Pellens, a member of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board since 2005, was unanimously appointed as new chairman to replace Ulrich Lehner, who left the group in July less than two weeks after CEO Heinrich Hiesinger quit.
Guido Kerkhoff, 50, was appointed CEO on a five-year contract, Thyssenkrupp said, confirming him in a role he had been filling on an acting basis since Hiesinger's resignation.
""I would like to thank the supervisory board for the confidence and the clear support it has given to the planned new set-up of Thyssenkrupp proposed by the executive board,"" Kerkhoff said in a statement.
""Our solution is responsible and equally serves the interests of employees, customers and shareholders. We will now decisively start implementation.""
Under the planned structure, Thyssenkrupp will spin off its capital goods business - elevators, car parts and plant engineering - into a separate listed entity called Thyssenkrupp Industrials.
Materials trading, shipbuilding and the group's 50 percent stake in a planned joint steel venture with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) will remain part of Thyssenkrupp, which will be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials.
Reuters was first to report last Thursday that Thyssenkrupp was considering a major overhaul, including a separation of business units.
Based on pro-forma figures for 2016/17, Thyssenkrupp Industrials had adjusted earnings before interest and taxation of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), while Thyssenkrupp Materials made 550 million euros, according to investor slides published on Sunday.
""COURAGEOUS STEP""
Thyssenkrupp Materials will initially hold a minority stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials, which it will sell down completely at some point, the charts showed.
A framework deal between management and labor representatives rules our forced layoffs, supervisory board member Susanne Herberger told Reuters.
Approval for the landmark move, announced by the company later on Thursday, was widely expected after it was backed by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation and Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's two largest shareholders, and labor representatives.
The three parties account for 13 seats of the 20-member board, where two seats are vacant after the departure of Lehner and former Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) Chief Executive Rene Obermann.
The supervisory board's nomination committee will continue its search to fill the two vacancies. Sources have told Reuters that Cevian, already represented by Jens Tischendorf, was looking to take a second board seat.
""With the new set-up, Thyssenkrupp is taking a courageous step forward. Thyssenkrupp now has a convincing plan to bring businesses closer to their customers and increase their performance,"" Pellens, 62, said.
A professor of business administration and international accounting at the Ruhr University Bochum and honorary professor at Tongji University Shanghai, Pellens also serves as the chairman of the board's audit committee.
Ingo Speich, fund manager at Thyssenkrupp shareholder Union Investment, cautioned that Pellens' board membership should not exceed 15 years, 13 of which have already passed.
""Pellens may be acceptable as supervisory board chairman given the difficult circumstances and the fact that some candidates turned down the job. But he has never led a company and, therefore, can only be an interim candidate,"" Speich said.
Cevian's Tischendorf was also appointed to the audit committee, a person familiar with the matter said.
Ursula Gather, head of the Krupp foundation, Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder, welcomed the appointments of Kerkhoff and Pellens. She added that Pellens had successfully supported and shaped many strategic decisions during his time on the board.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - After lengthy delays, an $8.2 billion revamp of a colonial-era rail line snaking from the Arabian Sea to the foothills of the Hindu Kush has become a test of Pakistan's ability to rethink signature Chinese ""Silk Road"" projects due to debt concerns.
The rail megaproject linking the coastal metropolis of Karachi to the northwestern city of Peshawar is China's biggest Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project in Pakistan, but Islamabad has balked at the cost and financing terms.
Resistance has stiffened under the new government of populist Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has voiced alarm about rising debt levels and says the country must wean itself off foreign loans.
""We are seeing how to develop a model so the government of Pakistan wouldn't have all the risk,"" Khusro Bakhtyar, minister in Pakistan's planning ministry, told reporters recently.
The cooling of enthusiasm for China's investments mirrors the unease of incoming governments in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Maldives, where new administrations have come to power wary of Chinese deals struck by their predecessors.
Pakistan's new government had wanted to review all BRI contracts. Officials say there are concerns the deals were badly negotiated, too expensive or overly favored China.
But to Islamabad's frustration, Beijing is only willing to review projects that have not yet begun, three senior government officials have told Reuters.
China's Foreign Ministry said, in a statement in response to questions faxed by Reuters, that both sides were committed to pressing forward with BRI projects, ""to ensure those projects that are already built operate as normal, and those which are being built proceed smoothly"".
Pakistani officials say they remain committed to Chinese investment but want to push harder on price and affordability, while re-orientating the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - for which Beijing has pledged about $60 billion in infrastructure funds - to focus on projects that deliver social development in line with Khan's election platform.
China's Ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing, told Reuters that Beijing was open to changes proposed by the new government and ""we will definitely follow their agenda"" to work out a roadmap for BRI projects based on ""mutual consultation"".
""It constitutes a process of discussion with each other about this kind of model, about this kind of roadmap for the future,"" Yao said.
Beijing would only proceed with projects that Pakistan wanted, he added. ""This is Pakistan's economy, this is their society,"" Yao said.
Islamabad's efforts to recalibrate CPEC are made trickier by its dependence on Chinese loans to prop up its vulnerable economy.
Growing fissures in relations with Pakistan's historic ally the United States have also weakened the country's negotiating hand, as has a current account crisis likely to lead to a bailout by the International Monetary Fund, which may demand spending cuts.
""We have reservations, but no other country is investing in Pakistan. What can we do?"" one Pakistani minister told Reuters. 
CRUMBLING RAILWAYS
The ML-1 rail line is the spine of country's dilapidated rail network, which has in recent years been edging towards collapse as passenger numbers plunge, train lines close and the vital freight business nosedives.
Khan's government has vowed to make the 1,872 km (1,163 mile) line a priority CPEC project, saying it will help the poor travel across the vast South Asian nation.
But Islamabad is exploring funding options for CPEC projects that depart from the traditional BRI lending model - whereby host nations take on Chinese debt to finance construction of infrastructure - and has invited Saudi Arabia and other countries to invest.
One option for ML-1, according to Pakistani officials, is the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, which would see investors or companies finance and build the project and recoup their investment from cashflows generated mainly by the rail freight business, before returning it to Pakistan in a few decades time.
Yao, the Chinese envoy, said Beijing was open to BOT and would ""encourage"" its companies to invest.
Rail mega-projects under China's BRI umbrella have run into problems elsewhere in Asia. A line linking Thailand and Laos has been beset by delays over financing, while Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad outright canceled the Chinese-funded $20 billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).
Beijing is happy to offer loans, but reticent to invest in the Pakistan venture as such projects are seldom profitable, according to Andrew Small, author of a book on China-Pakistan relations.
""The problem is that the Chinese don't think they can make money on this project and are not keen on BOT,"" said Small.

During President Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan in 2015, the ML-1 line was placed among a list of ""early harvest"" CPEC projects that would be prioritized, along with power plants urgently needed to end crippling electricity shortages.
But while many other projects from that list have now been completed the rail scheme has been stuck.
Pakistani officials say they became wary of how early BRI contracts were awarded to Chinese firms, and are pushing for a public tender for ML-1.
Partly to help with price discovery, Pakistan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance a chunk of the rail project through tendering. The ADB began discussions on a $1.5-2 billion loan, but China insisted the project was ""too strategic"", and Islamabad kicked out the ADB under pressure from Beijing in early 2017, according to Pakistani and ADB officials.
""If it's such a strategic project then it should be a viable project for them to finance on very concessional terms or invest in?"" said one senior Pakistani official familiar with the project, referring to the BOT model.
China's foreign ministry said Beijing was engaged in ""friendly consultations"" with Pakistan on the rail project. Chinese companies participated in BRI projects in an open and transparent way, ""pooling benefits and sharing risks"", it said. 
Analysts say Pakistan will struggle to attract non-Chinese investors into the project, which may force it to choose between piling on Chinese debt or walking away from the project.
In 2017, Pakistan turned down Chinese funding for a $14 billion mega-dam project in the Himalayas due to cost concerns and worries Beijing could end up owning a vital national asset if Pakistan could not repay loans, as occurred with a Sri Lankan port.
Khan's government chafes at several Chinese intercity mass transport projects in Punjab, the voter heartland of the previous government, which now need hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies every year. 
They also fume about the risk of accumulating off-books sovereign debt through power contracts, where annual profits of above 20 percent, in dollar terms, were guaranteed by the previous administration.
With the ML-1 line, there are also those who harbor doubts closer to home, including the previous government's finance minister, Miftah Ismail, who said his ministry had always had concerns about its viability.

""When people say it's a project of national importance, that usually means it makes no sense financially,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday it was up to the country's financial regulator to prosecute bankers following the release of a scathing report which found some institutions had pursued profit at the expense of honesty.
In almost 60 days of public hearings since February an inquiry into the financial sector heard instances of bribery, fraud, fee-gouging and board-level deception across the industry.
Some of the more shocking allegations included the charging of fees to dead people and the aggressive selling of a complicated insurance product to a boy with Down Syndrome over the telephone.
Morrison told Australian Broadcasting Corp television on Sunday that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had previously been too shy in prosecuting.
""Now ASIC, I think has been found wanting ... I’m glad we’ve increased its powers, its penalties, its resources and in particular its focus on prosecution,"" he said.
Morrison said he expected ASIC to take action against disgraced bankers following the release of the Royal Commission's interim report on Friday.
""I mean, that's the job of ASIC. It’s ASIC’s job.""
ASIC said in a statement on Friday that it would work towards building a system of tougher penalties. 
ASIC senior executive leader of corporate affairs Matthew Abbott said on Sunday that the regulator had a mandate to prosecute through the courts and had criminally convicted more than 160 people in the seven years since July 2011.
""Over that time we have also secured compensation of A$1.82 billion ($1.32 billion) for investors and consumers,"" he said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
The ASIC had also completed civil proceedings against more than 140 people, and removed more than 840 other people and companies from the financial services industry.
Australia's government proposed new laws last year to increase penalties and lengthen prison terms for financial crimes in a bid to strengthen the regulator's enforcement powers.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2018 09:34PM ET</span>","Musk to resign as Tesla chairman, remain as CEO in SEC settlement","By Michelle Price and Alexandria Sage
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company's chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement that caps a tumultuous two months for the carmaker. 
The securities fraud agreement, disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, will come as a relief to investors, who had worried that a lengthy legal fight would only further hurt the loss-making electric car company.
The SEC on Thursday charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuring market chaos hurt investors, it claimed. 
Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been bruised by Musk's recent behavior, which included smoking marijuana and wielding a sword on a webcast, and attacking a British rescue diver via Twitter. 
The settlement should place more oversight on Musk while not taking the “devastating” measure of forcing him out, said Steven Heim, a director at Boston Common Asset Management, which owns shares in Tesla battery maker Panasonic Corp. 
Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board committee to set controls over Musk's communications under the proposed agreement.
""The prompt resolution of this matter on the agreed terms is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including the shareholders of Tesla,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's charges shaved about $7 billion off high-flying Tesla, knocking its market value to $45.2 billion on Friday, below General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's $47.5 billion. 
In the settlement, the agency pulled back from its demand that Musk, who is synonymous with the Tesla brand, be barred from running Tesla, a sanction that many investors said would be disastrous. 
“I think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who rates Tesla ""neutral"" and who called the SEC's penalty ""a slap on the wrist"" for Musk. 
“The fact that he can remain CEO is very important for the company.""
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC's findings as part of the settlement, which still must be approved by a court. Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
HUNT FOR A STRONG CHAIR?
Musk had been directly involved in almost every detail of Tesla's product design and technology strategy, and drove the company's employees to extraordinary achievements - much as another Silicon Valley chief executive, Steve Jobs, did at Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
The entrepreneur is now required to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days, and he is not permitted to be re-elected to the post for three years. 
The SEC charged Tesla with failing to have required disclosure controls and procedures for Musk's tweets. The SEC said the company had no way to determine if his tweets contained information that must be disclosed in corporate filings, or if they contained complete and accurate information.
Musk walked away at the last minute from an earlier settlement with the SEC that would have required him to give up key leadership roles at the company for two years and pay a nominal fine, according to media reports on Friday. Reuters on Friday reported that Musk could settle with the SEC but was ready for a court fight. 
Investors said on Friday that it has been a mistake for Musk to turn down that settlement, especially at a time when the company has been pushing hard to meet aggressive production targets for its Model 3 sedan.
The settlement tasks the Tesla board, which critics have accused of failing to rein in Musk, with the tricky challenge of finding an independent chairman able to work closely with the sometimes unpredictable chief executive. 
It was not immediately clear who would be appointed to the role. Antonio Gracias, the current lead independent director and CEO of Valor Equity Partners, has been criticized as being too close to Musk and his companies. 
“The question is whether Musk’s buddies on the board decide to bring in a really strong chair who will stand up to Musk,” said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows corporate governance.
Musk has driven the company to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 over the past year. Electric vehicle news site Electrek reported that Tesla had produced 51,000 Model 3s with a couple of days left in the quarter, hitting its goal of 50,000 to 55,000.
The CEO, who has often turned to Twitter to promote Tesla and confront critics, said on Thursday that the SEC's actions were unjustified. Tesla shares jumped after his Aug. 7 tweets, a blow to short-sellers betting on the stock's decline. 

As the public face of Tesla, Musk had gained legions of fans for his bold approach to business and technology. He used his Twitter account to promote the achievements of Tesla, his rocket launch company SpaceX, and other projects such as his tunnel venture, the Boring Co, to his nearly 23 million followers.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>","At U.S. Marine base, families plead for housing help after Florence","By Andrea Januta
CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (Reuters) - Two weeks after Hurricane Florence devastated parts of the U.S. Southeast with raging waters and dangerous winds, some military families at the region's largest Marine Corps base say they are still residing in unlivable conditions and awaiting help from the base’s private housing manager.
Some, like Jennifer Maher, said they feel unsafe in their Camp Lejeune homes but were told they will not be moved because assessment crews determined their houses are habitable.
That did not work for Maher, pregnant in her third trimester and living with her husband and 2-year-old son. When she returned home last Friday, she opened the door to the stench of mold, she said while showing the wreckage to a visiting reporter. Then she saw the ceiling had collapsed in their bedroom and garage.
“I’m pregnant and I can smell the mold,” said Maher, whose husband is a Navy corpsman stationed at Lejeune. “There’s no way I could bring a newborn home and let her breathe this in.”
Though an assessment crew noted the collapsed ceilings and standing water, Maher said, the housing manager told the family they would not be relocated. After she threatened to complain to the Inspector General’s office on base, she said her family was given temporary lodging. She is considering breaking her lease, since she does not know if her home will be repaired before she is moved out of the temporary place.
“I understand they have a lot to take care of,” Maher said of the housing manager. “But it’s hard when your housing company says, ‘I don’t know what to tell you, go find a shelter.’”
Other families shared similar stories this week with Reuters, as the Marine Corps and the base’s private housing companies perform triage from the fallout from Florence. A reporter visited the base, speaking with three residents in their damaged homes and interviewing two others, one off base and one by phone.
This year, Reuters has been examining safety and environmental hazards faced by U.S. military families on military bases, including cases of childhood lead poisoning. At Lejeune, some families described encountering troubles that reporters observed at other bases: lags in maintenance responses by private contractors that stir worries over health.
Most of Camp Lejeune’s housing is run by Atlantic Marine Corps Communities, or AMCC, a partnership between Australia-based LendLease Group (AX:LLC), Boston-based WinnCompanies and the U.S. Navy. All the homes profiled in this story are managed by AMCC.
“Residents have multiple options to raise concerns to AMCC management and military leadership if they have persistent issues that are not addressed,” AMCC said on Saturday, in a statement provided through Marine Corps public affairs specialist Victoria Long.
According to Long, the Marine Corps Inspector General office for the region has received one complaint about housing issues related to Florence, but discovered AMCC had resolved the issue when it followed up. 
'ASKING FOR PATIENCE'
Of the more than 4,600 homes the company operates at Camp Lejeune and nearby New River Air Station, 1,200 have undergone assessments. The inspections found 82 homes uninhabitable and requiring relocation, said 2nd Lieutenant Andrew Martino, a communications officer at Camp Lejeune. Another 267 suffered sustained damage but were habitable. A further 560 homes are operated by a different manager, Lincoln Military Housing, which has not reported serious damage, he said.
“Assessments are ongoing,"" Martino said. “We’re just asking for patience around the base.”
AMCC said it has finished exterior assessments of all neighborhoods and expects to complete initial visual assessments of all home interiors by Oct. 5. It estimates 70 percent of its North Carolina inventory has experienced damage, and that repairs will take several weeks to many months.
Around 75 percent of families in the most severely damaged homes have been relocated, it said.
On its website, AMCC acknowledges many of its neighborhoods suffered widespread damage. The company is allowing families to break leases without penalty through Oct. 13, but is not guaranteeing alternative housing on base unless homes are deemed uninhabitable, its website says.
“One of our top priorities is currently assessing the damage that has occurred as a result of Hurricane Florence,” the website says. “Damages will be prioritized for safety, with the most severe and pressing cases being addressed first.”
Civilian areas, too, are struggling to recover. An estimated 8,000 or more homes in the Carolinas suffered major damage, according to the American Red Cross.
At Camp Lejeune, the base held community meetings this week to address resident concerns. Phone lines, shut down earlier, have come back online. But some residents say they have received few answers about their problems.
Another expectant mother, Paige Schneider, said AMCC told her a collapsed ceiling and mold in her home were not enough to require a move. Schneider said she told housing officials she was due within a month, and that the mold was dangerous for a newborn. Excessive exposure to mold can pose a potential health hazard.
An AMCC employee, Schneider said, suggested she and her husband remove the mold themselves.
She opted to take refuge with a friend. She was only given alternative base housing on Thursday, 13 days after the storm, when a doctor intervened. The doctor provided a letter, reviewed by Reuters, recommending that she be moved or that the property manager remove the mold.
The living conditions, the doctor wrote, are “unsafe for her or her family to reside there throughout her pregnancy or to bring a newborn home to such conditions.”
“It’s crazy it had to get that far for anything to happen,” Schneider said.
HUNKERED DOWN
As residents of coastal North Carolina prepared for Hurricane Florence’s arrival earlier this month, Camp Lejeune’s commander, Brigadier General Julian Alford, decided not to order service members and their families to evacuate. He told residents in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post he believed the base offered strong shelter in the face of a hurricane. Most of the base is not in a flood-prone area, he noted, and the base has withstood many big storms in its 77-year history.
Many families left anyway, paying out of pocket for hotels inland or scattering farther away to stay with family and friends.
No deaths were reported at the base. But some residents returned to find home ceilings caved in, drywall strewn throughout, standing water in bedrooms, and a coating of mold covering their belongings. Some homes went up to a week without power.
Onesja Johnson is waiting for her initial assessment. When she returned to the base over a week ago, she said she visited the housing office to say her ceiling was falling in and the mold made it hard for her to breathe. 
Johnson is sleeping on the couch, while her husband is deployed. She said her mattress is soaked through. Though she was told by the housing office that someone would come by to put a tarp on her roof, no one has yet, she said. “I honestly have no idea what’s going on.”
She is not alone. After returning to a kitchen infested with roaches and a mattress covered in mold, Sombra Torres and her husband were initially sleeping in their living room and eating take-out food. Sombra, also pregnant, slept on a loveseat, while her husband improvised a bed from military gear on the floor.
After two days, she said, she began to feel ill and stayed with a friend.
“I’m unable to get ahold of anybody” at AMCC, she said. “I’ve called many times and haven’t been able to get through.”

In its statement, AMCC estimated it will finish covering roofs with tarps by Monday. During the storm and for several days after, “communication lines were down and electronic capability was limited to receive residents' requests,” but has since been restored, it said. “It is possible that families with concerns were unable to reach AMCC during the storm and for several days after.”

Knorr said Bosch, the privately held auto components business, accuses it of competing in truck steering systems in violation of agreements between the two companies, according to a copy of the issue prospectus seen by Reuters.
Bosch therefore wishes to exit a joint venture by exercising an option to sell its 20 percent stake back to Knorr for 380 million euros. It has invoked arbitration proceedings in a bid to complete the sale, the prospectus adds.
Knorr disputes that Bosch has the right to exercise the option. ""We will resolutely defend ourselves against such demands,"" the company said in the prospectus.
Knorr has bundled most of its European operations into the joint venture, which is called Knorr Bremse Systeme für Nutzfahrzeuge GmbH. 
It was not immediately clear whether the dispute would affect Knorr's initial public offering, which was confirmed on Friday when the company said it would issue shares on behalf of owners Heinz Hermann Thiele and his family.
The share offering, which begins on Monday, has been priced at 72 to 87 euros apiece, valuing Knorr at between 11.6 and 14 billion euros. If completed, it would be the largest stock market listing by a German company this year and would leave Knorr with a free float of up to 30 percent.
Bosch said in response to a Reuters inquiry that it had decided to conduct a ""thorough review"" of its investment in the joint venture, citing differences over future strategy.

Bosch declined to give further details on the dispute.

(Reuters) - A U.S. trade judge on Friday declined to block the importation of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) iPhones with chips from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), handing a major defeat to  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) in its high-stakes legal dispute with the iPhone maker.
A U.S. International Trade Commission judge said Apple's phones infringed one Qualcomm patent related to power management technology, but denied the chipmaker's request for a ban on the import of some iPhones into the United States.
Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, said that ""public interest factors"" weighed against granting Qualcomm's request for a ban.
The determination will be reviewed by other judges. Qualcomm, the world’s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has another pending patent case against Apple before the ITC. 
Apple said in a statement that Qualcomm had unfairly demanded royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with.
""We’re glad the ITC stopped Qualcomm’s attempt to damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and U.S. consumers,” Apple said.
In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but ""it makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban.
""That goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products,” Rosenberg said. “There are many ways Apple could stop infringing our technology without affecting the public interest.""
Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.
San Diego, California-based Qualcomm initiated an ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.
Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but claimed that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does.
In a blog post on Friday after the ITC decision, Intel's general counsel, Steven Rodgers, said Qualcomm had ""publicly disparaged Intel’s products"" as inferior to Qualcomm's during the case.
""It is easy to say things, but Intel’s track record is clear,"" Rodgers wrote in his post. ""Every day, we push the boundaries of computing and communication technologies. And, the proof is in the pudding: last year, the U.S. Patent Office awarded more patents to Intel than to Qualcomm.""
The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts can.
Qualcomm dropped three of the six patents from the case before a trial that began in June.

Pender said in Friday's decision that Apple infringed only one of the three patents remaining in the case.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Friday that hackers stole digital login codes allowing them to take over nearly 50 million user accounts in its worst security breach ever given the unprecedented level of potential access, adding to what has been a difficult year for the company's reputation. 
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it has yet to determine whether the attacker misused any accounts or stole private information. It also has not identified the attacker’s location or whether specific victims were targeted. Its initial review suggests the attack was broad in nature.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg described the incident as “really serious"" in a conference call with reporters. His account was affected along with that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a spokeswoman said.
Shares in Facebook fell 2.6 percent on Friday, weighing on major Wall Street stock indexes. 
Facebook made headlines earlier this year after profile details from 87 million users was improperly accessed by political data firm Cambridge Analytica. The disclosure has prompted government inquiries into the company's privacy practices across the world, and fueled a ""#deleteFacebook"" social movement among consumers.
U.S. lawmakers said on Friday that the hack may boost calls for data privacy legislation.
“This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,"" Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said in a statement. 
Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra on Twitter said ""I want answers"" with a link to a Reuters story on the breach.
'COMPLEX' FLAW
Facebook's latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017, but the company first identified it on Tuesday after spotting a ""fairly large"" increase in use of its ""view as"" privacy feature on Sept. 16, executives said.
""View as"" allows users to verify their privacy settings by seeing what their own profile looks like to someone else. The flaw inadvertently gave the devices of ""view as"" users the wrong digital code, which, like a browser cookie, keeps users signed in to a service across multiple visits. 
That code could allow the person using ""view as"" to post and browse from someone else's Facebook account, potentially exposing private messages, photos and posts. The attacker also could have gained full access to victims' accounts on any third-party app or website where they had logged in with Facebook credentials. 
“The implications of this are huge,"" Justin Fier, director of cyber intelligence at security company Darktrace, told Reuters.
Guy Rosen, the Facebook vice president overseeing security, said the flaw was ""complex"" in that it resulted from three failings. 
A video upload feature should not have displayed on a user’s profile page when accessed through “view as,"" Rosen told reporters on a conference call. That alone would not have been problematic except that the video feature wrongly triggered the placement of the powerful login code. And it placed the code not for the ""view as"" user, but for who they were pretending to be.
Facebook fixed the issue on Thursday. It also notified the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Congressional aides and the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where the company has European headquarters.
The Irish authority expressed concern in a statement that Facebook has been ""unable to clarify the nature of the breach and risk to users"" and said it was pressing Facebook for answers.
Facebook reset the digital keys of the 50 million affected accounts, and as a precaution temporarily disabled ""view as"" and reset those keys for another 40 million that have been looked up through ""view as"" over the last year.
About 90 million people will have to log back into Facebook or any of their apps that use a Facebook login, the company said.
Two Facebook users sued the company over the breach in federal court in California on Friday. 
More than 6,000 users complained about the breach on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page. 
“I’m so scared now. All my activities are on Facebook,” Mohammad ZR Zia, a 25-year-old college student in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who has been using the social media platform since 2009, told Reuters. His account was logged out earlier on Friday.
The level of concern expressed on Facebook was enough that the company's automated system temporarily blocked sharing of some articles about the breach. 
""Our security systems have detected that a lot of people are posting the same content, which could mean that it's spam,"" a message told users. Facebook later apologized for the misfire. 
Facebook has suffered narrower breaches before. 

In 2013, Facebook disclosed a software flaw that exposed 6 million users' phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorized viewers for a year, while a technical glitch in 2008 revealed confidential birth-dates on 80 million Facebook users' profiles.

The broadcast and media company received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney's Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights related to the allegations against Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues in the company, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing https:// The New York State Attorney General has also requested information about the allegations, CBS said. Moonves resigned from CBS in early September after two New Yorker magazine investigations revealed a dozen women who accused him of harassment or assault. ""The Company may receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future,"" CBS said in a regulatory filing. ""The Company is cooperating with the ongoing investigation and related inquiries."" CBS declined further comment. 
Shortly after the New Yorker's July report on Moonves, CBS hired two law firms, Covington & Burling and Debevoise & Plimpton, to investigate the claims. The investigation is ongoing.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 05:49PM ET</span>","Icahn, CVR lose malpractice case against Wachtell Lipton law firm","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday dismissed an unusual lawsuit in which billionaire investor Carl Icahn accused the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz of malpractice related to his 2012 hostile takeover of  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI).
U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan said CVR failed to show that Wachtell and two of its partners, Benjamin Roth and Andrew Brownstein, should have disclosed that two banks helping CVR defend against the takeover stood to earn much higher fees if Icahn's bid succeeded than if it failed.
By suing, CVR, and thus Icahn, were essentially claiming they overpaid for the process that left the activist investor with an 82 percent stake in the petroleum refiner and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer.
Icahn's tender offer valued the Sugar Land, Texas-based company at $2.6 billion.
Sullivan said CVR's contracts with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) DBKGn.DE> entitled the banks to $18 million if CVR stayed independent, but more than $36 million if it were sold, based on a percentage of the sale price.
While that looked strange, Sullivan said the contracts were ""plain on their face,"" and a plaintiff could not allege malpractice when its ""sole allegation is that his attorney did not explain an otherwise-unambiguous legal document.""
The judge also said CVR could not hold Wachtell liable for having told CVR's chief financial officer, Frank Pici, it was ""OK to sign"" the contracts unless it knew he misunderstood them.
""Of course, defendants were not required to read Pici's mind at the risk of a malpractice claim,"" Sullivan wrote.
Sullivan said CVR could file an amended complaint only as to its claim that Wachtell committed malpractice by describing the fee terms as ""customary"" in regulatory filings.
""Obviously we're disappointed with the court's decision,"" Icahn's lawyer, Herbert Beigel, said in a phone interview. ""Suffice it to say we don't intend to abandon any claims that were dismissed. We'll obviously have to appeal the dismissal.""
Icahn is worth $17.5 billion, Forbes magazine said.
Neither Wachtell nor its outside law firm immediately responded to requests for comment.
Wachtell is still pursuing related litigation against CVR and Icahn in a New York state court in Manhattan.
Icahn had pressed the malpractice claim there as well, but dropped it last October, leaving the federal case.

The case is CVR Energy Inc v Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-06566.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) was fined $10 million on Friday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood over its handling of retail customer orders, including through its dark pool.
Both regulators said the Swiss bank's Retail Execution Services business, which closed in 2015, treated orders for which execution quality was not required to be publicly reported less favorably than orders subject to such reporting.
They also said Credit Suisse promised ordinary customers access to broad liquidity in dark pools, including its own, but processed only a ""minimal"" number of ""held orders,"" which must be executed immediately at market prices, in that manner.
""Wall Street firms cannot offer misleading assurances about the execution quality they provide their customers while engaging in electronic trading strategies that undermine those promises,"" Underwood said in a statement.
Dark pools are private trading venues that let people trade quietly, often in large orders with minimal price movement.
Credit Suisse's settlement covers alleged improper treatment of customer orders from mid-2011 through March 2015.
The bank is paying $5 million each to the SEC and Underwood's office, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
Credit Suisse spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said the bank was pleased to settle.
New York has been investigating electronic and high-frequency trading practices on Wall Street for several years.

Underwood, who became the state's attorney general after her predecessor, Eric Schneiderman, resigned in May, said her office has recouped $130.5 million of penalties from four banks in connection with the investigations.

Gold futures for December delivery were up 0.7%, or $8.50, at $1,195.90 a troy ounce by 2:06 PM ET (17:34 GMT) on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It settled the official session up $8.80 at $1,196.20, Comex data showed.
For September, though, the market was down about 1.6% for its sixth-straight monthly drop and the longest losing streak since January 1997.
Friday's high of $1,197.30 on the Comex also fell short of the $1,200 level held by the precious metal before the Fed raised rates on Wednesday for the third time this year. Earlier in the session, the market fell to a six-week low of $1,184.40.
Analysts said gold’s recovery on the day was partly aided by buying from central banks looking for hedging options after Italy’s large budget deficit raised contagion fears in the eurozone.
“There was a strong push toward gold by cenbanks today because of Italy,” said George Gero, managing director and precious metals analyst for RBC Wealth Management in New York. “But the headwinds from the Fed are still there, so you’ll likely see continued pressure for gold and probably real relief only when commodity inflation picks up again next year.”
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% at 94.72 after hitting a two-week high earlier at 94.98 on the back of the monetary tightening announced by the Fed this week.
Gold usually falls as the dollar rises, as it is denominated in the U.S. currency and is sensitive to moves in the dollar.
The Fed added a quarter point on Wednesday to bring U.S. interest rates to a range of 2.00% to 2.25%. The central bank indicated another increase in December, followed by three more in 2019 and one in 2020.
Data on Friday showed consumer spending in the U.S. rose as expected in August, although slightly lower than the prior month.
In other data, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes food and energy, was flat in August, staying at 2% after rising the prior month.

Tesla delivers its production and delivery numbers next week.
That did little to support Tesla shares amid intense debate on Wall Street, as analysts sought answers to two pivotal questions concerning Tesla's future: how valuable is Musk to Tesla and how much cash does the company need to continue its production ramp?
Barclays said that if Musk were forced to leave because of the SEC action, Tesla's stock would shed its ""Musk premium,"" worth about $130 a share. Others on the Street, however, touted further optimism, claiming a potential Musk departure would bring about a catalyst for a change in leadership.

The security issue affected almost 50 million accounts on Tuesday, Facebook said in a statement, adding that it is taking the issue ""incredibly seriously.""
Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell more than 3% in midday trading.
""Our investigation is still in its early stages,"" the company said. ""But it’s clear that attackers exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s code that impacted 'View As', a feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else. This allowed them to steal Facebook access tokens which they could then use to take over people’s accounts.""
""Access tokens are the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don’t need to re-enter their password every time they use the app,"" Facebook added.
Facebook says is has fixed the vulnerability and told law enforcement.
""We also don’t know who’s behind these attacks or where they’re based,"" the company added. ""We’re working hard to better understand these details -- and we will update this post when we have more information, or if the facts change. In addition, if we find more affected accounts, we will immediately reset their access tokens."""

The agreement came hours ahead of a deadline that could have paralyzed distribution and service channels, and followed binding assurances from the carmaker that it would address the dealers' outstanding concerns.
The carmaker had proposed new terms to the dealers in August that would have left them with significantly less income. The dispute with the dealers comes as global trade tensions and tougher emissions standards are pressuring BMW's profitability.
""We recommend that our members sign the new contracts,"" the leadership of the dealers' association said in a statement issued on Friday evening.
The association, which counts 550 independent dealerships, said it would continue talks with the company to iron out remaining differences over the five-year contracts that will enter force on Oct. 1.
The dealers account for an estimated 11 billion euros ($13 billion) of BMW revenues, while the carmaker only directly owns 50 dealerships in Germany, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported this week.

BMW has said its pretax profit would fall this year and cut its profit margin guidance for cars, blaming intense price competition following the introduction of new emissions rules.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: BMO takes gold traders from Scotiabank in precious metals expansion,"By Peter Hobson, Pratima Desai and John Tilak
LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's Bank of Montreal (BMO) (TO:BMO) has poached a team of six precious metals traders and salesmen in New York from Bank of Nova Scotia ( Scotiabank ) (TO:BNS), which is pulling back from the market, five sources familiar with the matter said. 
The hire boosts BMO's New York metals team to around eight people, making BMO's team one of the biggest in the city, the sources said. 
Canada's Scotiabank, whose ScotiaMocatta metals arm has long been the world's biggest lender to the physical precious metals industry, has been moving ahead with plans to halve the size of its metals business after a failed sale.
Banks including BMO's Canadian rivals Royal Bank of Canada ( RBC ) (TO:RY) and  CIBC  (TO:CM), traditionally strong in metals thanks to Canada's large mining industry, have been lining up to poach ScotiaMocatta's key staff or clients. 
""BMO has a good mining franchise and has always coveted Mocatta,"" one of the sources said. 
As Scotiabank began to retreat, BMO made building its presence in precious metals one of the three top objectives of its mining division, another source said.
BMO has hired Bimal Das, ScotiaMocatta's head of sales in the Americas, along with Tomas Gargantini, John Fox, Anuj Kakar, Harry Lampart and Russell Brown, the sources said.
Reuters was unable to reach the six sales and trading staff for comment. The five that had LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) accounts did not respond to messages sent via the social media platform.
The men left ScotiaMocatta in recent weeks and have not yet started work at BMO, they said, adding that BMO was likely to use the new team to expand into precious metals leasing and shipments. 
BMO is Canada's fourth-biggest lender. Scotiabank is the third-biggest. Both banks declined to comment.
Before its restructuring, sources had estimated the value of ScotiaMocatta's leases, credit lines and consignment lending of precious metal was estimated at $8 billion, dwarfing others in the market. 
It had more than 60 trading and sales staff around the world, sources said.
The defection leaves Scotiabank with fewer than five people in metals in New York. Its managing director for North America, Tim Dinneny, left in mid-May.
ScotiaMocatta's client book has attracted interest from competitors including banks JPMorgan (N:JPM) and ICBC Standard  (SS:601398), brokers INTL FCStone (O:INTL) and trading house Sumitomo, sources have said.
But Canadian rivals to Scotiabank have been among the most active. RBC hired two former ScotiaMocatta staff this year in London and CIBC added a new head of precious metals trading in New York. TD has expanded its metals unit in recent years with several hires. 
""The Canadians are moving the most aggressively,"" said one of the sources. ""Others are taking advantage, but they already have established (precious metals) franchises. The Canadian banks want to grow their businesses."" 
JPMorgan and Sumitomo declined to comment. CIBC and RBC confirmed their recent hires and did not comment further. TD and ICBC Standard did not respond to requests for comment.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Italian banks and stocks suffer worst day since Brexit vote after government budget deal,"By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares slid on Friday after the Italian government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with Brussels.
Shares in Italian banks (FTIT8300), whose big sovereign bond portfolios makes them sensitive to political risk, bore the brunt of selling pressure, sinking 7.3 percent as government bonds sold off and the focus turned to rating agencies.
Along with the main Italian stock index (FTMIB), the banks had their worst day since the June 2016 Brexit vote triggered a selloff across markets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index slid 0.8 percent with the leading euro zone stocks index (STOXX50E) down 1.3 percent. 
As the quarter drew to a close, the pan-European index managed a modest gain - its second quarter in the black. But the fact the three months resulted in just a 1 percent rise reflects the turmoil the region has gone through in that time.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) index fell 3.7 percent, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 1.4 percent.
""The deficit number is higher than expected and that clearly is not a good sign. All the attention will now shift to ratings agencies which were waiting for the budget to reconsider their scorings,"" said Gilles Guibout, portfolio manager at AXA IM in Paris.
""Meanwhile, it's difficult to imagine that Italian stocks will perform well,"" he added.
Italy's government on Thursday targeted the budget deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product for the next three years, defying Brussels and marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat.
Financials weighed heavily on the STOXX 600, dragged down by losses among Italian banks. The euro zone banks index (SX7E) fell 3.9 percent, its worst day in four months. 
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) led by Carlo Tommaselli said Italy's deficit target at 2.4 percent of GDP was not the worst-case scenario for markets but still posed some issues.
""The key point is that the higher than expected deficit is addressed to finance new expenses rather than growth,"" they wrote in a note, adding that action from rating agencies was now critical for the country's banks.
""A potential downgrade of the country rating could pose risks to the sovereign investment grade and additional potential charges to CET1 ratios which nevertheless would be mitigated by the internal models which most of the Italian banks adopt,"" they added.
Shares in Italy's two largest banks,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI), fell 8.4 and 6.7 percent, while smaller lenders such as Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and UBI (MI:UBI) were also under heavy selling pressure. 
Postal group Poste Italiane (MI:PST), which holds 130 billion euros of Italian government bonds, fell 4.3 percent.
The EU adopted a non-confrontational stance toward Italy after the budget plan was released.
Elsewhere, BASF (DE:BASFn) fell 2.3 percent after the chemicals group agreed to combine its oil and gas businesses Wintershall with DEA to create an independent European oil and gas company. BASF also said demand was slower than initially expected in the third quarter.
RSA Insurance (L:RSA) reported a small rise in net written premiums for the year so far, but said higher weather losses in Britain led to a disappointing third quarter. Its shares fell 9.3 percent.
Losses on the broader European market were limited by gains among some defensive healthcare and consumer stocks. 
Swedish aerospace company Saab (ST:SAABb) rallied 8.2 percent boosted by news its partner Boeing (NYSE:BA) had won a $9.2 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force. 

And  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) shares jumped 3.6 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts upgraded the stock to ""overweight"", predicting top-line growth would turn positive for the first time in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon and announced on Friday an $11.5 billion contract for 141 F-35 fighter jets from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), the biggest batch yet, lowering the price for the most common version of the stealthy jet by 5.4 percent to $89.2 million. 
A preliminary deal was struck in July, and reported first by Reuters, clearing the way for a larger multi-year purchase that aims to bring the cost per jet down to $80 million by 2020. Most of the jets are for the U.S. military, and others are for a number of allied countries. 
Reducing the cost of the world's most expensive defense program is crucial to securing orders in the United States and more from abroad. Lockheed is the No. 1 U.S. defense contractor.
""Driving down cost is critical to the success of this program,"" Vice Admiral Mat Winter, head of the Pentagon's F-35 office said. 
The agreement removes a roadblock from negotiations for a multi-year deal for the fighters that is expected to consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018-2020.
President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has declined as production increased. The price of the last batch of F-35A's in 2017 cost 7 percent less than the previous jet order.
Greg Ulmer, head of the F-35 program at Lockheed, said the Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects to cut the cost of the F-35A to $80 million by 2020. 
In addition, negotiations were ongoing for a multi-year deal that was said to be worth more than $37 billion, and encompassing a record 440 F-35 fighter jets.
Negotiations for this 11th batch of jets were extended because Trump-appointed Pentagon leadership drilled deep into the program to understand its costs, prolonging negotiations for the multi-year ""block buy,"" people familiar with the talks have said.
Last summer, Reuters had reported on this 11th round of contract negotiations between Lockheed and F-35 customers including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain and the United States. At the time, the anticipated price was for about $88 million per jet.
The F-35 comes in 3 variants: the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model; the F-35B, a short take-off/vertical landing version; and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.
This deal includes 91 jets for the U.S. including 53 of the A variant, 24 of the B variant and 14 of the C variant. In addition, there are 28 F-35's for international partners and 22 for Foreign Military Sales customers in this batch. 
The F-35 program is aiming to expand the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bring the unit price of the F-35A closer to $80 million in 2020 through efficiencies gained by ordering in larger quantifies.
Lockheed is aiming to deliver 91 jets in 2018 and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker hopes to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.

Lockheed is the prime contractor for the jet. Its partners including  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC), United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (L:BAES)

502,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 11:53AM ET</span>","Germany inches toward diesel fix, solution seen Monday: source","By Gernot Heller
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is on track to find a solution for tackling pollution from diesel vehicles but there is no agreement yet, a government source said after Chancellor Angela Merkel chaired a meeting on Friday in Berlin.
Final details of a deal that seeks to avert bans on older vehicles from city streets should be hammered out when leaders of Merkel's coalition of conservatives and center-left social democrats meet on Monday.
""We're on a good track,"" the source told Reuters. ""There are only details that need to be cleared up.""
Merkel has set an end-September deadline to find a way to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles, and avert more driving bans in cities that are being forced by courts to take action to improve air quality.
Yet her government has been split on how best to tackle the problem, with Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer siding with carmakers in calling for incentives to encourage owners of older models to trade them in for newer, cleaner ones.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has, meanwhile, called for hardware retrofits on older models - an option that the industry says is only feasible in some cases but which would hit fuel consumption and performance in others.
""We significantly narrowed our differences at today's meeting,"" said deputy environment minister Florian Pronold, standing by his ministry's call for retrofits and saying they should be paid for by manufacturers.
INCENTIVES
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) could offer owners of older vehicles that meet the Euro 4 emissions standard, as well as owners of some Euro 5 standard models, to trade in their cars for new ones, sources said before the meeting.
Scheuer, also speaking before the talks, told broadcaster n-tv that he would propose such incentives, saying the most effective way to reduce air pollution was to renew the fleet of cars plying Germany's city streets.
Any solution is likely to cost several billion euros. Scheuer said this week that car owners and taxpayers should not foot the bill.
In separate comments on Friday, he said he supported hardware upgrades for around 30,000 commercial vehicles, telling the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland newspaper group they could be funded from an existing clean-air program.
Earlier on Friday, the FAZ newspaper reported that carmakers may offer owners of vehicles affected by driving bans vouchers for hardware upgrades by suppliers such as Baumot (DE:TINCk) or HJS, without citing sources.
FAZ said the scheme would apply to some Euro 5 diesel vehicles and would cover 80 percent of the cost of upgrades, up to a maximum level of 3,000 euros ($3,500) per vehicle.
Older vehicles meeting the Euro 4 standard would not be covered, but their owners would be offered incentives to swap their vehicles for new ones, it said.
Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. listed equity options market is set for a record volume in 2018 due mainly to a resurgence in stock market gyrations after a couple of unusually quiet years, data from derivatives clearing organization OCC showed on Friday.
Total listed options volume for the year so far is at about 3.8 billion contracts, on pace to end the year with a little more than 5 billion contracts traded, according to a Reuters analysis of OCC's data.

Analysts pegged the surge of interest in options trading to a mix of factors, including a pick up in volatility, changed interest rate environment and growing adoption of options trading strategies.
""February and the increased volatility has created some interest,"" he said Matt Amberson, founder at Chicago-based volatility and options data firm ORATS.
A stock-market rout in February, jolted investors from their slumber and revived interest in options trading, analysts said.
Daily stock gyrations this year are a sharp departure from the trend in 2017. One-month historical volatility for the S&P 500 for the year so far is at 13.4, compared with 7.2 for the comparable period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Not only are stocks moving more, they are not all moving in tandem. Low correlation between stocks and indexes creates opportunities for putting on options trades, analysts said.

The changing interest rate environment has also provided a boost to trading activity, analysts said. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this year, most recently on Wednesday.
""What you get when you have interest rate movement is the fundamentals in underlying sectors start to diverge,"" Eric Metz, chief investment officer at SpiderRock Advisors LLC in Chicago.
Options are a useful tool for investors responding to that divergence, he said.
Both institutional and retail players have also become increasingly more comfortable using options, Metz said.
""Groups that are interested in performing options-based strategies, both institutional and retail, are escalating,"" he said.
""Education in the space over the last decade has really started to bear some fruit in the eyes of allocators,"" he said.
""And whether it's in-house or outsourced to a professional money manager like ourselves, that demand is filtering through into the options volume,"" said Metz.

""To ensure we are complying with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and protecting the interests of our clients, we have made changes to our policy regarding low-priced security,"" Bank of America spokesman Jerry Dubrowski said.
The bank considers low-priced securities as those that trade over-the-counter at, or below, $5 per share, and have limited or no financial disclosure information available.
Bank of America had begun clamping down on its clients' dealings in penny stocks in late July by banning purchases, CNBC reported earlier on Friday.
Six weeks later, the bank told clients it was restricting sales of risky securities, later amending the policy to give customers time to exit their positions, the report said.
Bank of America is the first among big financial firms to pull back on the purchase of penny stocks, although companies including UBS (S:UBSG) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) have review processes in place to evaluate risky trades, people with knowledge of those firms' policies told CNBC.
Over-the-counter securities have suffered a fall in reputation after being used for decades as tools for fraudulent schemes, thanks to lack of disclosure requirements.
Brokerages and traders looking to make quick money off this segment of the market buy stock in dormant shell companies, spread false information to promote the companies' products, and then dump the shares as other investors start buying in at inflated prices.

U.S. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has expressed shock at the amount of fraud related to penny stocks in his first year leading the agency. He has also said the regulator would increase scrutiny of trading in penny stocks.

OSLO (Reuters) - Two banks will raise the fees they charge power traders for clearing transactions on Nasdaq's (O:NDAQ) Nordic power exchange after a trader's default this month, sources at the banks said, while other banks may follow.
Derivatives trader Einar Aas racked up losses he could not cover on Sept. 10, leaving a 114 million euro ($132 million) hole in Nasdaq's clearing house buffers. This forced members of the power market's clearing operation to help fill the gap, including banks which process trades for customers.
""The default brought a new situation. It is natural the costs for the clients will have to be adjusted,"" said one of the sources, who is the head of clearing operations at a European bank.
""Our cost has to be covered and fees will rise depending on each customer's individual risk.""
This source said the bank would raise fees for customers within days or weeks.
A senior executive at the second bank said the bank would also soon raise fees to a ""small extent"" for its customers following the default. 
Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
Swedish bank SEB (ST:SEBa) and Dutch bank ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) said they were considering raising their fees. 
""We will have a discussion with the members clearing through us and Nasdaq. One possible outcome after assessing the risk could be raising the cost of clearing fees,"" said SEB spokesman Frank Hojem.
SEB will take into account risks of credit losses as well as regular running costs in pricing its clearing services, Hojem said.
""We are considering our options. There are several options on the table. We will communicate our decision when we are ready,"" ABN AMRO spokesman Arien Bikker said.
 Sparebank 1 SMN  (OL:MING) and  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) said they did not plan to raise fees. 
 Citigroup  (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) declined to comment. 
Some power traders, who usually pay clearing fees themselves, said they would now consider using banks to help protect against risk.
Emma Mazhari, head of forward optimization at Germany energy firm Ε.ΟΝ (DE:EONGn) said: ""We (already) clear through a bank, we were not directly impacted on that (the default) but you can anticipate that there will be indirect consequences for us further down the line."" 
She said an increase in banks' clearing fees was not surprising. ""Obviously we would have to look at that.""
Increased bank fees could trigger chain reactions and change the market, said Tor Mosegaard, head of power markets for Danske Commodities, which has already started to reduce its position on the Nordic power exchange.
""If our bank raised fees substantially we will consider closing our links to that bank ... I will negotiate with other banks,"" Mosegaar, who did not identify the bank, said.

Legal & General Investment Management, one of Europe's largest asset managers, on Friday said it intended to vote against Unilever's proposed move next month. 
""We understand Unilever has explored a number of alternatives in reaching its final decision. However, we do not believe Unilever has made a compelling case for many PLC shareholders to support the recommendation in favor of Dutch incorporation,"" Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at LGIM, said in a statement.
LGIM is the sixth-biggest shareholder in Unilever PLC, with a 1.98 percent stake, according to Reuters data. The group has total assets of 984.8 billion pounds ($1.28 trillion) under management.

German daily Handelsblatt reported earlier on Friday that the board had held off because of an imminent decision by the German government on how to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles.
Given that Germany's auto industry has rejected a proposal to lower the emissions of older diesel vehicles with hardware retrofits as too costly, it would be poor timing to spend millions of euros to buy Stadler out of his contract, which was extended by five years last year, the report said.
Stadler was forced to step down temporarily after he was taken into custody in mid-June on suspicion of interfering with an emissions investigation. Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement.
Both VW and Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.

In July, Volkswagen recruited BMW (DE:BMWG) engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it shake off the emissions scandal.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>","Ryanair strikes disrupt 40,000 passengers across Europe","By Daphne Psaledakis and Michael Serr
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A staff walkout at low-cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA) grounded planes in six European countries on Friday, disrupting the plans of more than 40,000 passengers.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has faced multiple strikes since it bowed to pressure to recognize trade unions for the first time in December, with staff stepping up pressure in talks over pay and conditions.
The impact on the airline's bookings has forced it even to consider cutting its short-term growth plans.
Cabin crews in Germany, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, as well as pilots in Germany, began a 24-hour walkout as airspace opened on Friday.
""They don't care about us. We are just numbers. We are lemons to be squeezed and thrown away,"" said Juan Fernandez, a former Ryanair employee who joined protesters at Brussels airport.
Strikers at the airport held up placards with the message 'RYANAIR MUST CHANGE'.
Ryanair, which initially canceled 150 flights due to what it said was an unnecessary strike by a ""tiny minority of cabin crew"", canceled up to 100 more on Thursday after German pilots said they would join the protest.
The Irish airline on Friday said that more than 2,150 of its 2,400 scheduled flights would operate as normal.
The action in some of Ryanair's largest markets will be its second-biggest one-day strike. About 55,000 customers were affected in August when pilots in five European countries walked out at the height of the summer holiday season.
BOOST FOR RIVAL
The strikes have boosted rival easyJet (L:EZJ), which forecast annual profit at the upper end of expectations on Friday, benefiting from robust demand and cancellations at Ryanair.
Shares in Ryanair were 0.2 percent higher at 13.18 euros by 1240 GMT, having fallen 20 percent since the action ramped up in mid-July.
Ryanair says it has made significant progress during negotiations in recent weeks, including reaching collective labor agreements with staff in Ireland, Britain, Italy and Germany.
The dispute in other markets chiefly centers on Ryanair's practice of employing a large proportion of its staff under Irish law, which unions say inconveniences staff and impedes them from accessing local social security benefits.
Hans Elsen, secretary of Belgium's LBC-NVK union, said that even though Ryanair's chief executive Michael O' Leary has said he offered unions what they wanted, LBC-NVK never got it on paper and cannot take what he says in the media as an offer.
The union represents about 90 cabin crew and pilots in Brussels.
A spokesman for Ryanair said the company has already written to the unions in Belgium and all other EU countries, offering to implement local law, social taxes and to accept local court jurisdiction.
In Frankfurt, German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) warned of more action.

""If need be, there will be further strikes. We have no other solution. We want the company to change,"" union representatives Ingolf Schumacher told Reuters.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Split marks only first step in Thyssenkrupp renewal,"By Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Matthias Inverardi
ESSEN/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) still has a long road ahead of it trying to raise margins and profits in its mediocre business divisions, investors and analysts said, adding a landmark move to split itself in two needed to be followed by changes to strategy.
In one of the most radical shake-ups of a big German company in decades, Thyssenkrupp said on Thursday it would spin off its elevators, car parts and plant engineering divisions, splitting the submarines-to-steel conglomerate into two listed entities.
The spun off entity, Thyssenkrupp Industrials, will be minority-owned by Thyssenkrupp Materials, the remaining 18 billion-euro ($20.8 billion) business which will also include metals distribution, a 50 percent stake in the company's future steel joint venture with Tata (NS:TISC), bearings and forging, and naval vessels.
But the new structure should not be mistaken for a new strategy, said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which usually represents 1 percent of Thyssenkrupp's voting rights at its annual meeting.
""There may be a problem in that a break-up by itself doesn't make the business more profitable,"" Hechtfischer said. ""What you need is an additional strategy and I don't see that yet.""
Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder, has long called for a broader overhaul of the sprawling group, saying virtually all divisions underperform their direct peers.
Activist investor Elliott, too, has said there was significant room for operational improvement.
Profit margins at Material Services, Thyssenkrupp's largest division by sales, stood at 2.3 percent in the last financial year, compared with 6.8 percent at U.S.-listed peer Reliance Steel & Aluminum (N:RS).
At Elevator Technology, Thyssenkrupp's most profitable business, margins stood at 12 percent, less than the 13.8 percent Finnish peer Kone (HE:KNEBV) made.
""Whilst we acknowledge that a split is a sensible step toward a broader portfolio change in Thyssenkrupp, it doesn't change our fundamental concerns over the quality of earnings and balance sheet,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said, keeping an ""underweight"" rating.
FIRST STEP
Thyssenkrupp shares, whose value had fallen by half since a 2011 peak, jumped as much as 17 percent on the news on Thursday, although they slipped 0.6 percent on Friday.
Guido Kerkhoff, installed as interim chief executive after the abrupt departure of long-serving Heinrich Hiesinger in July, announced the split after years of intensifying pressure from shareholders led by Cevian.
It was a bold move by the former finance chief who was initially seen as a stopgap. Kerkhoff managed to get trade union IG Metall and the company's biggest shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, to back the plan.
Cevian, which had lobbied for years for a move that would sharpen the group's focus, also expressed its support.
""Kerkhoff has bought himself a lot of time with this,"" said one investor who asked not to be named, adding the structural split was a step in the right direction.
Kerkhoff told ZDF television on Friday that although some administrative jobs may be lost as part of the transaction, he did not ""expect any major effects"" from the split.
The Industrials company will have about 90,000 employees while Materials will have nearly 40,000 workers.
The IG Metall union welcomed the move as a chance for all Thyssenkrupp's businesses to survive and avert a complete break-up of the conglomerate, although it demanded that there be no compulsory redundancies and that it keep its supervisory board role which gives it effective veto rights on major decisions.
The split must now be officially approved by the supervisory board, worked out in detail, and then voted on by shareholders in 12 to 18 months' time, Thyssenkrupp said. The board is due to meet on Sunday to give its blessing.
Analysts at HSBC broadly welcomed the move, although they cautioned that a potential merger of Thyssenkrupp's elevator business with a rival was now off the table for the foreseeable future.
""We like the idea that TK shareholders will have a claim on viable industrials businesses,"" global co-head of industrials research Michael Hagmann wrote, keeping his ""buy"" rating.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 09:57AM ET</span>",Global M&A volume drops in third-quarter as trade tensions loom,"By Liana B. Baker and Pamela Barbaglia
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions dropped to $783 billion in the third quarter, down 35 percent from the prior quarter, as the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China cast a shadow on the financial and regulatory prospects of some deals.
U.S. chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc pulled its planned $44 billion acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) in July after China delayed offering antitrust clearance, a move seen as retaliatory to the trade tariffs announced by the United States.
This has cast uncertainty on the prospects of other deals involving global companies that require Chinese regulatory approval, including aerospace supplier United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Corp's $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE:COL).
""We've got some clouds on the horizon, vis a vis a trade skirmish, or potentially a trade war with China. You have the potential for a hard Brexit and we've got rising rates,"" said Mark Shafir,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's global co-head of M&A.
The number of global announced deals hit its lowest since 2013, at about 9,135, and global deal volume was down 6 percent compared with a year ago. To be sure, dealmaking activity has remained stronger than average and the first nine months of 2018 saw global M&A reach a new record of $3.2 trillion.
M&A activity in Europe has been particularly strong, with deals worth $962.5 billion so far this year, a 72 percent increase compared with a year ago and the strongest period for European dealmaking since 2007.
U.S. M&A, which rose 14 percent year-over-year to $368.1 billion in the quarter, fared better than other regions. Announced deals in Europe fell 14 percent to $151.4 billion, while M&A in Asia-Pacific was down 38 percent to $185.1 billion, the Thomson Reuters data showed.
Among the third quarter's biggest announced deals were chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc's $18 billion acquisition of software maker CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA), and Dell Technologies Inc's proposal to pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back securities related to its stake in software company VMware Inc.
In August, dealmakers had been chasing potentially the largest buyout of all time, after billionaire Elon Musk tweeted that he had the funding secured to take electric car maker,  Tesla Motors  Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) private, valuing the company at $72 billion.
Musk had said he had held early talks about the buyout with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, a move that highlighted the growing importance in alternative pools of capital around the world, from sovereign wealth funds to pension funds. Musk decided to scrap the plan and was sued on Thursday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweets.
Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said he believes companies will gradually shy away from mega deals but remain active in midsize ones, despite the uncertain environment
""Going forward it will be hard to sustain the number of $10 billion-plus deals,"" Cristerna said. ""Next year we will see fewer transformational moves but there will be a large amount of activity in the $3 billion to $5 billion deal range because companies see the logic of doing M&A and are conscious of the difficulties and risks of going through a big transaction.""
Dealmakers said that regulatory risk remains a concern across the globe.
""Antitrust reviews are more difficult to predict,"" said Alexandra Soto, Lazard Ltd's chief operating officer of financial advisory in Europe and globally. ""The traditional definition of markets is changing and entire industries have been disrupted by new technologies."" 
Soto said companies remained interested in getting deals done to stay relevant. ""You have to be opportunistic when you operate in a disrupted market and keep on moving rather than standing still,"" she said.
Dealmakers also said they are preparing for an acquisition spree by Japanese companies, following the country's biggest-ever outbound deal this year, Takeda Pharmaceutical's 45.3 billion pounds($59.03 billion)agreement to buy London-listed drugmaker  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP). ""Many Japanese companies have access to substantial capital and they are using it to drive M&A growth outside of Japan,"" Morgan Stanley's head of Americas M&A, Tom Miles. ""We expect Japanese companies to continue outbound M&A at a strong pace.""
Tens of billions of dollars in tariffs by the United States and China have not dented the rise of most stock markets in the Western world.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) Global M&A Co-head Michael Carr said he does not see management teams ""handwringing about tariffs"" when they are trying to figure out whether to do a deal or not.
""Their attention is closer to home, competing to move their companies forward to generate growth for their shareholders,"" Carr said.
Morgan Stanley's Miles said some companies in sectors where tariffs create uncertainty are factoring it into their thinking but added, ""We have not seen uncertainty around tariffs be a major impediment to M&A so far.""

The board could announce a decision within weeks, ahead of its end-year target, as the European planemaker juggles a trio of pressures from management changes, industrial delays and a paralyzing corruption probe, they said. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) declined comment.
Faury, 50, was appointed head of the core planemaking business last December after Fabrice Bregier agreed to quit following a power battle with Enders, in a shake-up that also saw Enders draw back from plans to seek a third term in 2019.
The main external candidate,  Thales  (PA:TCFP) Chief Executive Patrice Caine, is reluctant to leave the French defense company but could do so if asked to by the French government, reports say.
The timing of the transition was not immediately clear, but two sources familiar with Airbus said it had not been excluded that Faury would become CEO as early as this year, advancing plans for a May 2019 handover.
The board could make a final decision by a Nov 13 meeting.
Enders plans to step down when his mandate expires in May after launching the company's digital transformation. His former rival Bregier was named on Friday as head of the French unit of Palantir, the U.S. data analytics firm powering that strategy.
INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS
Faury, who accompanied the board this week to China, has been seen as the top internal candidate to replace Enders since Bregier's exit. Pressure to end uncertainty grew with the resignation of the Airbus sales chief this month.
Faury has had less than a year to establish himself at the main business after previously running helicopters.
""He has won his spurs at Airbus (Commercial Aircraft). He is an industrialist who knows the issues and technology,"" a source familiar with the discussions said.
The soft-spoken, frugal French engineer will nonetheless have to tackle industrial problems that could weigh on cash generation and the pace of further production increases.
Besides delays on the A320neo plane, Airbus now faces a rash of quality problems as a new assembly line beds down in Germany, prompting Faury to tell staff this month that it risked losing customer confidence, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Quality problems can add costs and further delays.
Shares in Airbus, whose main rival is Boeing (N:BA), were down 0.7 percent at 108.12 euros on Friday, although they remain near record highs as production targets so far remain intact.
Faury will also need to restore morale shattered by a probe into the use of middlemen, now in its third year and which has left management sidelined as the board pilots the inquiry.

If confirmed, his hiring could eventually herald changes in the board, where French chairman Denis Ranque retires in 2020. Airbus usually divides chairman and CEO jobs between French and German nationals, though the ability of Paris and Berlin governments to influence that balance openly was halted in 2013.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Factbox: Impact of latest round of trade tariffs on European companies,"(Reuters) - Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, and U.S. trade disputes with Mexico, Canada and Europe, have rattled investors, led companies to rethink their strategies and boosted market volatility.
The Trump administration moved forward with fresh tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports as of Sept. 24 and China in return added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list.
Below are recent comments from European companies on trade tensions: 
** Austrian fibers producer Lenzing (VI:LENV) said it would focus on expansion in Thailand after it put on hold its $322 million project in Alabama, partly due to rising tariffs between the U.S. and China, where much of the project's production was destined. 
** German automaker BMW (DE:BMWG) blamed international trade tensions for fueling market uncertainty as it forecast a fall in 2018 pretax profit, against earlier expectations for a flat outcome.
** Volvo Cars  and its Chinese owner Geely  have postponed plans to float shares in the Swedish carmaker, blaming trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
** Bayer (DE:BAYGn) said it would be difficult to predict 2019 earnings, because the trade dispute could re-route global trade flows in farming commodities.
** UBS (S:UBSG) believes the trade dispute will extend beyond U.S. mid-term elections in November, and so the tensions and the global economic impact may yet rise.
** ""...a threat to world demand looms in 2019 from the U.S.-China trade war,"" the head of BP's (L:BP) oil trading in Asia, Janet Kong, said.
** After the U.S. imposed further tariffs on Chinese imports, Germany's BDI industry association said the escalation of the trade conflict was very concerning and would affect German firms.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Healthcare momentum rides on defensive appeal, earnings, election","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Healthcare company shares have taken the lead in the record-setting U.S. stock market, and a desire for investors to become more defensive combined with potentially strong upcoming earnings could drive them even higher.
One big uncertainty that threatens the sector's run: the looming congressional elections in less than six weeks.
Healthcare (SPXHC) has topped all other major S&P 500 sectors in the third quarter, rising more than 13 percent, or nearly twice the gain of the overall market in the period. 
The surge has propelled healthcare into the top echelon of sector performers for the year, trailing only tech <.SLPRCT> and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD), both of which are undergoing a major shake-up that could cause confusion for investors who make broad sector bets and lead to even more investment in healthcare.
""In sector reallocation, momentum certainly plays a role, and we are still very early in the momentum of the healthcare sector,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.
Investors took advantage of particularly cheap valuations for healthcare shares this summer. They were further attracted by the many healthcare companies that surpassed expectations for second-quarter profit and revenue, making it one of the best sectors on those measures. 
With fears that the economy may be on the verge of slowing, investors said healthcare, which represents 15 percent of the S&P 500, has also benefited as a potential defensive play and relative safe haven in rocky market times.
“Healthcare really is giving investors a lot of bang for its buck right now,” said Martin Jarzebowski, healthcare sector head at Federated Investors.
As much as any sector, healthcare has a lot on the line with the upcoming Nov. 6 congressional elections. Investor worries about onerous regulations, particularly for prescription drug pricing, have abated recently, analysts said, allowing for a longtime policy cloud over the stocks to lift, even as U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to lower the cost of medicines for consumers. 
Those fears would reemerge if expectations increase that Democrats were on track to seize control of both the Republican-held Senate and House of Representatives, as they are seen as more likely to impose tougher rules on industry.
""The biggest risk to the sector would be a Democratic sweep,"" Jarzebowski said.
Following seven months of outflows, more than $4.6 billion has flowed into U.S.-based healthcare mutual and exchange traded funds since May, according to data from Lipper.
May is also when valuations for the sector reached their lowest point in more than a year, at 14.6 times forward earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. 
With its surge since then, healthcare now trades at 16.3 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months. That still makes it a bargain compared to the overall S&P 500, which trades at 16.9 times.
DEFENSIVE BET
Healthcare stocks could further benefit if investors become more wary of the economic outlook.
The sector has traditionally been viewed as having ""defensive"" characteristics, strategists said. Those include the need for medical services even in an uncertain economy, healthcare's relatively lower volatility compared to other stock sectors and that many of the companies in the group have strong balance sheets.
""The later we get in the cycle, our enthusiasm for healthcare has only picked up,"" Lafferty said.
For the third quarter, for which reports will start arriving next month, healthcare earnings growth is expected to slow to 10.8 percent from 16.2 percent and 18.3 percent in the first and second quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Pharmaceutical companies, the biggest industry within the sector, are expected to see profit growth decline to 5.7 percent and 5 percent in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, from 12.1 percent and 19.8 percent in the first and second quarters, according to S&P Capital IQ. 
That pullback in growth is one reason Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research, rates the sector as ""market weight."" 
""I think it's a sector that will probably start to slow down,"" Bell said.
Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist at Jefferies, also said the sector ""needs a pause"" given its recent run. 

""The thing that is going to keep this group moving ... is going to be very good earnings,"" DeSanctis said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rallied to near 27-year highs and posted the biggest monthly gain since last October, helped by the prospect of a weaker yen and a strong U.S. economy boosting exporters profits.
During intraday trade, the Nikkei share average (N225) hit as high as 24,286.10, the highest level since November 1991.
But the benchmark index came off slightly to close just 1.4 percent higher at 24,120.04, a shade below the Jan. 23 closing high of 24,124.15. 
GRAPHIC: Nikkei soars - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ImLrCh
The index advanced 1 percent for the week, making a third straight week of gains. 
For the month, it surged 5.5 percent to post the biggest monthly gain since last October, on the earning hopes and partly as rising U.S. yields helped lift shares of financial firms, which hunt for high-yielding products such as foreign bonds.
""Still, the majority of buyers are seen short-term foreign investors, but mid-to-long term investors will probably have to catch up with the rally as well,"" said Shogo Maekawa, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
The dollar-yen level - which traded above 113.67 to hit a fresh nine-month high on Friday - is raising hopes for a brighter earnings for Japanese companies as a weaker yen boosts manufacturers' profits made abroad when repatriated.
The weaker yen and an upbeat U.S. economy have helped exporters rally, with Nintendo Co (T:7974) soaring 1.5 percent, Subaru Corp (T:7270) surging 2.3 percent and Kyocera Corp (T:6971) advancing 1.8 percent.
""There are many companies which have based their foreign currency expectations at 105 yen this year so there are hopes that companies may revise up their forecasts,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX and equity strategist at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.
Analysts said that foreign investors, who have been net sellers this year, are buying back Japanese stocks to catch up with the gains in the U.S. market, where both the S&P 500 index (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) have hit all-time highs this month.
The broader Topix (TOPX) advanced 1.0 percent in heavy trade, with turnover topping 3 trillion yen.
Other winners include shippers after the baltic dry index (BADI), for freight charges, rose 1.4 percent overnight. Mitsui OSK Lines (T:9104) surged 1.4 percent and Kawasaki Kisen (T:9107) soared 1.8 percent.
One loser was Panasonic Corp (T:6752), which provides batteries for Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). It dropped for a third day and was 1 percent lower after the top U.S. securities regulator on Thursday accused Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk of fraud.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to remove him from his role in charge of the electric car company, saying he made a series of ""false and misleading"" tweets about potentially taking Tesla private last month.

524,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees Italy Junk Risk Leading to ‘Sudden Stop’ of Capital,"(Bloomberg) -- A downgrade of Italian debt to junk following higher budget spending plans could trigger a “sudden stop” in the supply of capital, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The government’s announcement of a 2019 deficit above market expectations and potential increases to public debt will increase the risk of downgrades, which could see Italian assets decline further, Goldman said Friday. The three main ratings companies have Italy two notches above junk, with Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings set to review the nation next month.
“A downgrade by one notch by one or more rating agencies would place further pressure on Italian assets,” wrote Silvia Ardagna, senior fixed-income strategist at Goldman. “A downgrade by more than one notch could lead to negative self-fulfilling debt dynamics; under this scenario a “sudden stop” in the supply of capital cannot be ruled out.”
A sudden stop would be akin to Italy being unable to obtain sufficient foreign demand for its bonds, marking a major deterioration in the country’s ability to borrow. Debt is currently equivalent to 130 percent of economic output, with the total stock ranking alongside France as the largest in the euro area. A two-notch downgrade is not Goldman’s base case.
While Italy’s 2.4 percent budget deficit target for 2019 fell below the European Union’s 3 percent limit, it could still put further strain on the country’s finances, especially if the projected level is overshot, according to Goldman. The fiscal expansion is also unlikely to have any sizeable impact on economic growth, the bank added.
Italy’s 10-year yield rose 37 basis points to 3.26 percent, the highest level since May 29, after coalition leaders released their deficit aims. A downgrade to junk would see the country’s bonds fall out of some benchmark indexes.
Moody’s has the nation at Baa2 with a negative outlook and is due to review the country by the end of October, while S&P Global Ratings assigns a BBB grade and is due to review that on Oct. 26. Fitch Ratings lowered Italy to BBB in August."

LONDON (Reuters) - Funding Circle  struggled to shine on its 1.5 billion pound ($2 billion) market debut on Friday as the British peer-to-peer lending platform tested investor appetite for both large listings and financial technology firms.
Although shares in the company backed with a 150 million pound investment by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen initially rose, they slipped during morning trading to below their launch price of 440 pence per share.
Funding Circle, which was launched in 2010, is the first of Britain's new breed of peer-to-peer financial technology firms to launch an initial public offering (IPO) and the flotation is being closely watched as an indicator of investor demand.
The IPO, which valued Funding Circle at around 1.5 billion pounds, is expected to help to set the tone for a string of large listings in Europe.
London is seen as one of Europe's financial technology hubs and bankers have been eagerly eyeing the flotation of firms such as money transfer service Transferwise - a challenger to banks which charge high fees for sending money abroad.
Based on its offering size and pricing, which was set at the bottom end of the 420-530 pence per share range set originally by the company and its advisers, Funding Circle raised around 440 million pounds on the  London Stock Exchange .
While the stock opened in London at 460 pence per share, it then slipped and was trading at 439 pence at 0922 GMT. 
'INVESTOR DIALOGUE'
Funding Circle's online lending platform enables investors including banks, asset managers, insurers, government-backed entities and funds to lend to small and medium-sized businesses in Britain, the United States, Germany and the Netherlands.
The company said that in the six months to the end of June it had an adjusted loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 16.3 million pounds on revenue of 63 million pounds.
Funding Circle's flotation is a boost to the London Stock Exchange (L:LSE), which has been looking to attract large technology firms for whom New York is often more enticing because of its track record of technology floats.
Cyber security firm Avast traded lower when it went public in May 2018, while Alfa Financial (L:ALFAAL), which provides software for the asset finance industry, rose sharply on its May 2017 listing. 
A banker working on Funding Circle's debut said the deal would set the tone for others:

""Once you get to three or four, it begins to be a track record and it opens a dialogue with investors.""

529,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Australian inquiry slams greedy banks and regulator for rampant misconduct,"By Colin Packham and Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's big banks and wealth managers pursued profit ahead of their customers' interests and saw regulatory compliance as a cost rather than a guide to proper conduct, a scathing interim report from a commission of inquiry said on Friday. 
The sector has been rocked by months of revelations of wrongdoing stemming from the Royal Commission, driving down share prices and trashing the reputations of some of the country's biggest companies.
Commissioner Kenneth Hayne's report was brutal in its assessment of the industry's ethical standards and governance while also criticizing efforts by the regulator to police behavior, although it did not immediately recommend any legal action or reform. A final report is due in February.
In almost 60 days of public hearings, the inquiry has heard instances of bribery, fraud, fee-gouging and board-level deception across the industry.
Some of the more shocking allegations included the charging of fees to dead people, persuading a legally blind pensioner to be a loan guarantor without warning her of the risks, and the aggressive selling of a complicated insurance product to a boy with Down Syndrome over the telephone.
The three-volume report blamed a widespread culture of avarice.
""Too often, the answer seems to be greed – the pursuit of short term profit at the expense of basic standards of honesty. How else is charging continuing advice fees to the dead to be explained?"" it said.
The banking lobby said the interim report marked a ""day of shame"" for the country's lenders. 
""There are no excuses for the behavior that has been exposed by the Royal Commission,"" said Anna Bligh, chief executive of the Australian Banking Association.
In separate statements, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) acknowledged the wrong-doing raised in the report.
They pledged to provide a more comprehensive response in October. The four are due to face questioning over the report before a parliamentary committee next month.
The lack of immediate recommendations helped lift Australia's financial index (AXFJ) 1.6 percent on Friday. The big four banks have lost some A$30 billion ($22 billion) in combined market value since the commission was announced in late November last year.
The report said the inquiry would probe further into whether commission remuneration structures for mortgage brokers and financial advisers - a pillar of the sector's profitability - could actually serve customers properly.
""Should financial product sellers be permitted to provide financial advice ... at all?"" the report said.
The final report could recommend major regulatory reform for banks, financial advisers, pension funds and insurers, as well as civil and criminal prosecutions.
In addition to the banks, wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) has taken a huge reputational hit due to the inquiry while the nation's insurers have also come under fire.
REGULATORY WEAKNESS
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the report demonstrated a need for the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), to do more to tackle misconduct in the troubled sector.
""They do need to pursue litigation, to impose the penalties that are available to them, rather than some of these negotiated settlements which have seen the perpetrators of these offences or misconduct get off too lightly,"" he said.
Australia's centre-right government late last year proposed new laws to increase penalties and lengthen prison terms for financial crimes in a bid to strengthen the regulator's enforcement powers.
In particular, the inquiry found ASIC was too quick to negotiate settlements with banks following breaches.
""Much more often than not, when misconduct was revealed, little happened beyond apology from the entity, a drawn-out remediation program and protracted negotiation with ASIC of a media release, an infringement notice, or an enforceable undertaking that acknowledged no more than that ASIC had reasonable ‘concerns’ about the entity’s conduct,"" the report said.
ASIC said in a statement on Friday that it would work towards building a system of tougher penalties.

LONDON (Reuters) - Telecoms and financial services companies face an investigation by Britain's competition regulator after consumer body Citizens Advice complained that customers who do not switch providers were being ""ripped off"" .
Such customers were being overcharged 4.1 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) a year, the charity said on Friday and asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to tackle this.
""The practice of overcharging loyal customers is widespread and Citizens Advice has repeatedly warned that loyal consumers are being ripped off,"" its Chief Executive Gillian Guy said.
Citizens Advice submitted a so-called super complaint, which the government defines as raising ""any feature, or combination of features"" of a market for goods or services which ""appears to be significantly harming the interests of consumers"".
The CMA said it would consider the concerns raised and what should be done about them. This will include engagement with relevant regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Ofcom. It will publish a response within 90 days.
The competition regulator said possible outcomes include recommendations to change legislation, action by sectoral regulators and competition or consumer enforcement action.
Citizens Advice said its research had found that eight in ten people were paying a significantly higher price, in at least one of the markets, for remaining with their existing supplier.
""As a result of this super-complaint, the CMA should come up with concrete measures to end this systematic scam,"" Guy said.
IMPORTANT ISSUES
The FCA said it has been concerned for some time about the issue of long-standing customers being charged more for some products than new ones.
The financial watchdog said it would launch a market study into how general insurance firms charge their customers for home and motor insurance.
""Citizens Advice have raised a number of important issues and we will work closely with the CMA as they investigate this super-complaint,"" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said.
The FCA said it was already looking at the savings and mortgages market.
UK Finance, which represents banks, said the industry has already made changes to improve competition in mortgages and savings markets, including helping longstanding borrowers switch to a better deal.
The super-complaint is the fourth the charity has made since being given the power in 2002.
It said its complaint on payment protection insurance (PPI) in 2005 has helped customers receive 32.2 billion pounds in refunds and compensation so far.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday to its lowest in nearly two weeks while Italy's bond yields hit their highest in three after the government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with Brussels.
The Italian government on Thursday targeted a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat.
The deficit, though within the prescribed EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, is a concern for investors who fear the country's anti-establishment government is not committed to tackling its huge debt load. Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio stands at about 130 percent, the highest in the euro zone behind Greece.
(For a graphic on 'Where next for Italy's debt levels?' click https://reut.rs/2KmGDwe)
European shares opened lower, with shares in Italian banks - whose big sovereign bond portfolios make them sensitive to political risk - bearing the brunt of selling pressure. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3 percent by 0743 GMT. (EU)
Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.9 percent, while Germany's DAX dipped by 0.4 percent.
Italy's two-year bond yields - the most sensitive to political noise in recent months -- were up 31 basis points in early trade at 1.09 percent.
Other Italian yields were also higher on the day, with five-year yields rising 26 bps to 2.16 percent and benchmark 10-year yields up 17 bps at 3.08 percent. [GVD/EUR]
The euro fell to an 11-day low of $1.1615 after suffering its worst one-day decline in seven weeks on Thursday.
""The 2.4 percent target is not consistent with an improvement in the structural budget balance and hence they seem to be on a collision course with Brussels,"" said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.
""For me the key issue is what they assume on the budget beyond 2019. They are seemingly leaving the path of fiscal consolidation and that may not sit well with ratings agencies.""
The falls in European shares left MSCI's All-Country World Index down 0.1 percent and set for its firstly weekly loss since early September.
In Asia earlier, Japan's Nikkei raced to a 27-year high on the back of a lower yen and improved prospects for corporate earnings.
Japan's Nikkei stock index rose as high as 24,286.10 points, its strongest since November 1991, on renewed optimism over the global economy and hopes of a boost to exporters' earnings from a weaker yen. It was last up 1.5 percent.
Shares in China were higher ahead of a week-long national holiday. Blue-chips stocks gained 0.8 percent and the country's main Shanghai Composite index was up 0.7 percent.
Elsewhere in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, with a 0.05 percent decline.

After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday - the third increase this year - Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the United States does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the central bank plans to keep raising rates gradually.

""The Citi US Economic Surprise Index has been pushed into negative territory by disappointing housing data in the United States,"" they wrote.
""The latest data confirms that the housing market continues to be less than ideal. Pending home sales, a leading indicator, declined to the lowest level in seven months.""

534,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>","U.S. regulator sues Musk for fraud, seeks to remove him from Tesla","By Jonathan Stempel and Alexandria Sage
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Thursday of fraud and sought to remove him from his role in charge of the electric car company, saying he made a series of ""false and misleading"" tweets about potentially taking Tesla private last month.
In a lawsuit, the regulator described Musk surprising members of his own team and investors with a series of tweets, starting with the Aug. 7 announcement that he was thinking of taking Tesla private. Twelve minutes after the first tweet, Tesla's head of investor relations texted Musk's chief of staff to ask whether Musk's announcement was ""legit"", the SEC said.
Musk, 47, is the public face of Tesla and losing him would be a big blow for the money-losing car maker which has a market value of more than $50 billion, chiefly because of investors' belief in Musk's leadership. 
The Department of Justice, which has the authority to press criminal charges, has also questioned the company about Musk's tweets, the company said this month. 
Tesla shares tumbled 12 percent in after-hours trading. 
""Elon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon and that's great when Elon is scoring touchdowns and grand slams but not so great when there are negative things tied to him,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at car research firm Kelley Blue Book. 
Musk said he had done nothing wrong. ""This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,"" he said in a statement. ""Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.""
Tesla's board said they are ""fully confident"" in Musk. 
The SEC's lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, caps a tumultuous two months set in motion on Aug. 7 when Musk told his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share, with ""funding secured"".
On Aug. 24, after news of the SEC probe had become known, Musk blogged https://www.tesla.com/blog/staying-public that Tesla would remain public, citing investor resistance. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the SEC filed the lawsuit after a proposed settlement with Musk fell apart. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday. 
In its lawsuit, the SEC said Musk calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20 percent premium over that day’s closing share price and because of the number's slang reference to marijuana. The lawsuit, which cites emails and text messages between Musk and Tesla executives, quoted Musk as saying he thought his girlfriend ""would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price"".
After the initial tweet, Tesla's chief financial officer asked Musk ""would it help"" if executives drafted a blog post or employee email to explain his tweet. Musk responded, ""Yeah, that would be great."" 
Musk had not discussed the $420 figure with any potential funding source before he broached the subject to Tesla's board in an Aug. 2 email, the SEC said.
The SEC said its investigation into Tesla is ongoing. 
The move to bar Musk as an officer of any public company was a rare move for the SEC against the CEO of such a well-known firm. 
“The lesson for CEOs is that the rules apply to everyone including highly successful visionaries,” said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. 
Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said the SEC had acted quickly but that most such SEC lawsuits are usually settled without going to a jury trial. Settlements can take some time to reach if the defendant is unwilling to budge on the SEC’s key demands.
RECKLESSNESS?
The SEC lawsuit comes as Tesla has been struggling to deliver its new Model 3 sedan, which is key to the company's future profitability, after a long series of production issues and delays.
Musk has long used Twitter to criticize short-sellers betting against his company, and already faced several investor lawsuits over the Aug. 7 tweets, which caused Tesla's share price to gyrate.
According to the SEC, Musk ""knew or was reckless in not knowing"" that his tweets about taking Tesla private at $420 a share were false and misleading, given that he had never discussed such a transaction with any funding source.
The SEC said Musk met for less than an hour with three representatives of Public Investment Fund, at the company's Fremont, California, plant on July 31 during which the lead representative for the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund expressed interest in taking Tesla private if the terms were ""reasonable,"" according to the lawsuit.
Musk acknowledged the meeting lacked discussion of ""even the most fundamental terms"" of the deal and nothing was set in writing, according to the lawsuit. A week later, Musk announced his plan to the world without having discussed the matter again with the fund or looked at many of the logistics of going private, the SEC said.
Late in the day of Musk's initial announcement of his plans, the head of investor relations was asked whether there was a verbal or written commitment of funding.
""I actually don't know, but I would assume that given we went full-on public with this, the offer is as firm as it gets,"" the head of investor relations responded, according to the lawsuit.

The SEC said that Musk did not communicate with the fund representatives again until three days after his tweets.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 03:53AM ET</span>","Prudential, Sun Life among bidders for CBA's Indonesia insurance business: sources","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - At least five insurers, including Britain's  Prudential  (L:PRU) and Canada's Sun Life (TO:SLF), have bid for Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (CBA) (AX:CBA) majority stake in an Indonesian insurance venture, people with knowledge of the process said.
The stake sale, which could value the venture at between $250 million and $300 million, has also received second-round bids from insurer FWD Group, Singapore-listed Great Eastern Holdings (SI:GELA), and Indonesia's Sequis Life, three people said.
Australia's biggest lender is selling its 80 percent stake in PT Commonwealth Life, which has a presence in 20 Indonesian cities with more than 500,000 individual and group customers, Reuters reported in January.
The interest in PT Commonwealth Life is the latest case of foreign insurers wanting to expand their life business in Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million people.
In March, CBA confirmed that it was undertaking a strategic review of its Indonesian life insurance business, and that it has engaged external advisers for guidance on a possible sale of the venture.
The second-round bids were submitted last week, the people said, adding potential buyers are likely to be further short-listed within the next few weeks before a decision is made by CBA.
Representatives of CBA, FWD, Great Eastern, Prudential, and Sun Life declined to comment. Sequis said it could not comment now as it was ""bound by NDA"", or non-disclosure agreement.
The people declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk to the media about the deal process.
The Australian lender has been selling some of its businesses over the past year after suffering a string of scandals including rate-rigging charges, breaches of anti-money laundering laws, and fees charged to dead clients.
CBA sold its insurance business in Australia and New Zealand to AIA Group (HK:1299) for $3.1 billion last year. It also said this year its loss-making digital banking unit in South Africa was being sold for an undisclosed sum.
The Indonesian stake sale, if completed, will also be another instance of Asian banks exiting the insurance sector to free up capital and focus on their core banking businesses amid tougher regulatory capital buffer requirements.
GROWING MARKET
Asia is a battleground for foreign insurers including  Aviva  (L:AV), Prudential and Sun Life, attracted by the region's lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums.
The people said the foreign insurers competing for CBA's stake in the Indonesian venture were looking to bolster their presence in Southeast Asia, which has seen a handful of M&A deals in the last couple of years in the insurance sector.
Swiss group Zurich Insurance (S:ZURN) said on Thursday it was acquiring an 80 percent stake in Indonesia's Adira Insurance from PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (JK:BDMN) and a minority investor for at least $414 million.
FWD, owned by Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Richard Li, has agreed to buy HSBC Holdings' (L:HSBA) stake in a Malaysian insurance joint venture as part of a plan to expand its presence in Asia, sources told Reuters last month.
Sun Life, which operates in seven Asian markets including China, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines and Malaysia, has in recent years made a series of deals in the region to acquire businesses or raise its ownership in several of those markets.
CBA raised its holding in Commonwealth Life to 80 percent in 2007 in what was then a 50:50 joint venture. The remaining 20 percent is owned by an Indonesian firm, PT Gala Arta Jaya, according to the insurer's website.

Besides the insurance joint venture, CBA also has a retail and business banking presence in Indonesia.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 02:01AM ET</span>",India's shadow banking sector likely to face shake-up after default,"By Krishna N. Das and Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's burgeoning shadow finance sector is likely to face a shake-up after defaults at one major lender battered the nation's financial markets in the past week and reinforced worries about credit risk.
Industry officials and experts say they expect Indian regulators to cancel the licenses of as many as 1,500 smaller non-banking finance companies because they don't have adequate capital, and to also make it more difficult for new applicants to get approval.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has been tightening rules for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), did not respond to requests for comment.
Better capitalized and more conservatively run finance firms are likely to swallow up an increasing number of smaller rivals, the experts said. That could make it difficult for many small borrowers to get loans, especially in the countryside where two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live, and put the brakes on a surge in private consumption with a knock-on effect on growth.
Infrastructure Financing and Leasing Services Ltd (IL&FS) (ILFS.UL), a major infrastructure financing and construction company, sent shockwaves through the NBFC sector when it defaulted on some of its debt obligations in recent weeks.
Then last Friday, a large fund manager sold short-term bonds issued by home loan provider  Dewan Housing Finance  (NS:DWNH) at a sharp discount, raising fears of wider liquidity problems.
""The way things are unfolding, there is certainly cause for concern and the sector could see consolidation,"" said Harun Rashid Khan, a former deputy governor at the RBI and now a non-executive chairman at  Bandhan Bank Ltd  (NS:BANH), formerly a microfinance company specializing in small-value loans.
""The whole issue is they have to take care of their asset-liability mismatch,"" Khan said in reference to concerns that some of the firms have borrowed short-term when their revenue streams are longer-term.
The spotlight has now been turned on thousands of ""high-risk"" small players dominating lending in villages and towns.
The shadow banking sector now comprises more than 11,400 firms with a combined balance-sheet worth 22.1 trillion rupees ($304 billion), and is less strictly regulated than banks. It has been attracting new investors, particularly as the nation's banks have had to slow their lending as they seek to work through $150 billion of stressed assets.
The NBFC loan books have grown at nearly twice the pace of banks, and the cream of them, including IL&FS, had received top credit ratings.
Those credit ratings are now being called into question - IL&FS has suffered a series of downgrades in recent months - and there are growing concerns that many of these firms took on excessive credit risk by lending to people with little means of paying them back. There are also growing questions about whether lax regulation has allowed some of these firms to be used for money laundering. 
WINNOWING OUT
Rising borrowing costs, exacerbated by the turmoil in markets in recent days, will lead to a credit crunch in the sector and make it difficult for firms that aren't well capitalized to survive, according to top investors in the sector.
""Smaller NBFCs will face the problem of cost, their quantum of liquidity may not be the same as they are getting now. But medium and large-sized NBFCs should be able to achieve their volume as well as access to funds,"" said Rajesh Sharma, owner of Capri Global Capital (NS:CAPG), an NBFC that had a loan book of 12.5 billion rupees ($172 million) in the last fiscal year.
He added that in the absence of any financial incentive for NBFCs from the government, those who ""can't manage their portfolio performance will perish"".
The RBI has already been cancelling licenses of those who do not have a minimum capital base of 20 million rupees ($275,330).
""RBI has issued show-cause notices, given them time and is now in the process of cancelling their registration. Ultimately up to 1,500 should go out,"" said Raman Aggarwal, chairman of Finance Industry Development Council, an industry body.
At the same time, Aggarwal said the central bank is ""flooded"" with hundreds of new applications to set up NBFCs. 
He denied there was any wider asset-liability mismatch in the sector. But bankers and former central bank officials said the scrutiny will be higher for newer players now that ""asset-liability mismatches have magnified among existing NBFCs"".
Nearly 11,000 of India's NBFCs are small and medium-sized businesses with an asset base of less than 5 billion rupees. But the top 400, many of which are backed by banks and finance companies, control about 90 percent of the assets under management, Aggarwal said.
""NOT RIGID""
NBFCs have been differentiating themselves from banks by forming personal relations with customers despite charging up to 2 percentage points higher interest, said Aggarwal.
""They know the local market dynamics, they understand the local economics, so you can take a credit call based on the first few minutes of discussion with the borrower,"" he said. 
Unlike banks, NBFCs are ""not rigid"" and lend to even those borrowers who may never had a bank account, credit history or tangible assets, Aggarwal said. That could include someone buying a motorised rickshaw or setting up a small restaurant.
Analysts say the current uncertainty in the market will mean NBFCs with financially strong backers such as  LIC Housing Finance  Ltd (NS:LICH), Power Finance Corp (NS:PWFC),  Rural Electrification  Corp (NS:RURL),  Bajaj Finance  (NS:BJFN) and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance (NS:CHLA) will stand out.
And there is set to be an acceleration in deals, they said.
Over the past two years, IDFC Bank (NS:IDFB) has bought Grama Vidiyal Micro Finance,  Kotak Mahindra Bank  (NS:KTKM) bought BSS Microfinance, RBL Bank (NS:RATB) took over Swadhaar Finance while  IndusInd Bank  (NS:INBK) has announced the acquisition of Bharath Financial Inclusion.
""There should be some consolidation in the market and regulation,"" said S.S. Mundra, a former RBI deputy governor who is now on the board of  Indiabulls  Housing Finance Ltd (NS:INBF), a home loan provider.
""That would be good for the system in the long run.""

543,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",Hong Kong queue of IPO hopefuls faces market reckoning,"By Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The number of companies filing to go public in Hong Kong has jumped almost threefold this year, driven in part by China's burgeoning technology sector, but they will have to contend with weaker markets which could hurt deals.
Hong Kong is on track for a bumper year of initial public offerings (IPOs), spurred by a market rally late last year and listing reforms designed to attract high-growth technology and biotechnology companies.
So far this year 214 companies have filed with the Hong Kong stock exchange, up 170 percent from last year when only 79 submitted applications, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The financial hub also overtook New York in IPO volumes, with $27.7 billion raised so far this year, the data showed.
""There's a lot more that got started than will get finished,"" said Stephen Peepels, head of U.S. Securities, Asia Pacific for law firm Hogan Lovells. ""There's probably not enough investor demand to take on all the IPOs that have been announced during 2018.""
The huge spike in companies wanting to go public is also due to the nature of the businesses, which tend to be younger, fast-growing and in need of cash - especially from China - marking a change from the years when the main IPOs in Hong Kong were done by Chinese state-owned enterprises.
However bankers expect some of them could choose to raise money privately instead, putting off IPO plans as long as markets remain difficult.
""You'll likely see some smaller transactions push out their timetable a bit,"" said Sunil Dhupelia, Head of Equity Syndicate, Asia ex-Japan at  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN).
Across Asia, companies have raised $70.5 billion in IPOs in the first three quarters of 2018, up 23 percent from the same period last year and the highest since 2014.
But performance has been patchy in Hong Kong, with some of the bigger deals still trading below their IPO price, such as smartphone maker  Xiaomi  (HK:1810), which went public in July in the world's biggest tech float in four years.
""Investing in Hong Kong IPOs has not driven investor returns in the past 6-7 months which has contributed to the general sentiment and valuation sensitivity,"" said Finlay Wright, Director, Equity Capital Markets at Rothschild Global Advisory. ""It feels like it would only take a few deals not succeeding to damage confidence and hit the rest of that pipeline.""
TRADE TENSIONS
Weak markets amid global trade tensions - which have hit emerging markets particularly hard - have weighed on many deals, making investors more selective.
""When markets are falling, many investors would choose not to participate in IPOs as the company's stock prices are more likely to fall below IPO prices once it starts trading,"" said Jian Shi Cortesi, portfolio manager of Asian equities for GAM investments.
Volvo Cars and its Chinese owner Geely (HK:0175) earlier this month postponed plans to float shares in the Swedish carmaker because of Sino-U.S. trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
However companies from the region are still lining up to go public - from Chinese movie ticketing app Maoyan Weying to Tencent Music, the music streaming company owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (HK:0700).
Last week, Chinese online food delivery-to-ticketing services firm  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) gained about 5 percent on its Hong Kong debut, sending a positive signal to other companies in the pipeline, although it was last trading below its IPO price.
""The buy side wants access to China. They want access to the consumer,"" said Aaron Arth, Head of Financing Group for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs (N:GS), referring to the market weakness.
""While some of these deals could be performing better, most investors would say over the long term, these companies will show growth and value creation.""

Goldman topped the league table for equity raising in the region, followed by  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Citigroup  (N:C).

544,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 11:14PM ET</span>","Japan Inc's global push drives Asia M&As, offsets China slowdown","By Kane Wu and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan M&A volumes are set to break a 19-year-old record and steal the spotlight in Asia this year from cooling Chinese deals, led by blockbuster takeovers such as Takeda Pharma's (T:4502) $62 billion swoop on British drugmaker  Shire  (L:SHP).
Slowing growth at home and mountains of accumulated cash are pushing Japan Inc to scout for targets abroad in sectors spanning financials, consumer, industrials, renewable energy, technology and pharmaceuticals, bankers and lawyers said.
Merger and acquisition (M&A) deals involving Japanese companies, especially inbound transactions, are expected to accelerate as the country opens up to more foreign capital ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, they said.
Japanese firms were involved in a record $289.7 billion of deals in the first nine months of 2018, more than doubling from the same period last year and exceeding the previous all-time high of 1999, Thomson Reuters data showed.
""Japanese corporates are now getting used to doing acquisitions and some managements have got more confidence in doing mega deals rather than small transactions,"" said Tatsuhiko Kamiyama, a Tokyo-based partner at law firm Clifford Chance.
The hectic activity is helping the investment banking divisions of Western banks.
Morgan Stanley's (N:MS) Japan venture with Mitsubishi UFJ retained top spot in the country's ranking for the first three quarters, data showed. The U.S. bank also topped the Asia ex-Japan M&A league table, followed by UBS (S:UBSG) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
Japan Inc announced total deals of $242.2 billion in 1999 after the country relaxed its anti-monopoly law, introduced the stock swap system and launched tax benefits that favored takeover activities.
Two decades later, Japan is again planning structural reforms to boost its growth amid a super-loose monetary policy and mass fiscal spending that have led to cheap funding costs and more shareholder accountability for corporates.
In the past quarter, a unit of Mitsubishi Chemical (T:4188) agreed to acquire Praxair's (N:PX) European assets for 5 billion euros and Renesas Electronics (T:6723) struck a deal to buy Integrated Data Technology Inc (O:IDTI) for $6.7 billion.
For the first time since 2014, Japan's outbound M&A value, at $146 billion as of Sept 26, exceeded that of China's, as dealmaking remains challenged in the world's No.2 economy due to a tougher regulatory environment, funding constraints and yuan depreciation amid an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war.
""Conclusion by Japan Inc is that local growth will be challenging to come by, and therefore an international strategy will be an important long-term requirement,"" said Rohit Chatterji, JPMorgan's (N:JPM) co-head of Asia-Pacific M&A.
OLYMPICS BOOST
Chinese firms announced $92 billion in outbound deals for the first three quarters, down 8 percent year-on-year. Chinese companies still attracted the most buyers in the region, with deal values involving a Chinese target slipping 1.3 percent to $352 billion.
Investments into India and Australia also surged due to a few mega deals, including Walmart's (N:WMT) $16 billion acquisition of Indian e-commerce company Flipkart and a $9.5 billion takeover of Australia's APA Group (AX:APA) by a consortium led by Hong Kong's CK Infrastructure Holdings (HK:1038). 
Overall, the value of deals involving Asia Pacific companies hit $1.1 trillion in the first three quarters of 2018, still a record, the data showed.
""In deal volume terms it has not been a standout year for Asia (excluding Japan) but the activity has been quite balanced across the board in terms of sectors and geographies,"" said James Tam, head of M&A, Asia Pacific at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
China's deleveraging drive is also providing opportunities for Japanese companies.
Last month, Orix Corp (T:8591) struck a $2.2 billion deal to buy a 30 percent stake in aircraft lessor Avolon holdings as its cash-strapped parent HNA Group trims holdings in its core assets.
""China's aggressive M&A push into the overseas markets is slowing, and that's good for the other companies in the region, in particular Japanese companies,"" said Mayooran Elalingam, head of M&A, Asia Pacific, at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Dealmakers are counting on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games to give inbound investments a further boost.

""2020 Olympics and the approval of integrated resorts are huge drivers for Japan ... Hotels, tourism, casino, power sectors are expected to see more deals happening,"" said Lisa Christoffers Yano, a Tokyo-based partner at Hogan Lovells.

Seoul prosecutors have accused Lee of involvement in a company-wide operation to dismantle a union at Samsung's after-service unit between 2013 and 2016 when he was chief finance officer.
The indictment of Lee and other company officials on Thursday is another headache for the tech giant whose vice chairman Jay Y. Lee, the heir to the Samsung Group, is appealing a conviction for bribery in a scandal that led to the impeachment of South Korea's former president.
Lee Sang-hoon, who has led the board since March, is not related to the founding family.
""His status remains unchanged,"" a company spokeswoman said.
Ra Doo-shik, who leads a union representing more than 1,000 workers at Samsung Electronics Service, said on Friday that the indictment was encouraging.
""We are hoping that upcoming court proceedings will reveal the true picture,"" Ra told Reuters. 

Jay Y. Lee, the de facto leader of the South Korea's biggest conglomerate, was released on a suspended sentence in February after spending nearly a year in jail. He initially received a five-year term but a higher court later reduced that by half and suspended the sentence.

SEATTLE/ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Blue Origin, the space company founded by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, has won a contract to supply engines for United Launch Alliance's massive Vulcan rocket, the companies said on Thursday.
While Blue Origin has been seen as the front-runner for the contract for months, the win is a significant milestone for the Seattle-area aerospace company as it vies to become a player in the market for lucrative U.S. military satellite launch contracts.
Choosing Blue Origin's made-in-America BE-4 engine for the next-generation heavy-lift Vulcan launch vehicle is part of ULA's path to ending U.S. reliance on Russia's RD-180 engine for national security missions. That engine currently provides the main power for ULA's legacy workhorse, Atlas V, which the Vulcan will eventually replace. 
United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of aerospace stalwarts  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), picked Blue Origin's BE-4 engine to power Vulcan's core booster over the AR1 engine put up by Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (N:AJRD).
""United Launch Alliance is the premier launch service provider for national security missions, and we're thrilled to be part of their team and that mission,"" Blue Origin's CEO, Bob Smith, said in a statement. 
The terms of the contract were not disclosed, but engines represent a major portion of the cost of a rocket. 
Aerojet Rocketdyne spokesman Steve Warren said the company was ""still excited to be on team Vulcan."" Aerojet's RL10 engine will provide power to the Vulcan rocket's upper stage.
ULA said in announcing the contract award that Vulcan was on track for an initial flight in mid-2020, though industry sources expect that deadline to be extended.
Bezos is funneling $1 billion of his own fortune annually into Blue Origin as it scrambles to fly its own heavy-lift launch vehicle, dubbed New Glenn, in 2020. New Glenn will also be powered by Blue Origin's BE-4 engine and eventually compete with ULA's Vulcan, raising questions about the clarity of Bezos' strategy. 

""Nobody disputes that with the investment they're making they won't eventually be successful,"" Matt Desch, CEO of  Iridium Communications  Inc (O:IRDM), told Reuters in August. ""But how and when they become reliable is still uncertain.""

547,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Fast food fashion: Yum China's plan to get Pizza Hut back in vogue,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In a Shanghai bistro, surrounded by brass trimmed lamps and Italian marble, models and Chinese stars sported outfits of black, white and electric purple, the signature colors of veteran American fashion designer Anna Sui.
The catwalk-style event is no fashion show, however. Instead it is part of a major push by fast food giant  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) to give its Pizza Hut brand a high-end makeover amid rising competition and flagging sales.
The glitzy store and haute couture underscore a sharp strategic shift Pizza Hut is taking to revive its fortunes. The pizza chain has experienced tumbling same store sales this year that have dragged down Yum China's overall growth.
""The brand needs to be somehow rejuvenated,"" said Leon Zhang, Shanghai-based partner at branding consultancy Prophet, highlighting a rise in health-focused consumers and a growing array of options for Chinese diners that have hit the chain.
Pizza Hut has taken note. Alongside the tie-up with Sui - more at home at fashion shows in New York or Milan - it will open a test center for innovative products in Nanjing this week and roll out new ""Kiosk"" and ""Express"" store formats.
The chain has removed some badly received products - such as pizza topped with expensive abalone shellfish - and shut some concept stores, including one with robot waiters.
Pizza Hut says it has spent at least $60 million in upgrading its products since September last year and is introducing new technologies such as those allowing customers to order food by scanning QR codes on the tables. 
Jeff Kuai, the pizza chain's general manager, said the brand had ""streamlined"" its menu and bolstered its online presence to catch up with its better-performing sister brand, fried chicken chain KFC.
""We've learned a lot from the KFC turnaround and are making progress on all aspects of the Pizza Hut revitalization plan,"" Kuai said in comments sent to Reuters. ""We are confident in our revitalization plan and committed to returning the brand to growth.""
STANDING OUT
The Pizza Hut turnaround is not Yum's first salvage job in China. The firm had to restore confidence in all its brands after a food scare in 2012 and again in 2014. In 2015 it opened a high-end Italian restaurant as a test ""lab"" in Shanghai.
The New York-listed firm, spun off from Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) in 2016, owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell in the country and is the largest fast food operator in China with more than 8,100 outlets. It is valued at $13.4 billion and looking to more than double its number of stores to 20,000 in the long-run.
While it has stabilized sales growth at KFC with upgraded stores, a big push on delivery and automated check-outs, Pizza Hut's 2,200-plus stores have proved to be more difficult to turn around. The chain has posted just three quarters of positive same store sales growth in China since the start of 2014.
""At the moment they're really struggling to differentiate themselves enough to stand out from the rest,"" said Andrew Atkinson, marketing manager at Shanghai-based research and marketing consultancy China Skinny.
""There isn't a clear message about why Pizza Hut is special and why Pizza Hut has a position in the space.""
Major rivals include Pizza Express, bought by Chinese equity firm Hony Capital in 2014, chains like Papa John's (O:PZZA) and Domino's Pizza (N:DPZ) and a growing array of smaller, local chains doing well with new products and helped by a boom in deliveries online.
These include Shenzhen-originated Le Cesar - known for inventing a pizza using the popular Asian durian fruit - that now has over 120 stores, similarly sized Mua Pizza and Magelita Pizza with 600 outlets.
Pizza Hut's new-look for its stores and staff - which will be gradually rolled out around the country - could help the brand stand out more, analysts say. The shift comes at a critical time for Yum China, which recently rebuffed a $17.6 billion buyout from a Chinese-led consortium.
The Shanghai Pizza Hut outlet, in an upscale mall, may be the future model. It bears none of the signature red and yellow hues associated with the brand in the United States and pizzas are not the main attraction on the menu.
Instead it has trendy, modern interiors, and popular dishes in China like omelet rice and Australian steak to attract younger consumers. Yum China's chief executive has described the push as helping make the brand ""Instagram-worthy"".
That might help win over consumers like Wang Chupeng, 23, an undergraduate student in Hangzhou. While she likes the atmosphere and student deals Pizza Hut offers, Wang felt the brand was still caught between more premium and budget rivals.

""If I want to eat pizza I'll usually think of somewhere else. I'd rather pay a bit more to get a better pizza,"" she said. ""Overall I think Pizza Hut is a bit expensive compared to other places with a similar quality product.""

548,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 08:41PM ET</span>",Boeing wins $9.2 billion contract for new Air Force training jet,"By Idrees Ali and Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) was selected to build the U.S. Air Force's next training jet in a contract worth up to $9.2 billion over the life of the program, the Air Force said on Thursday.
Boeing teamed up with Sweden's Saab AB (ST:SAABb) to develop a new plane for the competition, beating out  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and Leonardo DRS (MI:LDOF).
The Air Force currently plans to purchase 351 of the jets and 46 simulators. Additional purchase options on the $9.2 billion contract, first reported by Reuters, could allow the Air Force to buy as many as 475 of the jets and 120 simulators.
The service expects the first jets to be delivered in 2023 with the program to reach full operation in 2034.
In its bid, Lockheed had offered a modified version of its T-50 training jet developed jointly with Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (KS:047810) while Italy's Leonardo DRS had offered the T-100, a modified version of the Italian aerospace company's M-346.
Boeing shares edged higher after the news, to close up 0.6 percent at $367.38, while shares of Korea Aerospace fell more than 24 percent in Seoul. The company said its group lost because Boeing's bid was lower.
The Air Force wants to replace its aging fleet of T-38 planes, which are nearly 50 years old. Analysts have said it could eventually buy up to 600 planes.
General Arnold Bunch of the office of the assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition told reporters that ""two-thirds of what we train for the fighters in the fourth and the fifth gen(eration) we actually can't do in the T-38."" 
Winning the contract is significant for Boeing, which reorganized its defense business more than a year ago in the hopes of a ""franchise level"" victory such as the trainer.
Landing big defense contracts had been difficult for Boeing, but Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security since February 2016, has helped the company win more contracts.
""Today's announcement is the culmination of years of unwavering focus by the Boeing and Saab team,"" Caret said in a statement. ""We expect T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century.""
The award from the Air Force comes after Boeing has had trouble delivering to the Air Force its new in-air refueling jet, the KC-46.

In a statement Saab said the award means Boeing can now begin placing orders with its suppliers, including Saab, but has not done so yet. Saab said that more than 90 percent of Boeing’s offering will be made in America, supporting more than 17,000 jobs in 34 states.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 08:12PM ET</span>","Goldman, JPMorgan, four others must face stock lending antitrust case","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday ordered  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and four other large banks to face an antitrust lawsuit by investors who said they conspired to stifle competition in the nearly $2 trillion stock lending market.
U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in Manhattan rejected the banks' arguments that the investors, led by several pension funds, made implausible allegations and sued too late, and that the defendants' activity was reasonable.
The plaintiffs accused units of Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) of conspiring since 2009 to keep the stock lending market ""in the stone age"" by boycotting the startup platforms AQS, Data Explorers and SL-x.
They said the banks did this by using their positions on the board of co-defendant EquiLend LLC to co-opt that company as a vehicle to maintain monopoly control over the market and, as a result, charge excessive fees to investors.
The banks countered that the plaintiffs merely alleged that ""continuing to execute stock loans under existing standards and rules"" somehow amounted to an illegal conspiracy.
But in her 93-page decision, Failla found sufficient ""direct evidence"" from the plaintiffs to suggest an illegal conspiracy and let them continue their proposed class-action case.
""This dispute boils down to whether the allegations concern conduct by EquiLend alone, or conduct undertaken by the prime broker defendants using EquiLend,"" Failla wrote. ""The amended complaint adequately pleads that defendants' concerted actions amounted to an unreasonable restraint on trade.""
Michael Eisenkraft, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email: ""We are pleased with the judge's ruling and look forward to prosecuting the case.""
The banks have four weeks to formally answer the complaint by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System; California's Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, Orange County Employees Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association; and Torus Capital LLC.

The case is Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-06221.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Puerto Rico open for tourists despite 'mixed-bag' recovery - governor,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello flew to New York this week on a mission: persuade potential tourists that the hurricane-ravaged island was ready for their return.
But Puerto Rico's recovery from last year’s Hurricane Maria has been a “mixed bag,” Rossello told Reuters on Thursday, acknowledging that the bankrupt U.S. territory, while improving, is far from out of the woods.
Puerto Rico has received only a small fraction of the federal funding it needs to get back on its feet, Rossello said in a 75-minute interview, and getting access to the rest could take more than a decade.
His administration estimates that fixing Puerto Rico fully will require $139 billion, but the federal government has earmarked only about $60 billion to $65 billion for the recovery, he said. Of that, only about $3 billion to $4 billion has actually flowed into the island’s coffers. Obtaining the remainder could take 10 to 11 years, he said, adding that his team is lobbying the U.S. Congress for more money. 
Compounding the problem is Puerto Rico's bankruptcy in U.S. federal court, where it is trying to restructure $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. There are also ongoing spending disputes between the government and a federally appointed fiscal oversight board. 
In the year since Hurricane Maria, Rossello has at times been diplomatic regarding the federal government’s response, while at other times – especially lately - adopting a more critical take. He has also been criticized for sticking with an estimated death toll of 64 early-on, when strong evidence suggested it could be higher. A government-commissioned study by researchers at George Washington University eventually pegged the toll at around 3,000.
When asked whether his administration’s messaging strategies have been tied to an effort to maintain good relations with President Donald Trump, Rossello said a “critical part” of the island’s recovery “is making sure the federal government responds to our petitions.” 
“So yes, I have opted for a path that involves dialogue, that involves collaboration,” Rossello said, adding that he has not been afraid to be critical. 
If Trump does not sign the island’s request to extend the federal government’s 100 percent coverage of repair costs, “I’ll be the first one to fight it,” Rossello said, “and I’ll be the first to point out that action, or lack of action, is one of the main obstacles to our recovery.” 
Rossello said Puerto Rico still has as many as 60,000 homes with temporary tarp roofs. It also has hundreds of thousands of informally constructed homes with many owners lacking title to their property. 
Rebuilding will require the current ranks of about 45,000 construction workers to grow to 130,000, according to Rossello, who recently signed an executive order increasing the minimum hourly construction wage to $15 despite opposition from the oversight board and the private sector.
POWER SHIFT
The island’s government is still considering initiatives that could make the island’s troubled electricity grid more resilient, Rossello said. Ultimately, the island hopes to generate 40 percent of its electricity from renewables and steer away from fossil fuels. The shift would require a new regulatory policy, approval by the bondholders, and, potentially, investment from outside companies or organizations.
“We have received 10 to 12 unsolicited proposals for generation,” he said, while acknowledging the government has yet to find a private operator for the power utility's transmission and distribution operations. 
But changes at the electric agency known as PREPA, which Rossello called one of the most troubled organizations in modern history, will be gradual. The governor said he is working with a search firm to identify outside board members for the utility, after nearly the entire board quit in an uproar over appointment of a new CEO.   
Limited electricity was a major problem for the island's small business sector, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report on Thursday. A survey of more than 400 businesses with fewer than 500 employees found 77 percent suffered losses as a result of hurricanes Irma and Maria. 
ISLAND BECKONS TOURISTS
Meanwhile, Rossello is trying not only to restore tourism, but to expand it in such a way that it incorporates hundreds of square miles of seaside and mountain communities that are largely unvisited. Puerto Rico's tourism is small compared with other Caribbean locales and tends to be centered in San Juan.
The island's visitor lodgings hit a 2017 high of 204,025 in July, but fell to just under 30,000 in October following the hurricanes, according to Puerto Rico Tourism Company data.
Convincing tourists to leave the capital, though, will require easier travel. “Puerto Rico should be a multi-port destination,” he said, discussing plans to beef up airport capacity in the south and west of the island. 
He emphasized the possibility of capitalizing on Puerto Rico’s near-constant spate of community festivals. “We have flower festivals, orange festivals, plantain festivals, coffee festivals, music festivals.”
Rossello pointed to so-called chinchorreos as a possible draw, events in which Puerto Rican foodies move from one inexpensive eatery to the next. 

“A bar crawl for food - that’s the best way to put it,” the governor said, “and the island is small, so you start in one place and you’re on a beachfront, and 15 minutes later you’re in the mountains.”

The new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) regime, which went into effect on Sept. 1, gives higher CO2 readings than the old New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) system, pushing vehicles into a higher tax bracket.
The new rules could take away tax incentives offered to cars with ultra-low emissions in certain countries, the Automotive News report said.
Automakers have to decide whether the extra cost to fit a bigger battery is worth the incentives given, according to the report.
The introduction of WLTP has forced some carmakers to withhold non-conforming models from showrooms, prompting them to discount other models to defend their market share.(https://reut.rs/2QYxxKH)

555,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Busy Day for Economic Data
Investors may be hoping to take a break from economic numbers after the Fed decision, but Friday’s calendar is surprisingly packed, including the central bank’s favorite inflation gauge.
The numbers on personal spending for August arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with economists expecting a 0.3% rise, just lower than the month before.
At the same time the August core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes food and energy, arrives. This is a key data point that the FOMC uses to get a sense of inflation.
Economists expect that the core PCE price index rose just 0.1% last month, with the year-over-year rise right at the Fed’s target of 2%.
Also before the bell, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin will give the opening remarks at a conference entitled Banking and the Economy: A Forum for Minorities in Banking.
At 9:45 AM ET, the Chicago PMI measure of Midwest manufacturing arrives, with the market expecting a small dip in September from August.
And at 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan releases its final measure of September consumer sentiment is released. Economists predict a small decline from the preliminary reading.
2. Tesla’s Musk Troubles; BlackBerry Earnings
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be active tomorrow, as the stock plunged about 10% in after-hours trading on reports that the SEC is suing CEO Elon Musk.
The Manhattan Federal Court docket said Musk is being charged with securities fraud, Bloomberg first reported. The charges could bar Musk from serving as an officer of the company.
There had been an SEC investigation into Musk tweeting out of the blue that he was thinking of taking the company private at $420 per share and had “funding secured.”
Meanwhile, it will be a blast from the past for some when BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) reports earnings before the bell tomorrow.
Many investors will still remember when BlackBerries were standard issue for everyone on Wall Street, but the company is no longer directly making smartphones. Instead, BlackBerry’s business has moved to software and services and it has built on its ability to design security technology necessary to the Internet of Things.
On average, analysts expect that BlackBerry earned 1 cent per share in its latest quarter on revenue of about $208 million.
The stock still hasn’t recovered from a plunge in June after its last earnings report. The numbers came in ahead of expectations, but there were worries about the sales still declining as the company was saying it was moving out of turnaround mode.
3. Will Oil Rally to End the Week?
Traders will be watching the energy markets tomorrow to see if oil can rally into the weekend after another avenue for more supply was shut.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry told a news conference at the Department of Energy late on Wednesday that the Trump Administration was not considering a release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to offset the impact of the sanctions on Iran that would come into force from Nov. 4.
“Perry is right. A release from the SPR will give the market a false sense of security and the demand side of the equation would be slow to adjust to less barrels,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago.
The move comes after OPEC and Russia indicated there would be no immediate increase in production at a meeting in Algiers.
Tomorrow the Baker Hughes U.S. oil rig count will arrive at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT)."
556,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 04:44PM ET</span>",Ford wants 'certainty' in any U.S. trade deals: chairman,"By Ben Klayman
DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - As the Trump administration negotiates new trade pacts with Canada, China and other countries,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) Executive Chairman Bill Ford said on Thursday the automaker wants deals that allow it to plan and invest with ""certainty.""
Bill Ford, celebrating the 100-year anniversary of a plant in Dearborn, Michigan, where the No. 2 U.S. automaker is based, said his executives have maintained close contact with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade negotiating team.
""We just want to work with the administration on trade issues, tariff issues,"" he told reporters at the company's Rouge complex, where Ford builds its highly profitable F-150 full-size pickup truck.
""Our business runs a lot better when we have certainty and we don't have gyrations,"" he added.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on Wednesday U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs would cost the automaker $1 billion in profits in 2018 and 2019.
The U.S. auto industry has warned against imposing more tariffs on Chinese products, saying that doing so would harm vehicle sales and cost jobs.
Trump in March announced tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum from most countries. The duties have allowed U.S. producers to raise their prices.
During the presidential campaign, Trump lambasted U.S. trade deficits as detrimental to American manufacturers and workers. Since taking office, he has pursued a policy of escalating tariffs he says will reverse that trend, including waging an increasingly bitter trade war with China.
The industry is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs. On May 23, Trump ordered a ""Section 232"" national security investigation into whether to impose a 25 percent tariff on vehicle and auto parts imported from the European Union and other trading partners.
In July, Ford revised its full-year earnings forecast downward due to slumping sales and trade tariffs on China as well as its struggling business in Europe.
Bill Ford declined to specify what the company wanted in any trade deals, calling the talks ""very fluid."" 
Ford had wanted the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico ""modernized,"" and that has happened, but there is still work to do, Bill Ford said.

The $1 billion cost to profits has not changed how Ford is restructuring and Hackett has done a good job leading the automaker, he said, adding the Dearborn Truck assembly plant would build the 2020 hybrid electric F-150.

The issue may cause additional short term disruption to customers in a small number of cases, a company spokesman said. 
""The guidance issued today is part of our ongoing management of the intermediate pressure turbine blade issue and applies only to the minority of engines which have not yet had replacement turbine blades fitted,"" he added.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) told Reuters on Thursday it was working through the replacement of intermediate pressure turbine blades on Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 Package C engines and had already replaced the blades on the majority of engines. 

In July, Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace president Chris Cholerton had said that problems with the Trent 1000 engine had left some Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes grounded but that would not prevent it from providing the engine for the new Boeing planes being mooted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other powerful business groups asked an appeals court on Thursday to not undo AT&T Inc's (N:T) purchase of movie and TV show maker Time Warner, despite the protests of the Justice Department.
The chamber, backed by the National Association of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable and others, argued that stopping the merger would ""undermine myriad transactions that generally benefit consumers.""
The business groups argued that companies had long assumed that if they bought a supplier or distributor -- generally called a vertical merger -- that the deal would be considered good for the consumer and would be allowed.
""The vague legal standard that the government ... advocate(s) would cloud the business community’s ability to ascertain whether vertical mergers are lawful, making it more difficult to invest in transactions with enormous potential to lower prices and enhance innovation—all of which benefit a diverse array of customers,"" the business groups said in a brief court filing.
The Justice Department lost a lawsuit in district court to prevent AT&T, which owns satellite company DirecTV, from buying Time Warner over concerns that AT&T would seek to raise prices when licensing Time Warner's news, sports and other programing to DirecTV's cable and satellite rivals. 
AT&T closed the Time Warner deal in June and has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
No date has been set for an oral argument.
The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, a frequent target of Trump’s ire.

A group of nine state attorneys general asked the court on Wednesday also to let the lower court stand.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Petróleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) will pay an $853.2 million fine to settle U.S. criminal charges that the Brazilian state-run oil company bribed politicians and then sought to conceal the payments, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.
Shares in Petrobras, as the company is known, were up 4.2 percent in early afternoon, helped by investors' perception that the pact is another step toward getting past the painful legacy of the landmark ""Car Wash"" investigation.
""Executives at the highest levels of Petrobras — including members of its executive board and board of directors —facilitated the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Brazilian politicians and political parties and then cooked the books to conceal the bribe payments from investors and regulators,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski said in a statement.
Petrobras said in a statement that it had acknowledged responsibility for ""violations of books and records and internal controls provisions."" Executives responsible for this have already left Petrobras, the company said, noting that the company did not admit wrongdoing on the bribery allegation. 
Under the agreement, which settles violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Petrobras will deposit $682.6 million, or 80 percent of the penalties, in a special fund in Brazil, with the remainder of the fine being split between the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Brazilian federal prosecutors will determine how Petrobras should allocate money in the fund into social and educational programs in an agreement yet to be settled. 
Petrobras said in a statement that the deal ""puts an end to the uncertainties, risks, burdens and costs of potential prosecution and protracted litigation in the United States.""
The oil company will take a third-quarter 3.6 billion real charge - the local currency equivalent of the penalty.
SHARES UP
Although Petrobras had not already provisioned for the U.S. settlement, XP Investimentos' analyst Gabriel Francisco said the penalties will not hurt the companies' results.
""The fines will not hinder Petrobras' plans of reaching a net debt of $69 billion by year end, as it has a comfortable cash position"" said the analyst. ""The deal means the end of a chapter.""
Still, although Petrobras has settled a dispute with the U.S. authorities, it still faces other demands for compensation related to the Car Wash probe.
Earlier this month, for instance, a Dutch court ruled that shareholders in Petrobras will have their complaints heard.

Argentine investors also initiated this month an arbitration proceeding against the firm for losses related to the corruption probe.

A cluster of popular tech stocks followed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares higher after JPMorgan said the tech giant was making progress weaning itself off the iPhone amid a transition from a hardware company to a services company.
""We expect increasing appreciation of acceleration in growth, along with greater visibility into earnings and cash flow with increasing mix of Services,"" JPMorgan said.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) also enjoyed gains, supporting the broader communications services sector.
There was no optimism on Wall Street for Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) as its stock crashed 21%, wiping out more than quarter of the company's market cap, after its second-quarter earnings report prompted investors to head for the exit.
Bed Bath said its sees current quarter sales to fall in the ""mid-single digit"" range and fourth quarter revenues to tumble in the ""high single digit range,"" citing changes both in its corporate calendar and ""tariffs on imports from China.""
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock was also found wanting, falling about 5% on weaker-than-expected guidance, which offset an above-forecast earnings report.
Carnival forecast fourth-quarter earnings in a range of 65 to 69 cents a share, below estimates of 74 cents.

VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess pledged to back a solution to help fund installing more effective exhaust filters during a conversation with German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer on Wednesday, Germany's Spiegel Online said.
The agreement comes as the German government is due to hold a diesel summit on Friday with Scheuer, who has ruled out a taxpayer contribution to possible retrofits.
Volkswagen has rejected a proposal that carmakers should buy back older diesel vehicles, the person further said.
VW agreed to fit older diesel vehicles with better catalytic converters, reversing its position and bowing to political pressure which mounted in the three years since an emissions cheating scandal, Spiegel Online said.
German cities have been sued by environmental groups for repeatedly flouting European clean air rules, a step that has led courts to propose banning of older diesel vehicles as a way to cut pollution from particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.

Carmakers are now scrambling to avert outright banks of diesel vehicles.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, helped by high-flying shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon, as well as the Federal Reserve's confidence in the strength of the economy as it raised rates for the third time this year.
The Fed also left its monetary policy outlook for the coming years largely unchanged, but investors switched into sell-off mode shortly before the market close on Wednesday as they digested the implications of the end of an era of ""accommodative"" monetary policy.
Adding to the feel-good sentiment was data showing U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter at its fastest pace in nearly four years as previously estimated.
""Fundamentally, earnings are rising, inflation appears non-problematic and interest rates are still relatively low and that presents a favorable backdrop for equities to trend higher,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
""FAANG's are strong today in part because they have pulled back recently which is presenting an attractive entry point.""
Apple rose 2.2 percent and was the biggest boost to the three main indexes after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) started coverage of the stock with an ""overweight"" rating, citing the iPhone maker's quicker-than-expected move to a services business.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 1.6 percent after brokerage Stifel talked up the company's retail, cloud, and advertising businesses. The online retailer is set to open a brick-and-mortar store in New York City.
The recently revamped communications services sector gained 1.09 percent, the most among the S&P sectors. It was lifted by gains in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
At 11:21 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 116.18 points, or 0.44 percent, at 26,501.46, the S&P 500 was up 16.05 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,922.02 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 66.92 points, or 0.84 percent, at 8,057.29.
The materials index , which fell 0.5 percent, was the only one among the 11 major S&P sectors to drop. The technology sector was the biggest boost to the S&P, with a 0.73 percent gain.
While Apple boosted tech, one of the drags was Accenture, which fell 1.2 percent as the consulting and outsourcing services company's full-year profit fell short of analysts' estimates.
Cruise operator Carnival (LON:CCL) Corp tumbled 5.5 percent after its fourth-quarter forecast missed estimates. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean slid 1.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.
Joining them was Conagra, which dropped 6.8 percent after posting quarterly revenue that missed analysts' estimates.
That weighed on other food companies, with Kellogg, JM Smucker and Campbell Soup shedding about 2 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.75-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The international UNI Global Union and other workers' groups said in a letter to the Dutch government's point of contact with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that IKEA Group had acted against OECD guidelines by not curbing anti-union conduct by managers in the three countries.
Netherlands-based IKEA Group, the owner of most IKEA stores worldwide, said in response that it complies strictly with regulations relating to union activities everywhere it operates. 
""We respect and welcome the free choice of our co-workers to seek representation through any kind of co-worker association,"" the company said in an email.  
The unions said in the letter that Dutch mediation could ""resolve these conflicts and create conditions for employees to exercise their right to freedom of association and collective bargaining in a climate free of fear and intimidation in all three countries mentioned"".
""The company's top management repeatedly ignored the red flags that workers and unions have raised about violations of rights in its stores around the world,"" UNI Global Union General Secretary Christy Hoffman said in a statement.

The integrated core processor (ICP) acts as the jet's brains, processing data for its communications, sensors and electronic warfare, among others, Lockheed said.
""We are aggressively pursuing cost reduction across the F-35 enterprise...,"" said Greg Ulmer, vice president of the F-35 program.
The ICP collects data from the aircraft's sensor suite to provide the pilot with 360-degree situational awareness of threats and then prioritize and recommend how to counter or negate the threat, Harris said.
Lockheed Martin's rotary and mission systems unit has supplied ICPs for all F-35 aircraft built to date and will continue through Lot 14.

The new deal comes nearly three months after Lockheed chose  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) to provide a sensor system for the jet.

Europe's largest low-cost carrier, which closed its last hub in France in 2011, has faced several months of strikes as a result of its decision in December to recognize unions.
Pilots and cabin crew in Germany are the latest to step up pressure over pay and conditions. German unions representing both said their members would strike on Friday, joining crews in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, and bringing the number of flights canceled to almost 250.
Ryanair said when it made its announcement on union recognition in December that the decision would help it expand in countries where unions had a strong influence, like France.
On Thursday, the airline said it would base two planes in Bordeaux and two more in Marseille, using the airports as a hub to add 27 new routes to its summer 2019 schedule. The move would create 60 new Ryanair jobs in each location, it said.
Basing planes at an airport allows an airline to fly a larger number of flights per day from that location. Ryanair, which now has 86 bases, aims to fly 200 million passengers per year by 2024, up from a forecast 139 million this year.
Ryanair said in January it planned to double capacity in France in the next four years to about 20 million passengers, although it said continued strikes might force it to consider cutting short-term growth plans in other markets.
Ryanair had already canceled 150 flights scheduled for Friday due to the cabin crew action when it announced on Thursday that ""under 100"" flights would now also not operate in and out of Germany after the Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) called on pilots to join the 24-hour strike.
""No improved offer has been made since the last industrial action on Sept. 12. In addition, no conciliation agreement has been reached between Ryanair and VC so far,"" VC said.
Ryanair Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew told VC in a letter dated Sept. 26 and released on Thursday that the airline was ready to enter arbitration with the union.
Ryanair said VC had rejected three German candidates it had suggested for arbitrator and that negotiations should take four to five weeks, not the five months proposed by the union.
Germany's services union Verdi, which represents around 1,000 cabin crew at Ryanair and had encouraged them to hold rallies on Friday, said its members would also join the walkout. 
Ryanair has traditionally employed a large proportion of its staff under Irish law, which unions say inconveniences staff and impedes them from accessing local social security benefits.

The European Union executive backed Ryanair workers on Wednesday by saying they should work under contracts in the countries where they live rather than in Ireland where the airline's planes are registered.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 10:26AM ET</span>","Accenture profit forecast falls short of estimates, shares slip","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Accenture Plc's (N:ACN) profit forecast for the year fell short of estimates, overshadowing better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and profit and sending its shares down about 2 percent.
The consulting and outsourcing services provider said the forecast assumes impact from a stronger dollar, and that the possibility of a ""hard"" Brexit and the ongoing trade war could impact its business.
The company said it expects full-year profit between $6.98 per share and $7.25 per share, below the average estimate of $7.28 per share. It also said it expects full-year revenue growth between 5 percent and 8 percent in local currency.
""Accenture reported solid numbers, driven by growth across all its segments. They provided FY19 guidance of 5-8 percent local currency revenue growth; and commented that the macro is incrementally more volatile, primarily due to disputes around global trade and the potential for a hard Brexit,"" Arvind Ramnani, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets said.
Like its peers, Accenture has been focusing on cloud computing, cyber-security and analytics to reduce its reliance on IT services, where margins are falling as clients demand more work for less money.
Accenture has spent about $3.4 billion over the last three years — nearly half of it in fiscal 2017 — on some 70 acquisitions, to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant (O:CTSH) and  IBM  (N:IBM).
Much of the company's recent growth has been driven by these services, which include everything from managing clients' social media marketing strategies to helping them move operations to the cloud.
Revenue from its digital, cloud and security-related services, which the company terms as ""the New"", made up more than 60 percent of total revenue.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.03 billion, or $1.58 per share, from $932.5 million, or $1.48 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, a year earlier.
Accenture's profit beat the average analyst estimate of $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose to $10.15 billion, ahead of estimates of $10.01 billion.
The company also raised its semi-annual cash dividend by 10 percent to $1.46 and said its board had approved an additional share repurchase program of $5 billion.

Accenture's shares were down 2 pct at $169.29 in early trading.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers at motorbike companies including Yamaha Corp (T:7951) and  Eicher Motors  (NS:EICH) are on strike in the southern Indian city of Chennai, demanding better wages and a right to form unions to defend their interests.
Employees said the companies had employed a large number of contract workers to get around rigid Indian labor laws that make it difficult to hire and fire full-time staff and have refused to bring them on company payrolls even after years of contract work.
The unrest is the latest to hit the state of Tamil Nadu, dubbed the Detroit of South Asia because big automakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Hyundai (KS:011760), Ford (N:F), Nissan (T:7201) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have factories in the state.
""Our main demands concern low wages, contract employees not being made permanent and workers being denied basic respect,"" said S Kannan, Kanchipuram district president at the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, one of the leaders involved in organizing the strike at Yamaha.
Kannan said that talks to resolve the strike had made no progress.
A spokesman at Yamaha, which sells in India as well as overseas, said that production is running below capacity.
Yamaha has a 4 percent share of India's two-wheeler market. It sold about 793,000 motorcycles in the past financial year and exported about 252,000.
Wages are low in India, making it an attractive manufacturing and export hub for companies, but workers feeling the effects of rising inflation have been agitating in recent years for higher pay.
""The issue is not widespread. It is in pockets, but it is a cause of concern, especially since it is an industrial belt,"" said an executive at a global automaker.
In May protests turned violent at metals conglomerate Vedanta's copper smelter about 400 miles from Chennai over alleged environmental violations that the company said underlined the risks global businesses face in India.
The government has tried to overhaul labor laws, hoping to create millions of new jobs and boost economic growth by making it easier to hire and fire, but has faced resistance.
Workers at Eicher Motors, which owns the Royal Enfield motorcycle company, are protesting one such scheme, the National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), said R Sampath, vice-president of the Royal Enfield Employees Union.
""The scheme stops contract workers from becoming permanent employees, allows management to keep wages low and fire people with one-month's notice,"" said Sampath, adding that contract workers do not receive other employee benefits.
Royal Enfield, which has about a 4 percent share of the two-wheeler market and sold more than 800,000 motorcycles in India over the past financial year, is ""hopeful of arriving at a mutually beneficial solution"", it said in a statement. 
""We have forums that address matters related to the wellbeing of workmen and are working to understand the issue that compelled a few workmen to refrain from reporting for work today,"" the company said.
Eicher Motors competes with U.S. motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) in India.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Several large Chinese companies, including tech giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA), are actively looking at opportunities in Turkey and have met with Turkish firms after the lira's sell-off has made local assets cheaper, sources familiar with the talks said.
The talks in Istanbul started in mid-August, when Turkey was at the height of its currency crisis, four sources said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
In addition to Alibaba, which earlier this year purchased Turkish online retailer Trendyol, other companies holding talks included China Life Insurance (SS:601628) and conglomerate China Merchants Group, three of the sources said.
""We met four Chinese groups in just a week. They held more than 20 meetings,"" one of the sources said, adding that the meetings had been arranged by top U.S. investment banks.
""They are looking into nearly everything.""
Alibaba declined to comment on future investment plans. China Life Insurance did not respond to a request for comment while China Merchants could not immediately be reached for comment.
Chinese firms have shown interest in Turkey's infrastructure, mining, energy, retail and insurance industries, three of the sources said.
The heightened Chinese interest comes as the world's second-largest economy braces for an escalating trade war with the United States.
LIRA SELL-OFF
Turkey's lira has fallen some 40 percent so far this year, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's control over monetary policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. The sell-off has deepened concerns about the outlook for the Turkish economy while depressing local asset prices.
Turkish energy firms have been particularly hit hard, given that much of their debt and their import costs are denominated in foreign currency, while their revenues are in lira.
""Various China-based energy companies are interested in energy production plants that are having trouble servicing their financial debt,"" one of the sources said.
Despite the crisis, Turkey retains enviable demographics, making it particularly attractive for consumer-focused industries over the long term. It is home to some 80 million people and with one of the youngest populations in Europe. 

Chinese companies first showed interest in Turkey as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative - a vehicle for Beijing to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries.

Under the scenario being explored, Thyssenkrupp would give existing investors shares of a company that combines elevators, industrial solutions and the components-technology business via an in-kind dividend, the people added, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Thyssenkrupp would keep a minority stake in the so-called capital goods company, its raw materials trading unit and a 50 percent stake in the steel joint venture with Tata Steel Europe, the people said. They cautioned that no decision has been made yet and that plans could change.
The shares added as much as 9.1 percent to 21.89 euros in German trading.
Cevian Capital, the second-largest shareholder, supports the plan for a split, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Other Options
Other options under consideration by Thyssenkrupp, although less likely at the moment, include merging the profitable elevator unit with Finland’s Kone Oyj or an initial public offering of the elevator unit, people familiar said.
Representatives for Thyssenkrupp and Kone didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.
Thyssenkrupp is looking at a major restructuring at a time when the company is in turmoil. It still lacks a permanent chairman and chief executive officer, and activist investors have called for dramatic changes that would reduce costs and boost profits in businesses that have long underperformed.
Shareholders including Cevian Capital have previously blamed an overly complicated business structure for Thyssenkrupp’s weak performance, and said the company needs to find “the right structure” to be competitive.
The company’s labor representatives make up a majority on the board and will have a significant influence over any decision. Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board is scheduled to meet in the coming days, the people said.
Reuters reported earlier Thursday that the company is considering an overhaul.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Mediobanca set for changes as Bollore pulls out of pact,"By Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) - French financier Vincent Bollore has decided to pull out of a  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) shareholder pact after two decades in a surprise move that could make Italy's most influential investment bank more of a takeover target.
Bollore, Mediobanca's second biggest shareholder, opted to withdraw due to his increasing financial commitment to French media giant  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) and a need to keep assets more flexible, Mediobanca said in a statement on Thursday.
The move, which follows a similar decision by smaller Italian investor Italmobiliare (MI:ITMI), means the shareholder pact will automatically dissolve on Jan. 1, leaving investors free to sell their stakes.
However, Mediobanca said Bollore, who holds 7.9 percent of the merchant bank, had made it clear in a letter he intended to hang on to the stake.
A source close to the matter said Bollore would remain an investor, at least for now, adding he would book a small capital gain in case of a full exit. Based on Wednesday's closing price, the stake was worth around 645 million euros ($755 million).
A second source familiar with the matter said core investors at the bank were now considering creating a lighter shareholder pact without Bollore that could rope in just under 20 percent of capital.
The pact would remain in force until 2020 when the current board comes up for reappointment, the source said.
The pact, which 15 years ago accounted for around 60 percent of capital, currently locks in 28.47 percent.
Bollore's decision to leave the pact would not affect his other investments in Italy and both he and Vivendi remained long-term shareholders in  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) and  Mediaset  (MI:MS), the first source said.
Vivendi, which has been looking to build a southern European media giant, is the largest shareholder in TIM but lost control of the Italian phone group in May to activist fund Elliott.
TIM's share are down 51 percent since Vivendi first invested in the Italian phone group back in mid-2015, leading the French investor to write down its stake earlier this year.
It also has just under 30 percent of Mediaset but has got bogged down in a legal spat with the TV broadcaster controlled by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
""Given the poor performance of his Italian investments and uncertainty created by the new populist government, it could be a first step to reassessing Italy,"" said IG analyst Vincenzo Longhi.
CHANGING ROLE
Mediobanca, the leading shareholder in Italy's top insurer Generali (MI:GASI), was for years at the heart of Italian finance with key stakes in a number of leading companies.
But in recent years it has sold most of those stakes to focus on traditional banking and plans to sell down its stake in Generali to help fund its wealth management business.
Last year Generali fended off a takeover bid from Italy's biggest retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).
""Bollore's move certainly increases the M&A appeal of Mediobanca as the pact's grip loosens and prospects improve,"" a Milan-based analyst said.
Under the stewardship of CEO Alberto Nagel Mediobanca has become leaner and more profitable and reported record revenues in its last financial year.
Other key shareholders in Mediobanca include Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI), asset manager Mediolanum (MI:MED) and the Benetton family's holding company Edizione.
UniCredit, the biggest shareholder with 8.4 percent, has not announced any decision on its commitment to the pact.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's share markets and the euro both took a tumble on Thursday as reports that Italy's long-awaited budget was facing a delay compounded an already groggy global mood after the third U.S. interest rate rise of the year.
Italy's main Milan bourse slumped as much as 2 percent with the country's big banks down even more as the country's borrowing costs also hit a three-week high in the government bond markets. (EU) 
Investors have been anxious about Italy's budget which some fear could lead to a blowout of the country's deficit, and put the coalition government on a collision course with the European Union.
Rome confirmed that a cabinet meeting over budget targets was still planned for later, dismissing an earlier report in the Corriere della Sera newspaper that it could be delayed.
But it couldn't soothe the markets, especially after the economy ministry was forced to deny its chief Giovanni Tria, an academic who doesn't belong to any one party, had threatened to resign.
""It is very fluid and it is changing by the minute it seems,"" head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Tim Graf said.
""Even if things get resolved positively today, Italy is not a situation that is going to go away,"" he added, pointing to the growing popularity of the country's fractious anti-establishment coalition government.
The strains weighed on the rest of Europe too, with the STOXX 600 still in the red despite an attempted rebound and the euro down 0.25 percent in the currency markets having skidded all the way down to $1.17. 
That fall also gave the dollar a boost after it had only managed a lazy gain after the Federal Reserve hiked U.S. interest rates on Wednesday by another 25 basis points to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent.
The dollar index which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was last up 0.4 percent to 94.529.
The index had scaled a 13-month high in mid-August, drawing safe-haven demand as trade tensions buffeted riskier emerging market currencies. The index has since fallen about 2.8 percent though as investors have become more nuanced in their views.
Fed ratesetters still see another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020.
Wall Street futures pointed to a broadly steady start having largely expected the move with traders also getting the taste for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) again after JP Morgan started coverage of the iPhone giant with an ""overweight"" buy rating. (N) 
OIL PRESSURE
The Australian dollar seen as a barometer of global investor risk appetite and Chinese demand, fell 0.4 percent to $0.7226, its lowest since Sept. 19 and not far off its 2-1/2 year lows of $0.7085 hit earlier this month.
Overnight, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended lower. There were, however, pockets of resilience such as South Korea's Kospi, which hit three-month highs, as it resumed trade after a three-day public holiday.
Japan's Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high too as signs that the United States may not impose further tariffs on Japanese automotive products for now lifted carmakers, though the index eventually ended down 1 percent. (T)
With the Fed's steady message still fresh in the mind 10-year U.S. Treasuries yields fell to 3.05 percent, from Tuesday's four-month high of 3.113 percent when traders had been expecting a more hawkish signal for the U.S. central bank.
FOMC members did drop a description of its policy stance as ""accommodative"", but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell then downplayed the significance of the change at a news conference saying rates were still generally accommodative.
Falling Treasury yields were good news for emerging markets. Plenty of EM currencies were firmer despite the dollar's broader gains against the likes of the euro.
Turkey's lira was back up to 6 per dollar for the first time in almost two week despite data showing that confidence among businesses had seen its biggest month on month slump in a almost decade. 
EM currencies have been pressured for months by concerns that higher U.S. yields would encourage investors to move funds out of those economies back into the U.S. That's on top of worries over the U.S.-China trade feud.
Indeed, the Philippino finance minister warned the world will be in ""deep kimchi"" if the current trade war drags on. The country's central bank raised its rates for a fourth straight meeting on Thursday in an effort to stem the slide in its currency.
Rising oil prices are another major pressure point for energy importers and they gained again ahead of U.S. sanctions coming into force on Iranian exports due in November. 
Global benchmark Brent was 0.7 percent at $81.88 per barrel, near the four-year high of $82.55 set on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1 percent to $72.34 a barrel.

""The real big impact is the fuel price...that is what is really worrying me,"" Philippines finance minister Carlos Dominguez told Reuters.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>","Tencent Music, bound for U.S. IPO, profits from social savvy","By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Music, which owns China's most popular music streaming apps, is often compared to Sweden's  Spotify Technology  (N:SPOT) but it offers more in the way of socially interactive services that is helping it hit bigger notes in money making.
The company, majority owned by Chinese tech powerhouse Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) and slated for a U.S. IPO next month, made almost $400 million in earnings before interest and taxes in 2017, according to an investor document circulated in August that was seen by Reuters.
Those profits are expected to nearly double to $764 million this year while revenue is seen climbing 72 percent to $3.1 billion, the document said.
By comparison, Spotify, with which it has a cross shareholding deal, lost 90 million euros ($105 million) in the second quarter of this year on revenue of 1.3 billion euros. 
Tencent declined to comment on the earnings numbers for Tencent Music or the IPO plans. Reuters could not independently verify the figures.
In a market that until a few years ago was dominated by pirated music, Tencent Music's strong financials are due to a business model that does not rely primarily on the monthly subscription payments that sustain Spotify and other Western music streaming companies.
Instead, analysts say much of its revenue comes from services such as karaoke live broadcasting where admirers tip performers.
""China music apps are more advanced in their integration of music streaming with live broadcasting, karaoke as well as social community,"" said Elinor Leung, managing director of Asia telecom and internet research at CLSA. 
""Social interaction is the main difference between Chinese music apps and Western music apps."" 
Tencent Music also benefits from differences in music copyright payment in China and the West, according to BOCOM International analyst Connie Gu. 
""Some popular musicians in Europe or the U.S. may require royalty payment per play count, while the current practice in China is for companies to sign three-year contracts regardless of play count, so the economy of scale helps the platform's profit,"" she said.
Tencent Music is seeking to raise $2 billion in its IPO, three people close to the deal told Reuters last week, in what will be one of the biggest U.S. listings by a Chinese company this year. 
It made a confidential filing with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this month, the sources said and likely valuations for Tencent Music were not immediately clear. Spotify, which went public in April, is now worth more than $30 billion.
Tencent Holdings and Spotify announced a share swap in December that gave the Chinese company a 7.5 percent stake in Spotify including shares held by Tencent Music. Spotify held 9 percent of Tencent Music, according to the Swedish firm's IPO prospectus.
BIG TIPS, BIG BUCKS 
For Tencent Music, there's much money to be made from people like Zhou Nan who performs on WeSing - a karaoke app that has some 50 million daily active users.
Zhou, 22, a music student in the city of Nanjing, conducts live performances on WeSing several times a month, with her band Flanger's account boasting nearly 270,000 followers.
Tipping from fans gives her 30,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan ($4,400-$7,300) a month, she said, and that's even after Tencent Music takes 70 percent according to their revenue-sharing contract. 
""The biggest tip I received from a single performance once was 20,000 yuan,"" Zhou said, adding that while she had a wide fan base, most tips came from those aged 40 or above.
Ordinary users of WeSing can also receive virtual gifts, with the purchase money all going to Tencent Music. 
Tencent Music is also seeking revenue offline by selling goods such as microphones and headphones, and opening mini karaoke boxes that can be put in shopping malls. WeSing outlined plans to open 300 such karaoke boxes across China this year, local media reports have said. 
All told, Tencent Music has more than 600 million active monthly users and about 80 percent of the online music market, according to the investor document. That includes its QQ Music streaming platform as well as the apps Kuwo and Kugou which it acquired in 2016.
Customers can buy songs or albums on Tencent's apps, or sign up for monthly subscriptions that cost between 8 yuan to 18 yuan, compared with $9.99 at Spotify. 
Those low fees and a relatively small proportion of monthly subscribers for those services could ultimately be a weakness, said Gu. 
""Compared with video, payment for music is going to grow at a slower pace,"" she said, adding that Tencent will need to work hard to convert more users into paying customers.
Tencent Music declined to comment on its ratio of paying customers.

It owns the most music copyright in China with some 17 million songs, though it shares or sublicenses content with rival apps owned by NetEase Inc (O:NTES) and  Alibaba  (N:BABA), so those users have access to similarly large libraries.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Shares in H&M (ST:HMb) rose more than 10 percent on Thursday after the fashion retailer reassured investors that it would not need to cut costs further to shift unsold clothing despite a bigger than expected fall in quarterly profit.
The Swedish company felt the effects of teething problems with a new logistics system designed to help improve its supply chain that cost it an additional 400 million Swedish crowns ($45 million).
However, the market reacted positively after H&M said it did not expect increased discounting in the current quarter thanks to the ""quality and balance"" of its inventories.
Its shares traded 10.6 percent higher by 0955 GMT, having lost nearly two thirds of their value from record highs in 2015. Many in the market have bet on the shares falling, meaning any positive news tends to prompt a strong reaction. 
In September, the first month of H&M's fourth quarter, the underlying sales trend was positive, CEO Karl-Johan Persson said on a call with analysts.
Persson said the logistics problems would affect costs and sales in the fourth quarter but to a lesser extent. [nFWN1WD03P]
H&M has seen profits shrink and inventories pile up over the past couple of years as its core budget chain has lost sales to low-price high-street rivals like Primark and online competitors such as ASOS (L:ASOS) and Zalando (DE:ZALG).
H&M has invested heavily in logistics and digitalization and is reviewing its mix of stores and brands and is also working on a new H&M store concept.
However, June-August pretax profit for the second-biggest clothing retailer after Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) shrank 20 percent from a year ago to 4.01 billion crowns ($454 million) against a Reuters poll forecast for a 16 percent drop.
British online rival  Boohoo  (L:BOOH) this week reported forecast-beating profit growth for the first half of the year and raised its sales guidance. Britain's  Next  (L:NXT) raised its profit guidance after better-than-expected trading in late summer.
GLITCHES
H&M is rolling out a new logistics system to make its supply chain faster and more efficient and better integrate its more than 4,700 stores with its website.
Problems with the new system in the United States, France, Italy and Belgium led to extra costs and a sales drop of 8 percent in those markets.
However, overall sales for its other 66 markets increased by 8 percent in local currencies during the quarter. 
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said that meant comparable sales in those markets may well have been up for the first time in three years. 
Markdowns increased by 0.7 percentage points, and inventories 15 percent to 38.7 billion crowns or 19 percent of sales in the period, the third quarter of its financial year.
H&M said its online sales soared 32 percent in the third quarter.
RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain saw the earnings as a mixed bag.

""We still see the risk to consensus estimates as on the downside, however H&M is working its way through some of its issues and has given more reassuring guidance on markdowns for Q4, expected at this stage to be flat yoy (year-on-year),"" said Chamberlain, who has a ""Neutral"" rating on the stock.

Latecomers to the digital space, Swiss luxury watch brands have now realized that e-commerce and social networks are formidable tools to get a tighter grip on distribution and customer relationships, while cutting out wholesalers also helps to keep a lid on the grey market.
Audemars Piguet, an independent brand with about $1 billion in sales, is changing its business model to place its customers at the heart of its commercial strategy and ""establish direct and personal relationships with watch lovers around the world"", it said in a statement published late on Wednesday.
Its chief executive told Reuters this month that the brand wanted to take all its sales in-house within three to five years.
Richard Mille, known for its ultra-expensive, sporty timepieces relying on Audemars Piguet technology, said it preferred dedicated mono-brand boutiques to multibrand retailers. 
""Consequently, the brand's presence at exhibitions no longer corresponds to its strategy for exclusive and selective distribution,"" the company said in a statement.
Both brands will be present for the last time at the next Geneva fair in January, they said.
The announcements deal another blow to third-party retailers and the two big industry shows designed for them - the SIHH (Salon International de Haute Horlogerie) in Geneva, which takes place in January, and Baselworld, held in Basel in March.
The number of exhibitors at the Basel fair halved this year and it recently lost one of its most important pillars when Swatch Group (S:UHR) dropped out.
The SIHH had been seen as benefiting from Baselworld's troubles, with brands such as Hermes (PA:HRMS) moving from Basel to Geneva, but the latest news shows it is not immune to the increasing focus on digital channels.

Watch retailers are trying to adjust to the changing environment, with bigger players such as Bucherer or The Watches of Switzerland expanding internationally and pushing online and pre-owned activities, while smaller rivals try to find a niche to survive.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 05:29AM ET</span>",Minister to Air France-KLM boss: Fix airline before talk of stake sale,"By Richard Lough and Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - France has no plans for now to sell its 14 percent stake in Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, pressing the group's new chief executive to focus on increasing competitiveness.
Le Maire was reacting to a warning from the group's new Canadian boss, Benjamin Smith, to Air France's labour unions that the government was prepared to offload its shares and they should not rely on the state to bail them out.
Smith, who took over the group last week, faces the unenviable task of having to overcome union resistance to reduce the French unit's swollen cost base while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch staff on side. 
A wave of strikes at Air France this spring cost the group some 350 million euros ($410 million) and led to the ouster of Smith's predecessor.
""Today the priority is to turn around Air France,"" Le Maire told franceinfo. ""Selling off the state's stake in Air France is not part of Benjamin Smith's action plan. It is not an option on the table today.""
Shares in Air France KLM rose 1.6 percent, although the stock remains down by nearly 40 percent so far in 2018.
In an interview published on Thursday, Smith told the Financial Times that the French government should not and would not bail out Air France to shield it from competition, even if there were some in the company that believed the state's holding offered them protection.
Le Maire himself warned Air France staff in May that the government would not come to the airline's rescue.
The French state is the largest shareholder in Air France-KLM. What President Emmanuel Macron does with the stake will be a test of the former investment banker's resolve to lighten the state's touch on the economy.
Le Maire said it made no sense for the state to sell down its stake in Air France while the airline is attempting to make tough reforms and at a time its share price is suffering.
""The state would be a poor manager (of its holdings) if it started selling its shares in a company that is not in good shape,"" he said. 
Air France-KLM's shares have been hit this year, mainly due to the strikes waged by French unions seeking improved pay and working conditions.
Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold an 8.8 percent stake in the group.

614,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",The World’s Leading Electric-Car Visionary Isn’t Elon Musk,"(Bloomberg) -- At this year’s Beijing Auto Show, a retired Chinese bureaucrat bent down to run his hands over the hood of a sleek sports coupe billed as the world’s fastest battery-powered car, and he smiled like a proud father.
In a way, that’s exactly what he was. Two decades earlier, Wan Gang persuaded China’s State Council to throw its vast power behind the risky, unproven technology of electric cars. He advocated using government money, including subsidies, to help create a world champion industry that would surpass Western automakers. That coupe he was admiring at the April auto show? It was built by homegrown NIO Inc.
Elon Musk made a name for himself promoting new-energy vehicles, but when the history of the electric car is finally written, Wan may loom larger. Chinese drivers buy one of every two EVs sold, and the global auto industry is pivoting to adjust. It’s a revolution fomented by Wan, a former minister of science and technology whose achievements are even more extraordinary when you consider that he never joined the Chinese Communist Party.
 “He’s the father of China’s electric-vehicle industry,” said Levi Tillemann, a former U.S. Department of Energy adviser and author of “The Great Race: The Global Quest for the Car of the Future.” “Without Wan Gang, it’s unlikely China would have pushed to surpass the West. That was his big idea.”
Wan, 66, who stepped down in March and now holds an academic post at a Beijing-based think tank, currently isn’t giving interviews, his office said.
After decades of hype and false starts, electric vehicles are on course to represent a significant segment of the auto industry. This year, China’s production of NEVs is expected to reach 1 million vehicles, a 26 percent increase from last year. The U.K., France and India are proposing bans on vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Long before becoming the nation’s top futurist, Wan suffered through the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, China’s great leap backward for science and technology. Sent from Shanghai to a remote village near North Korea at age 16 to learn values from peasants, he spent his days repairing the town’s smoke-belching tractor and building its electricity grid from scratch, according to the state-run People’s Daily and author Lisa Margonelli, who interviewed Wan.
One of the lucky few of his generation to attend college, Wan was admitted to a Ph.D. program in mechanical engineering at Clausthal University of Technology in Germany. When he graduated in 1991, job offers came from all the big German carmakers, but he picked Audi because it was the smallest and provided the best chances for promotion.
As an executive in Audi’s planning department, Wan played the role of ambassador, showing its state-of-the-art factory in Ingolstadt to Chinese delegates trying to resurrect their decrepit auto industry. One guest was then-science minister Zhu Lilan, who took a liking to the engineer.
 
Months after their first meeting, in 2000, Wan was back home selling Zhu and the rest of the State Council on the idea of leapfrogging. China was choking in smog, and its automakers, Wan reasoned, could never hope to catch up with Japanese, American or German manufacturers when it came to traditional vehicles.
A bet on new technologies could put China on more-equal footing or even allow it to take the lead, he theorized. It also could help the country break its dependence on foreign oil.
“Wan Gang was saying, ‘I want to create a system where we can be energy secure and there’s a more level playing field for our companies,”’ said Bill Russo, a former Chrysler executive who now heads auto consultant Gao Feng Advisory in Beijing. “He knew you couldn’t win playing the old game.”
And so did some high-powered colleagues. Former Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who started in 1952 at the automaker now known as China FAW Group Corp., developed the plan to create the NEV research program. And Ma Kai spearheaded NEV stimulus policies while running the National Development and Reform Commission that helps oversee the economy.
By 2007, Wan was minister of science and technology, overseeing billions of yuan with sway to help funnel research-and-development money toward favored industries. In that job, he repeatedly challenged China’s engineers: build a fleet of electric buses for the 2008 Beijing Olympics; put 1,000 battery-powered vehicles on the streets of every major city. The spring of 2010 brought subsidies of as much as $10,000 for every EV the carmakers could sell.
“There will be a strategic window for developing electric vehicles over the next 10 to 20 years,” Wan told state media that March. “We have to take action now.” China’s R&D rush was on.
A few months later, the mood was tense at Argonne National Laboratory, the U.S. federal research center near Chicago, where scientists invented the lithium-ion battery technology used in GM’s plug-in hybrid, the Volt.
Wan was visiting the lab to learn about chemical recipes for batteries. U.S. counterintelligence briefed scientist Jeff Chamberlain and his team about the dangers of letting secrets slip. The Americans were wary, until they got to know Wan.
“It all dissolved the moment you talked to him,” Chamberlain said. “We were just scientists comparing notes. I never felt once, not evenly remotely, that he was fishing. That doesn’t mean he wasn’t doing it, but we never felt it.”
The world’s automakers invited Wan inside, too. They had no choice.
“He was our most important customer in China,” said Makoto Yoshida, a government affairs officer at Nissan Motor Co., who last summer gave Wan a tour of a facility near Yokohama, where the minister drove hybrid cars. “If China says ‘we can’t accept your technology,’ it’s a big problem for us, which is why Wan Gang was the key person.”
Today, there are more than 100 Chinese-made electric-car models on the market, built by giants like Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. and startups such as NIO, which raised about $1 billion in an initial public offering in September.
Wang Chuanfu, the billionaire founder of BYD, China’s biggest maker of NEVs, recalled meeting Wan in 2014. “I was impressed by Wan’s obsession with clean-energy technology,” he said.
NEVs account for about 1 of every 20 passenger cars purchased in China, numbers likely to rise because of state incentives -- Wan’s real legacy.
The government is building a vast network of charging stations and strong-arming consumers into buying EVs by making them the only sure way to get a license plate in big cities. (Otherwise, drivers have to enter lotteries.) Starting next year, every automaker wanting to operate in China has to meet production targets for battery-powered vehicles or buy credits from rivals.
For Chamberlain, these are beneficial changes. Since 2016, the American scientist has run Volta Energy Technologies, a battery startup in Naperville, Illinois. He said the revolution wrought by Wan means it no longer matters if the U.S. rolls back emissions or fuel-efficiency standards, as President Donald Trump talks about.
“Whether it’s Ford or General Motors (NYSE:GM) or VW, or Hyundai or Toyota, if they want to participate in the Chinese market they must have electric vehicles,” Chamberlain said. “I’m happy for Wan Gang because that was his vision from many years ago.”

615,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 04:54AM ET</span>","Italian stocks, banks bruised by report Italy budget meeting may be delayed","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday on anxiety over Italy's budget, with bank stocks the worst performers, also weighed on by a fall in U.S. bond yields after the Federal Reserve hiked rates again.
The leading euro zone stock index (STOXX50E) slid 0.4 percent with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 0.3 percent, as investors digested a rate hike from the Fed and Italian media reports that today's budget meeting may be delayed.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) underperformed, down 1.3 percent with banks Unicredit (MI:CRDI), Banco BPM (MI:BAMI),  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) the worst fallers, down 3.2 to 4.3 percent as government bonds sold off.
The Italian banks index (FTIT8300) fell 3 percent, while euro zone banks (SX7E), which have been highly sensitive to Italian budget news, fell 1.4 percent.
Investors have been concerned that Italy's budget plans could lead to a blowout of the country's deficit and put the coalition government on a collision course with the European Union. 
""Besides the budgetary situation, we believe political uncertainty will remain elevated in Italy,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts.
""Given the amount of dissent between the two parties and the discontent within Five Star itself, it seems quite possible that the coalition could collapse at the time of the budget vote or just afterwards, as the disagreements could intensify once the details of the budget bill are known.""
Euro zone banks' earnings forecasts have been revised down consistently over the past months as political risks mounted. 
A rate rise from the Fed also weighed on European stocks which followed Wall Street lower. 
In positive moves, H&M (ST:HMb) jumped 10.4 percent after the Swedish fashion retailer reassured investors it would not need to cut costs further to shift unsold clothing.
Stronger than expected margin figures helped investors shrug off a one-off hit from logistics problems.
The large amount of H&M shares being shorted by investors also makes any positive news a significant boost for the stock as short sellers are ""squeezed"" to unravel their position.
Weak results and broker notes caused some sharp moves lower.
Chipmaker AMS (S:AMS) fell 6.3 percent after UBS analysts cut their price target on the stock. 
""Given the lack of visibility on how broadly 3D sensing will be adopted in 2019 in the Android universe, AMS's competitive positioning and the gross margin pressures that the company has faced lead us to stick with a neutral rating,"" they wrote. 
Ambu (CO:AMBUB) shares fell 12.6 percent with traders citing a negative note from Nordea.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares fell 3.9 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut the stock to ""reduce"" from ""hold"". 
Drugmaker Indivior (L:INDV) fell another 9.7 percent, adding to losses after a 16.5 percent dive on Wednesday after it slashed its revenue forecasts for its opioid addiction drug Sublocade.
IG Group (L:IGG) also sank 10 percent after the online financial trading firm said its CEO Peter Hetherington would step down immediately, the latest blow for the stock which fell sharply after weak results last week.

618,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Wall Street's Riskiest Loans Flash Dangers as Watchdogs Muzzled,"(Bloomberg) -- Washington rewrote the rulebook for Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis, but dangerous lending is still eluding regulators.
Take Bomgar Corp., which just lined up $439 million in loans. The deal marked the software company’s third trip to the debt markets this year. By one estimate, Bomgar’s leverage could soon spike to 15 times its earnings, raising questions about whether the firm could ever pay it off.
These kinds of transactions are increasingly common in the U.S.’s more than $2 trillion market for leveraged loans and junk bonds, and agencies including the Federal Reserve can’t do much about it. That’s because some of the most aggressive financing is being done outside the traditional banking sector.
“Regulators should sound the alarm,” former Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in an interview. “They should make it clear to the public and the Congress there are things they are concerned about and they don’t have the tools to fix it.’’
If regulators can’t maintain safe standards, it’s not just Wall Street’s over-levered corporate clients that might be at risk. Thousands of jobs could be at stake should companies start defaulting on their loans.
Right now, watchdogs don’t see any perils from leveraged loans that could threaten the financial system the way the collapse of the housing market did a decade ago. The market is much smaller and any excessive borrowing is concentrated among companies, not millions of U.S. households. Banks also are much better capitalized then they were before the crisis.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the “overall vulnerabilities” are “moderate.” Speaking at a press conference after , he also noted that the banks directly overseen by the Fed “take much less risk than they used to” in leveraged lending.
But in addition to heavily-regulated banks, Bomgar’s lenders include Jefferies Financial Group Inc. and Golub Capital BDC Inc. -- firms outside the Fed’s reach. While Moody’s Investors Service has predicted an outsized debt load, Bomgar said its leverage will be manageable at about seven times earnings. But even that level exceeds what regulators have typically considered prudent.
If Bomgar does run into trouble, Jefferies and Golub may not take a hit. That’s because leveraged loans are usually either bought by mutual funds and other fund managers or packaged into securities that are sold to investors.
Bomgar, Jefferies and Golub didn’t respond to requests for comment.
An effort by federal agencies to strengthen loan standards triggered some of the market’s shift from banks to less-regulated lenders, including Jefferies, KKR & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc.
Back in 2013, the Fed, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued guidance that schooled banks on what was acceptable leverage, restricting firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). from participating in the riskiest deals. When Powell was a Fed governor in 2015, he said the guidelines would prevent “a return to pre-crisis conditions.”
Amid strong opposition from Wall Street lobbyists, Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials, the guidance suffered a fatal blow last year when the Government Accountability Office declared it an overreach by regulators. That left Powell and other industry watchdogs in a bind. They said they still believed in their tough standards, but wouldn’t use them to punish banks.
With the hammer gone, banks have more leeway to compete with their less-regulated cousins. Already,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG are among firms that have arranged financing that previously might have run afoul of the Fed and other agencies.
Investors including mutual funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and banks have snapped up leveraged loans in recent years because the debt produces much better returns than safer assets such Treasuries.
But despite a slide in loan quality, yields aren’t rising much -- meaning investors may not be getting fully compensated for the risk they’re taking on. That echoes what happened with subprime-mortgage securities 10 years ago, when holdings labeled low risk triggered billions of dollars of losses.
“Money is chasing looser and looser projects, and from one day to the next the spring uncoils,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in New York. “What exactly do you do when you see tight credit spreads, low quality and significant issuance -- how do you slow that down gradually?”
So far, regulators appointed by President Donald Trump don’t seem focused on slowing things down.
Joseph Otting, the former banker who leads the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in a February speech that “institutions should have the right to do the leveraged lending they want as long as they have the capital and personnel to manage that.” Early last year, the OCC downgraded leveraged lending in its twice-yearly risk report from a “key risk” to something meriting “continued monitoring.”
“There isn’t anything going on in the market right now that would cause us to increase our supervision of that because we are always looking at that type of portfolio,” Richard Taft, the OCC’s deputy comptroller for credit risk, said in an interview this month.
Taft added that the agency has seen improved risk-management by lenders. But he granted that OCC supervisors have no say over the financing offered by nonbanks, which have engaged in transactions that the regulator wouldn’t “normally consider to be within safe and sound practices.”
If there’s a part of the government that could take away the punch bowl, it might be the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was set up through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to monitor threats that could lead to another crash.
The group of financial regulators -- including the heads of the Fed, OCC, FDIC and Securities and Exchange Commission -- didn’t broadcast any warnings about leveraged lending in its most recent annual report. In fact, the document said the number of leveraged loans trading at distressed levels had been falling.
The International Monetary Fund has a different view. Its analysis from April found a lot of market excesses and declining protections for investors, noting that a “share rise in defaults following a tightening of financial conditions, or a shutdown of the market at the extreme, could have large negative implications for the real economy.”
Tobias Adrian, a former senior vice president at the New York Fed who’s now the IMF’s financial markets chief, said in an interview that “supporting growth is important, but future downside risks also need to be considered.” He said regulators have “limited tools to rein in nonbank credit,” so the Fed may need to use monetary policy to cool down lending.
Yellen agrees that the government’s hands are tied.
“Dodd-Frank didn’t go far enough to give regulators power to deal with this,” she said.

The U.S. cable company emerged triumphant in the long-running battle for the pay-TV group after it beat Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox in a rare auction held last weekend.
The deal, struck at a price of 17.28 pounds, also marks a setback for U.S. entertainment giant Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) which would have been Sky's ultimate owner as it has agreed a separate $71 billion deal to buy most of Fox's film and TV assets. 
Fox, which helped to launch the British-based company, said on Wednesday it would now sell its 39 percent stake in Sky to Comcast, giving its U.S. rival more than 51 percent control. 
Comcast will issue the offer document on Thursday and shareholders will then be able to tender their shares in the normal way. Investors have until Oct. 11 to do so. 

The deal will give Comcast, owner of Universal Pictures and the NBC network, a global footprint of 53 million customers.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and its pension unit on Thursday on behalf of customers who were allegedly sold worthless insurance policies for their credit cards. 
The class action is the sixth to be filed against a major financial institution and the first against one of its powerful banks as a result of revelations stemming from a public inquiry into Australia's financial sector. 
The inquiry, called a Royal Commission, can recommend regulatory reform and prosecutions and is due to table an interim report in coming days before issuing its final recommendations to the government in February 2019.
Slater and Gordon lawyer Andrew Paull said NAB and its pension unit MLC, one of Australia's largest pension funds, had knowingly sold insurance to credit-card holders who were ineligible to claim under the terms of the policies.
""Most were existing NAB customers and the bank should have known the insurance was likely to be of little or no benefit to them,"" Paull said in an emailed statement. 
""Despite knowing this, NAB have continued to push the insurance widely, reaping millions in premiums while doing so.""
NAB Chief Legal and Commercial Counsel Sharon Cook said the bank would ""consider carefully any allegations"".
The law firm alleges most of the policies were sold over the phone and people were not given a reasonable opportunity to understand that they probably would not qualify for any benefit.
The lawyers did not specify the size of the damages it would pursue, beyond saying ""millions"" should be paid back.
The Royal Commission has revealed Australia's top banks routinely breached laws when issuing home loans, credit cards and other consumer loans.

Revelations flowing out of the inquiry have triggered five shareholder class actions against the country's largest listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), for allegedly failing to disclose governance problems.

The growth was the slowest pace since March and marked the fourth straight month of slowing growth. Citing analysts from Capital Economics, Reuters said markets had expected a 15.5% increase for August.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both fell 0.5% following the release of the data, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also traded 0.5% lower by 1:45AM ET (05:45 GMT).
China’s drug and health data seller Baytacare Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd received some attention as the trading of its H shares was suspended on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
On Wednesday, the Beijing Municipal Chaoyang District People’s Procuratorate approved the arrest of Wang Shaoyan, Baytacare’s former executive director and chairman of the board, on suspicion of misappropriating funds. Wang’s father, Wang Yan, was also included in the investigation.
Overnight, the Federal Reserve increased the overnight funds rate to a range of 2.00% to 2.25%.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell discussed trade related issues, saying that the Fed had heard a ""rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country.""
He also indicated there was no change in his thinking on monetary policy, although the Fed made an amendment to the statement by removing the use of “accommodative” to describe its stance on monetary policy.
There was much debate about whether removal of that key phrase was hawkish or dovish, but the Fed chief poured some cold water on the speculation.
""The change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy,"" Powell said at his press conference. ""Instead it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.""
Powell also noted that he doesn't see inflation surprising to the upside.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.8% lower. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he had reached an agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to open trade talks between the two nations.

628,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>","London-Shanghai Stock Link May Start December, China Media Says","(Bloomberg) -- A system that will allow Chinese and U.K. companies to list in each other’s stock market could begin as early as Dec. 3, according to Chinese state-run media, a long-awaited step in the Asian nation’s move to open up its financial system.
U.K.-listed firms with a market value of at least 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) would be able to issue depositary receipts, the Shanghai Securities News reported Thursday, without saying where it got the information. The newspaper said investors with a minimum 3 million yuan in securities and fund accounts can buy the shares. This is the first time specific requirements have been reported.
The London-Shanghai stock link, in the works since at least September 2015, is part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to increase access to the country’s financial system. Huatai Securities Co., China’s third-largest brokerage by market value, on Tuesday said it plans to sell at least $500 million of global depositary receipts and list on the  London Stock Exchange  , and other companies are looking to do the same, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Companies seeking to issue depositary receipts in China must be listed for at least three years and the issuance must be at least 500 million yuan, according to the report. The depositary receipts will be subject to a daily price change limit of 10 percent, in line with shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, it said.
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said in April that China aimed to launch the link this year, timing that was reiterated by Premier Li Keqiang during an official visit by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in July.
Chinese companies wishing to list in London will need to already be on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, worth at least 20 billion yuan, and won’t be able to issue more than 15 percent of their total share capital in the U.K., London Stock Exchange Group (LON:LSE) Plc said in May."

Dushnisky, 55, took over at AngloGold on Sept. 1 as the Johannesburg-based miner considers its future in its home country, which now accounts for about 12 percent of total output, and grapples with regulations that threaten profits at operations in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The former president of Barrick Gold Corp. ruled out “fire sales,” but said he would focus on assets that generate the most value.
“My initial sense is that 14 assets in a company our size is probably more than I’d like to see, some streamlining would make sense,” Dushnisky said in an interview on the sidelines of the Denver Gold Forum in Colorado Springs. “We’re not going to sell anything for less than full value.”
The executive won’t consider acquisitions until AngloGold is “firing on all cylinders.” Dushnisky said a mismatch between the company’s output and market valuation helped attract him to the top job. AngloGold trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 18 times, compared with a peer average of about 27 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“That tells me there are things that can be done to unlock value,” said Dushnisky, a Canadian national who was raised on a farm in rural Manitoba and is in the process of buying a house in South Africa. Asked if he would consider moving its primary listing in the country, he said there is no need “to do anything dramatic,” noting that the company has plenty of liquidity through its American depositary receipts in the U.S., where the majority of its shares trade.
AngloGold slipped 1.7 percent to close at $8.74 in New York on Wednesday, and declined 3 percent in Johannesburg.
The company has sold and closed operations in its home country to stem losses and now operates one underground mine and some surface operations.
Output from AngloGold’s operations in the rest of Africa is expected to expand to more than 50 percent of the company’s total, buoyed by production ramp-ups at Siguiri mine in Guinea and Kibali in the Congo. The Obuasi mine in Ghana could become a key operation for the company if its redevelopment comes in on budget by the end of 2019, the CEO said.
‘Engine of Growth’
“That’s the kind of asset which will be an engine of growth for this company,” said Dushnisky, who visited the project last week and met government officials.
His responsibilities at the world’s largest gold miner included dealing with host governments and communities and overseeing Barrick’s own streamlining as it shed non-core assets and focused on cutting costs and improving free cash flow.
While aware of the negotiations that led to this week’s announcement that Barrick Gold has agreed to buy London-listed  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. for about $5.4 billion, Dushnisky said he wasn’t directly involved.
“It’s early and so we, like everyone else, are enthusiastic observers of the combination,” he said.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 11:47PM ET</span>",Papa John's asks potential acquirers to submit offers: sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA), the world's third-largest pizza delivery company, has reached out to potential acquirers to ask them to submit offers, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Papa John's has come under pressure by founder John Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company. He resigned as chairman in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. Since then, Schnatter has been seeking ways to regain control. 
Papa John's sent out information this week about an auction to sell itself to other companies and private equity firms, and expects to receive first-round bids by the end of October, the sources said. There is no certainty of a sale, and Papa John's could also explore an alternative deal, such as receiving an investment, one of the sources added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter was confidential. Papa John's declined to comment. Reuters first reported last month that the company had hired Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) to prepare the ground for a sale.
Papa John's shares ended trading on Wednesday up 8.5 percent at $50.14, giving the company a market value of close to $1.6 billion.
Separately, Schnatter on Wednesday denied a CNBC report that said he had reached out to private equity firms about making an offer for Papa John's. 
""Any such report about a potential transaction involving Mr Schnatter is totally and completely false. It is unfortunate that CNBC published this false story without first contacting Mr Schnatter to obtain the true facts,"" a spokesman for Schnatter said in an emailed statement.
A CNBC spokesman said that the business news TV channel stood by its reporting. 
Papa John's has adopted a so-called poison pill defense to discourage a hostile takeover. 
Schnatter sued the pizza chain’s board and chief executive at the end of August to stop what he described as “the irreparable harm” they are causing the company, according to a court filing.
Last month, Papa John’s posted a second-quarter comparable sales decline of 6.1 percent and cut its sales forecast, citing fallout from the company’s split with Schnatter.
Negative publicity surrounding Schnatter depressed July traffic in North America, the company said at the time, noting it was hard to predict how long and how badly that would affect sales. Papa John’s has more than 5,000 locations worldwide, mostly franchised restaurants.
Papa John’s Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie has vowed to move beyond the fight with Schnatter with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter’s image from company promotions. Two franchisee associations working with the company have expressed support for its strategy.
Ritchie, previously Papa John’s president, took over as CEO in January. Schnatter came under fire in November for criticizing the National Football League’s leadership over national anthem protests by players.

Dealmaking in the restaurant sector is heating up. Arby's-owner Inspire Brands Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Sonic Corp (O:SONC) for about $1.57 billion in cash, adding more than 3,600 drive-in restaurants to its portfolio that includes brands such as Buffalo Wild Wings and Rusty Taco.

The lawsuit, which was filed against FedEx Ground Package System Inc and FedEx Freight Inc, had sought penalties under the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act, which prohibits shipping contraband cigarettes.
In his ruling, Judge Edgardo Ramos noted the complaint simply alleged that, sometime within a 10-year span, FedEx made shipments totaling over 10,000 cigarettes. ""Without further details, there is insufficient factual content to 'draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.'""
Ramos said the plaintiffs could appeal and re-file their complaint by Oct. 31.

""At FedEx Ground, we are committed to honoring the privacy of our customers, who trust us to transport their packages safely and securely. We take that trust very seriously and will continue to defend our position in the pending litigation,"" a FedEx spokeswoman told Reuters.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:51PM ET</span>",Tencent & Alibaba chase remittances in battle for Southeast Asia,"By Fanny Potkin and Venus Wu
JAKARTA/HONG KONG (Reuters) - For Chinese tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent, Southeast Asian domestic helpers in Hong Kong may prove key to their global ambitions in financial services.
Both companies recently launched money-transfer services that allow Hong Kong-based workers from Indonesia and the Philippines to send money home cheaply and easily. The moves are a first step in going after a global remittance business that moves more than $600 billion around the world annually. 
But the initiatives are also part of the firms' broader efforts to take their wildly successful WeChat Pay and Alipay mobile payment system overseas. 
Southeast Asia, with a growing population of 600 million people who mostly lack bank accounts, is a strategic battleground for Asian tech behemoths and their U.S rivals.
Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Financial called its Hong Kong remittance initiative ""a starting point and significant step in accelerating our pace to promote financial inclusion globally.""
Tencent's WeChat Pay, which is ubiquitous in China but has struggled to gain traction abroad outside of Chinese tourist destinations, is more circumspect about the goals for its Hong Kong We Remit service, although a spokesman allowed it was open to ""all possibilities.""
Sending money across borders, however, is harder than it looks. That helps explain why both companies are working with a Hong Kong-based financial technology start-up, EMQ, which has regulatory approvals and bank partnerships in place across Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
""We are the pipes and distribution for Tencent,"" said EMQ CEO Max Liu. He declined to comment on any relationship with Ant Financial, but three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Ant Financial is developing its own partnership with EMQ as part of a suite of new cross-border payment efforts. Ant Financial declined to comment.
The ""pipes"" are only part of the challenge. Reuters interviewed six Filipino and Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong who said it would take time to get their families to trust receiving remittances via their mobile phones.
Indeed, We Remit doesn't currently link up to mobile phone wallets. Instead, recipients pick up funds at banks or pawnshops, just as they've traditionally done with services from market leaders Moneygram and Western Union.
For the senders, the new services can be a revelation. For years, the only way Filipino maid Rochelle Bumanglag could send money home was by spending her off days on Sunday waiting hours at banks and remittances shops in downtown Hong Kong.
    ""When I go to a bank, it's a lot of queuing and a lot of hassle. WeChat, they always give us a good rate. It's very convenient, very fast. I go to 7-11 and put money in my account,"" the 42-year old said.
Another big attraction: neither WeChat nor Alipay are charging fees, at least for now.
""The WeChat rate is 6.80 peso to the HKD (Hong Kong dollar), whereas the bank’s rate is 6.79 pesos plus a HK$25 ($3.20) cable charge. It’s a big difference for us,"" said Bumanglag, who sends about 10,000 pesos, or about HK$1,470, a month home.
Eventually, those new WeChat and Alipay users might be persuaded to use other services too, the companies hope.
HIGH FEES
Filipinos and Indonesian make up most of Hong Kong's 370,000 domestic workers, according to government data. The two countries are among the world's top recipients of money transfers: The Philippines received $32.8 billion in remittances in 2017, while Indonesia had $9 billion, according to the World Bank. Over $16.9 billion in remittances flew through Hong Kong the same year.
Global remittances to low and middle-income countries alone are expected to reach 485 billion in 2018. 
(For a graphic on 'Remittances to Asia' click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/ALIBABA-TENCENT-REMITTANCES/01008022036/index.html)
The scale of the market helps explain why Alibaba sought to acquire Moneygram last year in an $880 million deal that was ultimately scuttled by U.S. regulators.
Together with U.S.-based Western Union, Moneygram has long been a dominant player in a business that's traditionally depended on large physical networks of local agents ranging from banks to convenience stores and pawnshops.
Those expensive networks, together with complicated compliance requirements and other technical and regulatory hurdles, have meant high fees, often for those who can least afford it. Reuters found that remittance fees in Hong Kong start at HK$15 and can range to as high as HK$200, with additional costs sometimes in embedded in unfavorable exchange rates.
For now, WeChat and Alipay are focused on gaining acceptance. WeChat became operational in Hong Kong last year, working with EMQ and other partners including popular Filipino pawnshop chains Cebuana and Palawan.
Ant Financial’s venture, launched through its Alipay HK affiliate and based on blockchain software, started moving money between Hong Kong and the Philippines in late June. Unlike We Remit, it allows real-time transfers between Alipay HK accounts and the Filipino mobile payments service Gcash, which Ant Financial partly owns and which is operated by telecommunications firm Globe Telecom. [L4N1TR3JW]
Sources say the Hong Kong initiative isn't Alipay's only move in remittances. Job advertisements in September for Ant Financial's Malaysia office listed remittances as a responsibility.
The firm has launched joint ventures in seven markets for local digital payments services, which operate independently under the partnerships’ brand names, including in Indonesia and Malaysia. 
Analysts say that AlipayHK's remittance tie-up with Gcash could be replicated in other markets.
""Ant Financial's eventual aim is to create a global payment system for its consumers,"" said Zennon Kapron, director of fintech consultancy Kapronasia.
""The first focus was following Chinese customers, the second was expanding merchant acceptance beyond typical tourist destinations, and the third is for local value wallets."" 
Ant Financial raised $14 billion in June, earmarked for its international expansion.
GLOBAL REACH
EMQ's network shows where Tencent and Ant could be going. The company has regulatory approvals in Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Singapore, China and Japan, which would allow clients to quickly scale up their operations.
The startup is in the middle of expanding to the Middle East and has a partnership with Chinese financial technology startup QFPay, whose point-of-sale terminals are used by Alipay and WeChat Pay in the mainland. 
Alibaba and Tencent face plenty of competition in remittances, not to mention the long list of technology and financial services companies that aim to compete more broadly in payments.
Moneygram head for Asia Yogesh Sangle told Reuters it would difficult for any company to equal Moneygram's global network of partners across 200 countries. And the incumbents have their own tech initiatives too: Moneygram started a partnership with Gcash in February, while WeChat Pay is working with Western Union on a service for Chinese students abroad.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>","U.S. union seeks raises, three-year contract for refinery workers","By Erwin Seba
SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Union officials representing 30,000 workers at U.S. oil refineries and chemical plants on Wednesday said they will pursue sizable wage increases and a 3-year contract in coming negotiations. 
Contract talks, which begin in January, come as U.S. refiners are enjoying strong profits, near-full utilization rates and record product exports. In the June quarter, the margin on turning crude to gasoline, diesel and other products was the highest since 2015.
The United Steelworkers union (USW) wants a wage increase comparable to the 6 percent per year increase it originally sought during 2015 talks, Kim Nibarger, chairman of the USW's national oil bargaining program, said in an interview following a three-day union meeting in San Diego. 
In 2015, USW members went on a six-week strike at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. In the end, they accepted a four-year contract that provided members between 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent annual increases each year and changes to working conditions. 
Nibarger declined to provide specifics of the proposals that union officials will bring to their members in coming weeks. Local union members will have 45 days to vote on the proposals reached on Wednesday. If 75 percent of locals agree, the wage increase will be presented to companies in January.
""They are in the range of the proposals made in 2015,"" he said. ""I think it is an aggressive proposal, but not unreasonable given the dedication of members to keep their facilities operating at top notch.""
Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa) was once again named lead negotiator on behalf of companies that own U.S. refineries, including Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC)  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp (N:HFC) and  Delek US Holdings Inc  (N:DK).
Shell declined immediate comment on Wednesday.
""Our goal is a mutually beneficial agreement for our members and the companies they work for,"" said Nibarger. 
The USW also wants improvements in a standard meant to reduce fatigue among its workers. It sought a similar change in 2015, he said. 
In 2015, the national strike lasted six weeks and some local strikes continued for months with workers at the Marathon Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas not returning to work until July.

The current USW contract runs out on Feb. 1.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of nine state attorneys general on Wednesday backed AT&T Inc (N:T) as the Justice Department asks a federal appeals court to reverse approval of the company's $85.4 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
It ""is rare for the federal government to pursue an antitrust case involving major, national companies without any state joining the effort,"" the nine state officials said in a court filing, noting that no states have filed briefs supporting the Justice Department's appeal.
""It is notable that the district court - after a six-week trial, during which it heard numerous witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of exhibits - found the federal government’s case to be without merit. That determination validates the States’ decision and is entitled to substantial deference,"" the brief said.
The nine attorneys general are from Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
The government is appealing U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's ruling in June that the acquisition of Time Warner could proceed. The government argued the deal would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law.
AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal. 
""In the crucible of litigation, DOJ’s claims were exposed as both narrow and fragile,"" AT&T company argued in court documents filed last week.
The merger, announced in October 2016 and closed on June 14, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, a frequent target of Trump’s ire.
In August, the Justice Department said Leon had failed to take into account how companies negotiate with each other and seek to maximize profits in considering the Justice Department’s arguments about how the deal would decrease competition.
The core of the Justice Department’s concern about the deal is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner’s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.

Oral arguments have not yet been scheduled by U.S. Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>","Amazon turns to toys, home goods in latest brick-and-mortar trial","By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Wednesday said it is opening a general store in New York City that will sell toys, household goods and a range of other products highly rated on its website, marking its latest push into brick-and-mortar retail.
Drawing on its wealth of customer data, Amazon has stocked the store with its best sellers as well as products popular with New Yorkers. The shop, known as Amazon 4-star, will let customers play with Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers and other devices made by the company. It will also sell books, games and kitchenware.
The news marks Amazon's latest incursion into the turf of rivals such as  Target  Corp (N:TGT), which has courted urban shoppers with new small-format stores. It also highlights how the world's largest online retailer, famous for upending retail chains' business, is increasingly turning to physical stores to please customers.
Digital price tags will line the shelves of Amazon 4-star. That will allow items' prices to fluctuate, so members of Amazon's loyalty club Prime will always pay the online price in the store.
Those without membership in the fast-shipping club will be charged the typically higher list price, unless they sign up for Prime on the spot. Amazon's chain of more than a dozen book stores operates in the same way.
Encouraging sign-ups is key to the company's strategy because Prime members tend to shop more on Amazon.com.
The extent of Amazon's ambition for the new store format is unclear. The company is known for experimentation, and a spokesman declined to comment on expansion plans.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Amazon will add new stores if the format takes off, but he expects it may not.
""If I’m looking for a television and the store is full of kitchen appliances, it doesn’t help me very much,"" he said.
Grocery remains the other key category for Amazon's brick-and-mortar play.

The company bought Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) in a $13.7 billion deal last year, from which it is now delivering fresh food to shoppers' homes. It is also rolling out smaller grocery shops known as Amazon Go, where in-store technology allows customers to walk out with items and have their credit cards billed without having to stop by a cash register.

Comcast outbid Fox in an auction to take control of pay-TV group Sky on Saturday, with a $40 billion offer price. That price includes Fox's 39 percent stake, which the offer valued at 11.63 billion pounds ($15.31 billion).
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which agreed to buy Fox in June for $71.3 billion, said it had given consent to Fox's decision. Disney shares rose 1.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $115.87 in midday trade.
Fox's sale hands full control of the satellite TV company to Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts, giving the U.S. cable company a global footprint of 53 million customers. 
It also allows Disney to focus its resources on building direct-to-consumer products such as the Disney-branded streaming video service that is expected to launch late next year, the company said.
""When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,"" Fox said in a statement. ""We bet -- and almost lost -- the farm on launching a business that many didn't think was such a good idea.""
Fox had previously agreed to sell the stake in Sky to Disney as part of Disney's acquisition of Fox. 
The sale of the Sky stake and the divestiture of regional sports networks will reduce Disney’s $71.3 billion cost for the Fox acquisition by roughly $30 billion, a source with knowledge of the matter said. That implies the anticipated sale of the sports networks will yield about $15 billion. 
Sky's Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said: ""Nearly 30 years ago Rupert Murdoch took a risk to launch Sky and in the process changed the way we watch television forever.
""With 21CF announcing its intention to sell its shares to Comcast we close one chapter while simultaneously opening another.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is ""pleased"" with the new domestic solar panel manufacturing investments announced since President Donald Trump imposed hefty import tariffs earlier this year, but continued investment could depend on the outcome of ongoing trade talks, a trade official said on Wednesday.
Solar companies including SunPower Corp (O:SPWR), China's JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd (N:JKS), and Korea's Hanwha Q CELLS Co Ltd (O:HQCL) have all announced investments in U.S. manufacturing since Trump imposed the 30 percent tariff on imports in January. Trump's move was intended to beef up domestic production but has also slowed the pace of domestic solar installations by pushing up costs.
""We're very pleased to see all these announcements,"" Cora Dickson, the Commerce Department's senior renewable energy specialist, said at the Solar Power International trade show in Anaheim, California. Dickson said ""many factors"" would impact any further announcements, however, including ongoing negotiations with Canada and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
Those negotiations could affect the flow of components and finished products across borders and alter the economics of U.S. manufacturing of solar panels.
""Obviously, free trade is wonderful, and the flow of trade and the whole supply chain and global supply chain right now is being sort of disrupted and shifting around,"" Dickson said. ""You have to think about alternatives. But the end goal is to get China to play fair."" 
Dickson noted that all of the new domestic solar capacity was for panel assembly and not the solar cells that are put together to make panels.
""We were hoping to see a resurgence in the cells. It hasn't happened yet,"" she said. 
Solar cell manufacturing takes more time to set up than panel assembly, and a large share of cell imports - 2.5 gigawatts a year - are exempt from the tariffs.
Trump's levy on solar panel imports in January was aimed at reversing years of decline in U.S. solar manufacturing under competition from cheaper Asian output. But most of the solar industry lobbied against a tariff, saying it would drive up the cost of solar panels and hurt the industry’s robust job growth.

Many solar companies have requested exemptions from the tariffs, and the Commerce Department last week granted seven of those requests, Dickson said. More decisions on exemptions will be made ""in due course,"" she added, without being specific.

641,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 05:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Washington May Overshadow Wall Street
While investors will always be paying attention to corporate numbers, stock moves and charts, there are times when Wall Street’s just distracted. Tomorrow will likely be one of those days as events in Washington could overshadow the tape.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, are scheduled to appear at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
The hearing comes amid other accusations by women against Kavanaugh. President Donald Trump has backed his nominee, saying he believes Kavanaugh’s denials.
And Trump is also scheduled to meet with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
This meeting comes after a chaotic Monday, when there were sourced reports that Rosenstein had either quit, been fired, both and neither.
Rosenstein is still in his position at the Justice Department and oversees the Robert Mueller investigation into possible Russian influence in the Trump campaign.
2. Pending Home Sales Arrive as Traders Look to December Fed Meeting
The Federal Reserve delivered its expected interest-rate hike today and left the market to debate whether removing “accommodative” from its statement means rates are close to neutral (dovish) or that the economy is strong enough for the Fed to be bolder (hawkish).
Fed chief Jerome Powell said policy is just right for now, but that won’t stop speculation.
Still, investors are free to focus on the new data to get a handle on whether the Fed hikes one last time in 2018.
Second-quarter final GDP numbers arrive before the bell, but little is likely to change from the last report.
Of more importance are the pending home sales numbers for August, which arrive at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Housing looked a little shaky in July, but new home sales surprised to the upside for August.
Economist expect that pending home sales dipped 0.2% from last month, compared with a 0.7% drop in the prior reading.
3. Five Companies Set to Go Public
The performance of initial public offerings can be a good indicator about the health of the overall market and the IPO calendar is getting busier with summer in the rearview mirror.
Five companies are expected to debut tomorrow, including four in the biotech space.
The biggest deal is Urovant Sciences, which is expected to raise $150 million. London-based Urovant currently has its drug vibegron, which treats overactive bladder, in a Phase 3 clinical trial.
The one scheduled IPO not in the drug business is China-based LAIX, which is an education provider specializing in artificial intelligence. It looks set to raise about $72 million."

648,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","GM's Cadillac to leave Big Apple, return to Michigan roots","By Nick Carey and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Wednesday that Cadillac will switch its headquarters back to Michigan from New York after just three years to be closer to engineers and design teams as the luxury brand plans to roll out two new vehicles annually through 2020.
Cadillac moved to New York under Johan de Nysschen, who ran the brand from 2014 until his abrupt ouster in April. The move to the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2015 accompanied bold plans to reshape Cadillac's lineup with a $12 billion product program in 2015 and was meant to bring the brand closer to the urban customers who for years had shunned it.
GM replaced De Nysschen with Steve Carlisle, who previously served as managing director of GM's Canadian operations.
After betting heavily on sedans models that are increasingly unpopular with U.S. consumers, last summer Cadillac announced a plan to catch up with market shifts by shrinking its lineup of sedans in favor of larger, more popular sport utility vehicles. 
Through the first six months of this year, Cadillac's U.S. sales were up 5.4 percent, driven by growth in SUV sales.
Next April, Cadillac will move to Warren, Michigan, a stone's throw from GM's main design hub. 
A GM spokesman said Cadillac will remain a separate business unit. The brand employs 110 people in New York, all of whom will be offered jobs in Michigan, the spokesman said.
The spokesman said that Cadillac will also play a ""big role"" in the automaker's plans for developing self-driving vehicles and that it made sense for the brand to be closer to the rest of GM.
Cadillac was founded in Detroit in 1902. 
Modern Detroit traces its origins back to a man named Cadillac — Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, to be precise, a French adventurer who founded Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit in 1701.
When Cadillac moved to New York it was eligible for state investment incentives, which a GM spokesman said the automaker had never used.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Nike shares dip after forecast disappoints,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Nike  (N:NKE) shares fell as much as 3 percent on Wednesday after the company disappointed Wall Street by not raising its full-year forecast following a sales boost from its Colin Kaepernick ad campaign.
The campaign, along with Nike's increasing efforts to woo younger customers with new sneakers and jerseys, had led to expectations that the company would lift its outlook for the year.
""A combination of heightened expectations going into the company's results, a slight disappointment in gross margins, as well as tepid second-quarter guidance is causing a wobbliness in the company's stock,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said.
Nike CEO Mark Parker said on Tuesday following quarterly results that the marketing blitz, which marked the 30th anniversary of its ""Just Do It"" slogan, was driving an uptick in customer traffic and ""record"" customer engagement.
The ad featuring Kaepernick, first aired in early September days after Nike's fiscal quarter ended, revived a nationwide debate that began in 2016 when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback began kneeling during the national anthem at games to protest police shootings of unarmed black men.
In reaction to the ad, protesters burned Nike shoes and called for a boycott of its products. Nike shares fell 3 percent the day after the ad was first aired.
Yet in the following weeks, analysts and marketing experts said they expected the ad to bring more attention to Nike and bump up sales.
Nike currently expects full-year revenue growth at the lower end of a high-single digit range due to a stronger dollar.
In the quarter ended August, Oregon-based Nike's revenue rose 10 percent, beating Wall Street estimates. Profit also exceeded expectations even as higher commodity costs hit margins.
After the report, analysts remained bullish and at least five raised their price targets on Nike's stock.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lifted its target to a Wall Street high of $103, well above the median target of $87.
""We advocate buying the dip as its margin expansion story remains in early innings,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a client report, calling it their ""top pick.""
The company's strong fundamentals and gains in market share in North America, its biggest market, have kept Wall Street upbeat, with 22 of 37 analysts rating its stock ""buy"" or higher.
""The underlying fundamentals or the building blocks of the story are still intact,"" Wedbush's Svezia said.
As part of efforts to grab more market share from rivals Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and  Under Armour  (N:UAA), Nike has focused on its digital platform and offered new lines of Jordan and React sneakers and World Cup jerseys.
Nike's shares, which have outperformed Puma (DE:PUMG) and Adidas with a 35 percent rise this year, were down a little less than $1 at $83.98 on Wednesday afternoon.

Kaepernick and representatives for the player did not respond to Reuters' messages and calls requesting comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street extended gains on Wednesday, while the dollar dipped but then recovered, after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as expected, and flagged the end of ""accommodative"" monetary policy.
With steady economic growth and a strong job market, the Fed left its outlook for the coming years largely unchanged. It still foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year and one in 2020.
""The strong dollar has been torpedoing everyone's international investments for the better part of a year or so,"" said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""If the dollar tails off here or just levels off, that is very bullish for emerging markets and other places where that dollar strength has really been a problem.""

Earlier in the day, Chinese equity markets had set a positive tone after global index provider MSCI said it could quadruple China's weighting in global benchmarks. That lent fresh impetus to a market already buoyed by expectations of state stimulus to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. 
Shanghai-listed shares closed almost 1 percent higher at eight-week highs and the Hang Seng Index, made up of large Hong Kong companies, rose 1.15 percent.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.27 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.19 percent.
The dollar index rose 0.18 percent, with the euro down 0.22 percent to $1.1745. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback.
Investors were also keeping close watch on bond yields in the United States and Germany. Ten-year borrowing costs in both have inched to multi-month highs, with the first interest rate rise by the European Central Bank expected in September 2019.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 03:29PM ET</span>","Trump metals tariffs will cost Ford $1 billion in profits, CEO says","By Nick Carey and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have cost  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) about $1 billion in profits, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday, while Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said higher steel prices have brought ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in new costs.
""From Ford’s perspective the metals tariffs took about $1 billion in profit from us,"" CEO James Hackett said at a Bloomberg conference in New York, ""The irony of which is we source most of that in the U.S. today anyway. If it goes on any longer, it will do more damage."" 
Hackett did not specify what period the $1 billion covered, but a spokesman said the automaker's CEO was referring to internal forecasts at Ford for higher tariff-related costs in 2018 and 2019. 
Higher U.S. steel prices have resulted in ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in additional annual costs, Rick Schostek, executive vice president of Honda North America, told the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, even as more than 90 percent of steel in its vehicles assembled in the United States is made domestically.
Honda also faces retaliatory tariffs from Canada and China on lawn-mowers it builds in North Carolina and transmissions made in Georgia.
Honda has not boosted U.S. vehicle prices as a result of the higher costs but the issue is ""certainly part of our thinking as we go forward,"" Schostek told reporters after the hearing.
While the vast majority of steel and aluminum that Ford uses for U.S. production is made domestically, it has said the tariffs could result in higher domestic commodity prices.
Ford shares dipped 0.7 percent to $9.32 in afternoon trading.
The United States said in March it would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum from most countries. The tariffs have allowed U.S. producers to raise their prices. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs will boost car prices by hiking commodity costs for manufacturers, automakers have warned.
During the presidential campaign, Trump lambasted U.S. trade deficits as detrimental to American manufacturers and workers. 
Since taking office, Trump has pursued a policy of escalating tariffs that he says will reverse that trend, including waging an increasingly bitter trade war with China. 
The auto industry is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs. On May 23 Trump ordered a ""Section 232"" national security investigation into whether to impose a 25 percent tariff on vehicle and auto parts imported from the European Union and other trading partners.
The section, included in the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, allows the president to adjust imports through tariffs if they threaten national security. 
At a briefing in Detroit on Wednesday, officials from analytics data firm IHS Markit said if the Trump administration imposed the Section 232 tariffs globally, it would have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. auto industry as well as the broader economy.
IHS Markit estimates that full implementation of the 232 tariffs would add between $1,800 and $5,700 to a new vehicle's price tag and cut new auto sales by around 2.2 million units in 2020 as well as slice total sales to as little as 14.5 million units from expectations of 17 million vehicles this year. 
The new tariffs would also cost around 300,000 in auto-related jobs in factories and dealerships across the country, and slash U.S. economic growth by 1.1 percentage points to 2.2 percent, IHS said. 
In July Ford lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to slumping sales and trade tariffs on China as well as its struggling business in Europe.

The automaker's difficulties in boosting sales in China have showed no signs of ending despite taking steps to bring new products to market.

Foreign investors poured 2.14 billion reais ($524 million) into Brazilian equities last week, pushing the total on the second half of the year to 8.4 billion reais, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.
For local stocks, which have been on a volatile stretch, improving corporate earnings’ and cheap valuations have been offsetting uncertainty on the outcome of the October election and its impact on Brazil’s fiscal outlook, seen as key by investors. The benchmark Ibovespa is up 3.1 percent this year, while emerging market stocks are down by 9.6 percent.
Election polls have shown increasing odds of a runoff between candidates who have opposing views on how to fix Latin America’s largest economy. Former Army captain Jair Bolsonaro, who leads the race, has enlisted an adviser who is in favor of privatizations and overhauling the pension and tax systems. Workers’ Party Fernando Haddad, on the other hand, wants to jump-start the economy by boosting government spending and offering cheap credit, policies seen as having the potential to drag Brazil into another recession.
“It is pretty interesting that flows are in positive territory since July considering the market uncertainty globally and locally,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategist Emy Shayo wrote in note. Flows are recovering amid an “undemanding” valuation and as “earnings are pointing to an expansion ahead,” she said.
The inflows also come on the back of a negative start of the year, when foreign investors pulled almost 10 billion reais from the local market, and differs from the move seen in Brazilian equities abroad: the biggest exchange-traded fund of Brazilian stocks has seen outflows of money since July.
Foreigners are also reducing their negative bets on the currency as the campaign reaches the final stretch. Short positions on the real fell to about $32 billion from $40 billion at the start of the month.
Markets have been volatile ahead of the election, concerned the left is gaining ground. Bolsonaro had 27 percent of voter intentions, according to an Ibope poll published Wednesday, followed by Haddad at 21 percent. The Workers’ Party candidate would win a runoff by 42 percent to 38 percent. The first round vote is on Oct. 7, and if no candidate gets a majority, the top two will move to a runoff on Oct. 28.
“The second round seems to be coming into view a bit earlier then expected, and so the candidates are making pushes to the center already,” said Mariana Guarino, a money manager at brokerage Truxt. “That’s helping ease some of the pressure on Brazilian assets.”"

The project has been met with resistance by some community members and local officials concerned about pollution, noise and traffic in San Bernardo, the area in Santiago where Walmart plans to build the center. 
The mayor of San Bernardo, Nora Cuevas, said she would consider ways to halt the plan after the project was approved unanimously by a group of ministers.

Walmart Chile [WMTCI.UL], the company's Chilean subsidiary, operates 380 stores in the South American country, largely under the Lider brand.

Lyft's net loss grew by 46 percent to $373 million, with the company losing 41 cents for every dollar of revenue, an improvement from a year earlier when the company lost 62 cents, the report said, citing a person with knowledge of the figures.
Lyft, which is expected to go public next year, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) was in talks to lead Lyft's upcoming initial public offering as an underwriter.
Lyft's chief rival, Uber Technologies Inc, is also eyeing a stock market flotation in 2019.
Both firms have amassed losses as they spend heavily to enter new markets and attract drivers to their platforms, although losses have narrowed in recent years.
Uber's net loss narrowed to $891 million in the second quarter ended June 30 from $1.1 billion a year earlier.
Its net revenue for the same period was $2.8 billion, up 8 percent over the previous quarter and more than 60 percent higher than a year earlier.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Daimler's new CEO adds international flair to Mercedes,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) appointment of company veteran Ola Kaellenius to become chief executive from next year signals a cultural shift by the world's oldest carmaker as it takes on new rivals from the tech sector.
A 49-year old Swede, Kaellenius is the first non German CEO to head up the 132-year-old Stuttgart-based inventor of the modern automobile. He also lacks an educational background in mechanical engineering.
With his international experience he embodies a more informal leadership style as  Daimler  seeks to embrace Silicon Valley management tactics to compete with tech rivals like Waymo and Byton in a race to put self-driving cars on the road.
""The hearts of our vehicles used to be drivetrains, in the future it will be their hard drives,"" Kaellenius said in a speech at the Consumer Eletronics Show in Las Vegas this year, an appearance which appeared to signal that he represented the new face of high-tech Mercedes-Benz.
Like Dieter Zetsche, who is set to take over as Daimler's chairman in 2021, Kaellenius excels at impressing international audiences. His polished but casual approach - with no suit or tie - echoes a management style more at home in California than Germany. 
Kaellenius joined Daimler as a trainee in 1993 and moved to work in corporate controlling at Mercedes-Benz in Tuscaloosa, Alabama before further postings at performance division Mercedes-AMG. He became a management board member for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales in 2015.
Critics say his emergence as Zetsche's heir apparent in the past two years has happened when Mercedes-Benz has enjoyed record sales and profits, sparing Kaellenius and Daimler's management board fights with labor representatives.
Mercedes-Benz overtook BMW (DE:BMWG) to become the world's biggest selling luxury car brand in 2016.
Kaellenius did restructure the Mercedes dealership network, but critics say this happened when vehicle deliveries reached record levels, reducing the need for painful cuts.
""Until now cooperation with Ola Kaellenius and labor representatives has remained constructive and we therefore expect it to remain that way in this new constellation,"" Daimler's works council chief Michael Brecht said. 
Kaellenius does have his work cut out for him. Daimler issued a profit warning earlier this year, hit by the rising cost of trade tariffs and problems getting the Mercedes vehicle fleet to conform to stricter anti-pollution standards.
Global auto sales are starting to wane and industry profits are being crimped by heavy investments into electric cars.
Daimler now faces scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors about diesel pollution as part of a broader clampdown on toxic fumes which has seen customers shun diesel cars, leaving German workers worried about jobs tied to engine assembly. 
In 2013, labor leaders, who command half the seats on the company's board of directors, opposed deeper restructuring measures and forced Zetsche to reassign cost-cutting specialist Wolfgang Bernhard as a condition for extending his contract as CEO. 
Zetsche did push through several restructurings in the last decade to try to restore the premium status of the Mercedes-Benz brand in the wake of an expensive merger with mass market manufacturer Chrysler.
Kaellenius, who has a qualification in international management from the Stockholm School of Economics, and experience in the United States, has introduced Silicon Valley management techniques at the carmaker to speed up the pace of innovation to keep up with the software industry.
Currently Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development, Kaellenius has helped Zetsche to sweep away layers of bureaucracy and encourage a more experimental approach to new products, changing a culture of strict hierarchies and meticulous planning.

""Kaellenius has been crown prince for a while, and he represents change. He is young, intelligent, has a good management style and is simply a different kind of animal from many other top managers in the auto industry,"" Juergen Pieper, an analyst with Bankhaus Metzler said.

PARIS (Reuters) - The board of Airbus (PA:AIR) is holding an unusual meeting in China as the European planemaker implements plans to increase local assembly of jets - a hike that could help unlock talks over a long-delayed deal to sell up to 180 jets, industry sources said.
The board of Europe's largest aerospace group traveled to the world's fastest-growing aviation market for an annual off-site ""strategy"" session coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the inauguration of Airbus jet assembly at Tianjin near Beijing.
Despite efforts to prevent electronic eavesdropping on discussions held on Chinese soil, the board is expected to stay well clear of sensitive subjects. Besides building jets, Airbus is a major European defense contractor, responsible for the production of France's nuclear missiles and German fighters.
""They are not going to talk about everything. It will be a general discussion,"" an industry source told Reuters.
The head of the Airbus planemaking division, Guillaume Faury, seen as a possible successor to Chief Executive Tom Enders whose mandate expires next year, is also in China for the off-site meeting, a person familiar with the matter said.
A spokesman for Airbus said it would not comment on the movements of its senior management or on details of the meeting, said to be taking place in a secured private location.
Booming Chinese air travel is a major driver of record Western production of passenger jets, while China is preparing to showcase its own aerospace industry at an air show next month.
Airbus earlier this year announced plans to increase the number of its best-selling A320-family medium-haul jets assembled at Tianjin from 4 a month to 6 a month by 2020, representing about a tenth of total A320 output.
A year ago it added a completion plant for A330 aircraft in Tianjin, hoping for a boost for its slow-selling A330neo model which gained European safety certification on Wednesday.
However plans for a landmark sale of up to 180 jets during a visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron in January fell through shortly after a perceived gaffe by two European envoys over China's sensitive historical relationship with Japan.
In June, industry sources said the two sides were once again in jet sale talks bolstered by the production increase and at the Farnborough Airshow a month later, Chinese interests were said to be behind a number of anonymous deals.
Among pending deals, Airbus is urgently trying to close what industry sources described as a provisional $9 billion deal with Chinese lessor ICBC for 80 jets, partially announced in Farnborough without the buyer's name being disclosed.
""We are always in talks with our customers, but we only communicate when deals are ready,"" the Airbus spokesman said.

Bloomberg News reported earlier that the two sides were close to an $18 billion deal.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian businesses could share with the government the financial burden of building high-speed railways and toll roads - projects high on President Vladimir Putin's economic agenda, a senior Russian government official said.
The Kremlin in August called on Russian metals and mining firms, which have profited from a weak rouble and strong commodity prices, to invest in projects that would help the stretched state budget meet Putin's decrees.
Putin's new decrees set out ambitious economic goals for his new presidency - including transport infrastructure such as high-speed rail links - which will cost the budget at least 8 trillion rubles and should put the Russian economy among the top five world economies by 2024.
Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov, in an interview with Reuters, said business could potentially invest in the development of high-speed passenger railways, which Russia does not have at the moment.
This was a sector which could provide demand for different metals, advanced technologies and IT-systems, he said.
""We are very much in support of investments by businesses. But it should be done where businesses see their own interests as well, not because someone has got on their backs,"" Akimov said.
A draft government and Russian Railways plan forsees the development of a high-speed rail link to the town of Nizhny Novgorod worth more than 620 billion rubles ($9.40 billion) and one to the town of Vladimir worth 200 billion rubles.
Total Russian Railways development plan is estimated at 9.9 trillion rubles to 2025, according to document seen by Reuters. 
""If the political decision to go ahead with this project (high-speed passenger railways) is taken, we will do our best to build up a model so that it would be attractive to investors,"" Akimov said.
The government's plan for total infrastructure development up to 2024 is worth 6.24 trillion rubles.
Around a half of that amount should come from the budget and another half - from so-called 'non-budgetary' resources, Akimov said. The plan, which he said may change, should be approved by Oct 1. 
Akimov also said the government had added development of Northern Sea Route which now is mainly used to ship liquefied natural gas, to its infrastructure plan. The project will increase the capacity of seaports and the construction of a Europe-Western China highway.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares held their ground near 4-week highs on Wednesday before a widely expected rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index ended up 0.3 percent, while London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) and Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) both advanced around 0.1 percent.
""I don't expect much to be happening before the Fed,"" said ABR managing director Harry Scheper. He added that volumes were low, as they typically are ahead of U.S. rate decisions.
The statement from the U.S. central bank is due at 1800 GMT.
European shares have been under pressure this summer but they have rebounded over the last few days on hopes the U.S. could resume trade talks with China after the two countries moved ahead with new tariffs on each other's exports.
Easing worries over Brexit and the Italian budget, due on Thursday, helped bring investors' attention back to the region's cheaply valued equity market. Fresh deal-making activity also buoyed the market.
On Wednesday the STOXX was supported by gains in defensive sectors like consumer staples and healthcare, while cyclical stocks that drove most of the recent gains suffered.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amid all the brickbats thrown at one of the longest bull markets in history, the remarkable buoyancy of world equity prices may simply be down to a shortage of shares.
Trade wars, an unpredictable White House, a messy Brexit and rising interest rates have all failed this year to knock stock markets off their collective perch for very long. Wall Street indices are at record highs and global equity benchmarks are less than 4 percent from the year's peaks.
GRAPHIC: MSCI world index - ups and downs in 2018 - https://reut.rs/2xBIVnO
For many, the most basic laws of supply and demand help square that circle. 
Equity markets worldwide are slowly shrinking. Not enough shares are being issued to offset those being withdrawn from circulation and net equity supply turned negative in 2016 for the first time ever, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) which expects low to negative supply this year after a marginally positive 2017.
Even just assuming stable investor demand for equity investments going forward, the supply picture means more money on aggregate will be chasing every public share. 
Fewer stocks are being sold via initial or secondary public offerings while buybacks, cash-funded mergers and acquisitions and even de-listing of companies altogether drain the world of investable equity. 
From January through August this year, primary listings added shares worth around $126 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. Even after allowing for secondary listings and share placements to employees, issuance volumes should be dwarfed by buybacks, which may surpass $1 trillion this year.
GRAPHIC: Shrinking number of publicly-listed firms - https://reut.rs/2MZOT6Q
Few expect the trend to reverse soon, with some citing overall disillusionment among company bosses with the vagaries and the glare of the marketplace as well as the relative cheapness of alternative debt financing. 
""It is a pain being listed on the stock market, there's red tape, short-termism, excessive scrutiny - these are all issues. But the really basic issue is, companies will go where the money's cheapest,"" said Robert Buckland, the Citi strategist who dubbed the trend ""de-equitization"" as far back as 2003.
While de-equitization has been around a while, it gathered pace during the period of near-zero rates when rock-bottom capital costs led companies to tap debt markets instead of selling equity. 
They also had a powerful incentive to prioritize buybacks over investment, with further impetus coming from U.S. tax cuts.
Buckland estimates the U.S. equity pool is shrinking at roughly 1.5 percent annually, adding that even in emerging markets, ""places where you would expect to be raising equity capital, it's slowed down to a crawl.""
True, central banks, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, are drawing a line under the easy-money era. But to meaningfully dent de-equitization, ten-year U.S. yields would need to rise to 4-5 percent, with corporate borrowing costs above 6 percent -- 200 bps above current levels, estimates JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.
For now though, Fed rate hikes are lifting short-term bond yields, while 10-year yields, the main borrowing reference rate, remain stuck near 3 percent, Panigirtzoglou noted.
Equity shrinkage is most pronounced in the United States, where, according to JPMorgan, net supply reduction in 2018 could be double last year's $200 billion. 
Laurent Godin, senior equity analyst at wealth manager Indosuez, cites University of Chicago data showing U.S. share listings in the 2009-2017 period averaged 180 annually, from 680 in 1995-2000. There were around 3,600 New York-listed firms last year, versus 7,500 in 1997, he noted.
Even in Frankfurt and London, the number of listed firms shrank by 45 percent and 20 percent respectively between 2003 and 2018, Indosuez notes.

TRILLION DOLLARS
Higher borrowing costs may not bring big equity listings back into vogue.
One reason is private equity. The past decade and a half witnessed huge deals that delisted companies such as Dell Computers and Hilton Hotels, often following takeover by private equity firms. 
Having boomed during the years of ultra-cheap money, these firms are estimated to still have some $1 trillion available to companies which want to avoid going public.
""As long as you have access to cheap financing from private equity, companies would prefer to stay private,"" Godin said. ""In the foreseeable future I don't see that changing.""
The evolving nature of business and society is also a powerful de-equitization driver. New multinationals are less capital-intensive than the manufacturing giants of yesteryear -- a firm like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) needs less money to start and expand than one producing heavy machinery or cement.
Other pioneers such as room-booking service AirBnb and ride-hailing app Uber rely on tech to utilize existing capital stock -- cars or flats -- instead of building hotels or factories.

DILEMMA
Not everyone buys the argument of dying equity markets. Some see de-equitization as reflecting the top of the economic cycle which is usually followed by another period of expansion. 
What's more, rumors of the death of equity have been greatly exaggerated in the past, though the worry this time is about supply of shares, rather than demand. 
Citi's Buckland recommends buying U.S. stocks as share count there shrinks. Indeed, U.S. stocks have dominated as fund managers' favorites this year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly polls show. 
But as growing global wealth continues to channel savings into investment funds, the risks are of inflated valuations and markets that defy gravity.
""I would hold tight and realize...maybe the strength in the market doesn't necessarily reflect the ongoing strength of economies and business,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 12:43PM ET</span>","Brexit and Brazil to test Orcel's skills at Santander, M&A in focus","By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Britain's looming exit from the EU and political uncertainty in Brazil will test the management skills of Santander's (MC:SAN) new chief executive Andrea Orcel while fellow bankers say his appointment is a sign the bank could go on an acquisition spree.
Orcel, who had headed the investment banking business of Switzerland's UBS Group (S:UBSG) since 2014, was named on Tuesday as the new CEO of the euro zone's biggest lender.
The management restructuring comes at a sensitive time for the Spanish bank with two of its three main markets - Britain and Brazil - in focus and with its shares down 20 percent in the last year.
A new strategic plan that  Banco Santander  had planned to unveil by the end of this year has been delayed until next February because Santander said it needed more time due to the uncertainty stemming from Brexit and next month's presidential election in Brazil.
The chairman of Banco Santander, Ana Botin, said on Wednesday Orcel's appointment did not signal a strategy change, and he would focus on growing Santander's business organically.
""There has been speculation that he comes to overhaul our strategy. But we are already clear on what our strategy is. We will remain the bank we are, a commercial bank operating in 10 countries,"" Botin told journalists at an event in Madrid. 
The bank, which made more than half a dozen high-profile deals in the 1990s and 2000s to grow from a regional Spanish lender to a global bank, is now putting the emphasis on better service and customer loyalty.
While Orcel is mostly known for his investment banking skills, which he used to advise Santander at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and UBS for two decades, the Italian also has a strong track record at the top of a global bank.
""Orcel is known for being a tough and an effective manager and was credited for turning UBS around. He is seen as a very aggressive manager and very demanding of his own employees,"" a London-based investment banker close to Orcel said.
A banker close to Orcel said he had almost become the ""unofficial CEO"" of UBS but his working relationship with its current CEO Sergio Ermotti had become difficult.
M&A?
Other bankers believe he will guide Santander toward a new phase of acquisitions.
""If you bring in an investment banker such as Orcel you don't want to be wasting his advising skills,"" a top Madrid banker said on condition of anonymity.
""Prior to his appointment, the bank counted on him as an external adviser, now he will be advising from within the bank,"" the banker said. 
Orcel, who had been a member of UBS's executive board since 2012, advised Santander on the deals it made in Britain, including the acquisition of Abbey National and Alliance & Leicester.
He was also behind the three-way purchase of ABN Amro by RBS (LON:RBS), Fortis and Banco Santander and worked on Santander's acquisition of Sovereign in the United States, where the Federal Reserve recently lifted a ban on acquisitions from next year, paving the way for a more effective capital allocation.

The banker close to Orcel said that he could even try to gatecrash Unicredit's (MI:CRDI) attempted merger with  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and look into a potential acquisition of the Italian bank.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>",Merck's Frazier to remain CEO of the U.S. drugmaker beyond 2019,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier will remain in the role beyond 2019, the drugmaker said on Wednesday, after it scrapped a policy requiring its CEOs to retire at the age of 65.
Frazier, who will turn 65 in December 2019, took the helm of the U.S. pharmaceutical company in 2011. On his watch, the company's stock price has doubled and its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda has raked in blockbuster sales, becoming one of the leading products in a new generation of oncology treatments.
""CEO succession has been our top priority, and removing the mandatory retirement policy enables the Board to make the best decision concerning the timing of that transition,"" Merck's lead director Leslie Brun said in a statement.
Frazier made headlines last year when he became the first business leader to leave U.S. President Donald Trump's now disbanded manufacturing council following Trump's comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.
The grandson of a sharecropper, and son of a janitor, Frazier's appointment to CEO in 2011 made him the only black person leading one of the major U.S. or European drugmakers.
Frazier made his name at Merck as the company's general counsel, steering the company through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks.
Merck eventually paid nearly $5 billion to settle some 27,000 lawsuits brought by those who claimed to have been harmed by the popular arthritis treatment.
As chief executive, Frazier has focused the company around the development Keytruda, which has racked up approvals to treat numerous types of cancer, including lung cancer. Analysts expect annual Keytruda sales to reach nearly $11 billion by 2020 and keep climbing from there, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Under Frazier, Merck also announced price cuts for some of its medicines in July, including a 60 percent reduction on a hepatitis C treatment, after Trump criticized drugmakers for failing to help reduce healthcare costs for consumers.

Merck's shares were up 21 cents at $70.86 on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May was reminded of how worried businesses are about Brexit on Wednesday when a rallying speech to executives in New York was met with a single stark question from the floor - just how bad can things get? 
May assured her audience that Britain would flourish after Brexit and remain an attractive place to invest, seeking to ease concerns about the country's future after it leaves the European Union next March.
She said she was confident that Britain would be able to achieve a good deal with the EU over its future trading relationship.
But in a question and answer session following her speech, Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of private equity firm Blackstone Group (N:BX), asked May to confront the downside risks to Britain's EU exit.
""I guess we are believers,"" said Schwarzman whose firm was part of a joint venture that agreed to buy up the commercial property portfolio of Britain's rail network owner for $1.9 billion.
""But on the other side, things could really go off with a bad Brexit and ultimately a change of government. What we really worry about is how bad things can get?""
In response, May said: ""I absolutely appreciate and understand from that – you're making decisions and looking ahead to what the future holds. And at the moment there is that uncertainty about what the future will hold in terms of Brexit.""
She pledged Britain would make a success of Brexit whatever the outcome of negotiations. 
Earlier,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) boss Ginni Rometty asked May on stage how she suggested businesses should manage the risks of Brexit.
""If you were us ... what would you do in our shoes to be planning right now. What would you do now to balance that risk?"" 
PRO-BUSINESS 
May's Brexit proposals were savaged by EU leaders at a summit last week and many in her own party have criticized her approach, raising prospects that she will fail to strike any agreement and that Britain could leave without a deal, something business leaders fear would be hugely damaging.
""We're at the point of the negotiations where we've got a few weeks to go,"" May said. ""We don't know where the negotiations will end. I'm confident about getting a deal but we have to make sure we’re prepared for any eventuality.""
In her speech, May said she would not abandon her current Brexit plan, shrugging off criticism at home and in Brussels.
She said her proposal to keep a close trading relationship with the EU on goods, protect manufacturing jobs and resolve arguments over the borders of Northern Ireland, while ending unrestricted immigration from the EU, was the only way forward.
However, with many of her own lawmakers and the opposition Labour Party saying they will vote against such a deal in parliament, there are major doubts over the final outcome of negotiations and May's long term future as leader.
In her speech, May promised that businesses investing in Britain would get the lowest rate of corporation tax among the G20 group of leading economies, with access to service industries and a financial center in London ""that are the envy of the world"".
She pledged to deliver an economy that is ""knowledge-rich, highly innovative, highly skilled and high quality but with low tax and smart regulation"" and said a new immigration system would allow businesses to attract the brightest and best.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",EU orders Ryanair to meet European rules on local contracts,"By Daphne Psaledakis and Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission ordered Ryanair (I:RYA) on Wednesday to respect EU rules by giving workers contracts in the country they live rather than in Ireland where its planes are registered.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has traditionally employed a significant proportion of its staff under Irish law, which unions say inconveniences staff and impedes them from accessing local social security benefits. 
After a meeting with European Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the demand was ""irrelevant"" as the company had already written to unions in all EU countries offering to move staff to local contracts. 
Since announcing in December last year it would recognize trade unions for the first time in its 30-year history, Ryanair has accelerated a shift from Irish to local contracts as part of recognition talks with various unions. 
But the unions have held a series of strikes in recent months, citing disagreements over terms, including in several cases the question of local contracts. 
Ryanair has canceled 150 flights on Friday due to the latest strike, by cabin crews in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
At a meeting in Brussels, Commissioner Thyssen told O'Leary that EU rules on employment for mobile air crews were clear - based not on the flag of the aircraft, but the place where workers left in the morning and returned in the evening.
""Respecting the law is not something over which workers should have to negotiate and not something that can be postponed to a later date,"" Thyssen said in a statement.
In response, Ryanair published the terms of its offer to staff, including an offer of local contracts. 
""The issue of applicable law is irrelevant in Ryanair’s case since Ryanair has already written to the unions in Belgium (and all other EU countries) offering to agree the implementation of local (Belgium) law, social taxes and court jurisdiction by agreement with the national unions,"" O'Leary said in a statement. 
Belgian union CNE said the airline had agreed to follow local employment law, but only from March 2020 and that this change would only affect about half of its workers. 
COMPETITION COMPLAINT
Ryanair on Wednesday also said it had submitted a complaint to the European Commission citing ""anti-competitive behaviors"" over the fact that employees of other airlines were involved in calling strikes in several countries across Europe.
It called on the Commision to investigate the ""collective campaign,"" which it said included the European Cockpit Association and the International Transport Workers' Federation.
""Ryanair’s business is being damaged by unnecessary strikes and disruptive interference in our bona fide union negotiations, promoted and coordinated by competitor airline employees, their unions and lobby groups,"" the airline said in a statement. 
Unions have said union members from other airlines have been assisting Ryanair staff due to the fact that they have a number of years of experience in dealing with union negotiations while most Ryanair staff have very little. 

Ryanair's share price was up 0.5 percent at 1355 GMT on Wednesday at 13.06 euros, but down 17 percent compared with three months ago, since when it has faced repeated strikes and an increase in the oil price.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>",Ford expands partnership talks with VW and Mahindra to cut costs,"By Ben Klayman
DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - With its stock trading near a 6-year low late last month,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) CEO Jim Hackett gathered the automaker's top 300 executives near its headquarters in Michigan for a global leadership meeting. 
Hackett's message: Ford must put in motion plans to restructure its business now in order to secure promised costs savings, Ford executives present at the meeting said.
""We have clarity of purpose and now it's time to take action,"" Hackett told Reuters in an interview.
A key part of that plan to save money calls for Ford to deepen partnerships with other automakers around the world to share factory floor capacity and develop vehicles together, Ford executives told Reuters.
Specifically, they said Ford is engaged in talks with Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and India's Mahindra (NS:MAHM) about expanding product and technology alliances.
With Volkswagen, discussions are focused on how to expand a commercial vehicle tie-up they previously announced to include collaboration in South America and Europe - where Ford is losing money - and co-develop other types of vehicles, according to a Volkswagen executive and two sources familiar with Ford's thinking who asked not to be identified. 
Pablo Di Si, chief executive for Volkswagen in Latin America, told Reuters the companies are studying a partnership in Brazil and the talks are ""advancing positively,"" although he did not expect an announcement until 2019. 
A VW spokesman declined further comment on the alliance discussions. 
An expanded alliance would give Volkswagen access to some of Ford's most profitable vehicles, including the Transit commercial vans and Ranger compact pickup trucks, said the two sources. VW could also help Ford strengthen its money-losing South American and European operations by combining vehicle production in those markets, the sources said.
Separately, product sharing talks are underway with Mahindra & Mahindra, including using the Indian automaker as a benchmark to bring down supplier costs in the region, two other people familiar with Mahindra's plans said. The first vehicle from the platform they are jointly developing will likely be launched in 2020, they added.
A spokesman for Mahindra did not respond to a request for comment.
The twin efforts are meant to help remake Ford in conjunction with the $11 billion restructuring it outlined for the next three to five years. Ford needs to improve profitability because it is investing billions of dollars to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, and gearing up for a major roll out of products over the next two years.
Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2xKteeb
Hackett, who recently spoke with the heads of Volkswagen and Mahindra, told Reuters the alliance talks are going well and hold a lot of promise for Ford. He declined to comment on specific deal structures being discussed or locations, however.
Broader product and cost-sharing deals with Volkswagen and Mahindra could allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to reduce the number of different vehicles it builds and shrink engineering and purchasing costs, Ford executives said. 
Fewer vehicle architectures, combined with increased numbers of electric vehicles, would also help Ford reduce the number of plants and employees it needs for that work over the next several years, according to the two sources familiar with Ford's thinking. 
The moves are aimed to help Ford hit its goal of doubling global pre-tax profit margins to 8 percent by 2020, up from 4.3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
Hackett remains under pressure to show results. The stock is down about 24 percent this year. 
""Hackett's job really is to cut the costs,"" said Edgar Wachenheim III, chairman of Greenhaven Associates, which is Ford's ninth largest investor with almost 33 million shares at the end of June. ""You have this possibility that Hackett can eliminate the $4.5 billion of losses (in its weaker operations) that were there in 2017 and the earnings will shoot up.""
The capital demands currently in the industry have never been greater, Ford executive vice president Joe Hinrichs told Reuters at the company's headquarters outside Detroit. 
""A big opportunity is around leveraging other people's strengths,"" Hinrichs, who is president of global operations, said of the alliances. ""There's a lot of opportunity to share capital, share engineering resources.""
Ford and Volkswagen said in June they were discussing whether to jointly develop and build a range of commercial vehicles, including vans. The commercial vehicle deal is a ""quick win"" and more will follow with VW, said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's executive vice president in charge of Ford's product development. 
""If you look on paper, we complement each other really well,"" he said of Ford and Volkswagen. ""There's opportunities for some synergies without us stepping on each other.""
Alliances also offer automakers the chance to share the costs, Hinrichs said.
""Everyone wants higher capacity utilization, but they want someone else to come to their capacity, and so we have to work through that,"" he said.
In Europe, Ford's Mondeo sedan and S-Max, C-Max and Galaxy minivans are set to be phased out when they reach the end of their product lives over the next several years, two other people close to the company said. That will ultimately lead to capacity cuts and job losses at assembly plants in Valencia, Spain and Saarlouis, Germany, the sources said.
The level of optimism at the annual leadership meeting last month about Ford's transformation was high, and now those executives want to get the message out more broadly to employees, according to Ford's Thai-Tang. 

""We have the right plan,"" he said. ""We now have to go execute and execute quickly.""

688,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Danske Bank whistleblower was former Baltics trading head: Denmark's Berlingske,"By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The internal whistleblower who helped reveal alleged money laundering at Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) Estonian branch was Howard Wilkinson, a former head of its trading business in the Baltics, Danish newspaper Berlingske reported on Wednesday.
Berlingske, which has published a series of revelations in the developing  Danske Bank  scandal, said Wilkinson, a Briton who was head of the bank's Danske Markets trading unit in the Baltics from 2007 to 2014, had confirmed his role in an email to the newspaper after he was named by Estonian media.
Danske Bank's CEO resigned last week after an inquiry revealed that 200 billion euros ($235 billion) of payments, many of which the bank said were suspicious, had been moved through its Estonian branch over a period of eight years.
""I can confirm that I worked as Head of Markets in the Baltics based in Tallinn from 2007 until my last working day in April 2014, just four months after my first whistleblower report to the top management in Copenhagen,"" the newspaper reported Wilkinson as saying in the email.
Reuters has been unable to contact Wilkinson, while Danske Bank declined to comment on Wednesday. 
Wilkinson warned Danske Bank's executive board in Copenhagen in 2013 and 2014 about suspicious activities at the Estonian branch, Berlingske, which said it has been in contact with him for months, reported. 
In Danske Bank's own report published last week it said the first whistleblower report was sent to its executive board, group compliance and internal auditor on Dec. 27, 2013 with the title ""Whistleblowing disclosure – knowingly dealing with criminals in Estonia Branch"".
SHOCKWAVES
The Danish state prosecutor for financial crime, which last month started its own inquiry into Danske Bank, said it was natural for it to speak with witnesses but declined to say whether this included Wilkinson.
The Danish FSA, which has also reopened an investigation of Danske, said it could not immediately comment.
""We know the whistleblower and the person has also helped us,"" a spokeswoman for the Estonian FSA said. She did not confirm the whistleblower's name.
Danske Bank's growing scandal led Denmark to bolster its defences against shocks to its financial system on Tuesday after a risk-assessment body said the sector's stability could be threatened by the money laundering affair.
The case, which has triggered regulatory, political and financial shockwaves, is a risk for Denmark's entire financial sector, the Systemic Risk Council, which monitors threats to the stability of the country's financial system, said.

Danish lawmakers have asked the bank's management to explain their actions at an open hearing, although it has yet to decide whether it will participate as it is not obliged to do so.

691,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 09:48AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank CFO denies it had internal talks about a merger with Swiss giant UBS — and calls such reports 'fictions of the press',"""We are constantly amazed at what passes through the editorial filters and gets into the press,"" von Moltke said,  according to a report from Reuters, adding that any numerous reports of possible mergers by the bank were ""fictions of the press.""
Both Deutsche Bank's press office had previously declined to comment.
Von Moltke's comments come after  a report from German newspaper Handelsblatt on Wednesday that senior Deutsche Bank staff discussed the possibility for a tie-up with UBS — which would combine the biggest lenders in Germany and Switzerland — at a strategy meeting earlier in September.
The discussions were part of a meeting in which the bank's supervisory board also discussed a long-vaunted merger with Commerzbank, Germany's second-biggest bank and one of Deutsche Bank's key domestic rivals.
Speculation that Deutsche Bank may merge with Commerzbank, its German rival, has swirled for years in the market, but neither side has commented. Bloomberg reported in June that Deutsche Bank's board spoke with shareholders and the government privately about a potential deal.
However, Handelsblatt says, executives were keen to stress that a merger with UBS would make more sense and be a better match. ""Deutsche Bank and UBS would complement each other well with their different strengths in investment banking and asset management,"" Handelsblatt said, citing insiders at the bank.
While Deutsche Bank's supervisory board discussed a potential tie-up, there is no indication that any talks have started between the two banks, or even that Deutsche Bank is actually planning an approach to UBS.
UBS declined to comment on Handelsblatt's report.
The report is the latest in long list of rumours about possible partners or targets for Germany's largest bank. In July, for example, the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche reported that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China could be interested buying a stake, citing unnamed sources in German regional government. JPMorgan denied that report.
Reports of discussions about a merger with UBS come just months after the ousting of Deutsche Bank's CEO John Cryan earlier in the year. Cryan was replaced by long-serving bank insider Christian Sewing in April.
Soon after his appointment, Sewing announced plans to scale back US operations and cut jobs.
Speculation about a merger with another institution in part reflect the numerous troubled patches the bank has encountered in recent years. These include:
Sewing has previously indicated publicly that Deutsche Bank would be willing to explore a merger, but only after the bank is profitable again. 
""We have a very clear plan to remain a global bank, but we have to work on profitability now,"" Sewing said at an event in Berlin on Monday.
""If that happens, we can talk about other things."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) is expanding the reach and funding of a group established to promote women working inside the bank to also help female clients, including entrepreneurs and individuals.
The bank said on Wednesday that it is backing the group with a full-time director and resources to promote savings by women and $10 billion of loans to women-owned businesses.
The group, which grew out of a networking and career advancement effort started in 2013, on Wednesday held its third annual ""Leadership Day"" by expanding the conference to 2,000 people at Radio City Music Hall from 300 employees in a room at JPMorgan headquarters.
""We are going to continue to focus on employees to make sure we have more women in senior positions, but the extension is around clients and providing access to capital,"" Samantha Saperstein, the JPMorgan managing director of the group, Women on the Move, said in an interview.
The move comes as a number of big banks have publicized their aspirations to have more women executives. In August,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said it aims to lift its share of women in mid- and senior-level executive positions to 40 percent by 2021 from the current 37 percent.
In March,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) said it was committed to having women account for 50 percent of employees globally ""over time."" 
Goldman does not disclose the current global percentage, but in the United States women make up 22 percent of executives and senior managers and 38 percent of total employees.
Studies by university scholars and by management consultants have shown that the financial performance of firms tends to be better if they have more women in top management. One reason is believed to be the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comes from a more heterogeneous pool of executives.
David Gaddis Ross, a professor at the University of Florida who has studied the issue, said in an interview that the increased attention for women from Wall Street likely reflects competition for a new generation of finance graduates who would rather work for firms that embrace diversity.

JPMorgan's conference was to include talks by the five women who are on the 11-member JPMorgan Operating Committee, and interviews with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) CEO Adena Friedman and Girlboss Media CEO founder Sophia Amoruso.

NAIROBI (Reuters) -  Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H) plans to more than double its hotels in Africa by 2020 to capitalize on improved travel links and robust economic growth that is boosting demand for rooms, the company's regional vice president said on Wednesday.
Hyatt currently has nine hotels in Africa but lags far behind rivals such as AccorHotels (PA:ACCP), which has more than 100 hotels in Africa and has earmarked $1 billion to invest in expansion on the continent.
Another rival Radisson has 86 hotels and almost 18,000 rooms in operation and under development after rapid Africa expansion. A senior Radisson executive for Africa told Reuters last year it planned to have 120 hotels by 2021. 
""We are more than doubling our presence on the continent by 2020,"" Kurt Straub, Hyatt's vice president of operations for Middle East and Africa, told Reuters.
""Air travel has improved tremendously, it has become much more open, people are freer to travel. Hyatt is very keen to go where our customers want to go,"" said Straub, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Nairobi to announce the opening of Hyatt's first hotel in Kenya in 2020. 
Chicago-headquartered Hyatt's existing hotels in Africa include one in Senegal and South Africa, where it has the luxury Hyatt Regency brand in Johannesburg.
Straub said the new hotels would include a Hyatt Regency in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and another in Arusha, a northern Tanzanian city popular with holiday-makers and conference organizers.
The Hyatt hotel in Nairobi will have 233 rooms, including some under the Hyatt Place brand, aimed at shorter stays, and 60 Hyatt House apartment style suites for longer stays.
Straub did not say how much Hyatt was investing in the project, which is a partnership with a local company, only saying it was a ""sizeable investment"".
""We are very careful in how we grow. We don't want to grow for the sake of growing,"" said the 25-year Hyatt veteran, who took over his Dubai-based job in February.
""It is not about the quantity, it is about being in the right place at the right time with the right partner.""
Other big international hotel groups, including Radisson, Kempinski and Marriott, are estimated to have about a third of the available room capacity on the continent. The rest are independently-run hotels.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Deal-making spree keeps investors upbeat about European M&A revival,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - The $40 billion takeover of British broadcaster Sky (L:SKYB) and other new deals in Europe have broken a summer lull to bolster investor optimism over an M&A revival in the region.
Europe has not traditionally been the preferred destination for M&A investors, but 2018 started with a boom that saw activist campaigns targeting big names from food group Nestle (S:NESN) to miner BHP Billiton (L:BLT) and paints maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO). 
In the last three months, however, the value of transactions more than halved as trade war concerns and political worries gripped markets and M&A bankers waited on the sidelines.
But this week's Sky takeover, a merger involving miner  Randgold Resources  (L:RRS) and the acquisition of Italian fashion house Versace showed that M&A in Europe is anything but dead and could help drive positive share price performance. Philippe Ferreira, cross-asset strategist at Paris-based Lyxor, which oversees some $165 billion of assets, said he was ""constructive"" over the outlook for European M&A. 
""Even if volumes have come down a bit, activity remains buoyant and is likely to remain so,"" he said, mentioning Sky and drugmaker  Shire  (L:SHP) in the UK and pointing to Germany and Switzerland as other regions where large deals are in the pipeline. 
Sky shot up 8 percent after the deal with Comcast (O:CMCSA) was announced and Randgold added 6 percent after saying it would be taken over by Barrick Gold (TO:ABX) in a deal that Bernstein analysts say could signal the start of renewed consolidation in the mining industry.
Shire is being acquired for $62 billion by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502), the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company.
Dealogic data show the value of deals in Europe more than halved to $182 billion in the third quarter so far from the previous quarter, sliding below year-ago levels. U.S. deals fell at a smaller pace and remained above year-ago levels. That has fueled some pessimism about whether the early boom in M&A would continue. 
""A lot of deals aren't happening,"" said a London-based trader, focused on special situations. He cited the lack of any big banking merger and no move by U.S. tech giant Amazon to buy a cheap retailer despite continued speculation. 
On Wednesday,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) dismissed speculation that it might seek a merger as ""fictions"", while the Telegraph reported that Amazon (O:AMZN) made preliminary approaches for online food delivery company Deliveroo that had made no progress.
BUMPER YEAR 
Still the year is set to be a bumper one and dealmaking activity could get a further boost if concerns that the U.S.-Sino trade war could damage Europe's export-oriented economy ease. A softening of political risk would also help, investors said. 
""We continue to expect M&A as a big driver for European equity markets. A lot of companies have cash and big balance sheets but the problem is it's difficult to announce a big deal in this market which has a lack of visibility,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Roland Kaloyan. 
""If we see some better newsflow coming on the political side and the macro side, that will be a strong catalyst to see more deals,"" he added. 
With nearly $1 trillion worth of deals, European M&A is on track for its strongest year since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, tracking global dealmaking. An unprecedented record of mega-deals, of which Sky is one, however, has lifted Europe's share of deal values to almost 30 percent, the strongest since 2012.
Investor sentiment this month was buoyed by hopes that the United States and China could resume talks on trade, while worries over a no-deal Brexit and the Italian budget eased.
A trader at a European bank however said some investors are wary of acquisitions that could hit share prices. The takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) has cost Bayer (DE:BAYGn) 18 billion euros of market value so far, but that may be an exception. 
According to a study by Cass Business School for investment adviser Willis Towers Watson, shares in European acquirers have bucked a negative global trend by outperforming their regional index by 2.8 percentage points this quarter. 
Over a one-year period, the outperformance was 6.2 percentage points, against a 3 percentage point underperformance worldwide, the study published on Monday showed. Possible picks range across different sectors. 
Among the stocks that U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) believes are well placed to play the revival in European M&A are retailer  Kingfisher  (L:KGF), electrical parts supplier  Rexel  (PA:RXL), hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and telecoms infrastructure supplier Nokia (HE:NOKIA). Their break-up candidates include engineer ABB (S:ABBN), miner  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and car maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). 
Lyxor's Ferreira said his outlook had not changed much this year and that interest from foreign investors in M&A in Europe had grown and that could support the market. 

""We talk with several funds investing in M&A and they are pretty much satisfied with the returns they got on European M&A,"" he said.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 08:16AM ET</span>","Daimler names R&D head as next CEO, Zetsche to become chairman","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) named research chief Ola Kaellenius as its next CEO on Wednesday in a succession plan that promotes a raft of tech-savvy managers at its Mercedes-Benz car brand and also seeks to install long-serving CEO Dieter Zetsche as chairman.
The German automaker said the plan would provide certainty on future leadership at a time of upheaval in the car industry, though some commentators questioned an arrangement they said could leave Zetsche as a back-seat driver.
Daimler said the 49-year-old Kaellenius would become chief executive in 2019 and the 65-year-old Zetsche would, if shareholders approve, become chairman of the supervisory board in 2021, following a standard two-year cooling off period.
The elevation of Kaellenius, a Swede who often wears jeans and sneakers and attends tech conferences, marks the first time the 132-year-old Stuttgart-based inventor of the modern automobile will be headed by a non-German CEO without an educational background rooted in mechanical engineering. 
Currently Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development, Kaellenius has helped Zetsche prepare for a new era of developing electric and self-driving cars at a time when Germany's auto industry faces competition from new rivals like Waymo, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Byton and Nio emerging from the technology sector. 
""With Dieter Zetsche’s intended appointment as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, we are ensuring continuity for the sustained success of Daimler AG,"" Daimler's current chairman Manfred Bischoff said in a statement. 
""In Ola Kaellenius, we are appointing a recognized, internationally experienced and successful Daimler executive."" 
GRAPHIC: German car stocks since 2006 - https://reut.rs/2N1ku84
CLARITY ON SUCCESSION
Zetsche, with his distinctive white moustache, took the helm at Daimler in 2006 and oversaw the launch of a string of new models that helped Mercedes to eventually overtake German rivals BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi (DE:NSUG) to become the world's biggest premium carmaker by sales in 2016. 
Kaellenius joined the company as a trainee in 1993. With a qualification in finance and accounting from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland and international management from the Stockholm School of Economics, Kaellenius has worked to introduce Silicon Valley management techniques at the carmaker.
Together with Zetsche he oversaw an effort to sweep away layers of bureaucracy and encourage a more experimental approach to new products, changing a culture often stymied in strict hierarchies and meticulous planning.
A major change at Daimler is to empower low level employees to generate business ideas and to allow departments to fund an idea even if it is not clear what products will result from the spending. Having a perfect ""specification sheet"" used to be a precondition for any investment.
Daimler said Zetsche would step down from his positions on Daimler's management board and as head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, effective at the end of the annual shareholders' meeting on May 22, 2019, and Kaellenius, would then be appointed as CEO.
""It is good that Daimler is providing clarity on the succession issue early on,"" said Ingo Speich a fund manager at Union Investment. 
Daimler said two strategy and technology executives would also take over roles previously held by experts in mechanical engineering. Wilko Stark, until now head of Daimler Strategy and planning, will become Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars Procurement and Supplier Quality on Oct. 1.
Sajjad Khan, currently Head of Digital Vehicle & Mobility, will take over management of Daimler's connected autonomous shared electric (CASE) and Electric Vehicle Architecture (EVA) organization.

Markus Schaefer, currently head of Production and Supply Chain Management, who has transformed Daimler's Mercedes factories by linking them up digitally, will succeed Kaellenius as Head of Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development.

699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Danske Says It's Committed to Buybacks Amid Laundering Probe,"(Bloomberg) --  Danske Bank  A/S (CO:DANSKE) is pushing back against risks that Denmark’s financial supervisor will halt share buybacks after reopening an investigation into the laundering of billions of dollars in dirty money.
Denmark’s biggest bank plans to continue with its 10 billion-krone ($1.6 billion) buyback program, Morten Mosegaard, interim chief financial officer, said on Monday.
“We have no intention of calling that off,” Mosegaard said. “The money has already been deducted from our capital position at this point.”
Jesper Berg, the head of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, reopened an investigation into Danske last week, after the lender admitted that a large share of about $235 billion that flowed through an Estonian unit between 2007 and 2015 may have been laundered.
He says the FSA is considering all its options in connection with the investigation. A halt to share buybacks would only happen in the case of ""material issues"" with capital planning. He said Danske is well capitalized. Companies need FSA approval before initiating buyback programs.
Ramifications for Danske’s credit ratings
Since Danske released the results of its internal investigation on Sept. 19, ratings companies have cut their assessments.
Questions Raised
Danske is two-thirds of the way through its current buyback program, which was announced in February and is due to run into early 2019. As of Sept. 24, the bank had bought 31.8 million shares with a gross value of 6.6 billion kroner.
Questions around the feasibility of continuing the share buyback program repeatedly arose during a conference call with Danske’s management on Sept. 19. That was the day the bank released its internal report on the laundering scandal and announced the departure of Chief Executive Officer Thomas Borgen.
The FSA has already forced Danske to add almost $800 million to its capital burden, in connection with the laundering case. The Danish government says the bank may face a fine as high as $630 million in Denmark alone, while other countries are also looking into the scandal, including the U.S. and the U.K. Danske may face total fines as high as $1.7 billion, according to Handelsbanken.
For now, the bank hasn’t made any provisions to cover such penalties. Management says the roughly 1.5 billion kroner it earned at the Estonian unit at the center of the scandal has been earmarked for a “donation” to society, though no clear recipient has yet been identified.
The key question is whether the U.S. might weigh in, in which case the risk of hefty fines grows considerably. Danske said last week that it’s reviewed 15,000 customers against sanctions lists and has so far found no violations. But the bank hasn’t completed its review of non-resident customers at the Estonian branch, including matching them against suspicious counterparties. The probe got through 6,200 named customers and still has 8,800 to go.
That figure doesn’t include the beneficial owners of U.K. shell companies and the end clients of so-called intermediaries in Russia and former Soviet republics, whose names Danske routinely failed to record, according to its own report. These intermediaries were “unregulated and represented unknown end-customers,” the report said.
“The interesting thing is: who is behind the shell companies?” said Andreas Hakansson, an analyst at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). “Who is on the other side of the transactions? Who are the counterparties and who are the people behind the shell companies? That is still a major question which could determine how serious this is.”
Danske declined to comment on the question of sanctioned individuals or intermediaries.
“Last week we published a comprehensive report from the external law firm Bruun & Hjejle on the Estonian matter,” spokesman Kenni Leth said. “Due to ongoing investigations from the authorities, we are unable to comment on details of the report other than what have already been published or commented on at the investor call and the press conference.”

701,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Saudi Arabia, four other Gulf states to enter key JP Morgan bond indexes","By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and four other Gulf states will enter JP Morgan's emerging market government bond indexes next year, a move likely to lure billions of dollars of new foreign investment into their debt, according to a JP Morgan statement sent to investors.
The indexes are key performance benchmarks for international investors in emerging market debt, so membership can help a country sell bonds and reduce its borrowing costs.
Sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt issuers from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait - all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - will become eligible for the EMBI Global Diversified (EMBIGD), EMBI Global (EMBIG) and EURO-EMBIG indexes, according to the statement, seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
Their entry will be phased in between Jan. 31 and Sept. 30, 2019. Both conventional bonds and sukuk, or Islamic bonds, will be eligible for inclusion in indexes, but sukuk will need to have a credit rating from at least one of the three major rating agencies to be included.
Some regional bonds rose on the news, with higher gains on longer-dated debt. Saudi Arabia's $6.5 billion bonds maturing in 2046 were up 1.3 cents , Abu Dhabi's notes due in 2047  were up almost one cent and Bahrain's $900 million 2047 bonds  surged 1.5 cents.
JP Morgan's decision follows a surge in debt issuance from the Gulf Arab region in the past few years, as low oil prices force most countries to fund part of their state spending in the international debt markets.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar have issued a quarter of all new debt sold by emerging market countries in each of the last three years.
""GCC index inclusion is a timely recognition of the fact that issuance from the region represents over 15 percent of the stock of emerging market debt, and provides important diversification benefits,"" said Mohieddine Kronfol, chief investment officer of Global Sukuk and MENA Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Investments.
GCC bonds are likely to become more visible to international investors and the inclusion is expected to ""significantly increase the size of the investible emerging-market universe and allow investors to consider GCC bonds when they want to reduce risk in a flight to quality – potentially reducing the volatility of emerging market bond portfolio flows,"" he added.
The move will lead to a further big flow of foreign money into Saudi assets, after this year’s decision by MSCI and FTSE Russell to include its stock market in emerging market indexes, which is expected to draw about $40 billion into Saudi equities.
The inclusion of GCC countries in the bond indexes will leave them representing around 11.2 percent of JP Morgan's EMBI Global Diversified and EMBI Global series, the statement said.
""It is estimated that around $360 billion of assets under management are benchmarked against the EMBIG family, with the EMBIG diversified at around $300 billion,"" said Zeina Rizk, director of fixed income asset management at Arqaam Capital in Dubai.
Rizk estimated this would translate into about $30 billion of inflows into the five countries' debt. 
""Those inflows are not going to come on day one, but the tailwind resulting from the inclusion headline, coupled with pegged currencies, strong oil prices, a relative immunity from trade wars and high credit quality, leads us to the view that the GCC has better value than the rest of emerging markets.""
The minimum size for inclusion in the indexes is $500 million, and during the inclusion process, instruments will need to have a maturity date beyond March 2022, the statement said.
According to Jean-Michel Saliba, MENA economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Bahrain - the weakest credit in the region - is the biggest beneficiary among the Gulf states included.

""This will provide not only large flows as a percentage of debt outstanding, but is also likely to be crucial for future external financing needs,"" he said.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:51AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank dismisses merger reports as 'fictions',"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has dismissed speculation that it might seek a merger as ""fictions"", after media reports suggested Germany's biggest lender might seek tie ups with Switzerland's UBS or German peer Commerzbank.
Speculation about a possible merger has increased as Deutsche Bank battles to recover from three years of losses.
German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday that Germany's biggest bank had studied the effects of a theoretical tie-up with UBS (S:UBSG), citing unnamed sources.
The Handelsblatt report, the latest in the German financial press on the issue, said the UBS scenario and a potential merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) were discussed at Deutsche Bank's strategy meeting with the supervisory board this month.
Handelsblatt quoted an unnamed source as saying managers at the Deutsche Bank strategy meeting stressed that any immediate merger was ""completely unrealistic.""
Deutsche Bank Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke on Wednesday said recent merger reports were ""fictions of the press"", while UBS and Commerzbank declined to comment on Wednesday's Handelsblatt report.
""We are constantly amazed at what passes through the editorial filters and gets into the press,"" von Moltke said, adding that Deutsche Bank had a lot of work to do on the merger of its retail units, which would take several years.
Deutsche Bank's shares were down 0.9 percent midday, while UBS was down 0.8 percent. Commerzbank was up 0.3 percent. 
Media reports on Deutsche Bank's potential next steps have picked up since it changed its management and announced a strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank.
On paper, a potential merger with UBS would fare better than a deal with Commerzbank as Deutsche Bank and the Swiss lender would complement each other well in the areas of investment banking and wealth management, the Handelsblatt report said.
A merger with Commerzbank, in contrast, might lead to high restructuring costs due to a large overlap, the paper said.
Handelsblatt quoted an unnamed source as saying managers at the Deutsche Bank strategy meeting stressed that any immediate merger was ""completely unrealistic.""
Asked at a conference on Wednesday about the potential for a tie-up with a competitor, Deutsche Bank's chief executive Christian Sewing said he had ""said everything there is to say about it and I am working on my homework"".
The comment echoed statements earlier this week when he dampened speculation of a possible merger in the near term, saying the bank must focus on its homework for the next 18 months.
However, the German government, which owns more than 15 percent of Commerzbank, has also stoked merger speculation.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the country needs strong banks to foster exports. Some bankers privately regard that as a shift in sentiment and hints at a willingness to back the financial industry, including helping engineer a merger.

Under the merger scenario with UBS, Deutsche would be the junior partner, and the German government would have to accept that, Handelsblatt reported.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:48AM ET</span>",Cinemas and fast fashion: Reforms change Saudi shopping habits,"By Tom Arnold and Marwa Rashad
DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's malls and bazaars are changing as retailers embrace a shift in shopping habits brought about by reforms to diversify the economy away from oil.
Designer clothes stores and high-end chocolate and flower shops are shutting and fast-fashion, fast-food, budget stores and cinemas are moving in.
Cuts to electricity and petrol subsidies and a rise in VAT have eaten into household budgets and many are making savings by switching from luxury to budget goods.
At the same time, reforms to bring women into the work force and encourage entertainment has lifted other types of spending. The departure of thousands of foreign workers has hurt local bazaars and led to other changes.
The reforms are part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's push to wean the economy off oil. He wants to create 1.2 million jobs for Saudis by 2022, with many in the retail sector.
""People are opting for budget goods and reforms enabling the re-opening of cinemas, greater recreational activities, as well as women being allowed to drive, may mean there is a shift in how consumers are spending,"" said Jason Tuvey, an analyst at Capital Economics.
Saudi retail giants such as Fawaz Abdulaziz  Alhokair  Co (SE:4240) and Savola Group (SE:2050) are having to adapt.
“Retailers are reviewing their portfolios, be it products or stores, to reflect changing consumer patterns,"" said an executive of one major Saudi retailer.
Alhokair closed over 200 stores in the 12 months to end-June but it also added 70 to 80 stores over the same period. It plans to close a further 55 stores this financial year while adding another 60, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The shift is partly aimed at bringing more affordable brands to shopping malls, that source said. A spokesman for Alhokair did not respond to a request for comment.
The company has the Saudi license for the Zara fast-fashion chain, part of Spain's  Inditex  (MC:ITX) group, and plans to increase the number of stores to 45 by 2020 from around 30. It also opened the first Saudi branch of Inditex's affordable store Lefties last year.
One of Alhokair's businesses also recently secured a $1.9 billion loan to be used in part to build new malls. The company has not detailed how it will fill those malls, but bankers expect them to include more entertainment offerings, such as cinemas and restaurants, in addition to stores.
The kingdom lifted a nearly 40-year ban on cinemas earlier this year to create an entertainment sector from scratch.
MORE WOMEN WORKERS
Overall consumption, which accounts for about 40 percent of gross domestic product, has stayed robust, averaging 4 percent a year in the past five years, despite the reforms.
Consumer spending weakened at the start of this year as the utility price rises took effect but higher prices for oil exports left room in the budget for bonuses and one-off payments for lower income families and spending has picked up.
Most analysts expect growth to continue for the next few years, partly due to women entering the work force after a female driving ban was lifted in June. The pace of growth is expected to be weaker than in the past decade, however.
The changes are proving challenging for retailers. Alhokair is one of six of Saudi Arabia's 10 major retail firms which registered lower net profit in the quarter ending June 30. Five posted lower sales.
Food and retail conglomerate Savola Group (SE:2050) shut seven supermarkets and two other stores in the second quarter in a plan to reduce its retail selling space by 3.8 percent
But then in May it bought a majority stake in a frozen foods processing firm. Analysts have said that could reflect an anticipation of increased demand for frozen food if women abandon traditional homemaker roles to go to work.
BAKERY SALES DOWN
The departure of some 700,000 foreigners has also had an impact.
Almarai's (SE:2280) sliced bread sales were partly dented by the departure of expatriates. That helped drag down its second quarter bakery sales by 8 percent from the same period in 2017.
""There is a change taking place in this country and you cannot do change without pain,"" Georges Schorderet, CEO of major Saudi food producer Almarai (SE:2280) said on an earnings call last month.
""I'm not expecting a better business environment in the short to medium term.""
Businesses in Saudi Arabia's bazaars have taken a hit. In Riyadh's Batha bazaar, a popular shopping destination for Asian expatriates, business has slowed.
""Business was very good when I first came here. But now you spend days without a single customer buying anything,"" said 43-year-old Bilal, who runs a small eyewear and watch shop.
He said a lot of his customers were expatriates like him who are leaving Saudi Arabia. He will soon return to Bangladesh.
As of September, Saudis must make up 70 percent of the workforce in 12 retail areas including selling furniture, car spare parts, sweets, watches and eyeglasses.
The goal is to push more Saudis to work in a sector they have long shunned because of its perceived low pay but it may also mean extra training and recruitment costs for retailers.
L'azurde Company for Jewelry and Alhokair have said their operating costs could rise due to the ""Saudization"" of the sector.
The government also plans to ease restrictions on e-commerce, an area where Saudi Arabia trails other Gulf countries.
This could bring further change to the sector.

""The country’s young population, high connectivity rates and advanced infrastructure are projected to propel the growth of e-commerce sales over the next several years,"" said yStats.com, an e-commerce intelligence firm.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Preparing for a bear market with your adviser,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Douglas Boneparth will never forget the terrified financial planning clients he counseled after Lehman Brothers collapsed 10 years ago.
""There were emotional outbursts; there were some tears; there was anger,"" he recalls.
Boneparth was 24 and had just moved to New York City from Florida to start a financial planning job when Lehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and set off a panic in the markets. 
His job was to calm the firm’s clients, even though he had never met them previously: “I was at the center of the apocalypse.”
Now, a decade later, “people are always looking around the corner” for the next crisis, Boneparth said.
So Boneparth, like many advisers schooled in the financial disaster, does not ignore the underlying fear. He wades right in, bringing up worst-case scenarios even if clients do not.
It is a new era in financial advice. Although trust has improved since the crash, it is still an issue for half of people with advisers, a recent Cerulli Associates survey shows.
“Now advisers tell clients to anticipate the next down market, and they are willing to admit they can’t predict when things will go bad,” said Scott Smith, director of retail investors for Cerulli Associates. 
Here is what you should be talking about with your financial adviser to prepare for the next downturn.
RUN THE NUMBERS
Financial planner Jim Shagawat, of Paramus, New Jersey, shows a client what would happen to $1,250,000 in retirement money in the event of another sharp downturn. If that portfolio money were invested entirely in stocks, it would suffer a $663,000 loss at the worst point of a 53 percent decline - as severe as the 2008-09 financial crisis - leaving just $587,000. 
But Shagawat would not steer a client into an all-equities retirement portfolio. He proposes a modestly aggressive mixture of 56 percent stock funds and 44 percent bond funds and cash. The drop would instead be $441,000 if the loss matched the 35 percent decline of a balanced portfolio in the financial crisis.
Horrifying as that loss might be, many people still find it reassuring because it is based on one of the worst periods in stock market history and uses a significant weighting in bonds to mitigate the sting of stock losses. 
If investors are still scared, Shagawat uses Riskalyze software to show more conservative stock and bond mixtures. People can try on the combinations like outfits in a store dressing room before deciding.
NOT A ONE-TIME TOPIC
During the financial crisis, 57 percent of financial advisers moved clients into more conservative investments, according to Cerulli. If clients and their advisers had given extensive thought to worst-case scenarios before the crash, emergency changes probably would not have been needed. 
Of course, people can change emotionally and financially over time. For example, 40-year-olds can take on more risk than people in their 60s starting retirement. 
Financial planners should check with clients regularly at all ages to make sure they are still comfortable with their risks, said John Loper, managing director of professional practice for the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. 
Individuals wanting to benchmark their own investments by comparing them to averages designed for their age could use target date funds for a model. Be aware that some fund companies take substantial risks, while others do not. 
To find the average for your retirement date, see the asset class glide path on page 48 of Morningstar's report on the 2018 Target-Date Fund Landscape (https:// WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING The 2008 downturn sent a vivid message about risk to parents paying for college. Some 529 college savings plans designed for 19-year-olds had moderate stock holdings and lost almost 11 percent in 2008, according to Morningstar. Those for children 13 to 18, fell almost 19 percent.  That is why money you need quickly must get special attention. For example, Loper has a son in college and all the college savings are parked in cash so there is no chance of a loss as tuition bills arrive. Likewise, financial planners typically tell people to keep house downpayments and other savings that may be needed within five years in CDs, money market funds or savings accounts so there is no chance of a loss. Boston financial planner Chris Chen, even has retirees keep enough money parked in cash to cover living expenses for four years in case a bear market arrives.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:06AM ET</span>",Investors at Smith & Wesson parent support call for gun safety report,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors at American Outdoor Brands Corp (O:AOBC) approved a call for the gun maker to produce a safety report, officials said during its annual meeting on Tuesday, marking a second win for religious activist shareholders focused on firearms makers after a series of mass shootings in the United States.
The resolution, approved over the company's objections, asks its board to report by February on its efforts to monitor gun violence, to research and produce safer guns, and for an assessment of reputational and financial risks.
All nominated directors at the Springfield, Mass.-based company, the parent of Smith & Wesson, received a majority of votes cast, according to a preliminary vote tally given by an official during the webcast meeting. The support for all nominated directors came despite concerns from top proxy advisers. 
The gun safety study vote shows top investors worry that gun violence could adversely affect the company, said Colleen Scanlon, senior vice president for Catholic Health Initiatives, one of the co-filers of the resolution.
""Trying to think about how to make our products safer for civilian use seems like a very reasonable action for the company to consider,"" she said in a telephone interview after the meeting.
American Outdoor Chief Executive James Debney said during the meeting he was ""very disappointed"" that what he called a ""political agenda"" became part of the company's proxy process.
He said only 28 percent of the company's total shares outstanding supported the resolution, indicating many investors did not vote. 
American Outdoor's vice president for investor relations, Elizabeth Sharp, said the company would ""review the vote totals and consider our next steps accordingly.""
The vote for the safety report underscored the attention focused on the firearms industry and its financial backers. In May, religious investors also won a majority of votes for a similar safety report resolution at rival gun maker Sturm Ruger & Co. (N:RGR)
After a gunman wielding a Smith & Wesson assault-style rifle killed 17 students and teachers at a Florida high school in February, some banks restricted firearms lending, and asset managers including BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Vanguard Group said they would speak to gun makers about the safety of their products.

BlackRock and Vanguard, which together hold about 20 percent of American Outdoor's shares, did not immediately comment after the votes were disclosed, and had previously declined to comment.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 05:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Carmakers trigger Brexit contingency plans as 'no deal' fears grow,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Carmakers in Britain have triggered some Brexit contingency plans, such as certifying models in the EU, and are working on redrawing production schedules and stockpiling more parts to defend against any loss of unfettered trade after Brexit.
The moves are aimed at ensuring plants, which rely on the just-in-time delivery of tens of thousands of components, can keep operating after Brexit on March 29, but will add costs and bureaucracy which could risk their long-term viability.
London and Brussels hope to agree a deal by the end of the year to avoid tariffs and trade barriers, but Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals have been criticised by both Brexiteers, who want a cleaner break from the bloc, and the European Union.
McLaren Automotive is looking at having its cars certified by both a British and an EU agency to smooth sales. It is also planning to stockpile critical components and change shipments into the EU around Brexit if there is disruption.
""I will sell a little more in January and February and plan to pick the volume up in May and give us a leaner period through the change point,"" Chief Executive Mike Flewitt told Reuters.
BMW (DE:BMWG), which said last week it would move the annual summer-time shutdown of its British Mini plant next year to April, is looking for lorry parking areas and warehousing on both sides of the channel and is seeking to sign contracts to lease certain locations, a spokesman said.
It is also investing in IT systems to handle any new red tape as carmakers estimate tens of thousands of new documents could be needed if tariffs and customs are imposed.
The German carmaker's Brexit plans are costing millions of pounds, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
But Honda (T:7267), which builds 10 percent of Britain's 1.67 million cars at its Swindon plant in southern England, is not in the market to buy ""huge amounts of warehousing space"", its Europe boss Ian Howells told Reuters.
""It's been a very precise calculation or estimation of what components need to be brought in,"" he said, adding the firm could also alter its output to sell more into the EU at the start of next year.
WASTE OF MONEY?
Many British carmakers have also asked suppliers to look into how they would handle delays at ports, executives told Reuters, as thousands of parts, engines and finished models move between Britain and the continent every day.
At stake is Britain's car industry, which employs about 850,000 people and is one of its few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s.
European carmakers would also face significant disruption to their supply chains and a potential loss of competitiveness if imported cars face tariffs.
UK negotiators have cited the car industry as an example of where the EU would lose out if there are new barriers to trade, a source close to the matter told Reuters, particularly due to the high volumes of German cars sold in Britain.
Britain's Brexit ministry did not reply to a request for comment. German carmakers have also pushed their government to maintain the status quo on uninhibited trade, the source said.
While companies with factories in Britain face uncertainty over their production sites, so do major automakers that do not build any vehicles in Britain, not knowing how their access to Europe's second-biggest autos market might change.
More than 85 percent of cars sold in Britain are imported, with Germany's Volkswagen group (DE:VOWG_p), which only has a plant building Bentley models in Britain, being the top seller.
Ford (N:F), which builds engines but no cars in Britain, is the biggest-selling single brand in the country.
A transitional deal is meant to come into force after Brexit ensuring that little changes until the end of 2020, but that will not happen if talks break down, meaning firms are having to plan for all contingencies.
Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL], Britain's biggest carmaker, which has warned it does not know whether its plants will be able to operate in six months' time, is still weighing its options, such as whether to follow Mini in moving its factory shutdown periods to just after Brexit.
""We are planning for different scenarios whilst keeping our options open,"" a spokeswoman said. ""No final decisions have been taken at this stage.""
Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will secure a good deal for the sector.
McLaren could have its vehicles also approved by Germany's agency and Honda is obtaining licences in both Britain and the EU, which was not necessary before Brexit due to recognition of vehicle certification agencies across the bloc.
But executives also risk spending millions of pounds on strategies which in the end are not needed if Britain maintains free and unfettered trade.

""What you don't want to do is go spend a fortune and then find it's actually a complete waste of time,"" said Flewitt.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>","Anbang in talks to sell Japan real estate to Blackstone, other bidders: sources","By Junko Fujita and Kane Wu
TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd [ANBANG.UL] aims to sell $200 million worth of Japanese real estate to bidders including Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), about two years after buying them from the U.S. investment firm, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
The debt-laden Chinese insurer, which was taken under the government control in February after spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions in recent years, is selling a portion of its Japanese residential assets to shore up its balance sheet, the people said.
The assets on sale are part of the portfolio of apartment buildings Anbang bought from Blackstone for around $2.3 billion, in its first foray into Japan's real estate sector.
A spokesman for Anbang declined to provide immediate comment, while Blackstone declined to comment.
The divestment comes as Anbang, which also owns New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, is looking to offload $10 billion worth of overseas properties as part of a government-led restructuring effort.
China's government over the past year has sharpened its scrutiny of highly leveraged companies with overseas investments. Some conglomerates such as HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] and Dalian Wanda Group Co Ltd have recently sold foreign real estate to pay down debt.
Anbang's Japanese real estate portfolio is scattered in major cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, said the people, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified as the deal process was not yet public.
The insurer wants to first sell assets deemed less attractive - mainly due to their location and age - as Japan's property market rebounds from a slowdown spanning the last three decades, one of the people said.
Japan's average residential land price is falling but the pace of decline has slowed, showed a government survey released last week.
Some potential bidders including Blackstone want Anbang to add more attractive assets to the portfolio on sale, the people said. If more assets are added, the sale could fetch about $500 million, they said.
The identity of other likely bidders was not immediately known, but a separate person said they include Hong Kong-based private equity firms.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:56AM ET</span>",French bank BNP Paribas has no appetite for more big acquisitions,"PARIS (Reuters) -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) is not planning any major international acquisitions in 2019-2020, France's biggest listed bank said in a presentation on Wednesday, despite signs of possible big deals in the European banking sector.
""2019-2020: No appetite for further acquisitions,"" the bank wrote in a slide for an investor presentation at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML). 
The slide referred to the bank's international financial services division, in which it bundles all activities outside the euro zone plus a series of businesses within the region such as insurance, asset management and real estate.
Earlier this year, BNP Paribas increased its presence in Poland with the 775 million euros ($912 million) purchase of Raiffeisen Bank's (RBI) (VI:RBIV) main business in the European Union's largest eastern economy.
BNP Paribas added in its presentation it would focus instead on integrating earlier acquisitions, such as the Polish deal.
BNP Paribas' comments came as German business daily Handlesblatt reported  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had considered a theoretical merger with UBS (S:UBSG).
The scenario, along with a potential merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), was discussed at the bank's strategy meeting with the supervisory board earlier this month, Handelsblatt said.
Deutsche Bank, UBS and Commerzbank declined to comment on the report.
A fragmented European market and rising costs linked to tougher regulations, have fueled speculation banks may look to merge. 
BNP Paribas added in its presentation it was on track with its goal to boost value for its shareholders, and described the current backdrop as providing a ""good macroeconomic context"".
The bank also said the sale of a further 30 percent stake in First Hawaiian Bank in two tranches this summer brought a capital gain of 300 million euros that will be booked during the third quarter.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said on Wednesday an ""extremely low awareness"" of the seriousness of inspection standards and rules had led to improper measuring of exhaust emissions and fuel economy in vehicle models made in Japan. 
Nissan said in July that sample testing for emissions and fuel economy in final vehicle inspections at most of its factories in Japan did not meet domestic standards, the second case in less than a year where misconduct was found in its inspection process.
The Nissan case is the latest incident of data tampering which has tarnished Japan's manufacturing industry and its reputation for high-quality, efficient production.
Nissan, Japan's second largest automaker, said the breach of inspection standards was similar to a case last year, when the firm admitted that for decades uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in Japan.
""As a company - executives, managers to plant supervisors - Nissan had extremely low awareness of the gravity of violating (final vehicle inspection) standards and rules,"" Nissan said in a statement.
It blamed the misconduct on a shortage of final inspectors and a lack of oversight by plant managers, the automaker said, adding it also needed to do more training.
Nissan said there were improper inspections during sample testing of 1,205 vehicles, more than the 1,171 units the company had initially reported in July.
Other tests for horn volume, external vehicle noise and the aim of headlights were also conducted improperly, Nissan said.
The testing was for vehicles destined for the Japanese market and did not affect units exported overseas, the automaker has said.
Nissan said its sample tests would now be overseen by supervisors and managers. It also planned to boost the number of inspectors and revamp the computer software used to measure vehicle emissions.
Separately, Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) said on Wednesday it found that 6,438 vehicles had been improperly tested for emissions and fuel economy, slightly higher than what the company reported to the government in August.

Last month, Suzuki Motor, Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Yamaha Motor Co (T:7272) apologised for improper testing, but said they did not find significant problems with the actual emissions and fuel economy of their vehicles to be sold in Japan and did not plan any recalls.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:26AM ET</span>","Exclusive: With six months to go before Brexit, 630 finance jobs have left - Reuters survey","By Andrew MacAskill, Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - As few as 630 UK-based finance jobs have been shifted or created overseas with just six months to go before Brexit, a far lower total than banks said could move after Britain's surprise vote to leave the European Union, according to a new Reuters survey.
Many bankers and politicians predicted after the June 2016 referendum that leaving the EU would prompt a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London's position in global finance.
But as Brexit Day nears, the number of jobs that UK-based financial institutions say they expect to move in the event of a ""hard"" Brexit was around 5,800, just 500 more than the last survey in March, and with more firms responding. That compares to around 10,000 in the first survey in September 2017.
The results are based on answers from 134 of the biggest or most internationally-focused banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity firms and exchanges to a survey conducted by between Aug. 1 and Sept. 15.
Nearly all of those surveyed said they are moving as few people as possible, hoping for a last-minute political deal that protects access to the EU's $19.7 trillion-a-year economy after Britain leaves the bloc. 
The likelihood of a ""hard"" or ""no-deal"" Brexit has increased substantially since Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for maintaining ties with the EU has been rejected by Brussels as well as by many politicians in her own Conservative Party.
Many business chiefs fear Britain could be heading for a chaotic split that would spook financial markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond. Some politicians on both sides put the odds of talks collapsing at more than 50 percent.
The survey findings suggest London, which has been a critical artery for the flow of money around the world for centuries, is likely to remain the world's largest center of international finance. While New York is by some measures bigger, it is more centered on American markets, while London focuses on international trade.
Extreme forecasts for UK job losses in a hard Brexit scenario have ranged from about 30,000 roles, estimated by the Brussels-based Bruegel research group in February 2017, to as many as 232,000 by the London Stock Exchange in January 2017.
Iain Anderson, the executive chairman of Cicero, a public affairs company, which represents many finance companies, agreed with the survey findings that the impact of Brexit is likely to be much more modest than initially predicted.
Anderson said early estimates were made by executives in a period of unprecedented emotional turmoil following the vote.
""They have now moved through the five stages of grief,"" he told Reuters. 
BANKERS BLUFF?
Ninety-seven of the companies that responded said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, although only 63 specified numbers. The rest said it would have no impact, that they were still deciding what to do or they declined to comment.
HSBC, which has publicly said up to 1,000 jobs could move to Paris, has so far not moved any staff, a source at the bank told Reuters as part of the survey. Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), which expects to move 150 to Amsterdam, also has not moved any employees, an RBS source said. 
Many other large international banks said in the survey that although they have moved or hired a small number of staff in European cities, they are aiming to shift as few jobs as possible and will take decisions about staff redeployment over several years. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which has taken a new office in Frankfurt and plans to move 500 people to Europe, has only moved or hired about 100 so far. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which has publicly said up to 4,000 jobs could move, said recently in a staff memorandum it has only asked ""several dozen"" staff to move.
The 134 firms who responded to Reuters for this survey - against 119 who responded in March and 123 in September 2017 - employ the bulk of UK-based workers in international finance.
The respondents included the 20 investment banks that earned the most fees from investment banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters' data.
Some companies predicted the number of job moves will increase significantly over the next few months. For example, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) plans to move more than 100 staff to Paris early next year.
Many companies said they hoped to use a transition agreement already agreed in principle between the EU and Britain that would maintain the current level of access to the EU until the end of 2020. 
Over the longer term, they were counting on an internationally accepted banking mechanism to allow them to conduct trades in the EU through their existing bases in Britain. 
Richard Small, a financial regulation lawyer at Addleshaw Goddard, said companies probably exaggerated at first and lowered estimates on more careful consideration.
Companies are now focusing on ensuring they have the right infrastructure in place, including licenses and real estate, so that they can ramp up their operations if they have to. 
""They've got themselves in a place that they will be nimble and can scale up and down more quickly,"" he said.
Bankers said it is still too early to say what the long-term results of Brexit will be.
""The truth is no one wants to move anyone and it all depends on what happens with the negotiations,"" said one executive at a U.S. bank. 
""It could be lower. It could be higher. If you can tell me what will happen with the negotiations then I will be able to give you an accurate estimate of how many jobs will move.""

719,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Foreign airlines to face new rivals on popular China routes as restrictions ease,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign airlines that fly on 20 popular long-haul routes to China will face fresh competitive pressure as Beijing begins to ease decade-old restrictions on Oct. 1, allowing more Chinese carriers to offer service.
The change affects about 20 percent of Chinese long-haul daily capacity, according to data compiled for Reuters by Chinese aviation data firm Variflight. 
It will turn up the heat on U.S. and European carriers like United Airlines (O:UAL) and Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), which have higher costs, lower outbound demand from their countries and less cultural appeal to Chinese travelers.
""The North American and European airlines are no match for the Chinese carriers,"" said Corrine Png, chief executive of Singapore-based transport consultancy Crucial Perspective, citing the majority of traffic being driven by Chinese customers. 
Some have already abandoned Chinese routes, with American Airlines (O:AAL) recently planning to drop Shanghai-Chicago service after also cancelling Beijing-Chicago and describing the routes as a ""colossal loss-maker"" that cost it $30 million a year.
The ""one route, one airline"" policy had been in place since 2009; altering it now is a response to the changing aviation market, China's Civil Aviation Authority has said.
Two of the routes, Shanghai-Paris and Shanghai-Frankfurt, already have two Chinese airlines flying them but can add one more.
'LITTLE INFLUENCE'
Variflight's chief data analyst, Cong Wei, said Chinese airlines controlled about 50 percent of the seats on the 20 routes, which include Beijing-Los Angeles and Shanghai-London, and had the potential for a much higher share. 
These routes are divided up between state-controlled carriers China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (SS:600115), China Southern Airlines Co (SS:600029) and Air China Ltd (SS:601111). 
They compete against foreign airlines including Air France KLM, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG),  Air Canada  (TO:AC), British Airways (L:ICAG), Virgin Atlantic (VA.UL), Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and American Airlines.
An Air France KLM spokeswoman said the company was monitoring the regulation change but had ""very little influence on how this rule could evolve."" 
""Competition between Europe and China is already present and increasing,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We continue to enhance our existing partnerships to offer the most attractive products and services at competitive fares to all our customers. This is undoubtedly the best response to this eventuality.""
Delta Air Lines said China continued to be an important market for its long-term network and that it was well positioned because of its partnership with China Eastern. Air New Zealand said it was aware of the change and was constantly assessing new route opportunities.
Lufthansa, Air Canada, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines did not respond to requests for comment. 
TIE-UPS 
The policy would also likely hurt incumbent Chinese airlines like Air China, which under the old rules had been able to dominate the Beijing-Los Angeles route. Many Chinese airlines are already facing falling returns on their international business. 
Rivals like Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), China's fourth-largest carrier, have been expanding their international business in secondary routes and could take on new ones, analysts said. Out of the 20 routes opening for competition, Hainan only flies between Beijing and Toronto. 
China Eastern and China Southern, headquartered respectively in Shanghai and Guangzhou, are also expected to launch new routes from the Beijing once the Chinese capital's new second airport opens in late 2019, giving the two state-owned airlines secondary bases. 
The opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport was a catalyst for the government's decision to change the route policy, the Chinese aviation regulator said in May. 
China Southern said it supported the policy change, while China Eastern declined to comment. Air China and Hainan Airlines did not respond to requests for comment.
Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China, said foreign carriers could focus on developing services for the luxury end of the Chinese market or deepen recently forged tie-ups with Chinese carriers to try to retain a competitive edge. 
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines respectively have small equity stakes in China Eastern and China Southern, while China Eastern owns a 8.8 percent stake in Air France KLM.
But Li said the ultimate winner would be Chinese travellers.
""By liberalizing international air rights, airlines will put more capacity on popular routes, at hot timings ... and provide passengers with safe, more convenient, more comfortable and economical services,"" he said.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 03:27AM ET</span>","MSCI considers boosting China's index weighting, could add $66 billion of inflows","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global index provider MSCI (N:MSCI) said on Wednesday it will consider quadrupling the weighting of Chinese big-caps in its global benchmarks next year, a move that could bring in $66 billion in new foreign investment.
MSCI also proposed adding Chinese mid-caps and shares listed on Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext, which would nearly double the number of mainland stocks in its indexes to roughly 430.
Investor expectations that more mainland stocks will be included in mainstream global benchmarks boosted Chinese share prices on Wednesday, with Shanghai and Hong Kong bourses up more than 1 percent.
MSCI's consultation for a further weight increase of Chinese A-shares comes just months after their historic entry into MSCI indexes in June, which has brought in tens of billions of dollars into the market. It also comes shortly before a decision is due by rival index publisher FTSE Russell on whether China will be included in its indexes.
""Based on back-of-the-envelope calculation on the assets benchmarked against MSCI, I would say a minimum of $66 billion,"" Chin Ping Chia, MSCI's Head of Research for Asia Pacific, said of broad inflow estimates for the new round of inclusion in an interview.
Chia dismissed suggestions MSCI's consultation announcement was timed to compete with FTSE's announcement and said it followed positive investor feedback after the initial index inclusions this year.
He also said China's push for further financial deregulation, in the face of surging market volatility and a broadening trade war with the United States, was positive.
""Despite all the headwinds, China seems to be very determined to open up its capital market to global investors,"" Chia said.
MSCI, which has included about 230 Chinese big-caps in its flagship indexes with an initial inclusion factor of 5 percent, said in a statement that it has proposed to increase that factor to 20 percent. The proposed increase will happen in two phases coinciding with MSCI's index reviews in May and August 2019, it said.
Alexander Treves, J.P. Morgan Asset Management Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific Investment Specialist, expects significantly more foreign inflows into China's A-shares over the next few years, in part because of the MSCI index inclusion.
""However, we think the bigger factor may be rising interest from European and increasingly U.S. institutional investors seeking to better understand and participate in China A-Shares investment opportunities,"" Treves said in a note. 
In addition, MSCI has proposed adding ChiNext shares to the list of eligible segments for inclusion starting from the May 2019 Semi-Annual Index Review.
MSCI is also looking at adding Chinese mid-caps with a 20 percent inclusion factor in one phase as part of the May 2020 Semi-Annual Index Review.
Chia said the proposals would involve the addition of 168 mid-caps and 31 ChiNext companies to the indexes.
China's stock market has lost roughly 15 percent this year, and ranks among the world's worst performers.
Chia said while the criteria for stock admission is based on market accessibility, rather than market valuation or volatility, lower valuations have certainly helped create more investment opportunities. 
MSCI said on Wednesday the consultation was open to feedback from the global investment community and that it would announce its decision by Feb. 28, 2019.

Chia declined to forecast how long it would take for MSCI to give Chinese A-shares full inclusion in its global indexes, but said it intended to eventually give Chinese stocks ""full weight"".

India's government has been working on a package for Air India after plans to sell a majority stake in the debt-laden airline failed this year due to a lack of interest from bidders.
""We are going through the government approval process,"" Sinha told reporters, without giving details.
Air India, which has survived for years with help from taxpayers, has asked the government for 21.21 billion rupees ($292 million) in additional equity to pay the carrier's bills to vendors.
India's top civil aviation bureaucrat said in September that a $120 million capital injection for Air India was on the way, and the government is also working on a relief package for the airline industry.
Jet Airways, India's largest full-service carrier, and state-owned Air India are struggling to stem losses in the world's fastest-growing domestic aviation market, where competition is intense and fuel taxes are high.
India's airline industry is forecast to lose up to $1.9 billion this financial year due to rising costs and low fares, according to consulting firm CAPA. 
The civil aviation ministry has proposed other measures to help the airline industry, including adding aviation turbine fuel to a nationwide goods and services tax, Sinha said.

724,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",Oil Falters as Trump Ups Pressure While Goldman Dissuades Bulls,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil slipped after President Donald Trump resumed his attack on OPEC while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). poured cold water on forecasts for $100 crude.
Brent futures in London fell as much as 0.6 percent. In a speech at the United Nations, Trump ratcheted up pressure on OPEC nations with a threat to demand payment for U.S. military protection after they ignored his call last week to reduce prices. In contrast to trading-giant bulls, Goldman Sachs said catalysts beyond Iranian sanctions are needed for a meaningful rally. A surprise gain in American crude inventories also weighed on sentiment.
Oil prices rose on Monday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled it won’t rush to release more oil into the market, shrugging off pressure from Trump who has been calling on the group to do more to temper gains. The prospect of tightening supplies due to a steep drop in Iran’s exports, Venezuela’s slumping output, and production bottlenecks in U.S. prompted trading giants Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. and Trafigura Group to warn oil could surge back above $100 a barrel.
“Trump demanded in a very strong tone at the United Nations that OPEC push down crude prices, triggering profit taking,” said Takayuki Nogami, chief economist at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. Still, “as investors aren’t convinced Trump’s latest call can force OPEC to change its course, prices will unlikely keep falling.”
Brent for November traded at $81.86 a barrel, down 1 cent, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at 12:18 p.m. in Tokyo, after settling Tuesday at the highest level in almost four years. The global benchmark traded at a $9.71 premium to West Texas Intermediate.
WTI for November delivery fell as much as 45 cents to $71.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange and traded at $72.15. The contract climbed 20 cents to $72.28 on Tuesday. Total volume traded was about 28 percent below the 100-day average.
Shanghai crude futures for December delivery climbed 0.8 percent to 553.3 yuan. The contract added 3.2 percent on Tuesday.
Less than a week after Trump criticized OPEC for pushing for higher prices, he blasted the group again on Tuesday. OPEC is “ripping off the rest of the world,” Trump said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York. “We want them to stop raising prices. We want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on,” he said.
Although OPEC and allies stopped short of pledging an immediate production boost earlier this month, the group’s guidance still implies an incremental 500,000-barrels-a-day production increase, Goldman analysts wrote in a note Tuesday. The bank said it believes OPEC and Russia will offset supply losses out of Iran, and a large jump in prices would likely lead to Trump authorizing a release from the country’s strategic reserves.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","As trade war rumbles, China steps up opening of financial markets","By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The worsening Sino-U.S. trade war has battered China's stocks and currency this year but that hasn't stopped foreign investors rushing into the country's capital markets, which are increasingly opening up despite rising protectionism.
If anything, the selloff has hastened bargain-hunting among investors, such as Fidelity International, UBS Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which believe the long-term growth potential of the world's second biggest economy outweighs the more immediate hit from trade disputes.
""In this environment, a handful of 'fallen angels' can be found,"" said Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity International. She notes that compared with developed markets, China's A-shares have already priced in much of the uncertainty around trade.
Assets under management in several of Fidelity's China-focused funds    have increased this year, despite the market slumping more than 15 percent.
UBS AM, J.P. Morgan AM and Neuberger Berman have also stepped up A-share buying this year.
""China has accelerated the opening up of its capital markets this year to mitigate the negative impact (of the trade war),"" said Hu Yifan, China economist at UBS Wealth Management.
Following global index provider MSCI's historic inclusion of China A-shares in June, regulators are redoubling efforts to integrate the $7 trillion stock market and $11 trillion bond market into the global financial system.
China's global market profile could grow over the next 12 months with the imminent launch of the Shanghai-London Stock Connect, the possible expansion of A-shares weighting in MSCI indices and the potential entry into FTSE Russell's global equity indexes.
DREAM SCENARIO
In a ""dream scenario"",  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) estimates China's efforts to connect its relatively isolated capital markets to the global financial system could create $1.3 trillion - $1.45 trillion of foreign demand for yuan assets.
During the first eight months of the year, China's stock market drew $47.7 billion of net foreign portfolio inflows, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF).
""We've been positive about China's consumption growth opportunities for a while,"" said Shumin Huang, head of research for Greater China Equities at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Huang, whose team covers over 150 A-shares, sees long-term investment opportunities in battered sectors such as healthcare and education.
Several China-focused exchange-traded funds popular with long-term foreign investors have seen increased inflows. These include iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF (HK:2823) and Xtrackers Harvest CSI300 ETF (L:ASHR).
Overseas holdings of China stocks have jumped nearly 50 percent over the past year, but still account for less than 3 percent of total market capitalization. 
In the bond market, overseas holdings surged 70 percent over the past 12 months to 1.75 trillion yuan ($255.25 billion), although this too is meager, accounting for just 2 percent of the market.
However, Wang Xiaojian, Chairman of Shanghai Yaozhi Asset Management Co, expects foreign bond ownership to double over the next five years. His group plans to launch a bond fund in Hong Kong to help foreign institutions invest in mainland Chinese debt. 
(For a graphic on 'Overseas holdings in Chinese stocks and bonds' click https://reut.rs/2xBUrzi) 
China's net capital inflows this year contrast with outflows seen in neighboring markets such as Thailand, Russia and South Korea, according to IIF data, drawn out by a rising U.S. dollar and stocks. 
Despite increased trade tensions, China's market operators are keen to show they're open for business.
This month, the Shanghai Stock Exchange invited nearly 20 global institutions including UBS AM, Nomura Asset Management and Norges Bank to meet executives from six Shanghai-listed companies.
Beijing has also relaxed capital flow rules, and awarded local fund management licenses to several global managers.
""That's seen as a very strong signal that the opening of the market is actually going ahead, regardless of the trade war,"" said Stephane Loiseau, Asia Pacific Head of Cash Equities & Global Execution Services at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A government-ordered inquiry into Australia's financial sector questioned on Wednesday whether the insurance industry's system of self-regulation should be overhauled amid evidence of widespread misconduct.
The Royal Commission, as the powerful inquiry is called, said in a paper it is considering whether laws should be strengthened to protect consumers. It will accept comments from the public until Oct. 25 before making a recommendation to the government.
""Is the current regulatory regime adequate to minimize consumer detriment?"" the inquiry, headed by former judge Kenneth Hayne, asked in the paper.
Rounding up 10 days of public hearings, lawyers assisting the inquiry detailed last week alleged misconduct at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), as well as subsidiaries of Japan's Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc (T:8750) and Germany's Allianz SE (DE:ALVG), plus six other insurers.
The insurance sector revelations were among the inquiry's most damaging, with shares in Insurance Australia Group (AX:IAG), Clearview Wealth (AX:CVW) and Freedom Insurance Group (AX:FIG) falling by between 10 percent and 75 percent since the inquiry began.
The life and general insurance industry sold over A$41 billion ($29.78 billion) worth of insurance policies to consumers in 2017, according to the inquiry.
Insurers in Australia are excluded from laws requiring fair contracts and requiring them to handle policy claims honestly and efficiently. They are, however, required to act in good faith and must otherwise obey company, insurance and contract laws.
The inquiry is calling for arguments justifying those exclusions, following revelations some insurers relied on unfair terms and conditions, such as outdated technical medical definitions, to avoid payouts.
Rather than having to abide by statutory code of practice, the industry successfully lobbied the government for a self-policed code of practice in 1994.
But the hearings revealed general insurers breached self-imposed regulations on over 31,000 occasions without penalty in recent years, casting doubt on the industry's ability to regulate itself.
""Should a failure to comply with the general insurance code of practice or the life insurance code of practice constitute ... a failure to comply with financial services laws...?"" the paper asks.
The quasi-judicial inquiry can recommend regulatory reform and prosecutions and is due to table an interim report in coming days before issuing its final recommendations to the government in February 2019.

""I think where the market might be slightly disappointed is around the gross margins ... it is slightly weaker than expected,"" MainFirst Bank analyst John Guy said.
Nike gross margins rose 50 basis points to 44.2 percent in the reported quarter, in line with average analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""The numbers are good, but they weren't wow enough,"" said Jeff Auxier, founder & portfolio manager at Auxier Asset Management.
For the second quarter, during which it launched its campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, Nike forecast revenue growth and gross margin expansion similar to the reported quarter. 
Many analysts said the campaign plays to Nike's core demographics in the United States, and has translated to 61 percent more merchandise sold during the period, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. 
The Oregon-based athletic shoe maker also expects costs to grow in the low teens in the current quarter on higher investments in its digital platform and sports marketing during kickoff of the NBA and NFL seasons.

""We returned to strong growth in North America even faster than what we had expected,"" Nike Chief Financial Officer Andrew Campion said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
Sales in North America rose 6 percent in the reported quarter.
Revenue rose 9.7 percent to $9.95 billion, beating estimates of $9.94 billion.

The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 16 percent this year, among the worst performers worldwide, amid a trade dispute with the U.S. and slowing economic growth.
More than 4,600 new accounts have been opened to trade China A shares via the Hong Kong link since the announcement of the MSCI inclusion, according to the index company. Chinese authorities have increased daily quotas for the stock link, while the number of companies suspending their shares has decreased and the Shanghai exchange’s closing auction is working well, MSCI said, explaining why it wants to boost the weighting.
“China and emerging markets are going to be increasingly important for global investors,” Bruce McCain, the chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said by phone. “There probably will be an immediate short-term reaction, as investors respond quickly to the emotion of the news.""
While that may not last, some optimism will remain in the long run, he said.
Inclusion in MSCI indexes hasn’t helped Chinese stocks so far. The Shanghai Composite Index trades near the cheapest level in almost four years.
The changes would mean that A shares make up 2.8 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by August next year, increasing to 3.4 percent when mid-cap stocks are added in 2020. That’s a fraction of the allocation for offshore-listed Chinese shares, which would comprise 29 percent of the index in two years’ time. Tencent Holdings Ltd. currently has the biggest weighting on the gauge, at 4.8 percent.
MSCI is seeking feedback from investors by mid-February and will announce its final decision at the end of that month.

739,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 09:23PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mostly Higher Despite Trump’s Trade Comments,"Investing.com - Asian equities were mostly higher in morning trade on Wednesday even after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his country would “no longer tolerate abuse” on trade.
Overnight, Trump’s comments pressured the financial sector and sent U.S. stocks lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3%, the S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% as traders awaited the Federal Reserve meeting.
""Those days are over. We will no longer tolerate such abuse (on trade),"" Trump told the United Nations General Assembly. ""We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated, and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens.""
In China, trade tension with the U.S. remained in focus as the country’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said Beijing would resume trade talks only if the U.S. show sincerity and not put a knife at China’s throat.
Wang then added that the two sides were set to have four rounds of talks but the U.S. went back on what they had agreed.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.2% and 0.4% respectively by 9:42PM ET (01:42 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also rose 0.6%.
Global index provider MSCI said it is looking into the options to increase the weighting of Chinese big-caps in its indexes.
MSCI said in a statement that it is considering to increase the initial inclusion factor to 20% from the current 5% in its flagship indexes.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.2%.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2% in the morning, with major miner Rio Tinto Ltd (AX:RIO) gaining as much as 2%, while BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) (AX:BHP Billiton) traded higher by 1.2%.

""The new branding conveys the company's focus on serving great coffee fast, while ... retaining its familiar pink and orange colors and iconic font,"" the company said. 
The company, whose sales in the recent quarters have been powered by breakfast and beverage items, said the new branding would be effective January.

Portfolio managers aren’t rushing out their checkbooks to gain exposure to the fast-growing region, even as high-yielding currencies such as India’s rupee languish near record lows. Instead, they’re positioning for further weakness, with the U.S.-China trade war and a strong dollar expected to remain persistent themes.
“We are biasing our exposure to the dollar,” said Manu George, director of fixed income in Singapore at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., which oversees $593 billion. “We have not been constructive for a few months on Asian FX and hence we are staying put for now.”
Emerging currencies and bonds extended losses this quarter as Argentina’s credit woes and Turkey’s lira turmoil fueled fears of contagion. A stronger greenback is adding to the stress, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbing to the highest in over a year last month amid bets that U.S. interest rates will continue to rise.
The Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah are pacing declines in Asia, as the U.S.-China trade row clouds the outlook for money managers. The U.S. imposed further duties on another $200 billion in Chinese goods on Monday, and China said negotiations to better the situation won’t take place as long as President Donald Trump continues to threaten more tariffs.
“The trade war has some length to go and could lead to further weakness in the Chinese renminbi,” said Alexander Zeeh, chief executive officer of S.E.A. Asset Management in Singapore. “As a result I would expect other Asian central banks to be in favor to weaken their currencies in tandem to remain relatively competitive with Chinese exports. This is the main reason I would avoid most Asian FX local currency bonds.”
Exceptional Thai Baht
Not everyone is negative on the region.
“In this environment of increased emerging-market volatility, past experience shows us that Asia FX could act as a safe haven,” said Anders Faergemann, a London-based fund manager at PineBridge Investments which oversees $87 billion globally. “We’re still optimistic on emerging markets from a fundamental perspective.” PineBridge increased its exposure to Thailand’s baht, while it also favors other EM currencies which it says are undervalued, including the Mexican and Colombian pesos.

Nikko Asset Management Co., which manages $216 billion globally, agrees that the baht will remain resilient but advocates broader patience as the drag from the trade war outweighs the attractive valuations on Asian bonds.
“We are not increasing exposure at the moment as we think that the current weak market sentiment driven by ongoing trade tensions could linger for a while,” said Edward Ng, a fixed-income portfolio manager in Singapore at Nikko Asset. “Given the vulnerable sentiments in EM, we have been cautious in this space, particularly on countries with weak external balances.”

The interest rate on People’s Bank of China seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements will stay at the current level of 2.55 percent through the end of the year, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of more than 40 traders and analysts.
Fed policy makers are widely expected to authorize a quarter-point hike in their benchmark overnight interest rate in Washington on Wednesday and signal they are on track to complete another increase before the end of the year.
""There is no need to follow,"" said Meng Xiangjuan, chief bond analyst at SWS Research Co. in Shanghai, adding that the stabilizing yuan-dollar exchange rate also reduces the pressure on the PBOC.
The escalating trade war with the U.S. and slowing economic growth are weighing on monetary policy decisions. China’s government is cutting some taxes, boosting spending, and loosening the monetary stance to ensure ample market liquidity.
""The trade uncertainty has prompted the central bank to maintain an accommodative bias,"" Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in the survey, adding that the central bank will likely stay put as it did in June after the Fed raised rates.
‘Accommodative Bias’
Zhu Jianfang, chief economist at Citic Securities Co., also said in a research note that China is not likely to keep up with the Fed in the fourth quarter, citing the downward pressure on the real economy.
A large majority of the survey respondents said the central bank will inject more liquidity into the market in the fourth quarter. The medium-term lending facility tool is seen as being the most likely method, with injections via a lowering of the reserve requirement ratio or open market operations also seen as possible.
The PBOC will ""try and maintain sufficient liquidity in the system"", Jeremy Stevens, a Beijing-based economist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. said in response to the survey. The measures won’t translate into effective lending in the short term, but ""that is better for the longer term outlook for the Chinese economy,"" he added.

S&P said the negative outlook reflects the uncertain outcome of the investigation, and the damage to the reputation of the Denmark-based bank. 
Danske Bank's CEO resigned last week after an inquiry revealed that 200 billion euros ($235 billion) of payments had been moved through its Estonian branch over a period of eight years, many of which the bank said were suspicious.
S&P also lowered its rating on Danske Bank's pension unit, Danika, to A-minus from A, as S&P believes it to be a core subsidiary.
S&P said it affirmed its A/A-1 long- and short-term issuer credit ratings on Danske.

""We could lower our issuer credit ratings within the next 18-24 months if Danske Bank's franchise suffers lasting damage or if we believe potential regulatory penalties would weaken the bank's capital and earnings,"" S&P said.

The move could affect the sale of BMW cars and spare parts from next Monday, the Munich daily said.
""We will not sign the contracts that have been offered to us with regard to a business model 2018+ in their current form,"" Peter Reisacher, president of the association of German licensed BMW dealers (VDB), told the paper.
""We will inform BMW on Wednesday in written form.""
The dealers account for 11 billion euros ($12.94 billion) of BMW revenues, the paper said, adding BMW only owns 50 of the 600 BMW car dealerships. The retailers received new terms in August that leave them with significantly less income.
BMW on Tuesday warned its pretax profit would fall this year, against earlier expectations for a flat outcome, and cut its profit margin guidance for cars, blaming intense price competition following new emissions rules.

The companies signed up for $8.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $7.8 billion a year earlier, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) said. 
""Fundamentals in the U.S. economy are favorable for capex investment by both large and small borrowers, and a number of asset classes and equipment verticals are benefiting,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""Steadily rising interest rates, a spate of disagreements with our trading partners and a powerful hurricane have seemingly little, to no, effect on the U.S. economy and its continued vitality.""
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.4 percent in August, up slightly from 76.2 percent in July.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), CIT Group Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc and Volvo AB.

The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for September is 65.5, up from the August index of 60.7. A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shaved some parts from the display in its largest new iPhone, helping keep costs under control in what has become the priciest component of its phones in recent years, according to a new cost analysis of the device.
TechInsights, an Ottawa, Ontario-based firm which rips open phones to analyze their contents and estimate the cost of the parts inside, said on Tuesday that the iPhone Xs Max with 256 gigabytes of storage capacity contains about $443 in parts and assembly costs, compared with $395.44 for the 64-gigabyte version of last year's iPhone X.
Apple released a trio of new phones earlier this month, including an update on last year's iPhone X, called the iPhone Xs, that starts at $999, and the budget-minded iPhone Xr that starts at $749. But it was the iPhone Xs Max - with a 6.5-inch display that uses so-called OLED technology for richer colors - that pushed new pricing boundaries, starting at $1,099. 
In its cost analysis released on Tuesday, TechInsights found that the single priciest part in the iPhone Xs Max - the display - cost $80.50, compared with $77.27 for last year's iPhone X, which featured a smaller 5.8-inch screen. The relatively small increase in cost despite the larger screen size was because Apple appeared to have removed some components related to its so-called 3D Touch system, which makes apps respond differently depending on how hard users press the screen.
""All told, what they took out adds up to about $10, so this $80 estimate would have been about $90,"" Al Cowsky, who oversees cost analysis at TechInsights, told Reuters in an interview. ""They had a trade-off in cost.""
Apple declined to comment on the study.
But Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research said Apple likely made the right decision to focus on ensuring it could deliver a larger-screened model this year economically.
""For a certain group of people, the whole thing is about the screen. It's driving the whole experience and it's what is making people excited about using the phone,"" O'Donnell said.

Other costs that increased were the phone's processor and modem chips, primarily because the chips used newer chip-making techniques from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TWO:5425) to boost their performance while taking up the same space. The 256-gigabyte iPhone Xs Max TechInsights analyzed sells for $1,249 in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading internet search engine Google will acknowledge that it has made ""mistakes"" on privacy issues in testimony an executive of the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit will deliver to a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.
""We acknowledge that we have made mistakes in the past, from which we have learned, and improved our robust privacy program,"" Google chief privacy officer Keith Enright will say in written testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee. Google will testify alongside AT&T Inc (N:T), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other companies amid growing concerns about data privacy.
Google’s written testimony did not identify specific prior mistakes but the company has come under fire for privacy issues.
In 2012, Google agreed to pay a then record $22.5 million civil penalty to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it misrepresented to Apple Safari Internet browser users that it would not place tracking ""cookies"" or serve them targeted ads.
A year earlier, Google agreed to an FTC privacy settlement and regular privacy audits for 20 years after the government charged it used deceptive tactics and violating consumer privacy promises when it launched its social network, Google Buzz.
In August, Alphabet was sued and accused of illegally tracking movements of millions of iPhone and Android phone users even when they use a privacy setting to prevent it.
The U.S. Commerce Department said it was seeking comments on how to set nationwide data privacy rules in the wake of tough new requirements adopted by the European Union and California.
Also, the Justice Department said it held a ""listening session"" with state attorneys general on how the government can safeguard consumers online.
Senate Commerce committee chairman John Thune wrote that Congress must work on enshrining consumer data privacy protections into law. 
Congress has questions about how internet companies sell advertising and use data from email accounts or other services. Thune wrote in The Hill newspaper that ""mounting controversies"" have fed doubt that tech companies can ""regulate themselves and enforce real privacy safeguards for the collection and use of our digital data.""
Massive breaches of data privacy have compromised personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, including notable breaches at large retailers and credit reporting agency  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX). 
Enright's testimony says ""with advertising, as with all our products, users trust us to keep their personal information confidential and under their control. We do not sell personal information. Period.""
Andrew DeVore, an Amazon vice president, will tell the committee that new European privacy rules ""required us to divert significant resources to administrative and record-keeping tasks and away from inventing new features for customers.""
Twitter data protection officer Damien Kieran will urge development of ""a robust privacy framework that protects individuals’ rights ... while preserving the freedom to innovate.""
The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) this summer held more than 50 meetings with tech companies, internet providers, privacy advocates and others, hoping to develop a national standard.
The Internet Association, which represents more than 40 internet and technology companies, said this month it backed modernizing data privacy rules with a national approach that would pre-empt California data privacy regulations taking effect in 2020.
California Governor Jerry Brown signed the legislation aimed at giving consumers more control over how companies collect and manage their personal information. New rules in Europe are even more stringent.

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May. Breaking privacy laws can now result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($23.2 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.

1. Fed Day Arrives
The Federal Open Market Committee will be taking the market spotlight tomorrow, even though the interest rate decision is pretty much a foregone conclusion.
With traders pricing in a 100% chance of a quarter-point hike, anything else would be a major jolt to the market.
Barring that type of outlier, the Fed’s statement, which will be released along with the rate decision at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT), will be the what likely moves stocks.
Investors will be looking at the dot-plot graph to see the expectations for future rate hikes in December and next year. And if the work “accommodative” is removed from the statement it will free the Fed up to continue raising rates to the elusive “neutral rate.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will give his press conference at 2:30 PM ET.
2. Social Media and Tech Execs Appear at Senate Hearing
Executives from tech and social media will be on Capitol Hill again tomorrow,
The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing entitled Examining Safeguards for Consumer Data Privacy at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
“This hearing will provide leading technology companies and internet service providers an opportunity to explain their approaches to privacy, how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation,” said Sen. John Thune, (R-S.D.), chairman of the committee.
Attending the hearing will be executives form AT&T (NYSE:T), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Charter Communications  (NASDAQ:CHTR).
3. Nike Beats on Bottom Line
Shares of  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) will be active tomorrow. The company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings after the bell today.
Nike posted a profit that beat expectations, with sales in line.
Shares of Nike fell about 2% in after-hours trading, although the stock has been rallying recently.
Notable earnings tomorrow include CarMax (NYSE:KMX) before the bell and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (NASDAQ:BBBY) after the close of trading."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday as chipmakers were dented by ratings downgrades and utilities declined ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike, offsetting a boost from the energy sector.
S&P 500 financials (SPSY), including interest-rate-sensitive bank stocks (BKX), dipped 0.38 percent ahead of the expected rise in interest rates by the Fed on Wednesday. Utilities, which tend to be favored in low-rate environments because of their solid dividend payments, (SPLRCU) slid 1.22 percent
The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) added 0.57 percent as Brent oil hit a four-year high, boosted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports, and OPEC and Russia's reluctance to raise output.
U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in September, bringing it closer to levels last seen in 2000, the Conference Board said, underscoring strength in the labor market and the overall economy.
The data pushed the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) up 0.59 percent.
""A lot of the noise around trade and anything else around politics really hasn't suppressed consumer confidence nearly to the degree that the other factors have boosted it,"" said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management, in Chicago.
The Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) dropped 1.70 percent, weighing on the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT), after brokerages Raymond James and KeyBanc cut their ratings on a number of chipmakers. Intel (O:INTC) fell 2.13 percent after Raymond James downgraded the stock.
Buoyed by strong economic growth and deep corporate tax cuts, the S&P 500 has gained 9 percent so far in 2018. But five of the S&P 500 sector indexes are down year to date, including the consumer staples index (SPLRCS), down 5.6 percent. Consumer staples (SPLRCS) on Tuesday lost 0.73 percent. The other six are higher, led by the technology index's (SPLRCT) 19 percent rally. 
""There are different stories for different sectors, it's a finicky little market,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. ""If you're a money manager, you have to be very careful about what you're buying.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.26 percent to end at 26,492.21 points, and the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.13 percent to 2,915.56. 
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) rose 0.18 percent to 8,007.47. Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) provided the greatest lift to the technology-heavy index, jumping 2.08 percent.
In extended trade,  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) fell 2.89 percent after it reported quarterly results.
 CenturyLink  (N:CTL) tumbled 8 percent after Chief Financial Officer Sunit Patel left the company in a surprise move to join T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) to oversee its integration with Sprint (N:S). T-Mobile rose 0.77 percent and Sprint added 0.31 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 54 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.6 billion shares, just below the 6.7 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.26%. The S&P 500 fell 0.13%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.18%.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump didn’t pull any punches as he launched into a tirade against international trading partners and OPEC, prompting investors to abandon their bullish bets on stocks.
""Those days are over. We will no longer tolerate such abuse (on trade),"" Trump said. ""We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated, and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens.""
Trump's tough talk on trade pressured financials, mostly banks, to reverse gains, forcing the broader markets lower.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fell from intraday highs to end the day lower. The early-day rally in financials had followed a rise in bond yields ahead of a widely-expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike Wednesday
Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Energy stocks also fell victim to Trump's ire, this time aimed at OPEC members, who the president blamed for higher energy prices, claiming the cartel was ""ripping off the world.""
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for November delivery rose 20 cents to settle at $72.28 a barrel, below intraday highs of $72.75.

769,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Bond Investors Steer Clear of the Fed’s Steamroller,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. Treasury auctioned two- and five-year notes this week that offered the highest yields in a decade. And yet buyers balked.
The $37 billion two-year offering priced to yield 2.829 percent — a lofty figure, considering it was a mere 0.75 percent just two years ago. Yet the bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, plunged to 2.44, matching the weakest level since December 2008. Effectively, investors sat this auction out, leaving primary dealers taking down their largest share since late 2016. The $38 billion five-year auction yielded 2.997 percent, yet demand this year has never been worse.
It’s clear that traders in the world’s biggest bond market see little reason to pick up a handful of extra basis points in front of what could be a steamroller of a Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday. Though it’s virtually certain that the central bank will raise interest rates, the big risk is that officials will signal a more aggressive path ahead. Remember, it’s at the September meeting that policy makers extend their “dot plot” out an extra year (in this case, to 2021). Notably, the Fed has never raised interest rates at a September meeting in this tightening cycle. The prospect of boosting them above “neutral” in the next few years would be most damaging to the maturities auctioned this week.
Market positioning offers little direction ahead of the Fed. Sure, a JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Treasury client survey showed a decrease in short positions for the week ended Sept. 24. But data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the same as it has been for most of this year: Hedge funds and other large speculators are betting heavily on interest rates moving higher, while asset managers are taking the other side.
It seems as if Treasuries are set up “for volatile yield reactions tomorrow afternoon,” according to Jim Vogel at FTN Financial Capital Markets. It doesn’t help that “as traders are nervous before tomorrow, volume during domestic trading has been slower than average,” he wrote in a note after Tuesday’s auction.
Those who are willing to fight their nerves could be rewarded. Two-year Treasuries yield 84 basis points more than the upper bound of the fed funds target range, which is 1.75 percent to 2 percent. That’s nearly the widest spread since 2010. In other words, the idea of a Fed “pause” has practically been eradicated as a possibility after it seemed like the most likely scenario just a short time ago. Remember when Chairman Jerome Powell said rate hikes were the best option “for now”?
Still, investors are prudent to build in a buffer — or just outright avoid Treasury auctions — until the Fed decision and Powell’s press conference are in their rearview mirror. There are simply too many wild cards that central bankers could choose to highlight or ignore, from the effects of tax cuts to the continuing trade war to the surprisingly strong pickup in wage growth. It’s too risky to fight the Fed, no matter how tempting the yields."

Semiconductor stocks were under pressure after Raymond James downgraded the sector, which it had said had entered a cyclical downturn, following a meeting with a number of handset, networking and PC supply chain stakeholders.
""Most importantly, it seems the suppliers with the shortest lead times appear to be seeing the downtick first. Conversely, products with longer lead times have yet to be impacted,"" Raymond James said.
The bank downgraded a cohort of semiconductor stocks, including  Monolithic Power  Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but maintained its outlook on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), unchanged on expectations for long-term growth and favorable company-specific trends, respectively.
Elsewhere, Amazon offered investors some refuge from the weakness in tech, which was weighed down by sharp slump in Centurylink.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose nearly 2% after an analyst at Jefferies suggested Tuesday that the e-commerce giant could see its shares surge to $3,000 by 2020, driven by strong growth in the company's Prime, cloud and advertising businesses.
CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) fell 7% after the company revealed on Monday that Chief Financial Officer Sunit Patel had resigned after accepting an executive leadership role at another company, though analysts continued to tout optimism.
""We remain confident that Centurylink is on track for margin and synergy realization, though recognize perception has likely capped the stock for a few quarters,"" Oppenheimer said.
Rising bonds yields, meanwhile, prompted investors to shun dividend-heavy sectors such as utilities, which fell more than 1%, weighing on the broader market.
Bond yields have hit a rich vein of form as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose to their highest since May, on expectations for Fed interest rate hike Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Music streaming services Spotify and Deezer joined European business and industry bodies in calling on EU regulators to take tougher action to curb what they say are the unfair practices of online platforms.
EU governments are set in the coming weeks to come up with a joint position on a proposed platform-to-business (P2B) law which is meant to ensure greater transparency and fairness in the digital economy. 
Driven by concerns over privacy and data protection, the European Union has in recent years introduced tougher rules to regulate online markets dominated by U.S. tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
But in a joint letter, businesses and industry bodies such as the European Publishers Council and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, said the P2B proposal did not go far enough.
""Targeted measures to prevent unfair practices by platforms are needed if the legislation is to promote sustained digital growth,"" they said in a joint letter dated Sept. 24 seen by Reuters.
Unveiled by the European Commission in April, the P2B law would force app stores, search engines, e-commerce sites and hotel booking websites such as  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services.
It would also give companies the right to group together and sue online platforms. 
The European business and industry groups did not name any platforms in their letter, which was addressed to EU ministers of competitiveness who are due to meet in Brussels on Sept. 27. 
""Instead of being gateways that facilitate access, these platforms use their privileged position to become gatekeepers to the digital economy,"" they said in the letter.
They also said unfair business practices include large platforms favoring their own services, unilateral and sudden changes in terms and conditions, arbitrary marketing bans, mandatory use of a particular billing system and arbitrary restrictions on data use. 
Tech lobbying group CCIA, which represents Google, Amazon and eBay have previously said there is no evidence of a systemic problem to justify more regulations.

Once EU governments have decided on a joint position, they will have to negotiate with the Commission and European Parliament on the final legislation.

(Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) said on Tuesday that U.S. regulators have received a ""wake-up call"" from automakers over the hurdles they face in trying to meet rising Obama-era fuel-efficiency requirements.
In day two of a three-day public hearing over the Trump administration's proposal to freeze fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026, automakers urged regulators to continue to boost fuel requirements but also take into account shifting consumer demand.
The Obama administration in 2012 approved rules to nearly double fuel-efficiency requirements to a fleetwide average of more than 50 miles per gallon but agreed to an evaluation by 2018 over whether the final years of the requirements were feasible.
The Trump administration billed the proposed rollback from Obama-era fuel efficiency standards as a way to help car companies and lower vehicle prices for consumers, but critics note the plan will raise estimated fuel consumption by 500,000 barrels of oil a day by the 2030s and boost pollution.
Securing America's Future Energy, a group of retired military leaders and business executives, proposed on Tuesday a compromise hiking requirements by at least 2 percent annually through 2026 with credits for electric vehicles and incentives for self-driving vehicles.
The Trump administration's proposed freeze ""places America at a strategic disadvantage,"" said retired U.S. Marine Corps Commandant James Conway at the hearing in Dearborn, Michigan.
Steve Bartoli, a Fiat Chrysler vice president who oversees fuel economy issues, said at the hearing that the U.S. auto market is significantly different today than was forecast in 2012, marked by lower gasoline prices and a dramatic shift in buying habits from cars to sport utility vehicles.
He said starting in 2016 the auto industry has been unable to meet current requirements without using credits earned from prior model years. Bartoli called the gap ""a wake-up call that assumptions made seven years ago about the U.S. auto market need to be revisited.""
He added that ""in business and in government, we have to make decisions based on the best information available to us at the time, but we also must be nimble enough to adjust our plans when the facts on the ground change.""
Neither Fiat Chrysler nor  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which also testified at the hearing, back a specific fuel-efficiency requirement through 2026.
The Trump administration also wants to revoke California's authority to set its own strict tailpipe emissions rules and mandate the sale of electric vehicles. California is moving ahead with setting its own rules, and 19 states said in August they would challenge the rollback in court. California this week urged the administration to abandon its proposal.
Automakers want California and the White House to reach agreement on nationwide rules.

Bob Holycross, a Ford environmental executive, said at the hearing automakers need ""regulatory certainty, not protracted litigation.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - AccorHotels' (PA:ACCP) new Middle East and Africa CEO is taking aim at rivals including Radisson as he looks to capitalize on a billion-dollar war chest to further the biggest European hotel operator's expansion in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The French group announced in July that it was teaming up with Katara Hospitality - the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) sovereign wealth fund's hospitality arm - to create a fund to invest in Africa.
The fund will invest in 40 hotels as  Accor  expands from the 114 hotels it operates in Africa under brands including Ibis, Novotel and Pullman.
With 70 percent of the existing properties being in North African markets, Mark Willis - appointed as the company's Middle East and Africa chief this month - told Reuters that Accor is looking at opportunities in Cape Town, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Abidjan and Kampala. 
""There's a variety of different things on the table. We have a number of deals about to close in those key destinations,"" he said, adding that he believes there is a gap in the market for economy and mid-range accommodation. 
In April AccorHotels acquired a 50 percent stake in South Africa's Mantis Group, which runs a string of five-star properties and lodges around the world.
Accor's established North African foothold, Willis said, was expected to serve as a springboard for the expansion push, since those same customers travel and do business across the continent. 
""The key, especially when you have a 40 million-strong loyalty base, is to make sure you've got footprint in those key locations where your guests need a brand that they know and trust,"" he said.
Among its main rivals, Radisson's Africa portfolio stands at 86 hotels and almost 18,000 rooms in operation and under development after rapid expansion on the continent in recent years.
While accepting that Radisson has done a ""fabulous job"" in Africa, Willis said that Accor is more than capable of competing in an African market that is increasingly attracting big-name hotel chains.
""We have the opportunity to really put a firm grip on the whole continent,"" he said.

776,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","As Brazil Election Looms, Tense Entrepreneurs Put Plans on Hold","(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s divisive and uncertain presidential election is forcing the country’s businesses to put their financial plans on hold, according to the chairman of pulp and paper producer Klabin SA.
Horacio Lafer Piva, a former head of the Sao Paulo industry group Fiesp, said Brazilian businessmen are concerned that polarization between left and right could jeopardize the approval of a meaningful pension reform, aggravating an already difficult fiscal situation.
“All entrepreneurs are tense,” Piva said in an interview at Bloomberg’s offices in Sao Paulo. “No one knows what is going to happen.""
Klabin, Brazil’s largest paper packaging producer and exporter, won’t resume decisions on investments until after the election, Piva said, adding that there are a lot of projects on hold in Latin America’s largest economy.
Thirteen candidates are running for the presidency, but if no candidate wins a majority in the first round vote on Oct. 7, there will be a runoff on Oct. 28. Polls show Fernando Haddad, from the leftist Workers’ Party, or PT, and far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro, are the two candidates most likely to reach the second round.
Recent Polls
The latest survey by the research firm Ibope on Monday showed former army captain Bolsonaro continues to lead the race with 28 percent of vote intentions compared with 22 percent for Haddad, who replaced former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as the PT’s candidate.
“The size of the concessions both sides would need to make to approve anything in Congress would be huge,” Piva said. “It’s going to be a war, a really tense situation.” The biggest challenge for whoever wins the race will be addressing the country’s ballooning fiscal deficit, he added.
Piva said he hasn’t decided yet who he’ll vote for, as both left and right options come with serious drawbacks. “I will wait until five days before the election, sit down, concentrate, and listen to jazz and then try to decide,"" he said.
Describing Bolsonaro as “an outsider”, Piva added that Brazil has already had a “very bad experience with an outsider,"" referring to Fernando Collor de Mello, the former Brazilian president who was impeached in 1992 amid a corruption scandal and a financial crisis.
Bolsonaro’s views on gender, diversity, democracy and security are ""a bit detached from the 21 century, they’re discussions from the past,"" he said. ""So there is a risk that Brazil takes a step back.""
While the PT has a stronger presence in Brazil’s Congress, and more experience negotiating with the legislative body, its last government “went terribly,” Piva said. President Dilma Rousseff led the PT’s last administration until her impeachment in 2016.
While Piva said that the business community trusts Haddad more than his party, questions remain over who would really be in power. “Who would run the government? Haddad, Lula, or PT’s president Gleisi Hoffmann? The pressure from the PT may be too big.""
Staying Put
The entrepreneur, who also sits on the board of a Brazilian private equity fund Tarpon Investimentos SA, among other firms, said that, unlike some of his peers, he isn’t taking his personal investments outside Brazil, nor is he buying dollars or selling shares in the companies he invests in, such as Vale SA or Klabin.
“I am not seeking to hedge like crazy as many people are doing now because a hedging decision is as huge as a stay put decision,"" Piva said, adding that he expects Brazil’s congress should be able to limit radical actions by either side of the political spectrum. Congress should play the role of a “mediator"" as long as “a loony doesn’t come with the idea to close it,"" he said. ""Brazil isn’t going to become Venezuela.""
To Piva, Geraldo Alckmin, from PSDB, is the candidate with “more content, experience, structure."" But he isn’t gaining any traction in the polls. “PSDB lost itself as an opposition party, and ended up discussing platitudes over meaningful issues,"" said Piva, whose father, Pedro Piva, who died in February last year, was a PSDB senator.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>",Michael Kors makes high-end fashion statement with $2.2 billion Versace buy,"By Giulia Segreti and Agnieszka Flak 
MILAN (Reuters) - Michael Kors (N:KORS) agreed to buy luxury designer Versace for 1.83 billion euros ($2.15 billion) including debt on Tuesday, as the U.S. fashion group positions itself to take on larger European rivals.
Michael Kors, whose namesake label is best known for its leather handbags, has made no secret of its ambition to widen its customer base and its portfolio of high-end brands after buying British stiletto-heel maker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion last year.
The bet on Versace comes as the U.S. group looks to refresh the more downmarket image of the Michael Kors brand and recover some of its pricing power. The move is also aimed at reviving Versace, which returned to a net profit last year.
It is the latest in a string of foreign takeovers of Italian luxury brands in recent years.
Milan-based Versace, known for its bold designs and its Medusa head logo, was one of a clutch of family-owned Italian brands cited as attractive targets at a time when the luxury industry is riding high on strong demand from China. 
""With the acquisition of Versace we have created one of the world's leading fashion and luxury groups,"" said John Idol, chairman and CEO of  Michael Kors Holdings .
Michael Kors has agreed to buy all of Versace's outstanding shares for a total enterprise value of 1.83 billion euros ($2.2 billion) to be funded in cash, debt and shares in Michael Kors Holding Ltd, which will be renamed Capri Holdings Ltd.
Idol later ruled out any further acquisitions by Capri, which will focus on developing the three brands. 
Talks started before the summer, when Versace was on the radar of several investors, as Blackstone (NYSE:BX) intended to exit the group, a source close to the deal said. 
The U.S. private equity firm, which bought 20 percent of Versace for 210 million euros in 2014, will make a 156 million euro capital gain by exiting its investment, Reuters calculations show. 
The Versace family, which owns 80 percent of the Milan-based fashion house, will receive 150 million euros of the purchase price in Capri shares.
""We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace's long-term success. My passion has never been stronger,"" said Donatella Versace, the sister of its late founder who is its artistic director and vice-president.
Versace CEO Jonathan Akeroyd will remain at the helm of the company, while Donatella Versace will ""continue to lead the company's creative vision"", Idol added. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth fiscal quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were among the advisers. 
BIG FASHION
Budding conglomerates like Michael Kors have been trying to make inroads into an industry dominated by European players such as Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP).
""The Versace brand has strong global growth potential which is untapped across all regions, particularly Asia and North America,"" Cowen analysts said in a note. 
Idol said his group plans to grow Versace's global sales to $2 billion globally, reach profit margins in the ""high teens range"" and open about 100 new stores as well as bolstering online sales. It also plans to raise the share of higher-margin accessories and footwear to 60 percent of sales from 35 percent. 
""Versace is terribly under-developed. That is going to change with the resources of Capri behind them,"" Idol added, in a call with analysts, explaining that the group's runway line would remain the main ""focus"". 
He admitted that the brand's reach was bigger than its customer base and that ""we need to convert those metrics"".
Versace does not disclose financial details, but filed documents showing 2017 sales were 668 million euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 45 million euros.
""(In luxury) Americans are the opposite of Italians: Though not excellent in products, they are (excellent) in their approach to the market. The only risk is that they don't give the product their due value,"" said Giuliano Noci, professor at Milan's Politecnico School of Management. 
Michael Kors shares were trading 1.4 percent higher at 1655 GMT, after falling more than 8 percent on Monday when news of the deal emerged. 
Versace is the latest Made-in-Italy name to be snapped up by a foreign company. Rome-based Fendi, celebrity jeweler Bulgari and cashmere maker Loro Piana were all bought by LVMH. Gucci is the biggest brand in Kering, which also Bottega Veneta and menswear brand Brioni.
Fans fretted on social media about the red carpet favorite losing its appeal, while Italian politicians mourned the loss of another of the country's cherished brands. 
""I am a liberal but I'm tired of seeing the best Italian brands in fashion, food and technology being bought by foreigners,"" Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 12:37PM ET</span>",Denmark bolsters defenses against wider Danske Bank risks,"By Teis Jensen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark has bolstered defenses against shocks to its financial system after a risk-assessment body said the sector's stability could be threatened by the  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) money laundering scandal.
Danske Bank's CEO resigned last week after an inquiry revealed that 200 billion euros ($235 billion) of payments had been moved through its Estonian branch over a period of eight years, many of which the bank said were suspicious.
The case is a risk for Denmark's entire financial sector, the Systemic Risk Council, which monitors threats to the stability of the country's financial system, said on Tuesday.
It advised the government to double the cash cushion financial firms must hold to protect against economic shocks, to 1 percent of risk-weighted exposure, partly because of the Danske Bank case and partly because of increasing risks in banks' overall lending.
""The Danish financial system is highly affected by developments and risk perception in international markets. That is why the Danske Bank money laundering case poses a risk to the entire sector and to Denmark's international reputation,"" the council said.
The warning was heeded by the Government, which raised the buffer to 1 percent with effect from Sept. 30, 2019, giving the banks a year to meet a requirement that the Systemic Risk Council says adds 7 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) to their existing regulatory equity requirements.
The ""vast majority"" of banks will be able to comply with the new requirement, given the sector's excess capital adequacy was 129 billion crowns in mid-2018, the council said.
Business minister Rasmus Jarlov, meanwhile, said that Denmark's Financial Services Authority (FSA) could have been more critical in its examination of Danske Bank.
""I don't understand that the authorities in Denmark and in Estonia have not reacted stronger to the many warnings that there have been,"" Jarlov told an open parliament committee meeting on Tuesday.
He said that the FSA's reopened investigation of the case would look at whether the bank could be held responsible for having given wrong information to the regulator and that he is ready to assign the resources necessary to get to the bottom of the case.
GRAPHIC: Danske Bank credibility falls - https://reut.rs/2xB4RiX
PARLIAMENTARY HEARING 
The bank's management was on Tuesday invited by parliament's business committee to explain its actions to an open hearing.
Under Danish law no one is obliged to participate in public hearings or comment under oath at them. The bank has yet to decide whether it will participate, a spokesman said.
The money laundering scandal has also hit Danske Bank's credibility among Danes, figures from polling firm Voxmeter showed on Tuesday.
The percentage of Danes who find the bank credible fell to 46 percent last week, by far the lowest level since recordings began in 2008 and much lower than peers  Jyske Bank  (CO:JYSK) and Nordea (ST:NDA) at 80 percent and 64 percent respectively, Voxmeter said.
Its figures suggest that the bank's image crisis is worse than after the 2008 financial crisis, when the Danish government had to give a guarantee to the bank's dollar creditors when international loan markets froze.
""This new case is being seen as a breach of trust by customers, and trust is a strong driver for a bank's business,"" said Voxmeter CEO Christian Stjer.
Weakening investor confidence in the bank could hurt its credit rating, DBRS said on Tuesday, while Fitch lowered the outlook for the bank's 'A' credit rating to negative from stable to reflect the potential impact of the scandal.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares closed higher on Tuesday boosted by gains among oil stocks and optimism over the Italian budget while British clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT) rallied after raising its profit guidance.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rose ended the day up 0.45 percent, recovering part of the losses suffered in the previous session when worries over a protracted U.S.-Sino trade war sparked profit-taking.
The oil and gas index (SXEP) jumped 1.7 percent and reached its highest level since May.
Oil majors  BP  (L:BP), Shell (AS:RDSa) and  ENI  (MI:ENI) rose 2.9 percent, 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent respectively more after Brent hit a fresh four-year high amid looming U.S. sanctions against Iran and an apparent reluctance by OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the expected to hit to supply.
""Russia and Saudi Arabia essentially ignoring Trump's pleas, combined with U.S. sanctions hitting Iran's oil exports in early November means we expect fresh multi year highs for oil, which will also help the oil majors such as BP and Shell to gain ground in the near term,"" LCG analyst Jasper Lawler said.
Commodities also rose with basic materials (SXPP) up 1.8 percent. 
Signs that Italy's coalition was likely to reach a compromise over the 2019 budget lifted Italian stocks and bonds with the country's top FTSE MIB (FTMIB) equity index up around 1.5 percent, outperforming the broader market.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), which are sensitive to political risk due to their big sovereign bond holdings, rose 1.5 percent. Their gains helped and growing expectations of a rate hike in the euro zone next year helped lifted the European banks (SX7P) up 0.7 percent.
State-controlled Italian defense contractor Leonardo (MI:LDOF) rose more than 3 percent after it won a helicopter order from the U.S. Air Force. 
One of the top gainer on the STOXX was Next, up 7.7 percent. 
The clothing retailer posted a 0.5 percent rise in first-half profit and raised its full-year guidance after better-than-expected trading in August and early September. 

Heavyweight drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) rose 1.7 percent after saying it would cut about 2,200 jobs in Switzerland over the next four years to help boost profitability.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 11:58AM ET</span>","Oil price above $80 lifts stocks, rate hikes expected","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - World shares climbed on Tuesday as oil prices above $80 a barrel lifted U.S. energy stocks and as some central banks were expected to raise interest rates, spurring investors to look beyond the latest round of U.S.-China tariffs.
On Wall Street, energy shares rose along with banks, which climbed in anticipation of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike later on Tuesday. But U.S. shares then lost some steam, weighed by losses in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and chipmakers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 13.91 points, or 0.05 percent, to 26,575.96, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.54 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,919.91 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 6.31 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,999.55.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.11 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) rose 0.51 percent. 
Concerns over trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, were offset by oil, which grabbed the spotlight and added to gains after surging more than 3 percent on Monday. 
OIL JUMPS
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) shot to four-year highs of almost $82 a barrel, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.
""The combination of tight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories – down from already under-stored levels – and anemic spare capacity helps support an oil price which could end the year above $90,"" Richard Robinson, manager of Ashburton's Global Energy Fund, said. 
U.S. crude  rose 0.21 percent to $72.23 per barrel and Brent  was last at $82.09, up 1.1 percent on the day.
The rise in energy shares, however, failed to squash broader market pessimism after new tariffs imposed by Beijing and Washington on each other's goods kicked in on Monday, and Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen accused the United States of putting ""a knife to China's neck.""
There are other big worries for investors too, not least the timing and pace of central bank policy tightening.
While the Fed is poised to hike rates for a third time in 2018 this week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday raised expectations the euro zone will also start to normalize policy over the coming year by referring to ""relatively vigorous"" underlying inflation and brisk wage growth.
That pushed German 10-year bond yields to four-month highs (DE10YT=RR) above 0.5 percent.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched a new four-month high (US10YT=RR) above 3.10 percent in advance of government debt supply later Tuesday and on bets about Fed interest rate hikes.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.0983 percent, from 3.078 percent late on Monday.
The U.S. dollar weakened ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting, as investors have already priced in two more interest rate increases this year and some in 2019, leaving little room for further currency gains.
The dollar index (DXY), tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.06 percent, with the euro (EUR=) up 0.16 percent to $1.1765.
Since mid-August, the dollar has declined 3.1 percent against that basket of currencies.

""The U.S. dollar appears vulnerable... given extended speculative bullish positioning against most of the G10 currencies and considerable tightening already reflected in fed funds futures,"" said Eric Theoret, currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.

Sonic is the latest U.S. restaurant to be taken private. Zoe's Kitchen was taken private by Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava last month, while NRD Capital took Ruby Tuesday private in October last year for about $335 million.
The deal comes as Sonic battles intense pricing competition from bigger rivals such as McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Wendy's Co (O:WEN). The company's same-restaurant sales have fallen for at least the past two years.
Inspire's offer values Sonic at $43.50 per share, a 19 percent premium to the stock's Monday close. Sonic's shares were trading at $43.35.
Including debt, the deal is valued at about $2.3 billion, the companies said.
Inspire Brands was formed by private equity firm Roark Capital as a holding company when Arby's completed the acquisition of Buffalo Wild Wings earlier this year.
Roark, which also owns bakery chain Cinnabon, bought a majority stake in Arby's from Wendy's Co in 2011 and purchased the remaining 12.3 percent last month.
Guggenheim Securities LLC is the financial adviser to Sonic, while Shearman & Sterling LLP is its legal counsel.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 11:04AM ET</span>",Facebook shares slip after Instagram founders quit,"(Reuters) - Shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) fell more than 2 percent in early trading on Tuesday after the two founders of photo-sharing app Instagram left the social networking giant under unexplained circumstances.
Analysts said the departure of Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger may have been the result of friction with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg over how Facebook's fastest-growing revenue generator is run.
""Our sense is the duo may have wanted to run Instagram more independently than their parent company wanted,"" said Scott Kessler, an analyst at research firm CFRA.
""We think (the) departures are a notable negative for Facebook.""
The sudden loss of the pair follows the departures of WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton and a reshuffling of Facebook's executive ranks earlier this year.
A Bloomberg report said Systrom and Krieger had been frustrated by a rise in the day-to-day involvement of Zuckerberg, who has become more reliant on Instagram in planning for Facebook's future.
Facebook's shares were down 2.4 percent at $161.51 in early trading, knocking more than $11 billion off the stock's market value.
""To the extent that their departures represent Zuckerberg exercising more power and being less accountable, such a development would underscore the need for an independent board chair,"" said Jonas Kron, senior vice president at Trillium Asset Management.
The institutional investor, which holds more than 52,000 shares in Facebook, urged Facebook in July to appoint an independent board chair to oversee management.
Systrom wrote in a blog post on Monday that he and Krieger planned to take time off and explore ""our curiosity and creativity again"".
Zuckerberg described the two as ""extraordinary product leaders"" and said he wished them all the best and was looking forward to seeing what they build next.
Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. Instagram had been hailed in Silicon Valley as a flashy acquisition done right, with the team kept relatively small and Systrom having the freedom to add features such as peer-to-peer messaging, video uploads and advertising.
Instagram has over 1 billion active monthly users, a sharp rise from the 30 million users when Facebook bought the app.
Facebook's shares are currently down about 6 percent this year, following six years of stellar gains.

Concerns over the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal and signals that a rise in costs would hurt Facebook's margins for years, fueled the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history in July.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Ryanair says it may trim expansion plans due to strikes,"By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) will consider cutting its growth plans for this winter and next summer if staff strikes continue, a senior executive said on Tuesday after announcing that 30,000 passengers will be grounded by a cabin crew strike on Friday. 
The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said in July it planned annual passenger growth of 7 percent to 139 million in the year to March 2019 and another 9 percent growth to 152 million in the year to March 2020. 
But it has said that a string of strikes by pilots and cabin crew since it recognized trade unions for the first time last December has damaged bookings just as strong increases in oil prices threaten to push up costs. 
""These repeated unnecessary strikes are damaging Ryanair’s business and our customer confidence at a time when oil prices are rising strongly,"" Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement. 
""If they continue, it is inevitable that we will have to look again at our capacity growth this winter and in summer 2019.""
Jacobs said that 30,000 people would be grounded on Friday by cabin crew strikes in Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany, which had forced it to cancel 190 of 2,400 flights. 
All affected customers have been given three day's notice of the cancellations, it said. 
Ryanair said it had made significant progress in recent weeks with union negotiations and said it had offered talks to staff from the five countries offering them improved conditions.
""We hope these unions will see common sense and work with us to finalize agreements for the benefit of our pilots and cabin crew over the coming weeks without further disrupting our customers or our flights,"" Jacobs said. 
In September 2017 Ryanair cut its planned capacity for the summer of 2018 after a shortage of standby pilots led to the cancellation of thousands of flights. 
But at the time it said its ambitious long-term growth plan to fly 200 million passengers per year by 2024 remained intact.

Its statement on Tuesday did not specify how much capacity it might cut.

Rockville, MD (Reuters) - Instagram on Monday said co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have resigned as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of the photo-sharing app owned by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), giving scant explanation for the move.
The departures at Facebook's fastest-growing revenue generator come just months after the exit of Jan Koum, co-founder of Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp, leaving the social network without the developers behind two of its biggest services.
They also come at a time when Facebook's core platform is under fire for how it safeguards customer data, as it defends against political efforts to spread false information, and as younger users increasingly prefer alternative ways to stay in touch with family and friends. Concerns over Facebook's business sparked the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history in July.
Systrom wrote in a blog post on Monday that he and Krieger planned to take time off and explore ""our curiosity and creativity again"".
Their announcement came after increasingly frequent clashes with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of Instagram, Bloomberg reported.
In a statement, Zuckerberg described the two as ""extraordinary product leaders"".
""I've learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it. I wish them all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing what they build next,"" Zuckerberg said.
INDEPENDENCE
Koum's departure in May followed the exit of his WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. 
That led to a reshuffling of Facebook's executive ranks, increasing Zuckerberg's ability to influence day-to-day operations. Zuckerberg ally Chris Cox, who leads product development for Facebook's main app, gained oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram, which had been given independence when Facebook bought them.
Adam Mosseri, who had overseen Facebook's news feed and spent a decade working closely with Zuckerberg, became Instagram's head of product.
Instagram and Facebook have operated independently and the two services barely mention each other. But as regulators have pushed Facebook to improve information safeguards for individual privacy, to combat addiction to social media, and to stop misinformation or fake news, Zuckerberg and other leaders have been under more pressure to monitor units beyond the core social network.
ACQUISITION DONE RIGHT
Systrom and Krieger notified the photo-sharing app's leadership team and Facebook on Monday about their decision to leave, Instagram said. Their departure would be soon, it said. The New York Times first reported the move.
Systrom and Krieger met through Stanford University and worked separately in Silicon Valley before forming Instagram in 2010. 
Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. The photo-sharing app has over 1 billion active monthly users and has grown by adding features such as messaging and short videos. In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, mimicking the ""stories"" feature of Snap Inc's Snapchat.
The photo app's global revenue this year is likely to exceed $8 billion, showed data from advertising consultancy EMarketer.
Increased advertising on Instagram has seen the average price-per-ad across Facebook's apps decline this year after a year of upswing. A new privacy law in Europe also has affected prices.
Instagram had been hailed in Silicon Valley as a flashy acquisition done right, with the team kept relatively small and Systrom having the freedom to add features such as peer-to-peer messaging, video uploads and advertising.
""I see Mark [Zuckerberg] practice a tremendous amount of restraint in giving us the freedom to run, but the reason why I think he gives us the freedom to run is because when we run, it typically works,"" Systrom told Recode last June.
The app's latest product, IGTV, has been slow to gain traction. Offered through Instagram and as a standalone app, IGTV serves up longer-length video content, mostly from popular Instagram users.

Video content has been a major emphasis for Facebook as it seeks to satisfy advertisers' desire to stream more commercials online.

The Dow rose 52.22, or 0.2%, to 26,614.27, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 4.21, or 0.14%, to 2,923.58. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite edged up 1.03, or 0.01%, to 7,994.27.
There were no encouraging developments in the ongoing trade war between China and the United States.
A senior Chinese official said today trade talk progress will be difficult with the U.S. putting “a knife to China’s neck” and the that the prospect of new talks depends on the will of Washington.
But the selloff in the previous session, as new tariffs went into effect, gave investors the opportunity to scoop up some cheaper shares.
The energy sector showed some strength again, as crude oil futures increased 0.69% to $72.58 a barrel, adding to Monday’s strong gains.
The bulls have been in control, with OPEC and Russia giving no inclination of a further boost in supply as the deadline for Iran oil sanctions gets nearer.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) rose about 0.8%, while Hess (NYSE:HES) gained 1%.
On the economic front, the Federal Open Market Committee starts its two-day meeting on interest rates, with traders pricing in a 100% chance of a quarter-point hike tomorrow.
But the currency markets were still predictably cautious, with the U.S. dollar index little changed, down 0.1%.

Around 10 percent of the 1,200 workers at Akzo Nobel's factory in Sassenheim joined the strike, the spokesman said, in a conflict that is focused mainly on the unions' demand that Akzo injects an extra 400 million euros ($471 million) in its pension fund.
Unions also demand a 3.5 percent pay rise. So far, Akzo has offered to increase wages, but has denied any demand for extra contributions to the pension fund.
Work stoppages were also causing a smaller Dutch factory to run at half its capacity on Tuesday, Akzo said, and were expected to hit production at a third plant on Thursday.
The company said it was too early to estimate the costs of the strikes.
Akzo Nobel earlier this year sold its Specialty Chemicals division for 10 billion euros to  Carlyle Group  (O:CG), after it fended off an unwanted takeover offer from U.S. rival PPG Industries (N:PPG) last year.
Unions demand the company uses part of those proceeds to shore up its pension fund, so that pensions can be raised to match inflation.

Buybacks cut a company's total share count, and spread the profits over fewer shares, boosting their per-share earnings and satisfying Wall Street.
After the S&P 500 started to recover from its financial crisis low in March 2009, companies that were flush with cash started to buy back shares. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, S&P 500 companies have bought back $4.4 trillion shares over the past decade, including the record-breaking buybacks from Apple that totaled $226.6 billion. No company has bought back more shares than Apple, which announced in March 2012 it would use a large chunk of cash to make the purchases. 
The amount in share repurchases executed by S&P 500 companies hit a record of $190.6 billion in the second quarter, a 58.7 % year-over-year increase, and that number is expected to keep growing for the coming months, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
“Given the record earnings, strong cash-flow, investor demand and corporate statements, the indications are that the high level will continue for the rest of the year,”  said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

813,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 09:25AM ET</span>",A crazy final week of September has already seen mergers worth $60 billion,"The final two weeks of September have seen a flurry of activity in the dealmaking space, with four major deals — and rumors of a fifth — announced in just a handful of days.
Over the weekend, the bidding war for Sky finally reached its conclusion when US broadcasting giant Comcast outbid Fox for the British company in a deal that values it at more than $40 billion.
A rare sealed auction, in which both Comcast and Fox were required to bid for Sky's assets without knowing what the other had bid,  saw Comcast outbid Fox by more than $2 per share, offering £17.28 ($22.71) per share to Fox's £15.67 ($20.60).
Sky's board immediately recommended Comcast's offer to its shareholders, and the biggest takeover in European media history was complete.
""This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally,"" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said after the deal was confirmed.
The Sky-Comcast deal has been swiftly followed by three major, albeit smaller, deals. First up, Sirius XM — the New York-based digital media company focused on satellite radio — had a  $3.5 billion bid for music-streaming service Pandora accepted on Monday.
Even bigger than Sirius XM and Pandora's tie-up was news that UK-listed  Randgold Resources is to be bought by Barrick Gold, creating an $18 billion gold-mining giant, the biggest in the world, producing in excess of 200 tonnes of gold a year.
""Our industry has been criticised for its short-term focus, undisciplined growth and poor returns on invested capital,"" Mark Bristow, Chief Executive of Randgold said in a statement. ""The merged company will be very different,"" 
He added: ""Its goal will be to deliver sector leading returns, and in order to achieve this, we will need to take a very critical view of our asset base and how we run our business, and be prepared to make tough decisions.""
The final deal of the week's mergers and acquisitions bonanza saw  Michael Kors announce Tuesday that it has agreed to buy the Italian fashion house Versace in a deal with an enterprise value of $2.1 billion. 
""We are excited to have Versace as part of our family of luxury brands, and we are committed to investing in its growth,"" Michael Kors Chairman and CEO John Idol said in a press release. 
Leaving aside the completed deals, there are also  reports that ride-sharing giant Uber is ready to bid for the London-based food-delivery platform Deliveroo. Deliveroo was valued at around $2 billion last year, and according to Bloomberg, would not be interested in selling for any price that’s not ""considerably higher"" than its current valuation. A deal between the two companies is likely a long way off, but that it is even being discussed and reported is significant.
There are numerous reasons for the recent M&A boom, which also saw  Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) buy Costa Coffee in late August. First up, big mergers tend to come towards the end of economic cycles. It's not entirely clear whether or not we're approaching the end of a cycle, or if the current economic and stock market boom will continue, but companies clearly think economic conditions are right for deals.
September, the final month of the third quarter, also tends to provide a solid time of year to go for a big deal.
""September can always be a big month for deals as projects that were put on hold, or were having finishing touches put on them over the Summer break get the sign-off from key decision makers coming back from their holidays,"" Ben Kelly, a merger arbitrage analyst at Louis Capital told Business Insider on Tuesday.
""Now we have Brexit approaching an end-game and acquirers are happy to take advantage of weak GBP to pick up assets,"" Kelly added with regards to deals for Sky and Randgold. Those deals saw non-UK firms buy British companies, using the weakness of the pound against the dollar to secure relatively less expensive buys."
814,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Germany's Altmaier defends plan to protect some industries from foreign takeovers,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Tuesday defended government efforts to shield some firms from foreign takeovers, arguing that the state had a responsibility to protect key technology and certain industrial sectors.
The takeover of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333) in 2016 spooked Germany, as did the surprise purchase earlier this year of a 9.7 percent stake in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) by Chinese carmaker Geely. 
In July, the state-controlled KfW bank bought a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz to prevent China's State Grid acquiring the shareholding, after Berlin failed to find an alternative private investor in Europe for the firm.
Speaking to business leaders at an industrial conference in Berlin, Altmaier said: ""Germany will remain the most open and most liberal country when it comes to mergers"", but the government was considering stricter takeover rules.
Berlin must be able to have a closer look at who wanted to buy parts of Germany's critical infrastructure, and senior officials are working on changes to foreign trade regulations to ensure that key technologies remain in German hands, he said.
These would include government reviews of foreign acquisitions of stakes in companies below the current 25-percent threshold and expanding which types of purchases must be examined.
A government source said last month that Berlin wants the power to investigate if an investor outside the European Union buys at least 15 percent of certain German defense-related or security-linked technology firms.
In addition, the government is considering creating a billion-euro fund that could help such firms in financial trouble, another government source told Reuters last week.
""We are currently working on an industrial strategy for the Federal Republic of Germany, where we want to clarify our interests,"" said Altmaier, a senior figure among Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative cabinet members.
In this new industrial strategy, the government would define areas from which the state would have to refrain while also identifying industrial sectors where the state could intervene.
Altmaier pointed to efforts to support the European production of battery cells for electric cars, underlining his willingness to subsidize such a venture for a limited period of time until it was profitable on its own.

Battery cells are a key battleground in the automotive industry as it shifts to electric motors. Currently the industry sources its requirements mainly from Asian manufacturers.

""This situation is totally irresponsible,"" the union said. Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands are planning a 24-hour strike on Sept. 28 over Ryanair's labor agreements. They plan to strike once a month until their demands are met.
Some pilots' associations are also planning to join the strike.
The Belgian cabin crew union predicted that the strike would be the biggest ever seen in Europe and cause the cancellation of about 80 percent of flights from Charleroi Airport and probably all of the airline's flights from Brussels Airport.
Earlier in September, Ryanair rejected claims by the unions that the strike would cause ""travel chaos"" and said the airline would warn affected customers of a small number of flight cancellations.
During a walkout by pilots and crew earlier this month, the airline was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 German flights.

Customers on Twitter have asked the Irish airline about the status of their flights on Sept. 28. Ryanair has responded to some that it expects ""the vast majority of cabin crew to work as normal on Sept. 28, as they have during previous strikes"" and that ""all fights are scheduled to operate.""

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Barrick-Randgold Deal Is Putting the Shine Back on Gold Miners,"(Bloomberg) -- Call it the shot heard ’round the gold industry.
As more than 1,100 gold mining executives, metals analysts and investors made their annual retreat to the mountains of Colorado, all anyone seemed to want to talk about was the deal that was announced just hours earlier. Mark Bristow, the outspoken chief executive officer of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. who helped arrange the merger with Barrick Gold Corp., didn’t seem surprised.
“I have been agitating for this industry to rearrange itself,” Bristow said in an interview at the Denver Gold Forum in Colorado Springs. “Everyone just wants to keep their own little space, and that’s the challenge.”
The days of keeping one’s own space may now be numbered as the Barrick-Randgold merger became the hottest topic of conversation at the conference, one of the biggest annual gatherings in the gold world. Bullion prices have been stuck in the doldrums all year and investors have punished mining equities with an exodus. The sector had lost its shine, but the new deal is being welcomed for its jolt of excitement, and at least some hoped, as a harbinger of the things to come.
“The industry needs more consolidation,” David Harquail, CEO of Franco-Nevada Corp., said in an interview during the conference. “We’ve got way too many companies. We’ve been shrinking in terms of value, so we should be shrinking in terms of number of companies proportionate to the value. This might be a good example of what other companies should be considering.”
Out of Favor
The proposed merger for Toronto-based Barrick and Randgold, the gold industry’s biggest deal in three years, comes as shares of bullion producers had this month fallen to the cheapest relative to the metal since 2016. The sector is so out of favor that Vanguard Group has said it will change the name of its precious-metals fund and reduce the portion of its holdings within the sector. Barrick and Randgold rallied after the deal was announced.
“Frankly, the biggest problem we have now is that large institutional shareholders don’t want to invest in an industry that has, for many years, lost money,” said Hugo Dryland, an executive vice chairman and the global head of mining and metals at Rothschild Inc. “There’s been too little M&A, too little movement on the inefficiencies in the industry.”
With Bristow set to become CEO at a combined Barrick-Rangold, he’ll fill a “vacuum of putting someone with a great tech background at the top of the business,” Dryland said, speaking from beneath a shady awning on a sun-drenched patio that was buzzing with mining executives and investors. Chatter about the deal, which was announced overnight before the conference started on Monday, could be overheard in hallways and outdoor spaces all day.
John Thornton, who as Barrick’s executive chairman put together the company’s offer to buy the Africa-focused rival, said the transaction was years in the making. He spoke alongside Bristow at the ""Everest"" cottage at the Colorado Springs Broadmoor resort, where the industry conference is being held. The cottage had been transformed into something of a makeshift war room. It was the first interview for both men since the deal was announced.
Barrick’s Munk
Peter Munk, Barrick’s company’s recently deceased founder, had been part of the discussions that eventually led to the deal, Thornton said.
“Peter and I discussed this deal one hundred times during the whole evolution,’’ Thornton, 64, said. “We had a meeting in the minds.”
The deal is also reviving speculation Barrick may return to the negotiating table with  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM). for a new tie-up after talks between the two collapsed in 2014 over differences on issues including the leadership of the combined company.
Thornton and Bristow declined to comment on Newmont specifically, but stressed that their merger doesn’t preclude other partnerships or even mergers as long as they make sense. A spokesman for Newmont, Omar Jabara, declined to comment.
Thornton noted that during his tenure at Barrick, he’s spoken to every major gold-mining company in the world about deals that might make sense, including mergers and other transactions “of consequence,” he said. His only “red line” was that he wouldn’t pay a premium.
‘Big Premiums’
“The gold mining industry is littered with the reverse, which is big premiums that destroy shareholder value,” Thornton said.
If approved, the merger would also add Randgold copper assets to the greater portfolio. A spinoff of those assets isn’t in the cards, Bristow said, and for now the company will not be creating a discrete copper business, something Thornton recently raised as a possibility.
“It’s not going to create a copper business, it’s going to have those copper assets embedded in the regional management teams,” Bristow said. “We’ve got enough copper expertise and we will manage them.”
The merger was preceded by nine months of intensive talks and a visit by the entire Barrick board to Kibali, a Randgold site in northeastern Congo, the executives said.
“I believe in the strategic merits of this deal and think that the new Barrick has the potential to become the industry leader in profitability and value,” said Marcelo Kim, a partner at Paulson & Co. who’s attending the Colorado conference. “This will all come down to execution and if there’s one team that brings the credibility to do it, it is the Randgold team,” he said by email.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 06:05AM ET</span>","Novartis to cut 2,550 jobs in Switzerland, UK in profit push","By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Novartis  (S:NOVN) will cut 2,550 jobs in Switzerland and Britain over four years, it said on Tuesday, as the Swiss drugmaker strives to boost profits and focus on new medicines.
Switzerland will bear the brunt, with 2,150 cuts planned at four factories and its Swiss-based business services unit. Some 400 jobs will also go in Grimsby, northeast England, where the company will close a plant that makes pills. 
Novartis currently employs around 124,000 people worldwide. But following the planned spin-off of eyecare unit Alcon in early 2019, that will fall to fewer than 100,000 people by 2022, Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said. 
Novartis's network of 66 global factories is operating below capacity after the expiry of patents on high-volume pills such as Diovan for heart disease, he added. 
As the company shifts to gene therapies and biologics like arthritis treatment Cosentyx, Narasimhan said the cuts were needed to help him boost the drugs unit's operating margin to around 35 percent of sales, what he calls the industry standard, from 31.3 percent now.
""Our medicines portfolio is evolving from high-volume products to more specialized and more personalized innovative medicines,"" the 42-year-old U.S. doctor told reporters. 
""We don't need the same scale we've historically needed. That's the evolution you're seeing in our portfolio, and that's being reflected in our manufacturing footprint.""
Unions blasted the move, saying the Swiss pharmaceuticals industry would be the worse for it.
""There will be massively damaging side effects for Swiss workers, the drug industry and Switzerland's export economy,"" Employees Switzerland wrote in a statement. ""We're not going to let Novartis destroy Basel as a center of industry.""
MORE TO COME? 
Narasimhan, whose company's net income rose 15 percent last year to $7.7 billion, is seeking to transform Novartis from a traditional pills maker to a maker of cutting-edge therapies like its $475,000-per-patient Kymriah cancer treatment.
He announced the sale of a U.S. generics drugs business last month to India's Aurobindo (NS:ARBN) and a consumer healthcare joint venture to GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) earlier this year. 
Meanwhile, he spent $8.7 billion to take over U.S.-based Avexis to get its experimental gene therapy against potentially deadly spinal muscular atrophy that is nearing a filing for U.S. approval.
The cuts join those at other drugmakers: 1,000 Takeda (T:4502) workers will be affected as it moves a U.S. headquarters, while GlaxoSmithKline is axing 650 U.S. jobs.
Severin Schwan, CEO of Novartis's crosstown rival Roche (S:ROG), said this month he also had his eyes on costs as his top-selling medicines face incursions from cheaper copies.
Novartis's restructuring comes as part of a program announced in 2016 to save about $1 billion annually, Narasimhan said. Previous moves have included closing a U.S. pill factory in Colorado that resulted in 450 job losses, as well as redundancies in Japan.
The company did not announce the cost of the latest cuts, but said it would take charges over the four-year period.
The net effect of the restructuring is about 2,100 jobs lost, Novartis said, taking into account new positions it is creating at soon-to-be-built Swiss facilities to make Kymriah. 
Novartis shares were up about 0.8 percent at 0900 GMT.
Analysts said the measures were in line with expectations - this month, Novartis Chairman Joerg Reinhardt hinted they were coming. 
""The company's ambition to deliver a mid-30s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin in Innovative Medicines requires productivity programs,"" UBS analyst Michael Leuchten said. 

""We expect the above will not be the last program to be announced.""

826,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 05:37AM ET</span>",Unilever defends plan to go Dutch in charm offensive,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) executives took to the British press and airwaves on Tuesday to defend their plan to base a new single headquarters in the Netherlands in the face of opposition from several prominent shareholders.
The plan by the Anglo-Dutch company has become a hot topic in Britain where it has become entangled in the debate over Brexit and its impact on the economy. 
Two main practical concerns are around the forced selling of Unilever shares by some British investors because Unilever will drop out of the benchmark FTSE 100 index (FTSE), and the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends.
In a coordinated charm offensive, Chairman Marijn Dekkers wrote an op-ed in the Daily Telegraph, while Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
Both stressed that the maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream remained committed to Britain, with over 60 percent of its business run from London, and repeated arguments for why the move will benefit the company and its shareholders.
""The benefits we get, which accrue to all shareholders, are the ability to manage our portfolio of brands and businesses more dynamically in many ways,"" Pitkethly said. 
The company decided to collapse its dual-headed structure following a review sparked by last year's unsolicited $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft-Heinz (O:KHC).
It says the move will improve governance and make it more agile, particularly when it comes to big-ticket deals.
David Cumming, chief investment officer of equities at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, a top-20 Unilever shareholder, told BBC Radio that it looked like Unilever was moving to the Netherlands for better takeover protection following Kraft's approach. 
""After 90 years with a dual structure, it seems a little bit of a coincidence,"" Cumming said. 
""I think they will struggle, because I don't see logically why any UK shareholder would support Unilever's decision to go Dutch."" 
Responding to the comment about takeover protection, Pitkethly said ""the best form of protectionism is great performance"". 
BLOW BEFORE BREXIT 
Unilever has said repeatedly that its Dutch future had nothing to do with Brexit. Still, its departure would be a blow for the British government as it struggles to negotiate its divorce from the European Union and preserve its place as a central hub for business and finance. 
Brexit opponents have warned its exit was a sign of business losing faith in the country. Brexit supporters, meanwhile, pointed to Unilever's ongoing commitment to its UK staff and operations.
For the proposal to pass, it needs approval from 75 percent of the UK PLC's voted shares, and 50 percent of the Dutch NV's. 
It also needs to be endorsed by a majority of shareholders.
If approved, at votes scheduled for Oct. 25 and 26, the existing shares would stop trading on Dec. 21, with the new shares beginning to trade on Dec. 24. 
Four top-20 shareholders, including Aviva, have voiced concern or disapproval. Together, they control about 5.5 percent of the British entity's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.
A promise by the Dutch government to scrap its 15 percent withholding tax on dividends was seen as helping to lure Unilever to the Netherlands. Yet the promise faces opposition by domestic critics and has become a hot political issue.

Chairman Dekkers said on Tuesday that the dividends will not face a new form of tax. The company has laid out an alternative plan to distribute capital in the event that the tax is not abolished.

Crossing the 30 percent threshold means that the U.S. cable company must offer to buy out other investors at the formal offer price of 17.28 pounds per share, valuing Sky at around 30.6 billion pounds ($40.2 billion).
That knockout Comcast bid beat a 15.67 pound offer from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) in a rare auction held over the weekend.
Shares in Comcast, owner of Universal Pictures and NBC network, fell on Monday on concerns about how much the company had paid to clinch the deal.
Fox holds a 39 percent stake in Sky, stemming from Murdoch's role in its creation nearly three decades ago, which it is selling to Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) as part of a separate deal.
Neither Fox nor Disney have said what they intend to do with the stake.
Comcast's winning bid quickly received the backing of Sky independent directors on Saturday. They said Comcast's offer was ""materially superior"" to Fox's, and they urged shareholders to accept it immediately.
Comcast said it was seeking to make further market purchases of Sky shares at a price of 17.28 per share.
Sky's shares were trading at 17.27 pounds in early deals on Tuesday.

Comcast needs 50 percent of the stock plus one share to complete its takeover. It is hoping to wrap up the deal by the end of next month.

(Reuters) -  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) named insider Jack Bowles to succeed Nicandro Durante as chief executive officer on Tuesday, giving him the task of adapting to new tobacco formats as smoking declines.
""I am confident that we will take full advantage of these opportunities as we accelerate the transformation of BAT into a stronger multi category tobacco and nicotine products company,"" Bowles said in a statement revealing his appointment.
Shares in the maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes fell by more than 2 percent and were the top loser on the UK bluechip index (FTSE) following the appointment of Bowles, who is chief operating officer of BAT's international business.
Bowles, 54, joined the world's second-biggest international tobacco company by revenue in 2004 and has worked in Western Europe, Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. He will become CEO designate on Nov. 1 and join the board on Jan. 1.
Durante plans to retire on April 1 next year, after nearly 37 years with BAT. Although its shares have risen by about 50 percent during his near eight-year tenure as CEO, they have fallen more than 23 percent in the past 12 months.
Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said last week that he hoped the change would prompt improved disclosure and communication. 
BAT said in July that it was confident of exceeding 1 billion pounds in revenue from next generation products this year, as new launches should bolster growth in the second half after a slowdown in some key markets such as Japan and Korea.
It plans to test its new Eclipse tobacco heating device in the United States this year, seeking to overtake Philip Morris (N:PM) in the world's biggest vaping market.
Philip Morris leads in the global tobacco heating market with its IQOS device. Companies say these devices may be more satisfying to smokers than traditional e-cigarettes because they are made with tobacco rather than nicotine-laced liquid.

Rival British tobacco company Imperial Brands (L:IMB) announced plans on Tuesday to launch a heated tobacco product early next year.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 03:26AM ET</span>",Out of fashion? H&M tests new store to get back in vogue,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Step into one of the more than 4,300 H&M (ST:HMb) budget fashion stores around the world and you often know what to expect: clothes racks crammed with tops, trousers and skirts in a spartan and sometimes cluttered environment.
H&M executives say that's no longer good enough. Sales have stagnated for years, the company's shares have lost nearly two-thirds of their value since 2015 and more nimble rivals have adapted faster to the rapidly shifting retail landscape.
Now, at a spruced-up pilot store in H&M's home town of Stockholm, the chain founded in 1947 is testing new concepts that mark a break with its past - and partly echo some tactics already deployed by rivals to attract shoppers. 
The H&M store in the upmarket Karlaplan neighborhood of the Swedish capital offers a smaller range of selected clothes, displayed on airy shelves and tables in color-coordinated sections - as well as espressos and invitation-only events.
H&M planned the layout and ranges with affluent local customers in mind, marking a shift from offering relatively standardized ranges across its stores to catering more for local tastes and means.
""It's an appealing store, visually, and also the range feels appealing to me. I'm more inclined to head here first rather than to the other stores,"" said Josefin Klegard, 38, sipping sparkling wine at an event for local loyalty club members with a pop-up beauty parlor and H&M designers talking about trends.
In Karlaplan, there's a high concentration of clothes from H&M's more upmarket lines such as ""Trend"" and ""Premium Quality"", which is usually only available online. H&M's Swedish website sells ""Premium Quality"" leather coats for 3,499 crowns ($397) while most H&M coats are priced well below 1,000 crowns. 
""We have to raise the entire quality level: to have fewer items in, a nicer presentation of the goods,"" said Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson, the grandson of H&M's founder.
""That is a task, to be able to sell more with less, and to do that in a cost-efficient way,"" he told Reuters.
SLUGGISH SALES
After decades of rapid expansion, H&M had 4,801 stores in 69 countries at the end of May, making it the world's second biggest fashion retailer after Spain's  Inditex  (MC:ITX), which owns the Zara brand. But more than two years of sluggish sales had left H&M with $4.1 billion of unsold stock.
A recovery in sales in H&M's third quarter suggests it might have stopped the rot, but analysts suspect the improvement was largely due to price cuts to shift stock, at the expense of profitability.
Full third-quarter figures are due on Sept. 27.
Majority-owned by the founding Persson family, H&M finally admitted in January it had a problem for a while with its H&M branded stores, which make up the bulk of its business.
Company executives admit they neglected the health of H&M stores as they focused on building online sales and developing eight new, mostly higher-end brands, such as COS and ARKET - even though the H&M brand accounts for over 90 percent of sales.
It was the crowds and clutter at H&M's store in New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) that turned off 21-year-old student Nicole Archie, who now prefers online sites such as  Boohoo  (L:BOOH) or Fashion Nova.
""I remember the line being so long that I went to go sit on a bench near the shoes,"" she said. ""There were laces and strings all over the floor and tangled. If I wanted to purchase a shoe, I wouldn't be able to because everything was so stuck together.""
Those kinds of shortcomings allowed rivals to steal a march on H&M as customers started to look for so-called destination stores with more attractive layouts and other things to do besides shopping.
Inditex has shut smaller Zara outlets to focus on large, sleek stores in prime shopping areas that are well integrated with its website, helping to keep sales powering ahead.
U.S. department store Nordstrom (N:JWN) has opened in small neighborhood locations in Los Angeles, offering everything from handbag repair to juice bars to manicures. 
Rival U.S. retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) has closed unprofitable locations and is investing in smaller but more open stores, with bigger fitting rooms complete with phone chargers and adjustable lighting.

'LUXURY BRAND'
The pilot store in Stockholm shows H&M is finally getting the message.
""After talking to the customers, we've been wanting to create a warmer and more personal feeling,"" Anna Tillberg, head of H&M's innovation think-tank the Laboratory, which is developing the new concept.
H&M invites loyalty club members from the area to yoga classes and mingle events in a store that has been refurbished with wooden floors, lush greenery, broad aisles, a cafe corner and spacious changing rooms. 
""It's a total change. This is like a concept store. It's much better now. There's no garbage or plastic or packaging anywhere,"" Mathilda Moncetti, 27, said at a recent event. ""The interior feels like a luxury brand."" 
Sitting by the in-store espresso machine, Daniel Claesson, head of business development and online at H&M, said the revamp had increased both the store's sales and footfall. H&M declined to give figures.
""We've learnt loads,"" he said. ""Here we've seen proof of the results of being more relevant for the customer we have right here.""
The company said in February that it expected sales in stores open one financial year or more to return to growth in 2019. Besides the new store concept, H&M also plans to adapt ranges to local tastes in many more stores.
The company, which rents its store space, is shutting underperforming H&M stores faster than usual, sometimes swapping the budget brand for one of its better-performing ones. It has also turned some regular H&M stores into discount outlets. 
But some investors fear it could all be too little too late.
Norwegian investment fund Odin Fonder https://odinfundmanagement.com has sold all its H&M shares, saying it was unsure Persson was the best person to steer the chain through the industry's rapid transformation.
""We think it needs to close at least 1,000 stores, and that just as many need to be refurbished,"" the fund said.

Glencore said in July it would buy back shares worth up to $1 billion in a program of purchases running to the end of 2018. It has now extended the program to the end of February 2019. 
The London-listed miner, with a market capitalization of $61 billion, announced plans to repurchase shares after the U.S. government investigation into bribery and corruption sent the stock down more than 15 percent since the start 2018.
Companies across the mining industry have been handing money back to shareholders after a recovery from the mining and commodity crash of 2015-16 and in response to pressure from investors not to spend cash on buying assets that they say may never deliver returns.
Global miner  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) said last week it will return $3.2 billion to shareholders from its sale of Australian coal assets in addition to existing buyback programs.
Glencore's share price had already been hit by concerns about political risk in Democratic Republic of Congo, where it mines just over a quarter of the global output of cobalt, because of a mining code that was signed into law in June.
After publishing first-half results just below analyst forecasts in August, the company, which has aggressively slashed its debt since 2015, said it would favor share buybacks over deal-making.
Many mining stocks have pared gains over the past few months as metals markets weakened in response to global trade tensions and uncertainty about Chinese demand.

GAM, which said on Tuesday no other staff were under investigation, said director Tim Haywood's potential conduct issues related to failure to conduct sufficient due diligence and failure to make accessible some internal records.
""Additionally, the investigation concluded that Mr Haywood may have breached the company's signatory policy and may have used his personal email for work purposes. He also breached the company's gifts and entertainment policy,"" the Swiss group said in a statement.
There was no immediate comment from Haywood.
GAM said it took the unidentified whistleblower's information very seriously whilst ensuring that it protected the person's identity and the fact that the person had come forward. 
""In November 2017, an internal investigation, supported by independent external counsel, was launched. In March 2018, the whistleblower expanded on the initial concerns and contacted the FCA whilst keeping the company informed,"" it said. 
GAM has begun liquidating nine funds whose trading it halted in July after suspending Haywood. The funds represented 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.5 billion) in assets under management at the end of July.
""The liquidation of the ARBF funds which ensures that all investors are treated equally and fairly is continuing, with between 60 percent and 87 percent of the funds returned to date,"" it said.
The second liquidation payments will start this week as it converts more fund assets to cash and returns money to investors ""over the following months, dependent on market conditions"". 
""No material client detriment has been identified to date and we continue to keep this under review,"" it added.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 09:21PM ET</span>",Sears CEO Lampert offers new deals to avert bankruptcy,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) Chief Executive Eddie Lampert, a major investor in the company, has proposed rescue deals to help the department store chain avoid bankruptcy as debt matures next month and it faces a cash crunch, according to a regulatory filing released on Monday.
Billionaire Lampert, who also runs hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, said the 125-year-old department store chain should take steps reduce its debt load to $1.2 billion from $5.6 billion. Lampert and his hedge fund, which he controls, own about 50 percent of Sears, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Lampert said Sears should offer creditors options to extend their debt or exchange it for new holdings, giving Sears more time to turn its business around. 
Lampert said the company should continue selling real estate to reduce debt by $1.5 billion and that ESL would be a back-up bidder for the properties.
Sears said it has referred Lampert's proposal to a special committee.
In an internal message seen by Reuters, Sears said, ""We will now be working aggressively to execute liability management transactions so that we can extend our runway and continue executing on our transformation strategy."" 
The proposals came as a Sears special committee weighs a prior offer from Lampert to acquire the retailer's Kenmore appliances brand and its home services business for as much as $480 million. Sears warned this month it could go out of business as it waits for approval from the committee on the deal. 
The U.S. government agency overseeing the pensions of 100,000 of the company's former workers must also approve a sale of Kenmore.
Sears' shares, worth $30 in 2015, were down 3 percent at $1.24 Monday.
Credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings Inc said it viewed Lampert's proposed deal as ""challenging to execute."" Even if the deal is done, Sears would still need significant cash to operate because of challenges in retail, the ratings agency said.
In recent decades, Sears, which was the world's largest retailer in the 1960s, has struggled in the face of declining foot traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores. 

In another attempt to avoid bankruptcy, money-losing Sears last year sold its Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (N:SWK) for $900 million.

TCI, founded by Chris Hohn and the third largest shareholder in LSE, has cut its stake to 1.79 percent from 5.05 percent, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.
LSE shareholders voted by 79.07 to 20.93 percent at an extraordinary general meeting in December to defeat a resolution that aimed to ditch chairman Donald Brydon over the way he handled the departure of former CEO Xavier Rolet. 
TCI called for the vote after accusing the board of forcing Rolet out.

As China steps up infrastructure spending in a bid to offset the economic impact of trade frictions with the United States, it has vowed to minimize financial risk and prevent local governments from taking on too much debt.
It is now establishing a budget performance evaluation and management system that will supervise all investment and financing activities by both central and local governments, China Daily said.
It will also cover public-private partnerships and China's sovereign wealth fund, and will include provisions to suspend funding for projects with ""serious problems"", the report added.
The newspaper said Chinese local governments issued debt worth 378.9 billion yuan ($55.27 billion) last week, a record weekly high. 
Total outstanding local government debt stood at 17.66 trillion yuan ($2.58 trillion) by the end of August, according to figures from the Ministry of Finance, about 18 percent of China's GDP in 2017.
China has already drawn up guidelines to control hidden local government debt as it tries to crack down on the illegal use of corporate financing mechanisms to fund public projects.
The debt-ridden rustbelt province of Liaoning in China's northeast has also established a parliamentary committee to scrutinize government spending and control debt, the first province to do so.

(Reuters) - The sleek Juul electronic cigarettes have become a phenomenon at U.S. high schools, vexing educators and drawing regulatory scrutiny over their sweet flavors and high nicotine content.
Now, a new wave of lower-priced Juul knock-offs is showing up at convenience stores, vape shops and online - despite a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rule banning the sale of new e-cigarette products after August 2016 without regulatory approval.
Start-ups and major tobacco firms have launched more than a dozen new high-nicotine devices with Juul-like designs since the FDA imposed the deadline, according to a Reuters review of the companies’ online advertisements, social media posts and public statements.
The FDA earlier this month threatened to ban Juul and four other leading vaping products unless their makers take steps to prevent use by minors. But the warning came after companies introduced a slew of new Juul copycats following the August 2016 deadline with no regulatory consequences.
In a statement to Reuters, the agency said it was investigating whether certain brands are being improperly sold without FDA approval and that it “plans to take additional action on this front very soon.” The agency said it would focus on products with high-nicotine concentrations and flavors appearing to target young people, and take “swift action wherever appropriate.”
The FDA set the August 2016 deadline to rein in the fast-growing industry but allowed sales of Juul and other older devices to continue without regulatory approval until 2022.
The companies that started marketing new devices after the deadline include startup firms such as Kandypens, Myle Vapor and VGOD, as well as large multinational tobacco companies including  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc and Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) Plc.
Kandypens touted its new Rubi vaping device last October - more than 14 months after the August 2016 cutoff - with an Instagram post saying it had been “working hard over here for the last 12 months” on the product. Vaping distributor VGOD posted on its website in May that it was “an honor to finally introduce the STIG,” referencing its Stig Pods, a disposable three-pack of high-nicotine devices.
British American Tobacco chief executive Nicandro Durante said on a July 2018 earnings call that the company would be launching its higher-nicotine Vuse Alto product in the United States the following month. Imperial Brands announced its myblu brand of e-cigarettes in a February 2018 press release.
Kandypens, Myle and VGOD did not respond to requests for comment.
Spokespeople for Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco said their products were compliant and on the market before August 2016. Imperial Brands said it had purchased an existing e-cigarette brand and renamed it. British American Tobacco did not respond to questions about its marketing or sales.
A spokeswoman for Juul Labs Inc, Victoria Davis, said the company is cooperating with regulators and working to prevent underage use of a product designed to help adult smokers quit tobacco cigarettes. 
“No minor or non-nicotine user should ever try Juul,” Davis said.
E-cigarettes vaporize a liquid that contains nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush. The Juul design mimics a flash drive - with plug-in cartridges of concentrated nicotine juice. It is far more compact than earlier vaping devices and produces less vapor, making it easy to use without being detected - an attribute some health advocates say attracts teenagers.
Juul’s imitators are also small and compatible with higher-nicotine blends, though some can also be filled with lower-strength juice.
The Chinese company Suorin introduced several such devices to the United States over the past year. Many high-schoolers and college students said they have switched to these products because buying widely available nicotine liquids is less expensive than Juul pods. 
In a statement, Suorin said it didn’t have “clear guidance” from the FDA on regulations governing its newer products but hopes to better understand how to fully comply. The company said its products are only intended for adult smokers.
One Juul pod has the nicotine content of about 20 cigarettes – the number in a traditional pack – according to Juul’s marketing. A pod can be consumed in a day by a heavy user, according to interviews with Juul customers.
Many of the newest blends from Juul and its imitators - called “nicotine salts” in the industry - contain a compound called benzoic acid, which lowers the pH level of the liquid. That reduction allows users to take in more nicotine without a bitter taste, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In addition to the devices, dozens of high-nicotine e-liquids have arrived on the market with names such as “frozen mystery pop,” “rainbow drops” and “Tokyo chocolate banana,” which critics say are designed to attract young customers.
Vaping proponents argue the Juul and similar new products give cigarette smokers looking to quit a much better option than lower-nicotine e-cigarettes.
“It gives the same exact sensation as a cigarette, except you don’t wake up coughing at 2 a.m.,” said Charles Trejo, a manager at V for Vape, a Los Angeles retailer.
Public health researchers say high-nicotine vaping devices like the Juul have proven adept at drawing in new customers, including teenagers, who never used tobacco.
“What they’re doing is creating addicts in large numbers,” said Dr. Robert Jackler, a professor who heads a group studying the impact of tobacco advertising at Stanford University.
High-nicotine vaping devices amount to a “weaponisation” of the drug, he said, citing research showing young people are particularly susceptible to nicotine addiction, which could lead them to other addictions including cigarettes.
HIGH SCHOOL 'JUUL ROOMS'
The companies launched the copycat devices as Juul’s market share surged from 13.6 percent of the e-cigarette market in early 2017 to more than 70 percent now, according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysis of Nielsen retail data, which does not include online sales.
The FDA’s regulation of e-cigarettes has come under scrutiny in recent months as Juul’s popularity has taken off. Anti-smoking advocates complained about the Juul lookalikes in an August letter to the FDA, saying the agency had failed to assert its authority over companies that had “evaded the review process.” The FDA said it planned to respond to the letter but declined further comment.
Vaping increased by nearly eightfold between 2011 and 2017 among U.S. high school students, according to the most recent CDC data. Experts say last year’s survey likely underestimates the increase because it was conducted before a surge in Juul sales.
Many high schools have resorted to locking bathrooms – jokingly called “Juul rooms” by students. Marcella Bianco, who helps develop school anti-vaping curriculum for the non-profit organization Catch My Breath, said elementary schools have recently started requesting materials.
Educators fear the high-nicotine devices could erode decades of progress in reducing youth tobacco use. Smoking among high school students declined from 15.8 percent to 7.6 percent between 2011 and 2017, according to the CDC, but e-cigarette use grew from 1.5 percent to 11.7 percent over the same period.
“It’s like a flashback to 20 years ago,” said Kathryn Hensley, a school board member in St. Lucie County, Fla. “Are we starting all over again?”
E-cigarettes have occupied a regulatory gray area in the United States since they emerged a decade ago. Only in 2016 did the FDA finalize rules to regulate e-cigarettes, including the requirement that companies get approval for new products.
Research on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes is limited. They are widely viewed as safer than tobacco cigarettes because they don’t contain the same cocktail of toxic and cancer-causing chemicals.
The U.K. Royal College of Physicians said in a 2016 report that e-cigarettes were 95 percent less harmful than smoking tobacco, citing a reduction in the risk of serious disease and death. The CDC has said e-cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes but has not assigned a specific risk reduction because the products can vary widely.
Some health experts are particularly worried about the impact of nicotine from e-cigarettes on adolescents. Research from a 2016 U.S. Surgeon General’s report found that such exposure could have “lasting adverse consequences for brain development and cognition” on teenagers. A study released by the National Academy of Sciences this year cited evidence that vaping among young people increases the risk of eventually smoking tobacco.
BANNED IN OTHER COUNTRIES
High-nicotine vaping devices and liquids are not allowed in many other parts of the world, including in the European Union and the United Kingdom, which have both set nicotine limits at 20 mg/mL in e-cigarette liquids. Regulators said that level was effective for most smokers trying to quit.
Juul pods are rated at 59 mg/mL, according to the company’s marketing. Israeli regulators last month banned Juul out of concern over its high nicotine content, saying the device “posed serious danger to public health.” 
Davis, the Juul Labs spokeswoman, said in August the company was “incredibly disappointed” with what it called the Israeli government’s “misguided decision” to crack down on healthier alternatives to tobacco cigarettes.
The company has since introduced a lower-nicotine version of the product in Israel that it says complies with regulations there. Davis said Juul believes the higher-nicotine version of the product still provides the best option for smokers trying to quit.
Imperial Brands’ new myblu product arrived in the United States earlier this year. Matt Kessler, a spokesman for Fontem Ventures, the Imperial Brands unit that owns myblu, said the brand complies with the FDA rules because it is a re-imagination of a similar e-cigarette that was marketed by a company that Imperial brands acquired a year earlier.
The new myblu brand, however, offers 4 percent nicotine strength, meaning at least 40 mg/mL, according to company advertising, higher than any previously offered by the earlier e-cigarette model, called My Von Erl.
Devices that vaporize higher-nicotine liquids fall under the definition of new products subject to FDA review, according to the 2016 regulation. Kessler declined to comment further on nicotine levels in myblu, saying only that the product “is compliant with FDA regulations.”
Durante, the CEO of British American Tobacco, acknowledged on the July earnings call that its Vuse Alto device had not been widely available before the August 2016 deadline. He said that’s not required under FDA rules.
“To be grandfathered” by the FDA, he said, “you could be in market, in one store, two stores only in the whole country.” 
The FDA declined to comment on whether myblu and Vuse Alto are compliant or if availability in one or two stores would be considered “on the market.” The agency said it would consider “the totality of the evidence” to decide a whether a vaping product had been commercially available before the regulatory deadline.
STRUGGLE TO QUIT
As new high-nicotine Juul competitors arrive, vaping enthusiasts on YouTube are posting reviews of the next “Juul killer” aiming to take a piece of the red-hot market.
Milo Gringlas, a freshman at Cornell University, said Juul has become so ubiquitous on campus that a popular late-night food truck now sells vaping devices and nicotine liquids. 
“Everybody either has one or is looking for one,” he said.
Austin Tompkins, who lives in Los Angeles, has struggled for the last six months to kick his addiction to Juul, which he started using about three years ago, when he was 19. He realized he needed to stop when he would wake up in the middle of the night needing another hit.
In his latest attempt, he’s made it two months without vaping. The urge hasn’t gone away.

“I’m telling you, right now, I would love a hit of a Juul,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) will pay $5 million to address ""robo-signed"" proofs of claim filed in consumer bankruptcy cases involving 71,448 Macy's-branded credit card accounts, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday.
The proofs of claim were filed between 2012 and 2015 by employees of a third-party vendor who did not review their contents, and had been working on behalf of Citigroup affiliate Department Stores National Bank, which issued the accounts.
According to a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Gainesville, Georgia, Citigroup learned of problems with the vendor's practices after it began servicing the accounts in July 2015, and notified the government the following month.
Citigroup has complied with applicable bankruptcy signing requirements since it began filing proofs of claim on DNSB's behalf, and has adopted procedures to avoid a recurrence, the filing said.
The $5 million payment will be distributed pro rata, with affected cardholders receiving refunds of about $70 each.
Citigroup, based in New York, said in a statement it was pleased to resolve the matter, and regretted any inconvenience to customers.
Macy's Inc (N:M) was not accused of wrongdoing.
Creditors file proofs of claim in bankruptcy cases to set forth how much they believe they should recover and why. 

Robo-signing involves the systematic approval of documents that have not been read. The practice was a cause of the U.S. housing crisis last decade, enabling marginal borrowers to obtain loans they did not qualify for.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest version of the heavily armored U.S. presidential limousine known as ""The Beast"" is making its debut in New York City this week.
The custom-built Cadillac produced by General Motors Co (N:GM) appeared for the first time in public on Sunday -- along with an identical version that travels in the motorcade -- when it ferried President Donald Trump around New York ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly meetings.
The previous version of the limo first appeared in January 2009 just before Barack Obama took office. Obama told Jerry Seinfeld in 2015 that the limo is ""a Caddy basically on a tank frame."" Obama said he ""could call a nuclear submarine right here"" from a phone in the car. 
GM won contracts worth $15.8 million for two phases of the development of the limo from 2014 through 2017, according to federal contracting records, but it is not clear if that represents all development costs. In 2010, GM won a $35 million contract from the Secret Service for additional presidential limousine vehicles.
GM declined to discuss specifics of the new vehicle.
The Secret Service posted a photo on Monday of two new limousines on Twitter. ""The Secret Service is ready to roll into #UNGA 2018!"" the agency wrote https://twitter.com/SecretService/status/1044306340292833280. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Experts say the presidential limousine has run-flat tires, bulletproof glass and a completely sealed interior to ward off a chemical attack, among many other high-tech security features. It also has extensive electronic communications equipment.
Car and Driver magazine said the headlights from the new version appear to be borrowed from a Cadillac Escalade SUV, and the new grille appears to be influenced by its 2016 Escala concept. The magazine said the ""car's proportions are considerably more attractive than the previous, somewhat Frankenstein-like Beast.""

GM won the contract for the new limo in 2014 after  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) opted not to bid. For much of the 20th century, the presidential limousine was a Lincoln. But since the early 1980s, the limousine has always been a Cadillac.

1. Nike Earnings on the Calendar
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) reports earnings after the bell tomorrow and while investors will pore over the numbers as usual, expect additional headlines and questions about its recent decision to feature former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in an ad.
On average, analysts expect that the athletic wear giant will report a profit of 62 cents per share on revenue of about $9.9 billion.
Nike courted controversy using Kaepernick in its anniversary “Just Do It” campaign, including a presidential condemnation. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Kaepernick and all NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest racism.



Nike stock sold off in the session after the ad debuted, but has been climbing steadily since.
2. Consumer Confidence Numbers Arrive
The Federal Open Market Committee kicks off its two-day meeting tomorrow and while the market waits for Wednesday’s decision, the latest numbers on the consumer will arrive.
The Conference Board will release its consumer confidence measure for September at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that the index edged down to 132.2 from the month before.
3. Jabil, KB Home Also Weigh In
Apart from Nike, there will be some more results to digest as the earnings calendar begins to pick up.
Ahead of trading,  Jabil Circuit  (NYSE:JBL) will release quarterly numbers. A rise on the top and bottom lines from the year-ago period is expected.
Shares are up from its last report date, thanks to a strong rally since the middle of August.
After the bell, KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will report. Analysts are forecasting a profit of 77 cents per share on sales of $1.26 billion.
Any commentary on the outlook for the housing market will be welcomed. Housing indicators had been showing some fragility in that part of the economy but have shored up recently."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow closed lower on Monday after a new round of U.S.-China trade tariffs kicked in, dampening last week's hopes for talks between the two countries, and as investors awaited a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
Seven of the S&P's 11 major sectors lost ground after U.S. tariffs on some $200 billion worth of Chinese goods took effect, along with Beijing's retaliatory duties.
""Investors are starting to see the writing on the wall that China is starting to dig in its heels and so is the U.S,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It's a general risk-off tone, a sense that people are becoming a little bit more cautious.""
U.S. equities made strong gains last week as investors held out hope that the United States and China would hold trade talks. But with both sides now looking entrenched in their positions, Zaccarelli said he ""wouldn't be surprised if we gave up all our gains from last week."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 181.45 points, or 0.68 percent, to 26,562.05, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 10.3 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,919.37, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 6.29 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,993.25. 
The industrial sector (SPLRCI), which has borne the brunt of the protracted trade war, was one of the biggest drags on the S&P with a 1.3 percent drop. 
Interest rate sensitive sectors such as consumer staples (SPLRCS), down 1.5 percent, and real estate <.SPLRCREC>, off 1.9 percent, were under pressure ahead of the two-day Fed meeting that begins on Tuesday and is widely expected to end with a rate hike.
The biggest percentage gainer among the S&P sectors was energy (SPNY) as oil prices rose to a four-year high, above $80 a barrel, after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply. 
The technology sector (SPLRCT) closed up 0.3 percent, lifted by a 1.4 percent gain in Apple Inc (O:AAPL), whose products have been spared from the new tariffs on China.
Other gainers included the new Communications Services index (SPLRCL), which ended its first session 0.2 percent higher.
The biggest boost to the new index, which houses media and telecom stocks, was  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which closed up 1.5 percent.
POLITICAL NOISE
Investors were rattled by reports in the late morning that U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would quit. But indexes steadied after the White House announced a Thursday meeting between Trump and Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel's probe into Russia's role in Trump's 2016 election. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 43 new highs and 53 new lows. 

About 6.96 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with a 6.65 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.68%. The S&P 500 fell 0.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.08%.
Downward spirals in trade-sensitive sectors like materials and industrials symbolized investor fears Monday about an escalating U.S.-China trade war, which entered a new chapter as a fresh round of tariffs came into effect.
Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), all of which have huge international exposure, fell about 1% each.
The United States' 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and China's tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods got underway Monday.
Investor fears on trade were further exacerbated after China hit back at President Donald Trump and his ""America First"" agenda, which Beijing argued was hurting international trade relationships.
Beyond trade, stocks were also knocked by fresh turmoil in Washington amid conflicting reports concerning the future of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the wake of a report that he considered possibly recording and removing Trump.
The White House late Monday said, however, that Rosenstein and Trump had had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories and will be meeting on Thursday.
Stocks fell sharply intraday after Axios said in a report, citing sources with direct knowledge, that Rosenstein had verbally resigned to Chief of Staff John Kelly in anticipation of being fired by Trump.
Still, losses were limited by gains in energy as oil prices surged to four-year highs after major oil producers stood pat on output plans at a key meeting over the weekend, refusing to give in to a recent demand to find a way to lower oil prices from Trump.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for November delivery rose $1.30 to settle at $72.08 a barrel.

Sirius XM's sizable holding of Pandora's preferred stock made the potential acquisition inevitable, though the deal was cheaper and arrived sooner than expected, according to JPMorgan.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States are still in exploratory talks about how they can pursue a limited trade agreement, with no real negotiations yet started, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Monday.
Malmstrom told reporters on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly that the two sides are looking at facilitating sales of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe and reducing regulatory barriers to trade.
""We're still in that exploratory phase. We haven't started any negotiations yet. People are talking to each other and we will have a new meeting in November,"" Malmstrom said.
Malmstrom said she also expects to meet with U.S. Trader Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Economy Minister Hiroshige Seko in New York to discuss efforts to reform the World Trade Organization.
She said the three ministers will discuss possible reforms aimed at reducing industrial subsidies, where China and other countries ""are massively subsidizing state-owned enterprise and thereby creating imbalances in the global market.""
""We are also talking about issues related to forced technology transfers, for instance, where we think we need new rules,"" she added.

The United States is pursuing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports based partly on its accusations that China's policies unfairly force U.S. companies to transfer technology to their Chinese partners.

869,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",The Strong Dollar Is Driving Profits for U.S.-Focused Companies,"(Bloomberg) -- A strong dollar is boosting the earnings of domestically focused companies in the S&P 500 Index more than those with foreign exposure, according to a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
The valuation gap between the U.S. and other global equity markets is at an all-time high, according to a report by the bank. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio rose in July and August and is now at its highest level since February, the report noted. The benchmark hit an all-time peak on Sept. 20.
Among global markets, the U.S. is the only region with more positive earnings revisions than reductions over the last three months, wrote Savita Subramanian, head of equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.
“U.S. earnings trends have been stronger than in the rest of the world,” said Jill Carey Hall, one of the equity strategists who worked on the note. “We had tax reform in the U.S. which was a big benefit to earnings.”
Within the U.S., a stronger dollar is driving a greater divergence in earnings revision ratios between purely domestic companies and those with foreign exposure, with ratios declining for foreign-facing corporations, wrote Ben Randol, the bank’s senior foreign exchange strategist. Indeed, Randol found that a 1 percent appreciation in the U.S. trade-weighted dollar reduced the earnings revision ratio for multinationals by 0.2 percent.
“It’s a fairly important result because the dollar has appreciated about 7 percent since the second quarter started, and a substantial portion of these effects have yet to be seen in the data,” he said in an interview.
Meanwhile, the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S. fell 2.3 percent in August. On earnings, the S&P 500 trades at premium to Europe, Japan and emerging markets."

(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) is exploring a sale of its Chubb (NYSE:CB) Fire & Security division for more than $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
On Sept. 14, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes said the company will announce a decision within 60 days about whether to break up. The company's main business lines are comprised of aerospace engines, elevators and building equipment such as air conditioners.
Chubb was acquired by United Technologies for about $1 billion in 2003, and is now part of the company's climate, controls and security division. It has been playing catch-up for market share with rivals Securitas AB (ST:SECUb) and Tyco International Ltd. Tyco was acquired by  Johnson Controls  International Plc (N:JCI) two years ago for $16.5 billion.
United Technologies, based in Farmington, Connecticut, has hired Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) to run an auction for Chubb, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential and cautioning that no deal is certain.
United Technologies did not respond to a request for comment, while Bank of America declined to comment. 
United Technologies, maker of Pratt & Whitney engines, Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators, has a market capitalization of approximately $113 billion. Chubb, headquartered in Britain, provides fire safety and security solutions for businesses and organizations around the world, although its business is predominantly in Europe. 
Hayes said at an investor conference this month that United Technologies planned to close its pending $23 billion acquisition of aerospace parts maker Rockwell Collins (N:COL) by the end of this month. That deal has been held up by China delaying regulatory approval, amid an escalating trade row with the United States. 
Investors have increasingly shunned sprawling industrial conglomerates, forcing peers such as  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) to also announce the sale or spinout of major divisions. 
Activist investor Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP and Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC have been putting pressure on United Technologies to break up into three focused, standalone businesses.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 01:43PM ET</span>",Canada's Barrick Gold to buy Randgold for $6.5 billion in all-stock deal,"By Zandi Shabalala, Justin George Varghese and Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold Corp has agreed to buy  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd in an all-stock deal valuing the Africa-focused miner at $6.5 billion, to create the world's largest gold producer in an industry under investor pressure to put capital to good use.
The new Barrick company, which will be listed in New York and Toronto, will own five of the world's 10 lowest cost gold mines and have market value of $19.4 billion based on Monday trading. That would make it the world's biggest gold miner by market capitalization, overtaking  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM), according to Reuters calculations.
The deal marks the biggest transaction in years in the gold mining industry, where companies have come under fire from investors for poorly managing capital, forcing them to focus on costs while dampening enthusiasm for acquisitions.
Randgold closed up 6 percent, making it the biggest gainer in London's wider mining index and valuing it at 4.93 billion pounds ($6.5 billion). Shares of Barrick, the world's second largest gold producer, were up 6.3 percent in afternoon trade in Toronto.
""Randgold has the agility and swift-footedness of a younger and smaller company, much like Barrick in its early years, while Barrick has the infrastructure and global reach of a large corporate company,"" Barrick Chairman John Thornton said in a conference call.
Randgold's long-term boss Mark Bristow will become the chief executive and president of the merged company, taking chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth with him and Barrick's Thornton, an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, will be executive chairman.
Bristow, a 59-year old trained geologist, has been at the helm of Randgold since its inception in 1995 and is known for his straight-talking, hands-on approach to running the company.
The deal brings to together two executives with different leadership styles and backgrounds.
Two-thirds of the directors of the board of the new Barrick will be nominated by Barrick and one-third by Randgold.
""What the deal delivers Randgold shareholders...is more options in terms of growth and development, whereas before they only had one growth option of scale in Massawa,"" said Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat, referring to the miner's gold project in Senegal.
""POOR HAND"" 
The deal value, at 48.5 pound-a-share, matched Randgold's market capitalization as of Friday's close. This lack of a premium for Randgold shareholders prompted scepticism from some analysts who were also concerned that Randgold's agility could be bogged down by the mammoth Barrick.
""UK shareholders are arguably being dealt a poor hand with the merger,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
""What Bristow has got to prove now is that bigger is better and the Randgold culture is the one that will perhaps prevail.""
The current spot gold price is not helping the sector, having lost out on traditional safe-haven flows to the dollar, pushing it 10 percent lower this year. 
Both Barrick and Randgold have lost a third of their market capitalizations over the past year before Monday's gains.
""We don't see a reason to change Randgold's approach... If we can't deliver something that is bigger and better, then we wouldn't do it,"" Bristow said on a call with analysts. 
Bristow added on another call that the new company would be open to weighing options for its Nevada and Australia assets, and said there had expressions of interest on the latter.
The new company will have the sector's highest adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and appreciation and EBITDA margin of nearly 50 percent based on 2017 numbers, and the lowest total cash cost position among its peers, the companies said.
Under the terms of the deal, each Randgold shareholder will receive 6.1280 new Barrick shares for each share of the African rival, the companies said.
Talks on the deal, which is still subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2019, started more than three years ago with advisors taken in July, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters. 
In 2017, Barrick and Randgold combined produced 6.64 million ounces while the next largest gold miner, Newmont, churned out 5.27 million ounces.
The two companies said they were aligned on their strategy with Chinese investors after Barrick said it would make a bigger push to attract investors in China.
Randgold, which mines also in Mali, Ivory Coast and the Republic of Congo, where it has been faced with regulatory risk, a factor that Barrick's Africa unit Acacia Mining has to deal with in Tanzania.

M. Klein & Co and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Barrick on the deal, while CIBC and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were the financial advisers to Randgold.

875,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Hidden Fear Gauge Reveals Stock Euphoria -- and Late-Cycle Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- Worrywarts on Wall Street have gone into hiding.
As the S&P 500 flirts with record highs and volatility cruises closer to historic lows, an overlooked gauge of stock-market fear is flashing a bullish signal: shares are swinging together less and less.
Implied correlation between the 50 largest members of the S&P 500 is near the lowest in at least ten months. Three-month realized fluctuations have fallen back to January levels, while a one-month metric is at its bottom tenth percentile since 2012.
Investors are slicing and dicing equities guided by their micro features, from corporate earnings to regulation, while tuning out headline noise generated by gyrations in global trade, government bonds and emerging markets.
“When everything is good, realized correlation tends to fade, people are rotating into and out of stocks and sectors,” says Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. LP. “Correlation would travel higher with volatility spikes when people throw the baby out with the bath water -- they don’t discriminate.”
Expectations in options markets that stocks won’t stage in-tandem moves anytime soon means investors may be caught off-guard by a reversal in sentiment.
“Low correlation among index constituents is a late-cycle sign,” says Yannis Couletsis, director at volatility hedge fund Credence Capital Management Ltd., who expects bets on falling stock links to remain profitable through 2019 or 2020.
“Markets don’t just crash from their all-time highs, they gradually weaken first. This translates to individual names or sectors not all performing similarly during the latest phase of a market rally.”
Relentless Rotation
The rotation of capital amid periodic weaknesses among sectors -- from tech stocks, banks to small caps -- continues to fuel this year’s rally, capping index correlations and volatility, in a replay of 2017’s bullish dynamics.
Optimists find plenty of reasons for cheer.
Investors are drilling down on corporate fundamentals. U.S. tax reform is crowning relative winners and losers across stocks and sectors, while the boom in mergers and acquisitions activity is separating potential targets from acquirers.
“While low correlation often indicates complacency and corresponds with low volatility -- and may be indicative of it -- the pick-up in sector dispersion” is due to traders separating the wheat from the chaff, says Peter Cecchini, global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP.
The lagging performance of real estate stocks on interest-rate pain and industrials beaten up by tensions in commerce illustrate the trend, he says.
Short-Correlation Bet
The current regime is a boon for stock-pickers and a growing breed of volatility traders on Wall Street.
Hedge funds pursuing the long-short investing strategy in North America are up 6 percent this year, according to data from Eurekahedge. In August, a typically volatile month unfriendly to equity investors, they notched a 2 percent gain. Dispersion trades put on by volatility-arbitrage funds are also booming in 2018, thanks to falling equity correlations.
Still, the current regime of muffled volatility and low correlation may be too much of a good thing, fed by unabashed enthusiasm for America Inc.
“Low vol and low correlation within the S&P 500 may actually be a product of a rotation into U.S. equities because of global risks,” said Cecchini. “Is that complacency in U.S. equities justified?”
For now, Purves at Weeden & Co. is sanguine.
Implied equity-price swings are trading at a premium to realized moves, and relative to historic correlations, he notes. In other words, traders have a built-in cushion to help protect them from an uptick in volatility from recent levels.
“It is one more argument that there’s not a lot of complacency in the market, and people are being relatively prudent.”

889,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Barrick and Randgold Raise Hopes Merger to Spark Sluggish Sector,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest gold deal of the past three years may ease concerns about Barrick Gold Corp.’s stagnant production and offer  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. a reset for its languishing shares. The question is whether the whole will really be greater than the sum of its parts.
Canada’s Barrick agreed on Monday to buy London-listed Randgold for about $5.4 billion, creating a global gold mining behemoth with a focus on Africa and the Americas. The shares of both companies climbed.
“Both sides are each hoping that the other will be the solution to their own problems,” Kieron Hodgson, natural resources analyst at Panmure Gordon, said by phone from London. “Shareholders have become increasingly agitated with the performance of both companies.”
Under Executive Chairman John Thornton, Barrick has been selling assets and stakes in mines to reduce costs and debt. While that effort was initially received well by investors, the move also has raised concern about the company’s production pipeline, helping send its shares falling by about a half from a February 2017 peak. For Randgold, the transaction offers a reset for its shares, which have slipped this year after previously outperforming its gold-mining peers.
Under the all-share deal, Barrick shareholders will own about two-thirds of the new entity and Randgold investors the remainder, the companies said on Monday. There is almost no premium for Randgold shareholders, but Barrick has agreed to a break fee of $300 million. Both sets of investors are expected to vote on the deal around Nov. 5.
“Randgold has a proven ability to operate successfully in some of the most challenging environments in the world,” Barrick’s Thornton said on a conference call. “The combined company will have five of the world’s top 10 tier-one gold assets.”
Thornton will retain his position in the enlarged company, while Randgold Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow becomes president and CEO. Randgold Chief Financial Officer Graham Shuttleworth will become CFO of the new company.
Barrick will benefit from lower costs and having Bristow as a top executive, Jefferies analysts said Monday in a note.
“While direct operational synergies are unlikely to be significant and increased Africa exposure is a clear risk, the addition of Mark Bristow as president and CEO is a positive,” Alan Spence and Christopher LaFemina wrote. “All things considered, this transformational deal should be good for Barrick shareholders over the medium/long-term.”
Barrick rose as much as 6.9 percent in New York, the most intraday since March 2017, and was trading up 5.5 percent at $11.05 as of 12:19 p.m.
Randgold shareholders will receive a dividend of $2 a share for the 2018 financial year. The company’s shares climbed 6 percent to close at 5,220 pence in London, the biggest gain since June 2016.
Randgold has still slipped about 30 percent this year as it faced labor challenges in the Ivory Coast, a tax dispute in Mali and the prospect of a tougher mining code in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Barrick’s majority-owned Acacia Mining Plc has been stuck in limbo after Tanzania imposed a ban on exports of mineral concentrates in 2017 and slapped a $190 billion tax bill on the London-listed company.
“There are synergies, very clear synergies in Africa particularly because we can operate the entire portfolio that will be double in size with exactly the same structures,” Bristow said on a conference call. “And as we progress collectively to find a solution that really delivers better value and more transparency in Tanzania, we will unlock many synergies.”
In many ways, the strategies of the two companies are similar. Both firms are highly focused on production costs, aiming to build portfolios that generate free cash flow even if gold prices drop to as low as $1,000 an ounce. The metal traded at $1,203.94 at 10:51 a.m in New York.
Barrick was advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and M. Klein and Co., while Randgold was advised by CIBC World Markets and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc.

Siemens said the measures were designed to boost the competitiveness of its Power and Gas division and the Process Industries and Drives division.
“The market for fossil power generation has contracted substantially. Against the backdrop of this structural change, the agreement we’ve reached is critical to improving our competitiveness,” Lisa Davis, member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG said in the company's statement.
The cuts are planned over the next two years, Davis added.
Cuts at Power and Gas in Germany will amount to around 270 million euros in efficiency gains, as part of an overall goal to achieve 500 million euros in savings, Siemens said.
Around 2,900 jobs will be cut in Germany instead of the 3,400 announced in November, and sites in Goerlitz and Berlin will continue operations, Siemens said.
The company said a sale of its site in Leipzig would now be a preferred option while another location in Erfurt would be restructured. A site in Offenbach will be closed.
Labor representatives fought hard to ensure there will be no forced redundancies at Siemens, said Juergen Kerner, a member of the supervisory board who represents IG Metall. 
In August, Siemens said it would combine its five industrial divisions into three operating companies as part of a broader effort to slim down its conglomerate structure.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 12:45PM ET</span>",Sirius XM to buy Pandora in $3.5 billion streaming push,"By Arjun Panchadar and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc will buy online music service Pandora Media Inc in a $3.5 billion all-stock deal that will help it battle growing competition from streaming rivals Spotify and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music.
Sirius XM, controlled by media mogul John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (NASDAQ:FWONA), has built a name supplying more than 175 channels to car drivers, but has largely trailed Pandora, Spotify Technology SA and Apple in mobile and streaming content. 
Monday's deal gives the pair a market value of about $34 billion, topping Spotify's $31.2 billion and follows through on Sirius' purchase of a 15 percent preferred-stock stake in Pandora for $480 million last year.
""We view the read through to Spotify as slightly negative as it could face a stronger competitor in the U.S. while at the same time one of the only large swaths of ad-supported listeners in the fast-maturing U.S. goes off the market,"" SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton said. 
Sirius shares, however, fell 4.2 percent to $6.69 as investors worried the company had overpaid.
Shares in Pandora, which has posted losses for at least the past eight quarters, rose 6.5 percent to $9.68 in early trading, slightly below an offer value of $10.05 based on Sirius' Friday closing price.
The deal, worth $2.68 billion at the offer price, is expected to generate more than $7 billion in expected pro-forma revenue in 2018. Analysts said the two businesses were largely complementary.
""SIRI cannot offer on-demand radio, and cannot offer customization, and Pandora offers both,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""Sirius can merge Pandora's radio business into its satellite subscription business, and can also begin to offer on-demand to its large installed base of satellite subscribers.""
Pandora has been trying to mark its position in an industry where competitors are routinely adding new features, giving away discounts and offering more content, including interviews with popular musicians.
Pandora shareholders will get a fixed-exchange ratio of 1.44 newly-issued Sirius XM shares for each share held.
If the deal is terminated, Pandora will have to pay either $52.5 million or $105 million, depending on the circumstances, the company said in a filing.
Sirius XM said following the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, Pandora stockholders will own 8.6 percent of the pro forma company on a fully diluted basis.
Sirius XM Chief Executive Officer James Meyer said on a conference call that the company had been in talks with Pandora even before its Chief Executive Officer Roger Lynch took up the position in August last year. 
""We had a conversation 15 months ago. We couldn't reach an agreement on value quite honestly,"" Meyer said.
Allen & Co LLC and BofA Merrill Lynch are financial advisers to Sirius XM, while Centerview Partners LLC, LionTree Advisors LLC and  Morgan Stanley  & Co LLC (NYSE:MS) are financial advisers to Pandora.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 12:41PM ET</span>","UK would allow EU airlines to fly in no-deal Brexit, would keep EU safety rules","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will allow EU airlines to continue to fly into the country if it leaves the bloc without a divorce deal, the government said in technical papers published on Monday, adding that it plans to stick to EU rules on aviation safety. 
The 'no-deal' papers acknowledged the risk that flights could be grounded if Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019, without a deal and said some pilot and safety licenses issued by the UK would no longer be recognized in the EU. 
Britain has said it wants to continue to participate in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), but without a Brexit deal this might not be possible. 
The UK government said it was aiming to avoid such a worst-case scenario, and would look for an agreement on flying rights if there was a disorderly Brexit. 
""In this scenario the UK would envisage granting permission to EU airlines to continue to operate. We would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn,"" it said in a paper published on Monday.
A deal between the UK and EU, or between the UK and individual countries, was possible, it said. 
On aviation safety in a no-deal scenario, the UK said it would retain EU legislation, and that functions currently performed by EASA would instead be performed by Britain's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Agency (CAA). 
The papers said that, for pilot licenses, the CAA would need to validate any EASA license used to fly a UK-registered aircraft, and UK-issued licenses would need to transfer to EASA if they wanted to operate EU-registered planes. 
RECIPROCAL ACTION SOUGHT
On most other aviation safety certificates, including for aircraft and for maintenance, parts and cabin crew, however, Britain said EASA-issued documents would remain valid in the UK for two years from the date of Brexit.
They would then need to be replaced by CAA versions before the end of that period. 
But it warned UK-issued license and certificate holders that their certificates would no longer be valid in the EU. 
For instance, in a potential headache for some parts suppliers and maintenance firms, the papers said the EU's indications are that it would not recognize some safety-linked certificates issued by the CAA, meaning that UK-certified parts could not be installed on EU-registered aircraft, and UK-approved engineers would not be allowed to work on them.
The UK said it was encouraging the EU to take ""reciprocal action in recognizing UK-issued certificates"". 
On security, the UK government said that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would be no reason for the UK's aviation security regime not to be recognized by the EU as equivalent, meaning no additional security restrictions. 

However, if the EU decides not to recognize the UK aviation security system, then passengers from the UK transferring through EU airports and their luggage would have to be rescreened when changing flights in EU hub airports.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Michael Kors set to snap up Italy's Versace: sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. fashion group Michael Kors (N:KORS) has agreed to take control of Versace in a deal that could value one of Italy's most prized designers at $2 billion, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Budding luxury conglomerates, including Michael Kors' U.S. rival Tapestry (N:TPR), owner of  Coach  and Kate Spade, are trying to make in-roads into an industry still dominated by European players such as Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH).
Michael Kors, whose namesake label is best known for its leather handbags, has made no secret of its ambition to grow its portfolio of high-end brands after buying British stiletto-heel maker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion last year.
Versace, known for its bold and glamorous designs and its Medusa head logo, is one of a clutch of family-owned Italian brands cited as attractive targets at a time when the luxury industry is riding high on strong demand from China.
But not all brands have benefited equally, with some struggling to refresh their image or products to capture a younger audience, and some fashion groups are looking to diversify with more labels to face such challenges.
""Bringing brands like these back to center stage is not as easy as it looks, though,"" said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). ""Would Michael Kors have what it takes to succeed in this? I wonder. The plan seems ambitious.""
Shares in Michael Kors fell in early U.S. trade and were down 8.7 percent by 1526 GMT.
The move is in line with the U.S. brand's ambition to aggregate various luxury brands - including fashion, shoes and accessories - under one larger group. 
The deal - which is expected to be announced imminently - will give Michael Kors a mega-brand and red carpet favorite that is among the most recognizable and followed fashion labels in the world. 
Two of the three sources who spoke to Reuters said the company had agreed to pay a large premium for Versace.
Michael Kors could not be reached for comment. Versace declined to comment.
Donatella Versace, sister of late founder Gianni who doubles as artistic director and vice-president of the Milan-based group, has called a staff meeting for Tuesday, according to a person who was briefed by a company employee. 
The Italian fashion icon has been considering a market listing after U.S. private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) bought a 20 percent stake in 2014 to fund overseas expansion, although Chief Executive Jonathan Akeroyd told Reuters earlier this year there was no rush for an IPO.
After investing in Versace at a high multiple, Blackstone found its performance insufficient to justify a market listing, said one of the sources, who is close to the family. 
""They gradually persuaded the family to look into a possible sale and introduced them to a series of buyers, including Michael Kors,"" the person added. 
""Blackstone wasn't going to put any more money into it. They needed a buyer who could make heavy investments.""
""OVERPRICED"" 
French fashion houses including Paris-based  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among those holding talks with the Versace family, the sources said, but considered the price too expensive.
""They didn't feel the need to invest so much money into another Italian fashion brand. It was overpriced,"" the source said. 
Kering declined to comment.
As part of the deal, Blackstone will fully exit Versace, while the family, which owns the rest of the fashion house via a holding company called Givi, will keep a role, the sources said.
Givi in turn is half-owned by Allegra Versace Beck, daughter of Donatella and niece of late founder Gianni. Donatella herself owns 30 percent of the holding, with the remainder in the hands of her brother Santo.
Blackstone, whose stake acquisition valued Versace at $1.4 billion in 2014, declined to comment.
Versace does not disclose its financial details, but documents deposited with the Italian chamber of commerce show that last year it posted sales of 668 million euros ($786 million) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and appreciation (EBITDA) of 44.6 million euros.
Since Akeroyd's appointment in 2016, Versace has been working on streamlining its management structure, cutting costs and pushing to increase sales online. 
Last year it returned to a net profit of just under 15 million euros compared with a net loss of 7.9 million euros the previous year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S.-China trade war dented European stocks on Monday after tariffs from the world's biggest economies came into force and China canceled planned talks, triggering new fears of a protracted, costly trade dispute.
Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.5 percent, extending losses after remarks from ECB President Mario Draghi bolstered expectations of rate hikes next year. 
Autos, among the most dependent on smooth global trade, fell the most, down 1.5 percent, while rate sensitive banks (SX7P) ended down 0.8 percent after briefly turned higher following Draghi's comments.
The leading euro zone stocks index (STOXX50E) fell 0.6 percent, breaking its longest winning streak since 1997.
""There's potential for this to be a relatively protracted period of uncertainty given that it seems unlikely you're going to come to a quick conclusion where both sides are happy,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.
Carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG)  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) were the top fallers on the DAX and the CAC 40 respectively. 
Dealmaking drove the greatest moves across sectors, with Europe's biggest pay-TV group Sky (L:SKYB) soaring after Comcast's offer won an auction for the company.
Sky shares jumped 8.6 percent to 17.23 pounds, just below Comcast's cash offer of 17.28 pounds a share. 
""Sky’s importance in the UK remains and with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) likely to dictate the strategy going forwards we would expect a continued focus on telecoms, broadband and mobile,"" Macquarie analysts said.
 Randgold Resources  (L:RRS) rose 6 percent after it agreed a share-for-share merger with Canada's Barrick Gold (TO:ABX) in a deal worth $18.3 billion.
""Perhaps this signals the start of renewed consolidation in the space,"" said Paul Gait, senior research analyst at Bernstein. 
""Clearly Barrick want the management of Randgold and the 'premium' that could be attached to someone like (Rangold CEO) Mark Bristow.""
Luxury stocks were in focus after reports that U.S. fashion group  Michael Kors Holdings  (N:KORS) had agreed to take control of Italy's Versace in a deal that could value the company at $2 billion. 
Paris-based  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) outperformed the broader market, ending up 0.4 percent and flat respectively, while  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) was down 1.6 percent. 
British travel operator Thomas Cook Group (L:TCG) sank 28.1 percent after slashing its profit outlook, blaming a hot summer in northern Europe for weaker holiday demand in the late August-September season.
Thomas Cook peer TUI (L:TUIT) fell 2.9 percent. 
Shares in Danish medical equipment firm Coloplast (CO:COLOb) fell 1.4 percent after Berenberg analysts cut their recommendation on the stock to ""sell"".
Oil and gas stocks (SXEP) supported the market, up 1.1 percent as crude prices jumped more than 2 percent to a four-year high after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production.

Oil firms  Saipem  (MI:SPMI) and OMV (VI:OMVV) were among top European gainers, up 3.6 percent and 3.9 percent respectively.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>",Wall Street's S&P communication sector starts with a whimper,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The new S&P 500 communication services sector (SPLRCL), which includes such high-profile names as Facebook (O:FB), Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Netflix (O:NFLX), made its debut on Monday, after the largest-ever overhaul of Wall Street's broad business sectors.
Under the shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), those stocks and others were moved out of the technology and consumer discretionary sectors into the new group - a bulked-up version of the former telecommunications sector (SPLRCL).
The reshuffle appeared to happen without any disruptions after investors reorganized their positions at the end of trading on Friday, which was the highest-volume trading session since Feb. 9, according to Thomson Reuters data. A big chunk of the volume came in the last 15 minutes of the session.
""It's testament to the strength and transparency of U.S. equity markets that it was smooth as silk, that you can take all these stocks and reclassify them into a new sector and not disrupt trading,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
""It was like somebody repainted a bedroom overnight. It went from blue to purple with no disruption.""
The communications sector was last down 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent drop for the broader S&P 500 (SPX).
The sector's biggest gainer was Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), up 2.0 percent and its biggest loser was Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), which fell 7.4 percent after news it beat Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) in the battle to buy Sky (L:SKYB) on Saturday.
The biggest U.S.-based technology and consumer discretionary sector exchange-traded funds, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLK) and Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLY), as well as the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLC), which  State Street  Corp (N:STT) launched in June to track the new sector.
S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI have maintained the widely used industry classification system since 1999, and the reshuffling is meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved.
Replacing the telecom sector, about 2 percent of the entire S&P 500, the communications index was expected to have a roughly 11 percent weighting under its new communication services tag.
The weighting of the technology index (SPLRCT), was expected to have fallen to 20 percent, from 26 percent, while consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) is likely to drop from 13 percent to about 11 percent.
The communication services fund could continue to attract new money in coming weeks as investors seek access to stocks that dropped out of the other indexes, including Facebook and Alphabet, strategists said.
 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) also moved to the new communication sector, which will include existing telecommunications sector companies:  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), AT&T Inc (N:T) and  CenturyLink  Inc (N:CTL).
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) will remain in the S&P information technology index, while Amazon.com (O:AMZN) will stay in the S&P consumer discretionary index.
At 18.7 times forward earnings estimates, the expanded communication services sector carries a higher valuation than the prior telecom sector, whose forward P/E was just 10.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The reworked information technology sector carries a forward P/E of 18.4 times, based on the data. The tech sector's prior P/E was 19.5 times.
The updated communication sector ""will have a growth tilt and shed its current value-only bias,"" UBS strategists wrote.
While many individual investors will not need to worry about the changes, those who have big allocations to individual stocks and sector-based products may want to make sure their sector exposures are aligned with their investment objectives, said Edmund Tran, equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office.

""If, for example, they invested in the telecom sector because they liked the very high dividend yield, which was around five-and-a-half percent, that's going to be drastically lower. So that's not going to be the defensive bond proxy sector that they're accustomed to,"" he said.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 10:36AM ET</span>",Uber's strongest growth comes in depressed Argentina -- minus commissions,"By Eliana Raszewski, Luc Cohen and Marcelo Rochabrun
BUENOS AIRES/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Uber's fastest-growing market in the world is now Argentina, company executives say, attributing the expansion to the nation's sudden economic unraveling, which has boosted unemployment and sliced the purchasing power of Argentines. 
Twenty percent of its drivers in Buenos Aires, the only city where it operates in Argentina, were jobless immediately before joining Uber. 
The economic downturn, ""has certainly helped many people find us as an alternative source of income,"" Felipe Fernandez Aramburu, who runs Uber business development in Argentina, told Reuters in a recent interview. 
Despite worries about the country's economy, which shrank 4.2 percent in the second quarter after its central bank hiked rates to ward off a currency crisis, the company says it does not fear that a recession could boost the number of drivers without an equivalent increase in demand. 
""Our growth today is less about economic conditions on the rider side,"" said Andrew Macdonald, who runs Uber in Latin America. Instead, Macdonald expects what he described as a paucity of public transportation options to lift demand in Argentina and said growth was highest in the neighborhoods with the least bus and train service. 
But Uber's Argentine unit still faces a snag: For most rides, the company does not charge its drivers the 25 percent commission it is theoretically owed. Due to legal and regulatory hurdles, Uber rides in Argentina can only be paid with cash or credit cards issued abroad, which almost no locals have.
When rides are paid in cash, drivers currently have no way to pay Uber its 25 percent commission, leaving many with a growing debt to the company. Commissions from drivers are Uber's only source of revenue. 
Uber's Argentine conundrum of being unable to profit from its fast growth there mirrors a wider problem for the ride hailing service, which has struggled to prove that it can be profitable as it gears up for a planned 2019 initial public offering.
'TOO MANY DRIVERS'
Macdonald played down those concerns, however.
""It's not about whether we are making money in the near term,"" he said, adding that the company will ""eventually"" have to charge those commissions. 
Macdonald would not say whether the Argentine market is profitable. Uber has disclosed that its operations in nearby Brazil - now the company's second-biggest market worldwide - are profitable. 
Once Uber can accept local credit and debit cards, it will be able to recoup what it is owed, the company said.
Drivers, however, say the current Argentine growth rate may be temporary, tied to the lack of a commission charge.
""What's going on is that there are too many drivers currently and so there's less work for us,"" said Jorge, a 62-year old Uber driver who requested anonymity. ""Everyone's coming to Uber because they don't charge a commission.""
Uber says that in the last three months, it has had 55,000 active drivers and 1 million active users in Buenos Aires. Each day, the company said it adds between 300 and 400 new drivers and 7,000 new users. There's also attrition in the mix. 
""The average lifespan for a driver in Latin America is about three to four months. It means they use Uber as something temporary,"" Fernandez Aramburu said. 
Uber's recruitment success reflects a wider trend within Argentina, where a rising jobless rate has hit full-time jobs with benefits in particular, economists say.
""We are going through a process that is making labor rights more precarious, and formal employment is dwindling,"" said Hernan Letcher, director of the Center for Argentine Economic Policy. 
Uber has been operating in Argentina since 2016, when it faced aggressive resistance from taxi drivers and government authorities, including legal disputes that led to the ban on credit card payments that is still in place. 
There is no regulatory framework for Uber in Buenos Aires, including no way for the government to collect sales tax on the rides. 
Macdonald said the company welcomes favorable regulation and that accepting local credit cards is a priority, which will make more drivers pay their 25 percent commission but could also increase Uber's business. 

“It's a testament to our investment in Argentina ... that we are able to grow so much even without being able to offer the convenience of all payment options,"" Macdonald said.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 10:35AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank ordered to do more to prevent money laundering,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's financial watchdog has ordered  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to do more to prevent money laundering and ""terrorist financing,"" and has appointed a third party to assess progress.
BaFin said on Monday this was the first time it had made such an appointment at a bank related to money laundering.
European regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of banks' dealings with their customers following a series of scandals.
The head of  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) resigned last week after Denmark's biggest bank said an investigation had shown that many of the 200 billion euros ($236 billion) of payments through its small Estonian branch were suspicious.
Last year, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million https://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-mirrortrade-probe/deutsche-to-pay-425-mln-to-n-y-regulator-over-russian-mirror-trades-idUSL1N1FK1JN for allowing money laundering.
Germany's biggest bank said in a statement it agreed with BaFin that it needed to improve its processes to properly identify clients.
""We have the strong commitment to operate within regulatory compliant practices for the identification of our clients,"" Deutsche Bank said.
Neither BaFin nor Deutsche Bank gave details of the new measures the bank would adopt. 
No new scandal or case triggered BaFin's move, two people with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In August, Reuters reported that Deutsche Bank had uncovered further shortcomings in its ability to fully identify clients and the source of their wealth.
BaFin said it had appointed KPMG as its special representative for a three year period to assess Deutsche Bank's progress.
The intervention is another blow to the bank's reputation. 
Deutsche Bank has made management changes and announced a strategic overhaul that includes thousands of job cuts and scaling back its global investment bank as it battles to recover from three consecutive years of losses.
In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay U.S. and British regulators $630 million in fines over artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia.
The U.S. Federal Reserve fined the bank an additional $41 million in May 2017 for failing to ensure its systems would detect money laundering.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (L:SKYB) shares jumped 9 percent on Monday to within touching distance of what Comcast (O:CMCSA) will pay to buy Europe's biggest pay-TV group after seeing off competition from Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA). 
The U.S. cable-TV giant offered $40 billion in a rare weekend auction that brought to an end its battle against Rupert Murdoch's Fox and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which would have been Sky's ultimate owner if Murdoch had succeeded.
However, concerns about the premium Comcast had paid were reflected on the stock market in New York where Comcast's shares lost more than 6 percent. 
Analysts at MoffettNathanson downgraded Comcast from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" and Oppenheimer downgraded from ""outperform"" to ""perform"". Fox shares, in contrast, were up 0.6 percent and Disney gained 1.7 percent.
Both Comcast and Fox/Disney had wanted control of Sky to increase their reach in Europe, where pay-TV is growing, and to gain access to Sky's 23 million customers which would bolster their defense against streaming services from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The prize was valued far higher by Comcast in the third and final round of the auction when it bid 17.28 pounds while Fox offered only 15.67 pounds, below the level at which Sky shares were trading on Friday. Sky shares stood at 1721.5 pence at 1350 GMT on Monday. 
Comcast, which owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures, swiftly received the backing of Sky's independent directors. 
Comcast is paying a high price - more than double Sky's share price before Fox made its initial approach in December 2016 when it offered 10.75 pounds per share.
One senior analyst at a London-based hedge fund firm said it was an ""incredible outcome"".
""Not only the absolute number but also the gap between both offers, which could lead to Fox/Disney selling their stake (or part of it at the very least), thereby de-risking the Comcast offer which is conditional to the more than 50 percent acceptance condition,"" he said.
Research firm MoffettNathanson said it feared Sky would be an albatross to Comcast.
""Comcast would like to have investors view Sky as a platform-agnostic collection of proprietary programming agreements that can serve as a springboard to create a global OTT (over-the-top) provider, and, to be fair, the company does indeed have many proprietary programming agreements,"" it said. 
""But it seems as though they would like investors to forget that it is also a satellite TV provider, and satellite video distribution is increasingly becoming obsolete.""
FOX HOLDING
The big hurdle to Comcast's ambitions is the 39 percent of Sky that Fox owns, and which it has agreed to sell to Disney in a separate wider $71 billion deal.
Fox's holding, which Comcast's offer values at more than $15 billion, stems from Murdoch's role in the creation of the company as a pioneer in British pay television nearly three decades ago.
Fox/Disney have not said whether they will accept Comcast's offer. Without that holding, Comcast will need about 82 percent of the remaining shares for its bid to cross the threshold for acceptances.
Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada said if Fox/Disney do not tender their shares Comcast would be unable to de-list Sky or squeeze them out.
""This could be used as leverage by Disney in return for distribution rights, or as part of any future asset swap,"" they said on Monday.
Sky operates in European markets such as Britain, Ireland, Germany and Italy. The deal also gives Comcast an immediate beachhead in online video streaming with its Now TV business, which has about 2 million customers.
Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts has praised Sky's technology after quietly testing it on a private visit to a shopping center on a previous trip to London. 
Analysts see Comcast super-charging Now TV to combat Netflix across the globe. And Sky's relationships to distribute HBO entertainment content and Premier League soccer further insulate Comcast over the next few years.

The deal with Disney will leave Fox to focus on assets such as Fox News Channel and its broadcast of sports such as National Football League and Major League Baseball.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Euro zone ministers seek easier access to precautionary ESM loans,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will discuss on Oct. 1 how they can get a precautionary loan from the euro zone bailout fund more easily, but are unlikely to take final decisions before agreeing on a whole package of euro zone reforms in December.
The bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), now offers a Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line (PCCL) that is similar to a loan offered by the International Monetary Fund and can be granted to a euro zone country with a sound economy.
The country has to observe EU budget rules, have sustainable public debt and current account, a track record of international borrowing at reasonable terms and solvent banks that do not pose a threat to the euro zone banking system.
""There are six criteria now, everybody wants them streamlined, some want them to be strict and other want them to be more loose,"" a senior EU official said. ""The general purpose it to keep access to the instrument more open and more easy, so that it really could be used."" 
The discussions are part of a broader scheme to overhaul some euro zone institutions, institutions and policy instruments to make the 19 countries that share the single currency more resilient in future crises.
The package of inter-related reforms, including ideas on a euro zone budget and a euro zone-wide deposit guarantee system, are to be finalised only by December. 
Among the ideas under consideration is a cheap loan, like the PCCL, that could be extended to a government hit by a so-called asymmetric shock - a crisis that happens in a single euro zone country rather than the entire bloc.
Some euro zone officials have been pushing for such a loan to be virtually without conditions, but this approach is unlikely to get support.
""There will always be conditions attached,"" said the senior official, who is involved in the preparation of the ministerial meeting. ""I think it will be fewer (than now), but it will not be without conditions.""
The ministers will also discuss how to shape that credit line so that applying for it by a government does not carry the stigma for financial markets of being economically weak.

The ministers will also discuss the role of the bailout fund in crisis prevention and management, which means its role in regular monitoring of the economies of euro zone countries as well as help in debt restructuring, should a crisis occur and the sovereign debt of a government be unsustainable.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 09:56AM ET</span>","Singapore fines Grab and Uber, imposes measures to open up market","By Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore slapped ride-hailing firms Grab and Uber with fines and finalized restrictions to open up the market to competitors after concluding that their merger in March has driven up prices.
Uber Technologies Inc sold its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab in March in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in the Singapore-based firm.
While the combined S$13 million ($9.5 million) fine was small compared with the firms' multi-billion dollar valuations, that and the other measures imposed by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore on Monday represent the strongest censure by a regulator since the deal was unveiled.
The anti-trust watchdog said it would require that Grab drivers not be tied to Grab exclusively and that Grab's exclusivity arrangements with any taxi fleets be removed.
Uber will also be required to sell its car rental business to any rival that makes a reasonable offer and will not be allowed to sell those vehicles to Grab without the watchdog's permission. The car rental business, Lion City, had a fleet of some 14,000 vehicles as of December.
Fining Uber S$6.6 million and Grab S$6.4 million, the regulator said effective fares on Grab rose 10 to 15 percent after the deal, and that the firm now holds a Singapore market share of around 80 percent.
Uber said it believed the decision was based on an ""inappropriately narrow definition of the market"" and would consider appealing.
Grab said it completed the deal within its legal rights, and did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws. It would abide by remedies set out by the regulator, it added.
Indonesia's Go-Jek, which plans to launch services in Singapore, said it welcomed the regulator's steps.
""We're encouraged to see the measures being taken to level the playing field – it will have a significant effect on our strategy and timeline,"" the company said.
Other new entrants to the market include Singapore-based Ryde.
Grab said it had not raised fares since the deal and argued that all transport firms, including taxi operators, should be subjected to non-exclusivity curbs.
Walter Theseira, an economics professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said the regulator measured effective fares in terms of the average price consumers pay after accounting for subsidies and discounts, while Grab defines it as posted fares before any discounts.
Grab has also been told to maintain its pre-merger pricing algorithm and driver commission rates, which the regulator said would protects riders against excessive price surges, and drivers against increases in commissions that they pay to Grab.
The watchdog said it would suspend the measures on an interim basis if a Grab rival was able to garner over 30 percent of total rides in the ride-hailing services market in a month. 
It would remove the measures if a rival attained 30 percent or more of total rides matched in the market for six consecutive months.
Rival services include third-party apps for calling cabs and private vehicles as well as taxi-booking services such as those provided by taxi operator ComfortDelGro Corp Ltd (SI:CMDG).
Uber and Grab have a month to appeal the Singapore regulator's decision.
The deal remains under anti-trust review in Vietnam, which has warned that it could be blocked if the firms' combined market share in Vietnam exceeds 50 percent.
Jerry Lim, Grab's country head in Vietnam, said he believed the local regulator will consider the market's unique competitive dynamics and regulatory landscape in its investigation.
In the Philippines, where the deal has been approved, the competition watchdog has said it is monitoring Grab's compliance with conditions intended to improve the quality of service, with any breaches possibly resulting in fines.

In testimony to the European Parliament, the ECB president said while headline consumer-price growth will only average around 1.7 percent a year through 2020, still below the goal of just under 2 percent, that stable outlook “conceals a slowing contribution from the non-core components” such as energy and food prices.
“Underlying inflation is expected to increase further over the coming months as the tightening labor market is pushing up wage growth,” he said in Brussels on Monday. “Domestic price pressures are strengthening and broadening.”
The euro jumped half a cent on the remark, reaching the highest level since June. It traded at $1.1800 at 3:16 p.m. Frankfurt time. Bunds extended losses and the Stoxx 600 index fell to a session low.
The ECB will end its bond-buying program in December and expects to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019. Policy makers have acknowledged market expectations for a hike around the final quarter of next year."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. tariffs that hit some $200 billion worth of Chinese products on Monday spare many high-profile consumer technology items such as ""smart"" watches and speakers, but the less flashy home modems, routers and internet gateways that make them work weren't so lucky.
Consumer tech industry officials and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency say they expect billions of dollars worth of these products, including those designed for home use, will be subject to the 10 percent tariffs activated on Monday.
The move will effectively create a two-tiered tariff structure for consumer internet, with many products, such as Fitbit (N:FIT) fitness trackers, Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) watch and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Echo smart speaker being favored over routers and internet gateways from Arris International (O:ARRS), Netgear (O:NTGR), D-Link (TW:2332) and others. 
""We're operating under the assumption that the tens of millions of devices that deliver high-speed internet into consumers' homes will be impacted by these tariffs,"" said Jim Brennan, Arris' senior vice president of supply chain, quality and operations.
""It feels anti-consumer because our devices are what enables the core of consumer tech,"" Brennan told Reuters.
The modems, routers, switching and networking gear that keep the internet functioning were not included in a newly created U.S. tariff code that was exempted from the latest China tariffs, a spokesperson for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said.
The agency has made no distinction between consumer-use modems and routers and the commercial network equipment used by data centers and broadband internet providers. 
Most new internet-connected devices had been lumped into a broad category in the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, 85176200, ""Machines for the reception, conversion and transmission or regeneration of voice, images or other data, including switching and routing apparatus.""
The catch-all category saw $23 billion in U.S. imports from China and $47.6 billion from the world last year. It was the largest component of U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariffs targeting Chinese goods.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office had said it was breaking out items such as smart watches, fitness trackers, Bluetooth audio streaming devices and smart speakers into a new subcategory that would be exempted, but it gave few details.
According to a notice posted by the U.S. International Trade Commission, computer modems would stay in a separate sub-category, while ""switching and routing apparatus"" would be put into a new sub-category. Neither of these sub-categories were granted exemptions from the tariffs.
""Although we have not had occasion to issue rulings on the scope of a provision for 'switching and routing apparatus,' we agree that as a general matter, modems, routers, and networking equipment will be subject to the remedy,"" a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said late on Friday, referring to the 10 percent tariff.
It was not clear how much of the $23 billion in Chinese imports within the catch-all category could escape tariffs, but a Reuters review of industry data suggests the share could be small.
U.S. Census Bureau data has not yet captured the volume of annual imports from China — or any country — of the goods that will be exempt.
But the Consumer Technology Association estimates that the U.S. market for fitness trackers, smart watches, smart speakers and wireless earbuds and headphones was $8.2 billion in 2017, with forecast sales of $11.6 billion for 2019.
Even if China produced a majority of those goods, exemptions would only apply to a fraction of the $23 billion category.
CTA has forecast direct sales of modems and routers to consumers at $2.3 billion for 2019, up from $2 billion in 2017, excluding the products supplied directly by cable and broadband internet providers and equipment used in data centers and other infrastructure outside the home.
But the group argues that consumers will bear the costs of the tariffs, even if their service provider buys the modems. 

""Overall, access to the internet will get more expensive, mobile plans will get more expensive, and connected devices that go to your smart phones will get more expensive because everything speaks to each other,"" said Izzy Santa, director of strategic communications for CTA.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 09:04AM ET</span>",Malaysian bank CIMB chairman Nazir Razak to step down,"By A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (KL:CIMB) Chairman Nazir Razak is to step down by the end of the year after almost three decades at Malaysia's second biggest bank, he said on Monday.
Nazir, the brother of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been CIMB's chairman since 2014, before which he was the chief executive for 15 years. 
Under his leadership, CIMB grew through rapid acquisitions from a boutique firm to a regional bank with a strong presence in Southeast Asia.
Nazir remained a key figure in the bank when he took over as chairman even though he had stepped away from day to day duties.
""It was always going to be hard to find the perfect moment for me to leave CIMB – not too soon, not too late – but always with the firm's best interest in mind,"" Nazir, 52, said in a statement. 
Nazir said he had decided to leave on completion of the bank's four-year recalibration plan, launched in 2014. 
CIMB said the board would decide on the next chairman and the exact date of handover in due course.
Reuters reported last November that Nazir, along with four prominent Southeast Asian business leaders, planned to start a regional private equity fund that would look to raise up to $1 billion. 
In a message to CIMB staff on Monday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Nazir said he would continue work in the region following his departure from the bank. 
""As you know, I am very passionate about ASEAN integration, and now I would like to fully commit to pursuing other opportunities in this arena,"" Nazir said.
CHANGES AT THE TOP
Nazir's move comes amid a management shake-up at Malaysian companies following an unexpected loss by Najib in the general election to Mahathir Mohamad in May. 
Officials seen as close to the previous administration have been purged in recent months. The central bank, sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional - CIMB's biggest shareholder - and the country's largest fund management firm Permodalan Nasional Bhd have all seen management changes since May.
Amid rumors over his possible departure from CIMB in June, Nazir had said he would step down if the board, shareholders or the central bank wanted him to. He had not indicated that he was considering leaving before his term ended in August 2019. 
In 2015, Nazir went on a leave of absence after the Wall Street Journal reported that he received around $7 million from his brother Najib before the 2013 general elections and disbursed the funds to other politicians.
An independent review into money transfer concluded that Nazir did not misuse his position and there was no inappropriate use of the bank's resources, following which Nazir resumed his duties as chairman. 
Najib is facing several charges of money laundering, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust as part of Malaysia's investigation into state fund 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Symantec launched the ""whistleblower"" investigation in May after a former employee raised ""concerns"" about some accounting practices, prompting the company's board to hire an independent counsel and other advisers to assist in the probe. 
The audit committee identified certain behavior inconsistent with the company's code of conduct, and Symantec said it would take 'appropriate action' in these matters, without specifying details.
The company said the committee reviewed a transaction with a customer for which $13 million was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018, and concluded that $12 million of the $13 million should be deferred.
Disclosure of the probe, and the decline in Symantec's stock price, put the company on the radar of activist investors. 
Starboard Value LP, a hedge fund with a history of buying stake in poorly performing companies, in August bought a 5.8 percent stake in Symantec. Earlier this month, Symantec named three nominees of Starboard to its board. [L3N1W34UX]
Symantec has also suffered from weak revenue growth in its enterprise security business. In August it disclosed that it would lay off about 1,000 employees, or 8 percent of its workforce. 
The previously announced financial results for fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2019 will be revised to take into account the deferral and any other financial adjustments required as a result of the revision, the company said.

Symantec said it would adopt the audit committee's proposal to appoint a chief accounting officer, and a separate chief compliance officer reporting to the committee.

930,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Lira Gains on Hopes U.S. Pastor Held in Turkey Will Be Released,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s lira gained the most among emerging markets amid speculation a detained American pastor could be released next month, ending a dispute between the NATO allies that has wreaked havoc on the currency.
A local court could free Andrew Brunson, currently under house arrest in the coastal town of Izmir, when he appears for a hearing on Oct. 12, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing Turkish officials it did not name. The lira also rose on speculation some short positions in the currency got squeezed out.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkey in August over the pastor’s detention, and has threatened to follow suit with more punitive measures if he is not set free, compounding a 40 percent depreciation in the lira this year. Brunson was arrested in the wake of a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey and is being charged for aiding terrorist groups.
There are “somewhat promising signs from both U.S. and Turkish officials of late” and the Oct. 12 trial is now “much more of a 50/50 probability event than has been the case ahead of previous hearings,” said Henrik Gullberg, a strategist at Nomura International Plc in London, who suggested that investors take a long position in the Turkish currency using a dollar-lira put-spread option strategy.
The Turkish currency rallied as much as 1.6 percent to 6.1899 against the greenback, before trimming gains to 6.2226. The yield on the nation’s 10-year government bonds fell 21 basis points to 18.73 percent.
Nomura recommended a two-month dollar-lira put at 6.00/5.75 as aggressive Turkey’s central bank tightening “favors positioning for downside” in the cross. The central bank this month raised its benchmark rate by 625 basis points to 24 percent.
“As funding approaches a substantial 30 percent, it is going to be difficult to sustain outstanding TRY shorts,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) strategists including Luis Costa wrote in a note to clients. “The extremely high negative carry continues to squeeze short TRY positions.”"

932,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 08:16AM ET</span>",Volvo halts Iran truck assembly due to U.S. sanctions,"By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish truckmaker AB Volvo has stopped assembling trucks in Iran because U.S. sanctions are preventing it from being paid, a spokesman for the company said on Monday.
The sanctions against Iran, reimposed on Aug. 6 by U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to pull out of a nuclear deal with Tehran, have forced companies across Europe to reconsider their investments there.
Volvo spokesman Fredrik Ivarsson said the trucks group could no longer get paid for any parts it shipped and had therefore decided not to operate in Iran in another blow to the country's car industry, which unlike the energy and banking sectors, had managed to sign contracts with top European firms.
""With all these sanctions and everything that the United States put (in place) ... the bank system doesn't work in Iran. We can't get paid ... So for now we don't have any business (in Iran),"" Ivarsson told Reuters by telephone.
Before the sanctions were reimposed, Volvo had expressed an ambition for Iran to become its main export hub for the Gulf region and North Africa markets.
The European Union has implemented a law to shield its companies, but the sanctions have deterred banks from doing business with Iranian firms as Washington can cut any that facilitate such transactions off from the U.S. financial system. 
TRUCK EXIT 
Volvo was working with Saipa Diesel, part of Iran's second-largest automaker SAIPA, which was assembling the Swedish firm's heavy-duty trucks from kits shipped to Iran.
Ivarsson said Volvo had no active orders in Iran as of Monday. 
A commercial department manager at Saipa Diesel confirmed that sanctions had prompted Volvo Trucks to terminate their partnership agreement.
""They have decided that due to the sanction on Iran, from (May) they couldn't cooperate with us. We had some renovation planned in Iran for a new plant but they refused to work with us,"" said the manager, who declined to be identified.
More than 3,500 Volvo trucks had been assembled by Saipa Diesel in the year to May, but none had been assembled in this financial year although the original deal was for at least 5,000 trucks, the manager told Reuters.
Swedish truckmaker Scania, which is owned by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said it had canceled all orders that it could not deliver by mid-August due to sanctions, while French carmaker PSA Group began to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran in June.

Germany's Daimler has said it is closely monitoring any further developments, while carmaker Volkswagen has rejected a report that suggested it had decided against doing business in Iran.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock markets traded in negative territory on Monday as fears of an escalating trade row between the United States and China spread from Asian markets, while oil rallied after OPEC ignored U.S. calls to raise global supply. 
The benchmark index for euro zone blue chips retreated 0.4 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600, which also includes stocks in the UK and outside the European Union, was down 0.3 percent.
U.S. shares were also expected to open lower, with futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq trading down 0.2 percent and O.4 percent respectively. 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent after China accused the United States of engaging in bullying over trade, added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list and reportedly canceled mid-level talks.
Buoyant dealmaking - with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) winning a pay-TV bidding war for Sky in the UK and Randgold (LON:RRS) Resources' merger with Canada’s Barrick Gold - was not enough to defuse fears that the standoff between the two biggest world economies would hurt.
""This is here to stay"", commented Adrien Dumas, a manager at Mandarine Gestion in Paris, arguing that because trade is at the core of the Trump administration's agenda, investors should accept that the trade war theme is unlikely to recede any time soon.
""It's a negative and it adds to other issues"", he said, pointing to stress in emerging markets or political risk in Italy and Britain. 
""Brexit is also weighing on sentiment"", he noted. 
OIL JUMPS 2 PCT
The UK blue chip index FTSE 100 was down 0.2 percent. The pound rose 0.5 percent to $1.3143 after a fall on Friday when British Prime Minister Theresa May said talks with the EU had hit an impasse. 
British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would back a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party backs the move, heaping more pressure on May, amid speculation that she could opt to call a snap parliamentary election. 
The euro rose 0.14 percent close to a three-month peak at $1.1766. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 94.088, just above its weakest point since early July. 
The Japanese yen, which sees fund inflows during times of crisis, was up 0.05 percent, while the trade-sensitive Australian dollar was down 0.2 percent. 
Oil prices jumped as U.S. sanctions restricted Iranian crude exports, tightening global supply, with some traders forecasting a spike in crude to as much as $100 per barrel.
Benchmark Brent crude hit its highest since November 2014 at $80.94 per barrel, up $2.14 or 2.7 percent, before easing back to around $80.65 at 1125 GMT. 
""This is the oil market's response to the OPEC+ group's refusal to step up its oil production,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.

OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group, Russia, on Sunday ruled out any immediate extra increase in output, effectively rebuffing a call by Trump for action to cool the market.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Monday it had changed its stance on emerging-market bonds and currencies to neutral from negative following the recent selloff, although it warned the backdrop for developing markets remained difficult. 
""After a significant sell-off, we close our bearish view on EM and shift into neutral gear,"" strategist Jaes Lord said in a note to clients. ""We can see the case for some temporary stability after a six-month bear market.""
Emerging markets had a rough time over the summer after crises in Turkey and Argentina sparked a wider selloff in assets of developing economies. 
Following a six-month bear market, Morgan Stanley predicted some temporary stability might occur, thanks to depressed valuations, investors adjusting their positioning and a weaker U.S. dollar. 
Some idiosyncratic issues had become less concerning, while policy response to shore up investor confidence had picked up and a further escalation of trade looked built in, Morgan Stanley added. 
""However, more material escalatory risks over the medium term mean that this issue should re-emerge as a strong headwind in time and so we do not see the case to move bullish.""
Across high-yielding currencies, Morgan Stanley said it ""liked"" Argentina, Indonesia and Russia and moved to a neutral stance on Brazil. Across local debt, its analysts took a positive view on Mexico and a neutral stance on Argentina, Brazil and Russia. 
""Overall, we see the case for local markets as stronger than credit, considering better positioning, valuations that are more consistently cheap across countries and expected dollar weakness,"" the bank added.
Across emerging-market hard currency debt, Morgan Stanley expected spreads to tighten with more debt issue supply possibly coming to market after a rocky summer, which would keep a lid on a potential rally. 
Bond sales usually rebound in September after a quiet August, but this year's currency crises in Turkey and Argentina and worries about rising U.S. sanctions risk for Russia have kept volumes dramatically lower so far.
Morgan Stanley is not the only major bank to take a more positive view on emerging markets. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said investor sentiment for emerging market assets had been firming.
""Recent price action has likely helped buoy sentiment
for EM assets, but we have noticed a marked change over the past two weeks in investors’ focus on EM - from downside risks to valuation and ‘opportunities’,"" Goldman analysts Caesar Maasry wrote in a note to clients. 
Turkey's interest rate increase in September, softer inflation data from the U.S. and valuations have rekindled ""tepid optimism"", he said. 
""We still prefer equity as the best-positioned asset class for a ‘bounce-back’ and find Brazil, Chile, Peru, Korea, and China offer a good combination of dislocation and supportive
macro growth dynamics,"" Maasry added.

MSCI's emerging market equity benchmark (MSCIEF) has fallen nearly 10 percent since the start of the year.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 04:47AM ET</span>",Asian firms shuffle production around the region as China tariffs hit,"By Ju-min Park and Makiko Yamazaki
SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - A growing number of Asian manufacturers of products ranging from memory chips to machines tools are moving to shift production from China to other factories in the region in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. 
Companies including SK Hynix (KS:000660) of South Korea and Mitsubishi Electric (T:6503), Toshiba Machine Co. (T:6104) and Komatsu (T:6301) of Japan began plotting production moves since July, when the first tariffs hit, and the shifts are now under way, company representatives and others with knowledge of the plans told Reuters. Others, such as Taiwanese computer-maker Compal Electronics (TW:2324) and South Korea's LG Electronics (KS:066570), are making contingency plans in case the trade war continues or deepens.
The company representatives and other sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
The quick reactions to the U.S. tariffs are possible because many large manufacturers have facilities in multiple countries and can move at least small amounts of production without building new factories. Some governments, notably in Taiwan and Thailand, are actively encouraging companies to move work from China.
The United States imposed 25 percent duties covering $50 billion of Chinese-made goods in July, and a second round of 10 percent tariffs covering another $200 billion of Chinese exports will come into effect next week. The latter rate will jump to 25 percent at the end of the year, and Trump has threatened a third round of tariffs on $267 billion of goods, which would bring all of China's exports to the United States into the tariff regime.
The tariffs threaten China's status as a low-cost production base that, along with the appeal of the fast-growing China market, drew many companies to build factories and supply chains in the country over the past several decades.
At SK Hynix, which makes computer memory chips, work is under way to move production of certain chip modules back to South Korea from China. Like its U.S. rival Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which is also moving some memory-chip work from China to other Asian locations, SK Hynix does some of its packaging and testing of chips in China, with the chips themselves mostly made elsewhere.
""There are a few DRAM module products made in China that are exported to the United States,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the situation, referring to widely used dynamic random-access memory chips. ""SK Hynix is planning on bringing those DRAM module products to South Korea to avoid the tariff hit.""
Most of SK Hynix's production won't be affected, the source added, since China's dominance in computer and smartphone manufacturing makes it by far the largest market for DRAM chips.
Toshiba Machine Co (T:6104) says it plans to shift production of U.S.-bound plastic molding machines from China to Japan or Thailand in October. 
The machines are used for making plastic components such as automotive bumpers. ""We've decided to shift part of our production from China because the impact of the tariffs is significant,"" a spokesman said.
Mitsubishi Electric, meanwhile, says it is in the process of shifting production of U.S.-bound machine tools used for metal processing from its manufacturing base in Dalian, in northeastern China, to a Japanese plant in Nagoya. 
In Taiwan, an executive at notebook PC maker Compal, who declined to be named, said the trade war's impact had been limited so far, but the company was studying its options.
""We can also use facilities in Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil as alternatives,"" the person said. ""It won't be easy because our majority production is in China; no other country can replace that at this moment.""
Smaller companies are exploring their options too. South Korean medical equipment manufacturer IM Healthcare, which makes products including air purifiers, is studying a move to Vietnam or South Korea if the trade conflict intensifies, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
SK Hynix declined to comment. Spokesmen for Compal and IM Healthcare could not immediately be reached.
Some Asian governments hope for an economic and strategic boost from the U.S.-China conflict. In Taiwan, the government is actively encouraging companies to move production out of China, pledging last month to speed up its existing ""Southbound Policy"" to reduce economic reliance on China by encouraging companies to move supply chains to Southeast Asia.
Taiwan economics ministry official William Liu told Reuters that the trade war was ""a challenge and an opportunity"" for the self-ruled island. Taiwan depends on China as an export market, he noted, but at the same time could see a boost in jobs from companies moving operations back home.

Thailand also hopes to benefit from the ""flow of technology and investment leaving China during the trade war"", said Kanit Sangsubhan, Secretary-General of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) Office of Thailand, which is coordinating a $45 billion project to attract investment into the country. The EEC last month took some 800 representatives of Chinese companies on a tour around the eastern industrial heartland, and the country's Board of Investment has done seven roadshows in China this year to woo investors.

941,By Investing.com,,,
942,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",China Says It Won’t Hold Trade Talks Unless Trump Stops Threats,"(Bloomberg) -- China dashed prospects for a near-term resolution to the trade war with the U.S., warning President Donald Trump his threats of further tariffs are blocking any potential negotiations.
The response, which came just over an hour after the U.S. imposed new duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods on Monday, underscores a deepening gulf between both governments in a dispute that observers say is less about a row over a bilateral goods deficit and increasingly about a U.S. desire to put the brakes on China’s economic ascent.
Trump has repeatedly threatened higher tariffs on the remaining Chinese imports should Beijing retaliate against Monday’s round. As China has said that step is certain, the stage appears set for yet another escalation of the trade war. China canceled talks that were scheduled for this week, and is digging in by prepping stimulus measures to cushion the economy.
“The door for trade talks is always open but negotiations must be held in an environment of mutual respect,” according to a white paper carried by the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Negotiations “cannot be carried out under the threat of tariffs.”
Whichever side is right, the hardening rhetoric is increasingly giving way to actions that are hurting the world economy, Fitch Ratings said in its latest global outlook.
""The trade war is now a reality,"" Fitch chief economist Brian Coulton said in the release. The ratings firm downgraded its world growth forecast for 2019 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.1 percent and warned of further downside risks.
The latest round of U.S. duties took effect just after midnight Washington time on Monday (midday in Beijing) on a list of products ranging from frozen meat to television components. China is poised to retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods, a move that Trump has said would spur new duties on another $267 billion in Chinese imports.
In announcing the rates for the retaliatory duties last week, the government in Beijing said the tariffs would be effective as of 12:01 p.m. local time on Sept. 24.
If the president follows through on the escalation threat, U.S. tariffs would cover all goods the nation imported from China last year, risking an escalating conflict that could upend the supply chains of multinational companies.
China on Saturday called off planned trade talks with U.S. officials with a move by the U.S. State Department to sanction China’s defense agency and its director on Thursday contributing to the decision, according to people familiar with the situation. There’s a growing consensus in Beijing that substantive talks will only be possible after U.S. mid-term elections in November, the people said.
Efforts at diplomacy have failed, with no breakthroughs since high-level talks began in May. Trump has warned that the 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods will rise to 25 percent in January if Beijing refuses to offer concessions.
Still, the U.S. remains open to talks, Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said in an emailed statement.
“President Trump has an excellent relationship with President Xi and our teams have been in frequent communication since President Trump took office,” Walters said. “We remain open to continuing discussions with China, but China must meaningfully engage on the unfair trading practices.”
Neither side has backed down since the tit-for-tat tariff war began in July when the U.S. imposed duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods. Another $16 billion of goods were included in August and China retaliated in kind to both moves.
Companies complain that the time frame between the announcement of the latest levies and implementation of the tariffs on thousands of products is too short. A protracted trade war will fuel inflation in the U.S., particularly as tariffs are added to categories such as furniture, apparel and technology, according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.
“Retailers are already facing a tidal wave of tariffs. This latest tranche is a tsunami,” said Hun Quach, vice president of international trade for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “With thousands of consumer products included, little warning, and no time to prepare, businesses are left scrambling.”
Beijing’s latest tariffs include an additional 5 percent duty on about 1,600 kinds of U.S. products including computers and textiles and an extra 10 percent on more than 3,500 items including chemicals, meat, wheat, wine and liquefied natural gas.
Asked this month if Beijing’s planned retaliation was a guarantee that Trump would go ahead with the next round of duties, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NPR’s Morning Edition that “the president was crystal clear in his statement: if China retaliates, the process will move forward on the additional amount.”
Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there was a chance the trade war could spiral out of control but that there is “a window for serious negotiation.”
“The Trump administration must get its position straight though -- what does it want from China, and who is empowered as a negotiator by President Trump to bring the deal home? Unless that happens, serious negotiations will be impossible and the likelihood of continued escalation increases,” Alden said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate hike this week will make cash the most attractive it has been in about a decade and end the era of stocks as the only game in town.
During this bull market which in August broke the record as the longest ever, interest rates were so low that most fixed income assets other than junk bonds yielded less than the inflation rate or the dividend yield on the S&P 500. This drove yield-hungry investors to stocks, the one asset that delivered a real rate of return, or return on investment adjusted for inflation.
""One of the big influences in the market over the last decade has been that bonds as an alternative have been pretty much out of the market,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.
""There is historically a tug of war between stock investing and bond investing and since the financial crises the bond market has been in the tug of war with one arm tied behind its back,"" he said.
That may be set to change.

The Fed ended its regime of rate suppression when it stopped expanding its balance sheet and then began raising interest rates in late 2015. Since then, bonds have slowly returned to delivering real returns relative to inflation.
With next week's anticipated rate action, cash will join the party. A broad array of money market assets should finally regain a real return versus inflation. It will be the first time since early 2008 that money market assets will deliver a real return.
""It certainly gives cash a boost. It gives risk aversion a boost,"" said Ablin.
(For a graphic on 'Real U.S. Treasury yields since the Fed began raising rates' click https://reut.rs/2zmV29s)
As the real rate of return available on safer U.S. assets rises, it diminishes the appeal of riskier assets.
""The regime of safe asset shortages is over. We are now in a safe asset glut regime,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analyst Zoltan Pozsar, said in a recent note.
The stock market, meanwhile, is bracing for the rate hike at a time when the forward price-to-earnings(P/E) of 17.2 versus the historic average of 15. This was not a headwind three or five years ago when the competition yielded a negative real return, but that valuation now may look a bit pricey, especially with profit growth expected to moderate after this year’s extraordinary, tax-cut induced showing.
S&P 500 earnings growth should hit its peak for the cycle this year, estimated at 23.2 percent, while growth for 2019 is now estimated at just 10.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""As long as earnings growth outpaces the interest-rate rise, stocks should be fine. If earnings growth slows in comparison to the interest-rate rise, then you’ve got an issue,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
Equity mutual funds posted outflows of more than $1 billion in the week ended Sept. 19, marking the group's 13th consecutive week of net outflows, according to Lipper data. At the same time, investors have been pouring money into ultra-short obligation funds, in a sign of increased allure of investments with shorter maturities.
The ultra-short obligation funds peer group, used to offset interest rate risk, had net inflows of $614 million in the week ended Wednesday, the 28th straight week of net inflows, Lipper data showed.

Even as cash grows more attractive, analysts do not see stocks falling out of favor soon. 
""I think the euphoria around the economy and forward earnings growth is swamping this yield comparison idea that bonds are starting to look more attractive than stocks,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis in Boston.

""I think investors will have real choices to make in the second half of next year as (bond) yields become more attractive and the earnings outlook becomes more fragile,"" he said.

Evergrande purchased 23.87% of the shares of Guanghui for RMB6.68 billion (US$1 billion). The company is set to inject an additional RMB7.81 billion (US$1.14 billion) into Guanghui as capital, it said in the statement. After the transaction, Evergrande will own a 40.96% stake in Guanghui.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 01:23AM ET</span>",Tech index refresh could give under-the-radar names their day in the sun,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A reshuffling of Wall Street benchmark industry sectors that transferred high-flying FANG stocks like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) out of the technology label may be a boon to some under-the-radar companies that used to compete with them for investor attention. 
Companies such as Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO),  Juniper Networks Inc  (N:JNPR),  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX),  Akamai Technologies Inc  (O:AKAM), and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) that do not often grab headlines could be among the unexpected winners from the largest reclassification of companies on Wall Street since 1999, fund managers say. 
That is because fund managers who are looking for technology exposure may be willing to add positions in companies that they previously overlooked now that Alphabet and Facebook have been regrouped into the new communications services sector and are no longer an option.
""At the end of the day, there are a lot of investors who are very sector-aware,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. 
""If you're a smaller tech company, this is great because you no longer have to compete against Google for capital.""
The overhaul by S&P Dow Jones Indices of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) took effect on Monday. The changes are meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved. Maintained by S&P and MSCI since 1999 and widely used by portfolio managers, the taxonomy classifies companies across 11 sectors.
The communication services sector will include three out of the four so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Alphabet - even though investors widely consider them the leaders of the tech rally that powered the stock market higher in recent years. 
While Alphabet and Facebook will leave technology, Netflix will be moved out of consumer discretionary to join the renamed sector. Amazon.com will stay put in consumer discretionary.
Shares of Alphabet, which made up approximately 10.2 percent of the technology sector, are up 12.3 percent for the year to date. After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Visa Inc  (N:V),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Cisco now round out the S&P tech index's largest five components. 
Overall, the regrouping of companies in new sectors is expected to generate more than $30 billion in market activity as active investors and passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recalibrate their positions to reflect the new weightings, according to estimates from State Street. 
While most diversified fund managers have wide leeway in deciding what companies to own, most tend to hug the weightings of the S&P 500 sectors when constructing their portfolios. 
That means that if a fund manager used to own Alphabet as a way to gain technology exposure, he or she would need to find another company to fill that hole now that Alphabet is in another sector. 
PLAYING DEFENSE
The shuffling of benchmark sectors may also make it harder for investors to play defense during the next market sell-off. Former value-stock companies like AT&T Inc (N:T) that were in the telecommunications sector are now lumped together with growth-focused companies like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) in the communications services sector. 
""In times when you would want to play defense and allocate to telecom, you can't really do that anymore,"" said Cliff Hodge, director of investments for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Cornerstone Wealth. 
Approximately 61 percent of the new communications sector will be growth stocks - so named because investors are often willing to pay a higher multiple in anticipation of above-market growth rates - while 100 percent of the former telecommunications sector were value stocks, the name given to companies that have slower growth rates but better dividends and balance sheets, according to State Street Advisors. 
The former telecom sector traded at a forward price to earnings ratio of 10.6, nearly half of the 19.3 P/E of the new communications sector.
The sector paid a dividend yield of 5.45 percent, making it an attractive place for investors to hide during market downturns. Yet the sector, renamed communication services, now includes stocks like Netflix, which doesn’t pay a dividend at all. 
With the telecom sector gone, more investors will gravitate toward consumer staples and utilities sectors, which have become a popular - and expensive - place for dividend income, said Jeffrey Liguori, chief investment officer at Providence, Rhode Island-based Napatree Capital. 

""Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is not a telephone company anymore and neither is AT&T,"" he said. ""They should be trading like media companies and getting valuations that are more appropriate as well.""

949,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Global spending on digital marketing nears $100 billion: study,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Spending on digital marketing grew by 44 percent last year in the United States and Britain to $52 billion, a study has found, estimating that global outlays on such tactics are approaching $100 billion.
In contrast to placing online ads through intermediaries, digital marketing, or ""martech"", has the appeal of enabling brands to target consumers directly via social media, search-engine optimization or voice-activated assistants, such as Amazon's (O:AMZN) Alexa.
The growth in part reflects a desire to take functions in house following high-profile complaints by consumer giants Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and Unilever (AS:UNc) over fraud in online advertising. 
The issue of 'brand safety', which can be jeopardized when ads appear next to unsuitable online content, has also frustrated marketers and encouraged them to seek greater control over how they target audiences.
""Clearly marketers are seeking to build in-house strength and are set to spend more on martech to remain competitive,"" said study author Damian Ryan, a partner at UK accountancy firm Moore Stephens.
""Our research finds that this budget is coming from media spend and will have a resounding impact on the value of media-centric agencies,"" he added, referring to traditional ad agencies that are struggling to adapt to the digital era.
The Moore Stephens survey, conducted with advertising and media consultancy WARC, covered 800 companies in North America, the Asia-Pacific and Europe.
It found that brands in Britain and North America spent 23 percent of their budgets on martech, up from 16 percent a year ago. And 63 percent of U.S. technology budgets were spent in-house, compared with 44 percent last year.
Tough European data protection rules that took effect in May, as well as concerns over the data practices of search giant Google (O:GOOGL) and social network Facebook (O:FB) - the two biggest online advertising platforms - have led several players in the ad industry to merge or retrench.
""We're at the beginning of the shakeout,"" Ryan told Reuters in an interview.
The emergence of platform companies that offer a one-stop shop for marketers is another trend to watch, he said, highlighting Adobe Systems' (O:ADBE) acquisition in May of e-commerce company Magento for $1.7 billion.
Adobe has just struck another deal, to buy business-to-business marketing software firm Marketo, for $4.75 billion.
""Fundamentally, brands don't like to trust agencies with data. The clear trend shows that brands are seeking to take control over marketing technology,"" said Ryan.

""Against that, we can see that, at the upper end where brands are spending more, they are still working with agencies.""

The company, under its new boss Mark Read, is considering a merger between Young & Rubicam and WPP's digital-ad firm VML, putting the combined group under the leadership of VML CEO Jon Cook, WSJ reported, citing sources.
There are talks about having the group's direct-marketing company Wunderman work with its creative firms to provide access to consumer data to help them craft more relevant ads, the WSJ reported, citing a source. 
The market leader has been hit hard in the last year as clients have increasingly turn to online platforms such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to reach consumers.
The group is also recovering from the departure of its founder and veteran CEO Martin Sorrell who left in April after complaint about personal misconduct, which he denied. 

WPP was not immediately available to comment on the report.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast scored a big win in the scramble for media assets by beating Rupert Murdoch, and his backer  Disney , in the battle for Sky with an eye-watering $40 billion bid.
It was a ""great day"" for Comcast (O:CMCSA), Chairman and Chief Executive Brian L. Roberts said of Saturday's auction victory. The U.S. group has had its sights set on Sky (L:SKYB), Europe's biggest pay-TV company, ever since Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) beat it to most of Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) assets in July.
Some analysts, however, said that Comcast's bid of 17.28 pounds per share in the rare blind auction was driven by an urgent need to build scale to defend against the threat posed by streaming services Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN).
""The price being paid for Sky is shocking, but it is a clear sign that legacy media companies are desperate for scale in a world dominated by tech platform giants,"" said Richard Greenfield, technology and media analyst at research firm BTIG.
Explaining the basis of big media's rush to merge, Greenfield likened it to the opening scene in the documentary ""March of the Penguins"". 
'WINTER IS COMING'
""The penguins huddle to survive winter. With Disney/Fox and Comcast/Sky, it's penguins huddling. Winter is still coming,"" he said, referring to the advance of tech players such as Amazon.
Sky would reduce Comcast's reliance on its mature U.S. market by opening the door to Europe, where pay-TV penetration is at about 30 percent and rising. 
The deal would also transform Comcast into the world's largest pay-TV operator with 52 million customers and lift the proportion of its non-U.S. revenue to about 20 percent from about 9 percent, based on 2017 full-year figures.
Comcast is paying a high price - more than double Sky's share price before Fox made its approach in December 2016. But analysts said that a favorable result in the English Premier League soccer rights auction - Sky's biggest expense - during the takeover saga had made the business more valuable.
Sky also gives Comcast an immediate beachhead in online video streaming with its Now TV business, which has about 2 million customers. 
Analysts see Comcast super-charging Now TV to combat Netflix across the globe. And Sky's exclusive relationships to distribute HBO entertainment content and Premier League soccer further insulate Comcast over the next few years. 
CLOUDS AND SILVER LININGS
Critics of the deal, however, argue that such relationships are sure to come under threat in the longer term, as content producers launch their own services and competition for sports broadcasting rights intensifies as deep-pocketed tech companies join the fray.
On the upside, however, Sky's product range - including broadband connections that complement its satellite offer in state-of-the-art platforms such as Sky Q - and its brand make it more than a content aggregator, said Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis, 

""Sky has an extraordinarily well established brand; it is a destination, and that is very valuable in the world of fragmented media,"" she said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Porsche will stop offering diesel versions of its cars, the unit said on Sunday, sharpening its focus on hybrid and battery-powered vehicles instead.
Volkswagen has admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests, sending shockwaves through the automotive industries and causing a sector-wide crackdown on polluting diesel engines.
As a result, carmakers around the world have ramped up spending on the development of electric cars, hoping to catch up with pioneer Tesla (O:TLSA).
""Porsche is not demonizing diesel. It is, and will remain, an important propulsion technology,"" Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume said in a statement.
""We as a sports car manufacturer, however, for whom diesel has always played a secondary role, have come to the conclusion that we would like our future to be diesel-free.""
Porsche's existing diesel customers would continue to be served, he said. 
Porsche, which is investing more than 6 billion euros ($7.1 billion) in electric mobility by 2022, said that demand for diesel models was dropping, adding their share of worldwide Porsche cars was 12 percent in 2017.
""We have never developed and produced diesel engines ourselves. Still, Porsche's image has suffered. The diesel crisis has caused us a lot of trouble,"" Blume said in a separate interview with weekly Bild am Sonntag.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss whether to require the car industry to carry out costly hardware upgrades for older diesel vehicles to reduce inner-city pollution, government sources said.
Porsche has sold diesel versions of its cars for nearly a decade. It has not had a diesel in its line up since February. Next year, it will launch the Taycan, which it says is its first fully-electric sports car.
According to Bild am Sonntag, Porsche is suspected of manipulating engines to improve their sound on the road at the expense of higher emissions, adding this function was not active in a testing environment.
Asked about this, Blume said: ""In the individual case of the 8-cylinder Cayenne EU5, the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has declared an engine charge control as not being in line with the law. This was about nitrogen oxide, not CO2.""

Blume said that Porsche was owning up to the issue, adding it affected about 13,500 diesel vehicles and that the carmaker was also examining petrol cars as a precautionary measure.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 05:04AM ET</span>","In Nigeria, Shell’s onshore roots still run deep","By Ron Bousso
BODO, Nigeria (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) wants to reweight its footprint in Nigeria to focus on oil and gas fields far offshore, away from the theft, spills, corruption and unrest that have plagued the West African country's onshore industry for decades.
Graphic: Oil spills at Shell's Nigeria operations - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KzACfH
But for the company that pioneered Nigeria's oil industry in the 1950s, the Niger Delta remains as important -- and problematic -- as ever.
While Shell has cut onshore oil production and sold some onshore assets, it continues to invest in others. In fact, onshore production has risen in recent years as a share of Shell's output in Nigeria, an analysis of company data over the past decade shows.
Graphic: Shell Nigeria production - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OB5wa0
Much of the increase comes from less polluting gas, used mainly in power generation, which Shell thinks will be key to the transition to lower carbon energy. Gas made up 70 percent of onshore production in 2017, up from 47 percent in 2008. 
Graphic: Nigeria onshore production - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CLPxEU
The company still controls thousands of kilometers of pipelines connecting inland fields to coastal terminals through its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Co of Nigeria (SPDC), however.
So while SPDC has cut oil production in the Delta by 70 percent since 2011, when it first started reporting data on spills, the incidence of spills and theft from pipelines has fallen at a much lower rate and has picked up again recently, the data shows.
Shell's Nigeria Country Chair Osagie Okunbor hinted it was a sensitive balancing act.
""We are too big just to see ourselves as 'there is a problem and we have to run'. That is not what we are thinking of doing,"" he told reporters on a media trip to the country in July. ""But at the same time we don't want to spread our footprint.""
Two pipeline spills in 2008 in the small community of Bodo in Ogoniland are emblematic of the problems in the Delta, a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps criss-crossed by pipelines and blighted by poverty and oil-fueled violence.
On a speedboat trip to the site of a clean-up operation launched by Shell last year, a makeshift oil refinery stood idle on a charred landing. The ground was soaked with oil, the air heavy with petrol fumes and slicks glistened in the water nearby. There were few signs of birds or fish.
So far this year, 85 crude spills have been recorded, already higher than the previous two years. In 2016, militant attacks pushed the volume of spills to more than 30,000 barrels, a high since 2011. 
Oil theft from SPDC rose to around 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 - a loss of nearly $180 million for the year - from 6,000 bpd the year before.
Despite all the problems and costs, however, Nigerian onshore operations generate billions of dollars annually.
Shell does not break down profits by country, but a report on payments to governments that the company publishes annually showed it paid around $1.1 billion in royalties, taxes and fees to the Nigerian government in 2017.
That means Shell earned more than $4 billion from oil and gas production in Nigeria in 2017 - around 7 percent of its total global output.
A Shell spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters' data analysis. 
The Nigerian Petroleum Ministry declined to comment.
Shell has shown it can shut down if it is not making money. It stopped producing oil completely in Iraq last year after half a century in the country, although it retains substantial gas operations.
""It's hard to think Shell would stay put onshore and weather all the problems if the assets didn't offer decent returns,"" said Aaron Sayne, a financial crime lawyer working at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI). ""To some extent, the onshore must still be worth the trouble."" 
THEFT AND SPILLS 
Shell remains central to Nigeria's economy and society. SPDC - operated by Shell with a 30 percent stake while the Nigerian National Petroleum Co has 55 percent, France's Total has 10 percent and Italy's Eni has 5 percent - is the country's largest oil joint venture, employing thousands.
The Anglo-Dutch giant's operations drew unwelcome attention in the early 1990s when residents of the Delta's Ogoni region called for fairer distribution of oil wealth and compensation for spills. The government cracked down and in 1995 executed nine protest leaders, including prominent writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, prompting Shell to end production in the area forever. 
It retained control of the Trans-Niger Pipeline, however, and nearly a quarter of a century later, little seems to have changed on the ground.
In 2015 Shell accepted responsibility for operational faults that caused the 2008 spills that dumped tens of thousands of oil barrels into creeks around Bodo, and paid a settlement of 55 million pounds to villagers.
Dozens of spills since, including one by a barge carrying stolen oil that sunk in July, are frustrating remediation efforts, clean-up officials said.
""You clean it up, you walk away, somebody goes back there and does the same thing. It's like going around in circles,"" said Ogonnaya Iroakasi, Ogoni restoration project supervisor and an SPDC member.
Around 80 percent of the spills are a result of sabotage, Shell data shows.
Shell has taken a number of steps to improve the situation in the area, including training youth to start up businesses and funding local community patrols, campaigns to raise local awareness and even a local radio station.
But critics say it is not enough. 
""I am not minimizing the challenge of re-pollution but Shell are not doing enough to solve it,"" said Daniel Leader, the Bodo community's lead UK lawyer. ""The pipelines are not equipped with the most basic leak detection technology and Shell is simply not present on the ground in these communities."" 
Local residents are frustrated as the slow process stops many from fishing, one of the main sources of income. Much of the anger is focused on Shell but Eni has also struggled to cope in recent years. Since starting to report data to authorities in 2014, the Italian company has recorded more spills than Shell, according to Amnesty International.
""Please, don't give up on us ... I hope that you guys here can force Shell to do the right thing,"" Michael Porobunu, chairman of Gokana council of chiefs, told the clean-up crew and reporters on his porch. 
OFF THE COAST
SPDC has sold 10 of the 27 field licenses in the Delta it held in 2010, mostly to local companies. It has applied to renew the remaining licenses, which expire next year.
The divestments are a reminder of another cost of doing business in Nigeria - corruption. Shell has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the $390 million sale of oil mining license 42 to local firm Neconde in 2011.
Offshore operations are an attractive alternative to the Delta in many ways. The Bonga field 120 km (75 miles) off the coast is one of Shell's prized assets since starting up in 2005.
The giant tanker, with a drilling platform that pumps 225,000 barrels of oil and 210 million cubic feet of gas per day from a field one km below, won the company's ""asset of the year award"" in 2016 for its safety and reliability.
Many risks remain. In 2016, the Trans-Forcados pipeline was shut down for months after militants detonated a bomb at its sub-sea section. Shell and Eni face bribery allegations in a Milan court over the 2011 purchase of an offshore license. Drilling offshore is also more expensive and technically complex.
Shell and its partners will decide next year on whether to develop a new offshore field, Bonga Southwest.

""Such an investment will reopen the window for the next wave of investment in deep water Nigeria,"" Bayo Ojulari, managing director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, said in Lagos.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Danger remains even as flood waters recede in Hurricane Florence's aftermath,"By Gene Cherry and Harriet McLeod
(Reuters) - Nearly all rivers and waterways in North and South Carolina will crest Sunday, but most will remain at dangerous flood levels for days to come, the U.S. National Weather Service warned, more than a week after the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people.
Swaths of rivers near the Atlantic coast will not crest for days to come, such as the lower Cape Fear River near Wilmington, N.C., one of the hardest hit communities, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS's Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland.
""This isn't over,"" Oravec said early Sunday. ""Large sections of rivers near the coast won't start cresting until at least early in the week, maybe later.""
""All that water is going to take a good while to recede,"" he said. ""Damage can still be done. It'll be a slow drop.""
Meanwhile, remnants of the once mighty storm, brought heavy rains northwest up the Ohio Valley, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said.
Officials in towns and cities in both North and South Carolina were filling sandbags and finalizing evacuation plans, eyeing some rivers that are swollen by heavy rainfall on Saturday.
In Conway, South Carolina, where President Donald Trump visited this week, images posted by the city on Saturday showed water lapping at homes in an area where residents were being evacuated.
In Lee's Landing in Horry County, some residents used boats to get to safety as the Waccamaw River spilled into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported. 
""If you can get out, get out,"" Joseph Tanner, the county's fire rescue chief, said in an interview with WBTW News 13.
More than two dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, the NWS said. 
At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm, with most of those in North Carolina.
About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters.
Nearly 550 roads remained closed, the state's department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence.
 Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River.
Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife.
The company is testing the water for possible contamination, Duke officials said in a release Saturday.
""The company is bringing in additional construction material from across the state to repair the breach as soon as the flood waters recede,"" the release said.
The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog ""lagoons,"" which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to state officials. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country.
Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 06:17PM ET</span>",Comcast outbids Fox with $40 billion winning offer for Sky,"By Ben Martin and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Comcast (O:CMCSA) beat Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) in the battle for Sky (L:SKYB) on Saturday after offering 30.6 billion pounds ($40 billion) in a dramatic auction to decide the fate of the pay-television group.
The U.S. cable giant bid 17.28 pounds a share for control of London-listed Sky, bettering a 15.67 pounds-a-share offer by Fox, Britain's Takeover Panel said.
Buying Sky will make Philadelphia-based Comcast, which owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures, the world's largest pay-TV operator with around 52 million customers.
Chairman and chief executive Brian Roberts has had his eye on Sky as a way to help counter declines in subscribers for traditional cable TV in its core U.S. market as viewers switch to video-on-demand services like Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN).
""This is a great day for Comcast,"" he said. ""This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.""
Comcast's knock-out offer thwarted Murdoch's long-held ambition to win control of Sky, and is also a setback for U.S. entertainment giant Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) which would have likely been its ultimate owner.
Disney has agreed a separate $71 billion deal to buy most of Fox's film and TV assets, including its existing 39 percent stake in Sky, and would have taken full ownership after a successful Fox takeover. 
Comcast's final offer was a jump on its bid going into the auction of 14.75 pounds, and compares with Sky's closing price of 15.85 pounds on Friday.
Comcast believed it needed to deliver a knock-out blow given that Fox's existing stake in Sky gave it a chance of victory if it was a close second to Comcast, two sources said. 
Its final offer - more than double Sky's share price before Fox made its approach in December 2016 - quickly won the backing of Sky's independent directors on Saturday.
""We are recommending it as it represents materially superior value,"" said Martin Gilbert, chairman of Sky's independent committee. ""We are focused on drawing this process to a successful and swift close and therefore urge shareholders to accept the recommended Comcast offer.""
Fox noted the recommendation, saying it was considering options for its 39 percent stake and would make another announcement in due course.
""Sky is a remarkable story and we are proud to have played such a significant role in building the incredible value reflected today in Comcast's offer,"" Fox said.
Fox's holding, which Comcast's offer values at more than $15 billion, stems from Murdoch's role in the creation of the company nearly three decades ago.
His younger son James was pivotal in building Sky into Europe's leading pay-TV operator as its former chief executive and current chairman. 
Comcast, which requires 50 percent plus one share of Sky's equity to win control, said it was also seeking to buy Sky shares in the market.
HUGE PRICE
One fund manager who holds Sky shares said nobody could complain about the Comcast price. 
""The question now is if Fox actually sells out and if not can Comcast get to 50 percent,"" he said. 
One banker involved in the auction said: ""Did Comcast pay a lot more than they needed to?""
Sources familiar with the matter said Fox, Disney and Comcast had not been in discussions about the 39 percent stake.
The auction was a dramatic climax to a transatlantic bidding battle waged since February, when Comcast gate-crashed Fox's takeover of Sky.
It is a blow to 87-year-old Murdoch, who tried to buy Sky eight years ago only for the bid to collapse in the fallout from a phone-hacking scandal at his British newspaper business. 
Some politicians have opposed a deal, citing concerns about the influence Murdoch would wield over the UK's news agenda.
Fox made a string of concessions to assuage those worries and land a company that serves 23 million households in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.
Sky's chief executive Jeremy Darroch said Comcast's victory was the beginning of a new chapter. ""Sky has never stood still, and with Comcast our momentum will only increase,"" he said.

RALEIGH, N.C., CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Communities in North and South Carolina along waterways to the Atlantic coast faced rising floods on Saturday more than a week after the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people.
Officials in towns and cities in both states were filling sandbags and finalizing evacuation plans, eyeing some rivers that are swollen by heavy rainfall but not expected to crest until Sunday.
In Conway, South Carolina, where President Donald Trump visited this week, images posted by the city on Saturday showed water lapping at homes in an area where residents were being evacuated.
In Lee's Landing in Horry County, some residents used boats to get to safety as the Waccamaw River spilled into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported. 
""If you can get out, get out,"" Joseph Tanner, the county's fire rescue chief, said in an interview with WBTW News 13.
More than two dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, the National Weather Service said. 
At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm, with most of those in North Carolina.
About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters.
Nearly 550 roads remained closed, the state's department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence.
 Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK) said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River.
Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife.
The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog ""lagoons,"" which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to state officials. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country.
Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. airline industry scored a win on Saturday as bipartisan congressional legislation dropped plans to mandate ""reasonable and proportional"" baggage and change fees, but included other new passenger protections.
After weeks of negotiations, a 1,200-page bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was unveiled early Saturday that would require the FAA to set minimum dimensions for passenger seats -- including legroom and width -- and prohibits airlines from involuntarily removing passengers from flights after they’ve cleared the boarding gate.
In April 2017, video went viral on social media of 69-year-old passenger David Dao being dragged from a United Airlines (O:UAL) flight at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after he refused to give up his seat to make room for crew members. United apologized and promised not to remove seated passengers to make room for other passengers.
But airlines had heavily lobbied against new rules limiting fees. U.S. airlines revenue from baggage and reservation change fees increased from $5.7 billion in 2010 to $7.5 billion in 2017. Other fees are not reported to regulators.
The compromise bill did not include language adopted by a Senate Committee in 2017 that would have required the reasonable fee rules. It was struck in a compromise unveiled by Senate Commerce Committee Republican chairman John Thune and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman Bill Shuster, a Republican, along with the top Democrats on the two committees Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Peter DeFazio. 
Congress is set to vote on the measure next week ahead of a September 30 deadline.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) became the latest major airline on Thursday to hike checked bag prices by $5 for the first bag to $30, joining Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), United and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU).
Airlines for America, an airline trade group, has said the fee provision would result in “government-mandated price controls” and should be rejected and the Trump administration also strongly opposed the provision.
The bill also requires the U.S. Transportation Department to set new rules authorizing commercial drone deliveries and gives the Justice Department and Homeland Security Department new authority to disable or destroy drones if they pose a threat to government facilities after the Trump administration warned it did not have the legal authority it needed to address threats.
Under the bill, airlines must refund passengers for services they paid for but did not receive and will enshrine in law a prohibition on passengers making mobile phone calls while in flight or using e-cigarettes.
The bill requires airlines to allow passengers to check strollers if they are traveling with a small child and require regulators to determine if it is unfair or deceptive for airlines to tell passengers ""that a flight is delayed or canceled due to weather alone when other factors are involved.""
It also makes it unlawful for any person to place a live animal in an overhead storage compartment, prompted by outrage over the death a dog in March in an overhead compartment of a United flight. It also gives the Transportation Department authority to require airlines to allow pregnant passengers to board earlier.
The bill would also authorize a return of ""supersonic"" transport with reduced sonic booms, and provides for an additional $1.68 billion in immediate funding for disaster relief in the wake of Hurricane Florence.
It also directs the FAA to establish an Office of Spaceports to provide guidance, support licensing for spaceports, and promote infrastructure improvements for future space travel.
The bill also addresses sexual misconduct in aviation by creating a task force to review practices and increases civil penalties for interfering with cabin or flight crew members.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An overhaul of Wall Street's technology and media sectors coincided with the quarterly expiration of futures and options, bringing a burst of volume to trading late on Friday that could continue in the days that follow.
After the close on Friday, S&P Dow Jones Indices was poised to reorganize several of its sectors and relaunch its telecommunications index as a new communication services sector.
About 10.87 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday, the highest volume since Feb. 9 and one of the highest-volume sessions of the year, according to Thomson Reuters. A big chunk of the volume came in the last 15 minutes of the session.
Of the S&P technology sector's 10 biggest percentage decliners of the day on Friday, three were companies that are joining the new communication sector. Twitter was the biggest loser, with a 4.5 percent drop, while Facebook was the fourth-biggest decliner, with a 1.9 percent drop, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw the seventh-biggest loss, with a 1.6 percent drop. The reorganization by S&P and MSCI of the Global Industry Classification Standard involves S&P 500 heavyweights like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc, and drastically alters the weightings of some sectors.
The telecom sector, currently about 2 percent of the entire S&P 500, is expected to have a roughly 11 percent weighting under its new communication services tag. Technology, with a roughly 26 percent weighting, is expected to fall to about 20 percent. Consumer discretionary is likely to drop from 13 percent to about 11 percent. 
(S&P 500 future sectors: https://reut.rs/2CEBuBd)
(S&P 500 current components: https://reut.rs/2CHuALD)
On top of the index reshuffling and ""quadruple witching"" expirations, S&P also is implementing the quarterly rebalancing of its indexes.
Among the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq on Friday were AT&T (NYSE:T),  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and Facebook, all of which will be in the new communication services sector.
EBay, also in the top 25 most active stocks on the Nasdaq on Friday, is being moved from the technology into the consumer discretionary sector, which will result in fund managers needing to buy more than 2.7 million shares in the online marketplace, according to ITG.
""The assets associated with the information technology ETF are greater, so this is actually a net positive for eBay in that fund managers will have to buy more shares than they will have to sell,"" said Ivan Cajic, head of index research at ITG in New York.
""It will be a net positive demand for eBay."" 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will remain in the tech sector but will see its share float fall about 5 percent due to Berkshire Hathaway's growing position in the iPhone maker. ITG expects fund managers will need to sell more than 39 million shares due to the smaller float. 
Some strategists expect the sector changes to cause little disruption to the market because money managers have had a long time to prepare. S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the overhaul in November 2017.
""It has been well, well publicized that they were doing this, so it should not create all kinds of drama,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. 
Others said reshuffling by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are actively managed may result in higher volatility in the short term as managers rotate money to new areas. 
Those in charge of actively managed funds could be adjusting positions for weeks following the sector changes, said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.
""At the end of the day, large-cap growth managers are going to be really overweight communication services,"" he said. 

""That has some potential to cause some interesting swings over the next several weeks,"" DeSanctis said. ""A lot of investment managers try to keep their sector weights within a certain boundary plus or minus a couple of hundred basis points.""

964,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 12:43AM ET</span>",White House optimistic on China trade; no date for more talks,"By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is optimistic about finding a way forward in its trade dispute with China, but it does not have a date scheduled for further talks as it assesses Beijing's response to the latest round of tariffs, a senior White House official said on Friday.
The official said despite its protestations, China was well aware of U.S. demands it halt what Washington considers unfair trade practices. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his resolve on the issue, the official said, and the two sides remain in touch.
""We have been very clear in all of these meetings about what is ... required,"" the official said. ""I am still optimistic that there is a positive way forward, and the president wants us to continue to engage to try to achieve a positive way forward.""
The official's comments came ahead of a report by the Wall Street Journal that China had canceled mid-level trade talks with the United States, as well as a proposed visit to Washington by vice premier Liu He originally scheduled for next week.
Earlier this week, China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list as it hit back at U.S. duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods that go into effect from Sept. 24. The escalating trade dispute has spooked financial markets.
Speaking to reporters at the White House on condition of anonymity, the official made clear the administration's ultimate goal was not to separate the interlinked U.S. and Chinese economies, but he said companies could choose to alter their supply chains if Beijing did not change course.
""Our goal here is not to cleave off the Chinese market from the U.S. market, I don't think that's good for long-term growth,"" he said. ""In the short term there is of course a risk that if China continues on the path it is, that some companies as a result of this may start ... to move supply chains.""
The official also said he hoped Canada would agree to join a U.S.-Mexico trade deal by the end of the month, while saying he thought U.S. lawmakers would support a bilateral deal with Mexico if that did not happen.
U.S. and Canadian officials have been engaged in talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, a 1994 deal that underpins $1.2 trillion in trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The official dismissed concerns separate deals with Canada and Mexico would have a negative impact on supply chains. 
""I think it's overblown to say that if we have separate deals with these two, that there still can't be a really high degree of integration,"" he said.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>","China drafts new nuclear energy law, focus on international market","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will provide more support for its nuclear firms to go overseas and strengthen their position on the international market, according to new draft legislation submitted to the industry for consultation on Friday.
""The state will encourage and support the positive and orderly participation of its enterprises in the international market"" and promote the export of nuclear equipment, fuel and services, the draft Atomic Energy Law says.
China aims to bring its total installed nuclear capacity to 58 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2020, up from 37 GW at the end of June this year, but it also has ambitions to dominate the global market and has created a unified third-generation reactor brand known as the ""Hualong One"" to sell overseas. 
China has already signed a series of preliminary agreements with countries like Brazil, Argentina, Uganda and Cambodia and it is also undergoing a technical approval process for the Hualong One in Britain. 
The government also published new guidelines last month aimed at promoting its own technical standards in foreign markets and play a ""leading role"" in the global nuclear technology standardization process. 
However, its only overseas nuclear project so far is the Chashma nuclear complex in Pakistan. 
China's new draft atomic energy law sets out the government's responsibilities when it comes to disclosing information about the safety and environmental impact of nuclear power. It also includes clauses calling for the ""convergence"" of military and civilian research into nuclear energy.
It calls for the establishment of a uranium reserve and a system for storing, transporting and treating spent fuel. Members of the public are invited to submit their opinions about the legislation to the Ministry of Justice before Oct. 19. 
China was once regarded as one of the bright spots for the global nuclear sector, but its ambitious domestic reactor building program has slowed considerably, with no new projects approved since 2016.
In a bid to guarantee safety in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011, China promised to deploy only new and safer reactor technology, including Westinghouse's AP1000 and the EPR designed by France's Areva.
But the untested models have been repeatedly delayed amid design flaws and huge cost overruns, and Beijing is now expected to struggle to meet its 58 GW target.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 09:24PM ET</span>",Caterpillar leans on old playbook to cope with Trump tariffs,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CLAYTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Six months into the U.S. tariffs on imported aluminum and steel,  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) is finding that one of the best ways it can protect profits is a cost cutting strategy that is more than two years old. 
At this sprawling factory in central North Carolina where it makes small front-end loaders, the company laid off workers in 2016 in response to plunging sales, consolidating two shifts into one under a program it calls the Operation & Execution Model. 
Even though demand has picked up since then, its Clayton plant still runs a single shift and operates only four days a week. One third of the facility's 550 employees are on flexible contracts.
The result: CAT is producing more loaders here with 30 percent fewer people on the factory floor than in the past, the company told Reuters. 
It has redesigned all new machines it makes with over 20 percent fewer parts, cutting back on the consumption of steel which brings down the cost, Tony Fassino, vice president at Caterpillar's building construction products, said after a factory tour in Clayton.
""Fewer parts numbers are a huge win,"" Fassino told Reuters. ""It improves safety, it improves the quality, it improves the cost.""
Now, these cost cutting approaches are helping counter the financial impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade wars.
The heavy-duty equipment maker estimates the import tariffs will inflate its raw materials costs by up to $200 million between July and December, though it does not provide a forecast for manufacturing costs in 2018. Caterpillar has said it would offset the impact through a price increase that went into effect on July 1 and general cost cutting measures, helping it post a record profit for all of 2018.
Caterpillar's increasing emphasis on operating efficiency has proven timely, helping to bring down the cost of production at a time when material expenses are mounting on Trump's import curbs, and capacity constraints are driving up freight costs. 
(For graphic click https://tmsnrt.rs/2NG2DrF)
An internal calculation provided to Reuters, previously unreported, shows that the measures have accounted for half of the improvements in the profit margins since 2015 at the company's construction industries division. Since January 2017, the efficiency model has been rolled out across the company, but CAT would not disclose more details.
CAT, Deere & Co (N:DE) and Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) are among the many manufacturers trying to keep a lid on expenses to cope with a 30 percent rise in U.S. steel prices since the start of 2018.
Those rising costs, along with a tit-for-tat tariff war with China, have clouded the earnings outlook for industrial companies, dragging down their shares.
Despite a recent rally this month, Caterpillar shares are down about 9 percent from their late-January levels, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in S&P 500 industrials index (SPLRCI), showing investors have yet to fully reward the company for its industry-best efficiency results when it comes to operating margins and return on net operating assets.
(For graphic click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CN5P0g)
Steve Volkmann, a machinery analyst at Jefferies, attributes the stock's underperformance to concerns that the company's greater exposure to foreign markets and a sizeable presence in China make it more vulnerable to escalating trade wars.
""It is disappointing that they can't get paid for good quarters these days,"" he said, referring to the company's strong earnings in the last quarter.
While overseas markets do account for more than half of Caterpillar's sales, the company has an evenly spread manufacturing footprint across the globe, which Volkmann and other analysts say make it better placed to deal with the tariffs.
The company has also tried to put at rest worries about its operations in China, saying the trade tensions have not impacted its business there. 
COST CONTROL 
As part of its cost cutting effort, CAT business heads have been mandated to reduce the overall manufacturing cost of every new product by at least 5 percent, one Caterpillar company executive told Reuters. This entails cost cuts by suppliers as well. 
Donaldson Company Inc (N:DCI) - which makes filters for CAT's machines - told Reuters that it tries lower the cost of production every year through material substitution or automation or efficiency gains. Cuts in travel and entertainment budgets helped the company improve operating income by 40 basis points in the latest quarter.
CAT's Operation and Execution effort affects both production strategy decisions and small details of every operation.
For example, it does not make smaller front-wheel loaders in the United States even though their sales in North America are growing. Instead, semi-finished machines are shipped in from overseas factories to the Clayton facility, where tires and buckets are installed, Fassino said.
This not only allows better utilization of the company's factories, but also provides flexibility to tailor the machines to the requirements of local customers.
Similarly, CAT has been managing freight contracts for deliveries across North America since 2016. Apart from improving the predictability of deliveries, and reducing insurance and damage claims, the contracts are letting Caterpillar leverage its scale and volume to moderate transportation costs in its supply chain. 
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
At the Clayton plant, the company's focus on lean manufacturing, efficiency and flexible cost is on full display.
Parts are put in a sequential order in stand-up bag carts next to the assembly line so that assemblers do not have to spend time looking for them.
Suppliers have been instructed to pack the parts in the same way. In case the parts do not arrive in the required order, workers in the factory warehouse are required to unpack and rearrange the parts before they reach the factory floor.
Automation is increasingly being used to test machines. Components and parts are moved on tugger trains instead of by fork lifts to save time and cost. 

""Save one minute here and save five minutes there. Add all that up, you have two shifts to one shift,"" said Caterpillar's Fassino.

(Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) pilots said they refuse to budge on the wording of their contract governing the outsourcing of regional flights.
President of the U.S. No. 3 carrier, Scott Kirby, has called for changes to the so-called ""scope clause"" which sets guidelines on the size of planes that can be operated by regional feeder carriers, among other things. 
A scope clause restricts planes heavier than 86,000 pounds (39,000 kg) with more than 76 seats from regional routes, where pilots are generally paid less than their mainline counterparts. 
""We are holding the line,"" said Todd Insler, chairman of the unit of the Air Line Pilots Association that represents United pilots. “We have no intention of degrading scope.” 
The United negotiations are being watched by other airlines entering labor talks, along with commercial planemakers Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) of Brazil and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) of Japan, which are building new planes that are too heavy to be flown by regional carriers because they exceed the scope clause weight.
A United spokeswoman on Friday referred to earlier remarks by Kirby. Kirby has said changing the scope clause would make the carrier more competitive against rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
Insler disagreed with that.
""We won't use regional jets to disadvantage our mainline employees, pilots, flight attendants, anyone else,"" Kirby told analysts at a conference earlier this month. ""Having competitive scope, however, is really important to being the best. We can't have one hand tied behind our back and try to compete with AA and Delta.""
Pilots have asked United to shift flights from regional carriers to the main airline because smaller carriers use less-efficient 50-seater planes and have faced problems recruiting pilots in a competitive market, according to Insler.

Major carriers have generally been reluctant to make regional flights part of the mainline operations, citing higher costs. ""It's very difficult to make those aircraft work at any mainline airline,"" United Chief Financial Officer Gerald Laderman told analysts at a conference earlier this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday issued an environmental assessment of a revised route for the Keystone XL crude pipeline that concluded it would not harm water or wildlife, clearing a hurdle for the project that has been pending for a decade. 
Even if the pipeline spilled crude oil along its revised route through Nebraska, a top concern of environmentalists, there would likely be no impact to groundwater, the nearly 340-page draft review said. 
""Prompt cleanup response would likely be capable of remediating the contaminated soils before the hazardous release reaches groundwater depth,"" the review said.
Last month a federal judge in Montana had ordered the State Department to conduct the review of a revised route of the project to take into account new information relevant to a permit it issued for the pipeline last year.
The review also said implementing the revised route would have ""no significant direct, indirect or cumulative effects on the quality of the natural or human environments.""
U.S. President Donald Trump is eager to see the building of the pipeline, which was axed by former President Barack Obama in 2015 on environmental concerns relating to emissions that cause climate change.
The project has galvanized environmentalists, tribal groups and ranchers in opposition to the $8 billion 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline that would carry heavy crude from Canada's oil sands in Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. From there the crude would be sent to refineries and potentially for export. 
Canadian oil producers, who face discounts for their crude due to transport bottlenecks, U.S. refineries and pipeline builders, support the project.
TransCanada Corp plans to start construction in 2019, spokesman Matthew John said. 
The company's Chief Executive Russ Girling said last month that it could make a final investment decision on the project late this year or in early 2019, pending some regulatory approvals and court challenges.
Robert Kwan, an RBC analyst, said the draft review was a ""positive step"" for Keystone XL.
Environmentalists said the review was an example of the Trump administration trying to push through a project that would risk harming water resources and increase dependence on crude. 

""We've held off construction of this pipeline for 10 years, and regardless of this administration's attempts to force this dirty tar sands pipeline on the American people, that fight will continue until Keystone XL is stopped once and for all,"" said Kelly Martin, the Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign director for Sierra Club.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ex-employees of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc met at Irish pubs near their former office in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday night to reminisce 10 years after the bank's collapse, in gatherings with the atmosphere of high school reunions despite marking the largest failure of the financial crisis.
More than 100 traders, lawyers and recruiters who worked at Lehman shot the breeze at Connolly's Pub and the Playwright Tavern, both blocks away from the investment bank's old headquarters.
They recalled the best times at Lehman, which had a reputation as a scrappy underdog competing against larger rivals like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), before filing the biggest-ever U.S. bankruptcy by assets on Sept. 15, 2008.
""Who has a reunion about a bankruptcy?"" joked Kevin Genirs, who was senior legal counsel at the bank. ""Lehman always had a great group of people who enjoyed working together.""
Vanessa Jagenburg, who was one of Lehman's few female managing directors in equities, recalled earning the nickname Vanna when she first joined Lehman in 1989, after ""Wheel of Fortune"" host Vanna White. She thinks a trader based on the West Coast bestowed the nickname because he thought she looked like the TV star, even though she was not blonde.
""It was the greatest ride of my life,"" said Jagenburg, who was trading memories with former colleague Ron Gold, who worked in sales.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen people at the two soirees, where Stella Artois beer and vodka sodas flowed freely and some attendees scarfed down hamburgers while getting updates on former colleagues' lives. Most were dressed in business attire and said they have remained in finance, though their careers have gone in directions they would not have predicted before 2008.
Matt Lewis worked in subprime mortgages at Lehman, pitching securitizations to clients who originated loans. He now uses his skills at a boutique firm, but because the mortgage market has changed dramatically since the crisis, much of Lewis' business has dried up.
""It's like having worked on an assembly line at Ford,"" said Lewis. ""But they didn't just move the plant or close the line down. Now everyone's driving a hovercraft.""
After seeing many of his 26,000 Lehman colleagues lose their jobs, Darren Kimball bought an outplacement services firm, now called GetFive.

""I had a great first career,"" said Kimball who worked in equity research sales and trading at Lehman. ""But I don't miss being a slave to a stock going up or down on a Tuesday.""

981,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 05:17PM ET</span>","As new iPhones go on sale, studies reveal chips from Intel and Toshiba","By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) latest iPhones hit stores around the world on Friday, featuring components made by  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Toshiba (T:6502) among others, according to two firms that cracked open the iPhone Xs and Xs Max models.
The studies by repair firm iFixit https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+XS++and+XS+Max+Teardown/113021 and chip analysis firm TechInsights https://w2.techinsights.com/l/4202/2018-09-21/276cjx, published this week, are among the first detailed teardowns of the phones, which reviews suggested were a subtle upgrade from the tenth anniversary iPhone X.
Supplying parts for Apple's iPhones is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers. While Apple publishes a broad list of suppliers each year, it does not disclose which companies make which components and insists its suppliers keep quiet.
That makes teardowns the only way of establishing the breakdown of parts in the phones, although analysts also recommend caution in drawing conclusions because Apple sometimes uses more than one supplier for a part. What is found in one iPhone may not be found in others.
Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
The breakdowns listed no parts from Samsung (KS:005930) and no chips from  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
Samsung in the past has supplied memory chips for Apple's iPhones and was believed by analysts to be the sole supplier of the costly displays for last year's iPhone X.
Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years, but the two have been locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices.
U.S.-based Qualcomm, the world's largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.
Qualcomm said in July that Apple intended to solely use ""competitor's modems"" in its next iPhone release.
The iFixit teardown showed iPhone Xs and Xs Max used Intel's modem and communication chips instead of Qualcomm's hardware. 
The latest iPhones also had DRAM and NAND memory chips from Micron Technology (O:MU) and Toshiba, according to iFixit's study. Previous teardowns of the iPhone 7 had shown DRAM chips made by Samsung in some models.
TechInsights' dissection of a 256-gigabyte storage capacity iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, revealed DRAM from Micron but NAND memory from SanDisk, which is owned by  Western Digital  Corp (O:WDC) and works with Toshiba for its supply of NAND chips.
Toshiba's chip unit Toshiba Memory was purchased by a private equity-led consortium earlier this year that Apple joined.
In the past, TechInsights found Apple used different DRAM and NAND suppliers in the same generation of phones.
""For memory – Apple obviously competes with Samsung and wants to reduce their reliance as much as possible – so totally consistent that we'd see Toshiba for NAND flash storage and Micron for DRAM,"" Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said.
Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, said in an interview that it appeared that one of Dialog Semiconductor's (DE:DLGS) chips had been replaced in the iPhone Xs Max by one of Apple's own chips, but it was not yet known whether that also applied to the iPhone Xs.
Dialog declined to comment. In May, the company said Apple had cut orders for its chips. 

IFixit and TechInsights technicians also found components from companies including Skyworks Solutions (O:SWKS), Broadcom (O:AVGO), Murata (T:6981),  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI), Cypress Semiconductor (O:CY), Texas Instruments (O:TXN) and STMicroelectronics (BN:STM).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrials led the Dow to a new closing high on Friday ahead of Monday's major sector reshuffle, capping a week that largely shrugged off trade worries. 
Trading volume spiked to the highest level since Feb. 9 in anticipation of the S&P 500 sector change, when telecoms will be folded into a new sector called communications services, along with heavy-hitting stocks such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
While the Dow closed higher, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the session in negative territory. The S&P and the Dow posted weekly gains, with the Dow showing its biggest weekly percentage advance in over two months. The Nasdaq lost ground on the week.
""Quadruple witching,"" when stock options and futures expire, and the rebalancing of the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 (RUT) indexes also contributed to heavier traffic.
""A lot of those changes have been anticipated by the index funds, and they've prepared for it,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But there's a lot going on.""
 Boeing Co  (N:BA), the United States' biggest exporter to China, boosted trade-sensitive industrials (SPLRCI) higher. The sector led the Dow's advance. 
Yields on long-dated U.S. Treasuries edged down on Brexit anxieties even with Federal Reserve expected to hike key interest rates next week. Financial stocks (SPSY) headed lower, ending their recent rally. 
""Any time there is a rate hike you potentially see a flattening of the yield curve, which is not good for financials,"" said Ghriskey.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 86.52 points, or 0.32 percent, to 26,743.5, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.08 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,929.67 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 41.28 points, or 0.51 percent, to 7,986.96.
Telecoms (SPLRCL) rose 1 percent on its last trading day as a discrete major S&P sector, and was the index's biggest percentage gainer. 
All of the FAANG momentum stocks ended the session lower, with Facebook, Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) down between 1.1 percent and 1.9 percent.
Shares of security and alarm company ADT Inc (N:ADT) jumped for a second day in a row, closing up 5 percent as Amazon introduced its new Alexa Guard service which could notify ADT of disturbances in the home. 
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) rose 2.8 percent after announcing it would hike its quarterly dividend by 15 percent.
 Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) gained 2.9 percent following an upgrade by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
A 2.9 percent drop in shares of Micron (O:MU) helped pull chipmakers lower after the company said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would weigh on its financial results for as much as a year.
Shares of  Pier 1 Imports  Inc (N:PIR) plunged 19.9 percent after the home furnishings retailer cut its second-quarter forecasts.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 46 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.77 billion shares, nearly 64 percent higher than the 6.57 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Friday that turbine blade oxidation which forced  Exelon Corp  (N:EXC) to idle four electric power units in Texas also affects another model, widening the impact of the latest problem to hit GE's ailing power unit.
GE said the oxidation, which weakens metal turbines blades, also could affect no more than 75 of its 9FB turbines, in addition to some 51 HA-Class turbines that it warned earlier may have the problem.
GE said that the 9FB ""comprises less than 1 percent of the company’s global gas turbine fleet"" of 7,500 turbines installed worldwide. GE has said it sold its first 9FB in 2003. 
GE shares were down 1.5 percent at $12.28. 
The 9FB is part of a prior generation of turbines, known as the F-Class, in which GE holds a market share lead over rivals  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (T:7011).

The 126-year-old, Boston-based company declined to say whether any 9FB turbines have been shut down due to blade oxidation.
Industry experts and investors on Friday were trying to gauge the risk to GE power business, which has suffered steep declines in sales and profits. 
News of the oxidation problem trickled out Wednesday when GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes mentioned it in a post on the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) website.

GE said on Thursday that while four HA-Class units in Texas had been shut down, 10 other HA units in the U.S. were operating. GE's website shows five HA units operating in U.S. GE said the other five have not yet started commercial operation.

996,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Notches Another Record High as Defensive Stocks Rally,"Investing.com - The Dow soared to record highs for a second-straight day Friday as defensive stocks turned to offense on falling U.S. Treasury yields.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.32% to 26,743.50. The S&P 500 fell 0.04% to 2,929.65., while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.51% to 7,986.96.
Falling bond yields increased the attractiveness of high-income-yielding bond proxies like utilities and telecoms, helping offset weakness from profit-taking in financials and tech. The rise in telecoms was also supported by rise in AT&T (NYSE:T) following an upgrade from UBS, citing an ""all-time low valuation,"" and expectations for the company to return to earnings growth next year.
The 10-year Treasury yield slipped Friday, following strong early-week gains as the benchmark Treasury breached the key psychological 3% level earlier this week ahead of a widely-expected U.S. interest rate hike next week.
Profit-taking in financials and tech comes as both sectors posted strong gains for the week on the back of a surge in bond yields and reduced fears on trade, respectively.
China and the United States earlier this week imposed less-harsh-than-expected tariffs on each other, helping lift sentiment on trade.
In sharp contrast, U.S.-Canada talks were set to end the week with little sign of progress as a key White House official suggested the United States could move ahead with a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without Canada, ahead of the U.S.-imposed Oct. 1 deadline.
“We’re still talking to Canada, and we’re getting very, very close to the deadline where we’re going to have to move ahead with Mexico all by themselves,” White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Friday.
Trade-sensitive stocks such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) pushed the Dow into record-setting territory this week, as both posted strong weekly gains.
Energy, meanwhile, also racked up gains, supported the broader markets, as oil prices rebounded from lows, which followed a report suggesting major oil producers were set to discuss plans to boost output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for November delivery rose 46 cents to settle at $70.78 a barrel.
On the corporate earnings front, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) guided sales below analysts' estimates and said PC processor shortages were hurting demand for its memory chips. The chipmaker also warned that President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs on Chinese imports would pressure the company's gross margins.
The company expects future quarterly revenue between $7.9 billion and $8.3 billion, while analysts had estimated $8.45 billion in revenue.
In other corporate news, cannabis company Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) fell 30% Friday after a wild week that saw its shares halted on several occasions after rising as much as 90% on Wednesday intraday.
Trading was volatile today due to quadruple witching, where stock options, stock index options, stock index futures and single stock futures expire.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), the world's largest manager of alternative investments such as private equity and real estate, said on Friday it could be overseeing $1 trillion in assets by 2026. 
The firm currently manages $439 billion, a five-fold increase since it went public in 2007.
The ambitious target highlights how Blackstone, like many peers, is eager to take advantage of healthy investor demand for private equity and other forms alternative asset management. 
There is, however, concern in the industry that fundraising will suffer when the next economic downturn comes, as it did in 2009 during the financial crisis. 
""Now you may ask ... have you tapped out? Are you hitting some ceiling? The answer to that is a definitive 'no,'"" Blackstone President and Chief Operating Officer Jon Gray said at an investor day event, the firm's first since 2014. Gray was promoted earlier this year from head of Blackstone's real estate division.
In a presentation, Blackstone said assets under management could hit $600 billion in the next two years or so, $800 billion in four to six years and pass $1 trillion in eight-plus years. 
The outlook underscores comments by Blackstone Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman in July about the alternative asset management industry entering a fundraising ""super cycle,"" and his belief that Blackstone still has plenty of room to grow.
A growing asset base will boost the amount Blackstone earns from management fees, typically 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the assets it manages. These fees tend to be valued at a premium by investors because they are considered more stable than performance fees, Blackstone's other main revenue stream. 
In its presentation, Blackstone said it had a ""clear path"" in the next two years or so to achieve at least 50 percent growth in fee-related earnings. 
Blackstone shares rose as much 5.1 percent, reaching $39.70, their highest since July 2015.
In January, Blackstone agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of  Thomson Reuters  Corp (N:TRI) (TO:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal. Reuters News will remain part of Thomson Reuters.

Einar Aas, a Norwegian derivatives trader who made large bets on the power market, left a 114 million euro ($134 million) hole in Nasdaq's Nordic clearing house buffers when his funds ran out.
Within just two working days of the default, members of the exchange, and Nasdaq itself, were forced to replenish the funds in order to continue trading.
While Aas had run out of cash, he still owns real estate and other assets that could be sold.
""Nasdaq would like to inform our members and clients that Mr. Aas and his lawyers have agreed to submit to a consensual arrangement with creditors to liquidate Mr Aas's estate,"" Nasdaq Clearing Commodities said in a statement on Friday.
Funds recovered via the process will be distributed to default fund participants on a pro rata basis, it added.
""Nasdaq would support liquidation of the assets in a swift and timely manner consistent with realization of maximum value for members and will liaise with members in relation to this matter,"" the exchange said.
Nasdaq also added it had hired management consulting firm Oliver Wyman to review the clearing unit's risk management practices.
Aas did not respond when contacted by Reuters for comment.
In a statement last week, he said the default would probably lead to personal bankruptcy, and that he did not want to make further public comments on the case.

999,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Putnam stares down hedge funds on big shopping mall bet,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Putnam Investments has placed a large, concentrated bet that struggling U.S. shopping malls can transform themselves even as key tenants shut stores or file for bankruptcy.
So far, it is winning - to the chagrin of hedge funds like Alder Hill Management LP that are on the other side of the bet.
Putnam, a Boston-based mutual fund firm, holds more than $1 billion worth of derivatives tied to mortgages on shopping malls, office buildings and hotels, according to interviews and filings analyzed by Reuters.
One way Putnam gains exposure to the mortgages is through the CMBX Series 6 Index, which references a basket of 25 BBB- rated commercial mortgage-backed securities. There are about 46 shopping malls linked to the index, whose key tenants - Sears Holdings Corp and J C Penney Company Inc - have been closing stores at a rapid clip.
Putnam has been selling protection on the CMBX, which means it is betting that the mortgages referenced in the index will not go bad. Investors buying protection, including Alder Hill, are betting there will be loan defaults and writedowns on the same properties.
Putnam funds receive payments from investors shorting the CMBX index but are on the hook to pay those investors if borrowers do not make adequate mortgage payments or if there is a loan writedown.
The CMBX Series 6 index is generating returns of 6 percent, Brett Kozlowski, a portfolio manager on Putnam's fixed-income team, said in an interview. The trade does not involve any leverage, he said. 
That performance has helped the $4.7 billion Putnam Diversified Income Fund rise nearly 5 percent over the past 12 months, beating 90 percent of peers, according to Morningstar Inc research. That fund discloses nearly $700 million in exposure to the CMBX Series 6. Other Putnam-managed funds have similar investments on a smaller scale.
Although Putnam has been winning, its investment strategy is not without risk. Retailers have struggled for years with consumers' changing tendencies and how to compete against online shopping behemoth Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Nearly 9,000 major chain stores closed in 2017, according to real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. That was more than double the number of closures in 2016, outpacing the record set in 2008 during the Great Recession, Cushman & Wakefield said.
The carnage has continued this year, with the Bon-Ton department store chain filing for bankruptcy and closing more than 260 stores. Its woes mirror rivals like Sears, which has closed more than 250 stores and continues to bleed cash.
Although Putnam realizes the retail sector is still having trouble, its investment strategy is partly based on the idea that shopping malls can transform themselves into different destinations, Kozlowski said. For instance, the Westside Pavilion outside of Los Angeles is converting square footage into office space.
The short sellers see a much grimmer future.
The CMBX Series 6 index would plunge 56 percent in a worst-case scenario outlined by Alder Hill in a July report. Even with limited store closures, the riskiest malls in the index will only be able to produce 45 percent of their 2017 operating profit going forward, the report said.
The New York-based hedge fund declined to comment.
The Emerald Square (NYSE:SQ) Mall in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, is one example cited in its report.
Alder Hill estimates the mall's value is less than outstanding debt of $104 million, hurting its chances for redevelopment like at Westside Pavilion.
""Emerald Square Mall is likely headed for a term default and a high severity loss for CMBS lenders,"" Alder Hill said.
Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) LP, which owns 56 percent of Emerald Square, was not available for comment.

PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Farfetch (N:FTCH) priced its shares above its targeted range on Friday in a New York flotation that values the online luxury retailer at over $5.8 billion and underscores how big a bet web sales have become for high-end brands.
E-commerce is emerging as one of the biggest growth drivers for luxury labels initially fearful of diluting their image by selling online. 
London-based Farfetch - a 10-year-old site that connects shoppers to hundreds of boutiques and fashion labels but carries no inventory - is one of a clutch of rapidly-expanding multi-brand platforms that got an early foothold in the market.
The company's shares were trading as much as 39 percent above its initial public offering at $20 per share on the New York stock exchange on Friday - surpassing the range of $17 to $19 that already had been increased. 
It will raise $885 million in the listing, with the company issuing 33.6 million new shares and existing shareholders, including early backers such as Advent Venture Partners and Vitrurian Partners, selling 10.6 million. 
The IPO values Farfetch, founded by Portuguese entrepreneur Jose Neves, at $5.8 billion according to the share count available in its latest filings. When including employee share options this would rise to $6.3 billion, the company said. 
Existing Farfetch investors include JD.com (O:JD), China's second largest e-commerce firm, which bought extra shares along the listing in a private placement. 
The flotation comes at a time of growing competition among independent online fashion retailers and luxury groups rolling out their e-commerce operations, including cash-rich luxury heavyweights like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), which is experimenting with its own multi-brand site. 
 Richemont  (S:CFR), the Swiss conglomerate that owns jeweler Cartier, this year took control of now delisted Farfetch rival Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter, in a deal that valued that platform at 5.3 billion euros ($6.2 billion). 
Farfetch - which has never turned a profit, but posted a 59 percent jump in revenues last year to $386 million - drew investment from prominent industry players in its IPO, like the Pinault family that controls  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the French group behind brands such as Italy's Gucci. 
To stand out from the crowd, the platform is investing heavily in technology, including for digital store services it is trialing with France's Chanel, one of Farfetch's big name tie-ups. 
""It is an industry that, rightly so, chooses their path and their channels very carefully,"" said Farfetch Chief Executive Jose Neves, adding that, for most luxury retailers, it is all about brand image, aesthetic and high-end customer service.
""But I think the industry has seen the potential of reaching key demographics like the new millennial customer that thinks digital first. These customers are online - they’re not offline.""
Online sales are set to make up a quarter of the luxury industry's revenues by 2025 from just under 10 percent now, according to consultancy Bain, thanks in part to demand from young shoppers in tech-savvy markets like China.
($1 = 0.8493 euros)
""That is an incremental $100 billion opportunity just in online luxury fashion,"" Neves said. ""This is Chapter 2. We want to be a category leader and we want to continue to gain massive share in this space,"" Neves said.

After a rout in August, overseas debt from Argentina has returned 8.9 percent this month, joining a rally in emerging-market assets to post the second-best performance among peers. The IMF is working with a “sense of urgency” to help the country restore confidence, a spokesman said Thursday. Clarin newspaper reported that day that Argentina was seeking to expand its credit line with the lender to as much as $70 billion from $50 billion.
The moves come as investors focus on one of the countries hardest hit by a move away from emerging market assets. The peso lost more than half its value in 2018 and Argentina’s government was forced to seek an unprecedented $50 billion loan from the IMF amid concern that officials weren’t moving fast enough to close the budget and current-account deficits.
""The Argentine bond market has recovered strongly in the last two weeks on hopes that the IMF will provide additional funding to dispel doubts about the country’s solvency in the medium term,"" said Alejandro Hardziej, a fixed income analyst at Julius Baer. ""We remain constructive on Argentina as we believe the government is responding appropriately to unfavorable external conditions.""
Argentine spreads against Treasuries also dropped below 600 basis points for the first time since August. The peso extended gains for a third day to the lowest since Sept. 11. As part of the IMF deal, the country’s Central Bank is looking to create a floating range for the peso, local newspaper Clarin reported, that would allow the peso to trade freely within a range of 32 to 44 pesos per dollar.
""It’s difficult to say whether the upgraded IMF program will provide a positive shock to confidence,"" Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Nomura Holdings, said in a note. ""However the latest price action suggests greater sensitivity to positive headlines and strength ahead of the announcement.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Effective collaboration between companies across South Africa's defense industry and lucrative export markets from Central Asia to Saudi Arabia offer a way out of a crisis in the sector - once a pillar of Africa's most advanced economy - a top industry figure said.
Squeezed global military budgets, domestic economic headwinds and a contracting home market have hit the South African defense industry hard.
But seated in front of a Marauder - a 15-tonne armored truck that gained a cult following after a civilian version appeared on the British motoring program Top Gear - Ivor Ichikowitz, chairman of its manufacturer, the Paramount Group, was upbeat.
""The industry is in a state of crisis at the moment. But there's nothing like a good crisis to create opportunity for regrowth,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of an aerospace and defense expo outside Johannesburg.
""The entire industry now has to reinvent itself to be relevant to the rest of the world."" 
A United Nations arms embargo imposed on South Africa's apartheid government in 1977 forced it to produce all its own military hardware. And by 1994 when Nelson Mandela was elected president in the country's first democratic elections, the industry employed over 100,000 people.
But South Africa's defense spending has steadily declined since, and just 15,000 work in the sector today, a trade association official said last month. 
If it is to survive, Ichikowitz said, the industry as a whole must take a lesson from Paramount, which uses portable production to establish manufacturing operations around the world. 
Paramount now operates in around 30 countries and, according to the company, has posted year-on-year sales growth of 20 to 30 percent over the past decade. 
Now Ichikowitz wants South Africa's optical, electronics, system integration and defense platform industries to work more closely together.
""We're saying the time has come to create Team South Africa,"" he said. ""The fact that South Africa is non-aligned gives us a huge advantage ... That puts us in a position where a lot of markets are open to us."" 
""CRAZINESS IN THE WORLD""
Paramount manufactures military vehicles, aircraft, ships, and weapons systems.
It is expanding its production lines in Kazakhstan from armored vehicles to new areas including unmanned aerial vehicles. It is partnering with Italy's Leonardo Sp (MI:LDOF) to weapons one of its aircraft for the African market. 
This week it announced it would team up with Singapore's ST Engineering to market a line of armored vehicles internationally. And it is planning to produce a variant of one of its light attack aircraft for the U.S. market.
But a much bigger prize may be up for grabs in Saudi Arabia.
One of the world's largest arms purchasers, Saudi Arabia is seeking international partners to develop its manufacturing capabilities with the aim of producing half of its required military equipment domestically by 2030.
Ichikowitz told Reuters in April that Paramount was in talks with the Saudi government to establish production facilities in the kingdom. And representatives from state-owned Saudi Arabian Military Industries were in South Africa this week to speak with other defense companies.
""South Africa has a huge role to play in helping to enable and facilitate the establishment of industry in Saudi Arabia,"" Ichikowitz said.
Saudi Arabia has been fighting a costly war in Yemen since 2015 in support of the internationally recognized government against the armed Couth movement.
""I think the craziness in the world that has created an inward-looking America, an inward-looking Europe, an inward-looking Asia has created a massive opportunity for Africa,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Friday filed a lawsuit accusing Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc of forcing pregnant workers at a Wisconsin warehouse to go on unpaid leave and denying their requests to take on easier duties.
The EEOC, which enforces federal laws banning discrimination in the workplace, said Walmart's distribution center in Menomonie, Wisconsin, has discriminated against pregnant employees since 2014. Federal law requires employers to accommodate workers' pregnancies in the same way as physical disabilities. 
Arkansas-based Walmart is the largest retailer and private employer in the United States.
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove in a statement on Friday said the company does not tolerate discrimination.
""Our accommodations policy has been updated a number of times over the last several years and our policies have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law,"" he said.
Walmart is also facing class action lawsuits in Illinois and New York accusing it of denying accommodations to thousands of pregnant workers at its retail stores. In March, a federal judge in Illinois denied Walmart's bid to dismiss the claims. The New York case is pending. 
Walmart denied the claims in both lawsuits and said its anti-discrimination policy has long listed pregnancy as a protected status.
Friday's lawsuit, filed in federal court in Wisconsin, stems from a complaint filed by Alyssa Gilliam, an employee at the Walmart warehouse in Menomonie.
The EEOC in the lawsuit said Gilliam became pregnant in 2015, and Walmart denied her requests for restrictions on heavy lifting, additional breaks, and a chair to use while working. 
The commission said Walmart refused similar requests by other pregnant workers at the warehouse, but granted them for workers with disabilities or injuries. 
The federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act prohibits workplace discrimination against pregnant women. In a 2015 decision involving  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), the U.S. Supreme Court said the law requires employers to provide the same accommodations to pregnant women as it does disabled workers. 

Since the Supreme Court ruling, workers have filed pregnancy discrimination lawsuits against several large companies, including Merck & Co Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) unit Whole Foods, Novartis AG, and AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's mobile phone subsidiary.

Founded in 1948, Longchamp, best known for its folding Pliage handbags, is one of the last remaining independent family-owned leather goods makers in France with a global presence. 
At a time when some top-of-the-range luxury brands, such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton and Hermes (PA:HRMS), are riding high on strong demand from China, others are having to refresh their designs or marketing strategies to keep young shoppers in particular hooked. 
Longchamp, which does not publish its earnings, saw sales grow at a ""less vigorous"" pace in 2016 and 2017, having tripled in the decade before, Chief Executive Jean Cassegrain, grandson of the firm's founder, said in an interview. 
The company - whose top market is French, followed closely by China - took a hit as tourist numbers in France fell following deadly Islamist militant attacks in 2015. 
But by next year, Cassegrain said Longchamp aims to outperform growth in the broader luxury industry, which according to consultancy Bain, should rise 6 to 8 percent globally.
The firm had said it made sales of 560 million euros ($658.11 million) in 2015, and they are estimated by industry watchers to still be in a 500 million to 600 million range.
Longchamp, which sells its bags and accessories in China through Tencent's (HK:0700) messaging site WeChat, plans to launch its own e-commerce platform there in 2019 to increase sales, following similar moves by rivals LVMH and Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci. 
The handbag maker has largely finished expanding its worldwide store network, with 1,500 sale points in department stores and 300 of its own shops, although it plans to open a few more in the United States, including one in Beverley Hills.
""We're entering a different phase of growth, it's no longer about store openings but about improving the performance of our current network,"" Cassegrain said. 
Longchamp, which manufactures about half its bags in France with the rest in countries including Tunisia and Romania, recently marked its 70th anniversary with its first fashion show in New York and picked celebrity model Kendall Jenner as the face of its campaigns to raises its U.S. profile.

LONDON (Reuters) - Easing fears of a trade war further lifted European shares on Friday, with trade-sensitive sectors like miners (SXPP) and autos (SXAP) leading the advance.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.4 percent, while the Euro STOXX 50 (STOXX50E) ended up 0.8 percent. Both have had 10 straight sessions of gains. 
The last time the STOXX 600 performed so strongly was in September last year, but for the Euro STOXX 50 it was the longest winning streak since 1997.
Markets shrugged off the escalation of the trade war between the U.S. and China, focusing on the fact that tariffs announced this week were lower than expected and on hopes of a compromise.
Inexpensive valuations also fueled demand for European shares, which have been underperforming their U.S. peers recently on worries the region's export-oriented economy could be hit harder by a trade war. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Friday confirmed its overweight rating on European value stocks, mentioning among their buy-rated picks financials Allianz (DE:ALVG) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and miner  Glencore  (L:GLEN). 
Data showing euro zone business growth easing again in September - yet another sign that momentum in the currency bloc has passed its peak - had little impact on trading. 
Miners rose 1.3 percent, leading sectoral gainers on Friday, after copper rallied as investors calculated that the U.S.-China trade dispute could cause less damage than feared.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Luxembourg is among EU states that have urged caution in beefing up the bloc's supervision of banks against money laundering, while Denmark is in favor, an EU official familiar with talks on the matter told Reuters on Friday.
The positions were taken in a closed-door meeting of national envoys that debated a European Commission plan to tighten actions against financial crime, the official said. 
It took place on Thursday, the day after the chief executive of  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), Thomas Borgen, resigned over a money laundering scandal involving the lender's Estonian branch.
There have been other high-profile money laundering cases at banks in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta, Latvia and Spain in recent months.
Currently, the fight against financial crime is conducted by national authorities which share little information and have sometimes showed little appetite to take action against domestic wrongdoers.
In Luxembourg, authorities decline to disclose the names of some banks sanctioned for money laundering, using loopholes in EU rules that allow secrecy, despite international guidelines recommending making them public.
The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland joined the Duchy in warning against acting ""prematurely"" over the Commission proposal, which would give more powers and resources to the European Banking Authority (EBA), the source said.
France, Spain and Denmark were among EU states that showed support.
The proposal, which needs EU states' and lawmakers' approval, was published last week. It needs to be approved before EU elections in May or risks being shelved. 
States had earlier recognized ""gaps"" in the EU legal framework against money laundering.
But the source said most were surprised at last week's Commission proposal, which came only days after they had agreed to postpone action to next year.
Germany, Estonia, Hungary and Italy showed caution about giving more powers to the EBA on money laundering, the official said, but stressed the importance of more cooperation and exchange of information among national authorities.
EU finance ministers will discuss the proposal at their next regular meeting on Oct. 2, according to a preliminary agenda. However, no decision is expected.

The Commission's plan was seen by experts and lawmakers as sensible, although it postponed indefinitely bolder measures, such as the setting up of a single agency to counter money laundering, as recommended by the European Central Bank.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 12:22PM ET</span>",Neiman Marcus bondholder says company may be in default,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Distressed investor Marble Ridge Capital LP said in a letter to Neiman Marcus Group Ltd LLC that the luxury department store company may be in default on its debt after it moved its Mytheresa business into an entity belonging to the retailer's private equity owners.
""These recent actions threaten the viability of a storied franchise that includes marquee brands such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman,"" another luxury department store also owned by the retailer, said Dan Kamensky, managing partner of Marble Ridge, in a statement about the letter, parts of which were made public on Friday. 
Marble Ridge is working with law firm Brown Rudnick LLP and plans to organize with other creditors to look into the Mytheresa move, according to a person familiar with the matter. The hedge fund last year pursued a similar strategy with Singapore-based Global A&T Electronics Ltd. 
""We believe a more responsible board would have engaged in a strategic review to maximize value for the benefit of all of the company's stakeholders,"" Kamensky said.
Buyout firm Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) acquired Neiman Marcus for $6 billion in 2013, saddling the retailer with about $4.7 billion in debt. 
Neiman Marcus said on Tuesday it moved the Mytheresa online business to an entity called Neiman Marcus Group Inc, owned by Ares and CPPIB. 
“As publicly disclosed, Mytheresa was already an unrestricted, non-guarantor subsidiary not part of our lenders’ collateral and it will remain outside of the collateral,"" Neiman Marcus said in a statement. ""This reorganization was expressly permitted by the company’s credit documents.”
Ares and CPPIB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The transfer may have made the company insolvent, Marble Ridge said in the letter dated Sept. 18 and seen by Reuters. Marble Ridge owns bonds and a portion of the term loan of Neiman Marcus.
Moving Mytheresa strips ""an important and valuable asset away from the creditors of the company and (gifts it) to Ares and CPPIB,"" for nothing in return, according to the letter.
Mytheresa's earnings growth has outpaced Neiman Marcus, its outlet stores Last Call and Bergdorf Goodman online, Thomson Reuters IFR reported in a story this week, citing a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst report. 
Brick-and-mortar retailers including department stores have been hit hard by the rise in popularity of online shopping, with dozens filing for bankruptcy over the past several years. Reuters reported last year that Neiman Marcus was working with an investment bank to address its debt load.
J. Crew Group Inc, another upscale fashion retailer, faced litigation from its creditors after it moved its intellectual property to an affiliated company in a debt restructuring deal.

AT&T rose about 2% at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT).
The stock was boosted by an upgrade from UBS, which raised the stock to buy from neutral, according to published reports. UBS raised its price target to $38 from $33 and said the company should return to growth in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the second half.
Sentiment was also buoyed by the company after it asked a federal appeals court to reject the Justice Department’s challenge of its acquisition of Time Warner.
AT&T was one of several strong performers in the S&P Telecom Sector index, which was up about 1.5%.
With bond yields retreating today, telecoms tend to outperform as their dividends become more attractive.
But there is an argument that AT&T will diverge from that sector when, as expected, the Time Warner deal goes through and that it will be looked on as more of a content and tech play.
The rise in bonds and corresponding retreat in yields also impacted the financial stocks, which are down but still on track for a strong week.
The S&P Financial Sector index, which hit levels not seen since the first quarter recently, was down about 0.2%.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) was the biggest loser in the index, falling about 2%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rebounded and world shares hit a more than six-month high on Friday after China's moves to boost domestic consumption bolstered a rally driven by investor bets the latest U.S.-Sino trade salvoes were unlikely to dent global growth.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index and the Dow industrials scaled record peaks for a second session, though the Nasdaq turned lower soon after the market opened.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.39 percent to hit six-month highs.
Sterling tumbled and pushed the dollar up after British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had hit an impasse and that the European Union must offer an alternative plan after the bloc's leaders rejected her plans.
The pound fell 1.36 percent, and was on course for its biggest daily loss since June 2017. 
""Sterling bears are out in full force. They've pushed the pound quite aggressively down this morning,"" said Dean Popplewell, a chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto.
The dollar rebounded from early lows but was still set for its biggest weekly drop since February as the equity market rally and rising bond yields fueled a rush to buy riskier assets. The dollar index rose 0.26 percent to 94.159 against a basket of major currencies. 
A rally in Chinese markets helped lift MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan 1.32 percent, partly on expectations that Beijing will pump more money into its economy to weather the trade war.

U.S. long-dated Treasury yields slipped, in tandem with those in Europe, as Brexit talks stalled between Britain and the European Union.
U.S. 2-year yields, however, remained unaffected as they hit a fresh 10-year high in the run-up to an expected rate increase at next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",British inquiry intensifies Danske Bank money laundering scandal,"By Teis Jensen and Pamela Barbaglia
COPENHAGEN/LONDON (Reuters) - Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) money laundering scandal spread on Friday to Britain where the National Crime Agency (NCA) said it is investigating the use of UK-registered companies.
Concern about the extent of possible money laundering involving Danske Bank's Estonian branch is mounting and European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager joined a growing chorus of calls for a clampdown on the billions of euros alleged to have been ""washed"" through several European banks. 
""This is a giga scandal,"" Vestager said, as Danske Bank's already battered shares fell a further 3.9 percent.
Britain's NCA said it was ""aware of the use of UK registered companies in this case and has related on-going operational activity"", adding that the threat posed by the use of UK-registered companies for money laundering was ""widely recognized"" and that Britain was working to restrict it.
British and Russian entities dominate a list of accounts used to make 200 billion euros ($236 billion) in payments through Danske Bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank said this week are suspicious.
By 2013, the number of UK-registered customers in its non-resident portfolio topped 1,000, Danske Bank's report revealed, ahead of Russia, the British Virgin Islands and Finland.
“We are following and analyzing the situation closely...” Samu Kurri, head of financial analysis and operational risks at Finland's Financial Supervisory Authority told Reuters.
Investor concerns over the potential penalties  Danske Bank  could face have increased, with particular focus on what action U.S. authorities might take after an investigation commissioned by the bank exposed control and compliance failings.
The bank faces Danish and Estonian criminal inquiries following complaints filed by U.S. fund manager Bill Browder, who is campaigning against corruption in Russia.
So far the United States has not said whether it is investigating and while Danske Bank Chairman Ole Andersen said that the lender had made an assessment of whether it violated any U.S. laws, he declined to share its conclusion of this. 
""We need to do more to prevent money laundering from happening,"" Vestager told reporters in Copenhagen following the resignation on Wednesday of CEO Thomas Borgen, who was in charge of Danske Bank's international operations including Estonia between 2009 and 2012.
Danske Bank's tiny Estonian branch accounted for as much as 10 percent of group profit during the period when suspected money laundering was conducted via its operations there.
Borgen said on Wednesday that he had been ""personally cleared from a legal point of view"", while Danske said its board had not breached their legal obligations.
The European Commission last week recommended banking supervision changes, including bolstering national authorities, but stopped short of setting up a new financial crime agency called for by the European Central Bank.
Denmark's central bank said on Friday that it supported a proposal for tougher laws to prevent money laundering agreed by politicians on Wednesday and called on the management of Danish financial institutions to ensure none took place.
""As the largest bank in the country, Danske Bank is of major importance to the reputation of the financial sector and hence the financial stability of Denmark.""
The left-wing Red-Green Alliance has summoned business minister Rasmus Jarlov to an open parliament committee meeting on Tuesday to discuss the ""political aftermath"" of the case.
""We must discuss if we should continue to have banks that are as big as Danske Bank, who with their irresponsible behavior pose a threat to the economy and financial stability, or if they should be split up into smaller units,"" the Red-Green party's business spokesman Pelle Dragsted said.
Jarlov has so far rejected calls to split up Denmark's largest banks, which also include Nordea (ST:NDA), Nykredit and  Jyske Bank  (CO:JYSK).
Although credit ratings agency Moody's said on Friday that it saw no reason to date why Denmark's AAA rating should be affected, it lowered Danske Bank's outlook to negative from stable, citing risks related to the scandal such as ""further investigations and regulatory penalties"".
'DEEPLY REPREHENSIBLE'
Within Denmark, which often tops surveys as one of the world's least corrupt countries, the saga has stirred a political storm and prompted a backlash against Danske Bank.
""We don't think it's appropriate, with the things that have been unearthed, that Thomas Borgen is still heading the bank,"" Anders Schelde, head of investments at MP Pension, told Reuters. The Danish pension fund, which holds Danske Bank shares worth around 600 million Danish crowns, will not buy any more shares in the bank while Borgen, who will stay on until a successor is appointed, is still in charge. 
Meanwhile, the charity CARE Danmark said it was severing ties with Danske as its main bank.
""We've decided to drop Danske Bank due to the money laundering scandal which is incompatible with the values our organization stands for, and what our members expect of us,"" CARE Danmark CEO Rasmus Stuhr Jacobsen told Reuters. 
Denmark's largest NGO, the Danish Refugee Council, said it is also considering dropping Danske Bank, Secretary General Christian Friis Bach told online media outlet Altinget.
And the mayor of Aalborg, Denmark's third largest municipality, said he would discuss its partnership with Danske Bank at its next committee meeting, but noted that there were only two Danish banks able to handle a municipality its size. 
""Danske Bank has been involved in money laundering which is deeply reprehensible and outrageous but Nordea has been involved in tax havens, so the entire bank sector needs to clean up for us to have a trusting collaboration with the banks,"" Thomas Kastrup-Larsen said.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",KKR-backed Calsonic lines up 5 billion euro financing for Magneti takeover: sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Arno Schuetze
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Calsonic Kansei has lined up around 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in financing from Japanese banks to fund its proposed acquisition of  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) unit Magneti Marelli, four sources familiar with the matter said.
The Japanese car parts maker, which U.S. private equity fund KKR bought from Nissan and other shareholders in 2016, has been in talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) for months and has asked the likes of Nomura and Mizuho to finance its bid. 
Calsonic has made an initial proposal of 5.8 billion euros for Magneti Marelli, two of the sources said, but the final price could be revised after the Japanese group conducts in-depth due diligence on the Italian rival. 
Calsonic aims to take full control of Magneti Marelli and create a group worth around 16 billion euros in revenues that will be later listed on the stock market, the sources said.
But FCA is seeking more than 6 billion euros for the diversified parts maker, which specializes in lighting, powertrain and electronics, they added.
No binding agreement has been reached at this stage and the deal could still fall apart, the sources said. 
""They are still far from signing a cheque,"" one of the sources said, adding Calsonic was struggling to match FCA's price expectations.
While there is no exclusive or binding agreement with Calsonic, the Japanese remain the only party in talks with FCA.
Spokesmen for FCA and Nomura declined to comment. Calsonic and Mizuho were not immediately available for comment.
To help bridge the price gap, FCA or its controlling shareholder, the Agnelli family, could retain a stake in the combined entity, two of the sources said.
""A hybrid structure would allow the Agnellis to realize some value after the listing and would lower the amount of debt needed to finance the deal,"" one of the people said. 
The financing includes senior loans equivalent to 5 times Magneti Marelli's core earnings, or 6.5 times including junior debt, one of the sources said, in a sign of abundant availability of credit even for cyclical old economy sectors.
NEW BOSS
A sale would be one of the first big decisions for new FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley, who took over in July after long-time boss Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died after succumbing to complications from surgery. 
Marchionne had set in motion a process to spin off the unit and distribute its shares to FCA shareholders by early 2019. 
However, at one of his last public appearances in June, Marchionne said FCA would still be ""receptive"" to an offer if it ""properly recognized"" Magneti Marelli's value. 
The deal is being structured as an outright acquisition by Calsonic to create a global auto components giant, cut costs through synergies and expand the customer base of both suppliers, the people added.
""There are synergies in driver control systems, interior electronics and modules, one of the sources said. ""Together with Magneti's lamps and Calsonic's HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems) it's a great portfolio of products.""
The larger entity would also reduce Magneti Marelli's and Calsonic's reliance on FCA and Nissan respectively. 
When KKR bought Calsonic, the parts maker relied on Nissan for 80 percent of its global sales. 
FCA does not spell out earnings for Magneti Marelli, which sits within the carmaker's components unit alongside robotics specialist Comau and castings firm Teksid, but analysts say Magneti Marelli, which employs around 43,000 people and operates in 19 countries, could be worth up to 5 billion euros.
Magneti Marelli has often been touted as a takeover target and FCA has fielded interest from various rivals and private equity firms over the years, but a deal remains elusive as potential bidders were offering too little or were only interested in some parts of the business. 
FCA also prefers the Calsonic offer to a pure private equity bidder because it limits the risk of the unit being broken up, the sources added. 

However, if the talks drag out too long, FCA is ready to pursue its planned spin-off of Magneti Marelli, two of the people said. ($1 = 0.8545 euros)

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) faces an EU antitrust fine for preventing cheaper beer imports into Belgium despite its efforts to settle the investigation, people familiar with the matter said.
Last year, the European Commission accused the world's largest brewer of abusing its market dominance in Belgium by impeding cheaper imports into the country of its Jupiler and Leffe brands from neighboring France and the Netherlands.
The European Commission typically frowns on attempts to prevent parallel trade in the 28-country bloc, whereby cheaper products in one country are transported for sale in another, seeing such tactics as an obstacle to the single market.
The Commission said the result was that Belgian consumers were paying more for the two most popular beer brands in Belgium. AB InBev sells Jupiler and Leffe at lower prices in the Netherlands and France because of the greater competition in these two markets.
EU antitrust rules allow companies to settle investigations by offering concessions and regulators to close the case without levying any fine or proving wrongdoing. The Commission normally accepts this option only if it sees it as a quicker way to restore competition to the market.
The Commission, which can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover, declined to comment. The sources say a formal decision will take some time before it is announced. AB InBev did not immediately respond to a request for comment

The EU competition enforcer said AB InBev's tactics included changing the packaging of both brands in the Netherlands and France to make them harder to sell in Belgium. Dutch retailers were given limited access to key products and promotions to prevent them from importing products into Belgium.

1031,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",ECB Heads for Peak Liquidity as Euro-Area Stimulus Tools Top Out,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro zone’s era of massive excess liquidity, courtesy of the European Central Bank, is about to peak.
Next week, lenders must repay 9 billion euros ($10.6 billion) outstanding from cheap loans the ECB doled out in 2014-2016, when the bloc was teetering on the edge of deflation. Next month, the central bank will cut its monthly bond-buying program by 15 billion euros, and stop altogether at year-end.
In a speech on Thursday, ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet presented a model that projects excess liquidity -- the cash beyond banks’ immediate needs that is sloshing around the financial system -- will peak at about 2 trillion euros around the end of this year and drop below 500 billion euros in 2022.
Praet’s comfort with that potential trend reflects the euro area’s solid economic growth even in the face of risks such as U.S. trade protectionism. Nevertheless, President Mario Draghi’s suite of stimulus measures in recent years has subdued bond yields, weakened the single currency and boosted stocks to drive the region’s recovery, raising concern that any tightening will further drag on an already slowing expansion.
The ECB takes the view that the loans, known as TLTROs, and quantitative easing mean the bloc is now well placed to cope with slightly steeper borrowing costs as excess liquidity shrinks. Policy makers expect to keep official interest rates unchanged “at least through the summer of 2019,” and have acknowledged market expectations for a hike late next year.
The decline will initially be slow. The loans that fall due on Sept. 26 are all that remains of 432 billion euros that were issued. Some were repaid early, while most of the rest were rolled over into a more-generous second program that starts maturing in 2020.
The bond-buying program will be capped at 2.6 trillion euros at the end of the year, but the proceeds of maturing debt will be reinvested to maintain the size of holdings. The ECB simulation made an “arbitrary” assumption that those reinvestments will continue until December 2020.
“The ongoing economic expansion gives us confidence that inflation dynamics will strengthen,” Praet said. “In the more distant future, when the associated impact on long-term rates does eventually become significant, the measured tightening in financial conditions will be justified by the advanced phase of economic expansion which the economy will be enjoying at that point in time.”

Men accounted for 75 percent of all cannabis-related securities trades over the past month, according to data from TD Ameritrade, the online broker with 11 million clients who hold more than $1 trillion in assets. At the end of last year, baby boomers were more likely to trade marijuana stocks, but now TD Ameritrade’s seeing more interest among millennials. The younger cohort also trades more actively -- about 25 percent more than other groups.
Weed stocks have been caught up in a frenzy of interest that’s produced massive gains and dramatic volatility in recent weeks, with an exchange-traded fund focused on the industry surging 78 percent in just the past five weeks. It may not be surprising that men are the primary traders of weed stocks, since studies show they’re about twice as likely as women to use marijuana.
“We’ve seen broad-based interest in cannabis stocks among our clients historically, and given recent headlines, these names have regained popularity, particularly among Millennials who have recently been more likely to trade them than other groups,” said Joe “JJ” Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
The hype around pot stocks lit up this week after shares of  Tilray Inc  (NASDAQ:TLRY) took investors on a wild ride, nearly doubling at one point on Wednesday before losing 18 percent on Thursday. The stock is down another 25 percent in Friday trading.
“Like any other sector that is seeing a spike in momentum or popularity, these are trades that can move very quickly,” Kinahan said. He added that it’s “critical for investors to err on the side of prudence.”

(Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) apologized for outages that hit its online and mobile banking services on Friday, the latest in a string of such failings at British banks which have drawn criticism from customers and lawmakers.
RBS later on Friday said it had fixed the problems, which followed similar outages on Thursday that hit  Barclays  (L:BARC), the Co-operative Bank <42TE.L> and fintech firm Cashplus.
Lawmakers on Britain's Treasury Select Committee, in letters published on Friday, called on Barclays and RBS to explain what caused the problems and set out how they would compensate customers who suffered financial losses as a result.
The outages come when Britain's lenders have been driving customers toward such services as the banks cull branch networks to cut costs. Regulators and politicians are increasing scrutiny over banks' cyber resilience.
“High street banks justify the closure of their branch networks on the basis that they are providing a seamless online and mobile phone banking service. These justifications carry little weight if their banking apps and websites cannot be relied upon,"" Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said.
Morgan gave the banks until Friday Sept. 28 to respond to her questions about the outages.
Royal Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Ross McEwan told LBC Radio that the outage may be related to regular changes it had made to its technology, such a change to its firewall, but the cause was not clear yet. 
""The team are working flat out… We feel the pain for our customers every time this happens,"" he said.
The RBS outage on Friday also affected NatWest, RBS's most highly rated brand among customers. The lender used Twitter to apologize to customers and said telephone banking and ATMs were working as normal. 
Many customers took to social media to complain about the outage.
""So how do you expect me to pay my bills today when I work 9-5,"" Natalie Wilkinson said in a tweet to NatWest, asking other users to recommend a more reliable bank.
The consequences for banks of online banking problems and the subsequent scrutiny of those failings by politicians can be severe.
Earlier this year a major outage at mid-sized lender TSB, owned by Spain's Sabadell (MC:SABE), left thousands of customers unable to access their money or make vital payments for long periods.
TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester resigned this month, following heavy criticism by the Treasury Committee and the bank's customers for his handling of the crisis.
British banks do not have long to strengthen their contingency plans for when online banking services fail.
The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority in July set a deadline of Oct. 5 for British lenders to explain how they can avoid damaging IT breakdowns and respond to the growing threat of cyber attacks.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Dutch PM stands by plan to axe tax to woo big business,"By Bart H. Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will push ahead with plans to scrap the country's dividend tax, he said on Friday, warning that failure to do so could prompt  Unilever  (AS:UNc) (L:ULVR) and Shell (AS:RDSa) to move their headquarters elsewhere.
Rutte has come under enormous pressure to keep the 15 percent withholding tax. Opponents argue that scrapping it amounts to a 2 billion euro tax break for foreign investors, mainly designed to please Shell and Unilever. 
A recent poll showed that only 11 percent of voters support plans to axe the tax.
""We stand to lose some of the biggest European companies if we do not proceed with this plan,"" Rutte said in a heated parliamentary debate on the matter. ""That is an unacceptable risk.""
The prime minister also repeated his core arguments that getting rid of the tax will make the Netherlands a more attractive place to do business, attract foreign investment and create jobs.
""One of the largest companies in the Netherlands will decide, at the end of October, to move its headquarters here,"" he said, referring to Unilever.
Shareholders of both the British and Dutch arms of Unilever will vote in October whether to approve the plan to create a single headquarters in Rotterdam.
""Another very large company is already here, but is faced with the question whether to remain or even strengthen its position in the Netherlands,"" Rutte said, referring to oil major Shell, which is headquartered in The Hague.
""They have told us this tax is a major factor in their decisions. You could still opt to hold on to the tax, but there's a large risk that these companies would then decide to leave.""
Shell, which uses a dual share structure to exempt British shareholders from Dutch tax, has lobbied against the levy for years. Unilever has been less vocal, but CEO Paul Polman came out in support of Rutte last month, saying scrapping the tax would be good for the Dutch economy.
Several prominent British investors have been critical of Unilever's plan to base its headquarters in the Netherlands, with some citing the increasing uncertainty over the Dutch tax as a new risk. 
Rutte's political support appears solid enough for now to see the plan through final approval in December. His coalition holds a one-vote majority in both parliament and the senate.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal is assembling a team of traders in China, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, as the specter of U.S. sanctions hangs over its sales to customers in the West.
The sources said Rusal is in the process of setting up a trading company to house the team, which will include a sales manager, an aluminum trader and an alumina trader. 
Rusal will task the team with trading domestically sourced aluminum in China. It also expects them to look for opportunities to import the metal, as well as export aluminum products from the country, according to a job description for a sales director role reviewed by Reuters.
An analyst position has also been created at the new entity, which will be located in Beijing, after Rusal earlier considered Shanghai, the sources added. 
Rusal declined to comment on Friday.
The United States announced sanctions on Rusal on April 6. It said last week that customers of the Russian firm before that date could sign new contracts without the risk of penalties but made no mention of an Oct. 23 deadline for U.S. entities to wind down business with Rusal.
Sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters earlier this month that European customers would avoid signing 2019 metal supply agreements with Rusal.
China is the world's biggest aluminum consumer and a potentially lucrative market for Rusal, on the doorstep of its smelters in Siberia. 
However, China is also the top global producer of the metal, meaning the country has scant need for foreign aluminum. It imported just 14,631 tonnes of primary aluminum from Russia in 2017, according to Chinese customs data.
Rusal, which is listed in Hong Kong, already has a representative office in Beijing but it has previously carried out trading activities in China via North United Aluminium (Shenzhen) Co, a Guangdong-based joint venture with China North Industries Corp (Norinco). 
The Rusal-appointed deputy general manager of North United Aluminium, which was set up in 2012 to trade aluminum, alloys and other non-ferrous metals in China, left the JV over the summer, joining Trafigura in July.
Rusal's China sales director will be required to establish the trading office in China ""from scratch,"" the job description says.

The coalition, launched by Paulson's U.S. hedge fund Paulson & Co, will issue analyst reports and engage with management to improve capital allocation, compensation and corporate governance in gold companies, the coalition said in a statement.
The initial lineup includes a dozen named investors and four anonymous members.
The council includes Adrian Day Asset Management, Apogee Global Advisors, AMG Fondsverwaltung AG, Delbrook Capital, Equinox Partners LP, Equity Management Associates, John Hathaway, Kopernik Global Investors, Livermore Partners, La Mancha and Sun Valley Gold. 
Reuters named a number of these investors in a report earlier this year.
The Shareholders Gold Council will be headed by Christian Godin, who was recently head of equities and director of research at Canadian fund manager Montrusco Bolton Investments Inc.
Paulson & Co called on the world's top investors in gold equities to form a coalition last September. Partner Marcelo Kim attacked the gold mining industry at the Denver Gold Forum, saying the sector needed to address high executive pay, cozy board appointments and value-destroying mergers and acquisitions. 

Founded by the billionaire investor in 1994, Paulson & Co manages about $8.7 billion.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",France's Orange Bank sued over 439 million euros lost in Madoff collapse,"By Inti Landauro
PARIS (Reuters) - A French woman and her daughter are bringing a law suit against Orange Bank to try to recover some of the 439 million euros ($516 million) they say they lost in the collapse of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme a decade ago.
Laurence Apfelbaum and her daughter Emilie allege that Banque Finama advised them in 1999 to work directly with Madoff's investment funds, where they had already placed money via Finama, when Finama was itself withdrawing assets from the scheme because of doubts about Madoff's credibility.
Finama, which was later renamed Groupama Banque, was acquired by French telecoms operator Orange (PA:ORAN) in 2016 and turned into Orange Bank, a mobile banking business.
A civil court in Bobigny, north of Paris, will begin proceedings on the case on Oct. 2. Orange Bank will contest the claim.
The case underscores how the ripples from Madoff's $60 billion scheme, one of the biggest financial frauds in history, can still be felt in the financial system 10 years on.
Madoff pleaded guilty to federal crimes including securities and investment fraud in 2009. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $170 billion. 
Nicolas Lecoq-Vallon, a lawyer representing the Apfelbaums, says they would have withdrawn their funds from Madoff's scheme in 1999 if Finama had shared its suspicions with them.
Instead, he said Finama shut the Apfelbaums' accounts and told them to deal one-to-one with Madoff. 
""The bank advised my clients to deal directly with Madoff's firm when it had to -- at the very least -- warn them and share the doubts it had about the legitimacy of the scheme,"" he told Reuters.
At around the same time in 1999, Finama withdrew about 100 million euros that it had invested with Madoff, Lecoq-Vallon said, citing comments made by Bernard Pouy, who was the bank's chief executive at the time.
Pouy, who was quoted in interviews in 2009 saying Finama withdrew its funds after concluding that Madoff's scheme was suspect, didn't return calls seeking comment.
ORANGE PLAYS DOWN THREAT
Orange said it was aware of the Apfelbaum case when it bought a controlling stake in Groupama Banque and that it had taken necessary steps to mitigate the risks. 
""The necessary measures were taken by the Orange Group to protect itself against this liability,"" a spokesman said, without elaborating on the measures taken.
Bernard Vatier, a lawyer for Orange Bank, said the Apfelbaums' claim ""rests on lies and inaccuracies"" and reiterated that the bank faced no risk from the lawsuit.
He said late financier Albert Igoin, Laurence Apfelbaum's father and Emilie's grandfather, who bequeathed them the wealth after making his fortune in banking, knew Madoff personally and decided on his own accord to invest with him in 1980. 
Finama cannot be held responsible for the family's decision to invest with Madoff, Vatier said, adding that the bank had dropped the Apfelbaums as clients because it didn't want to retain customers who had dealt directly with Madoff.
But Lecoq-Vallon said Finama had a duty to share any information it had about Madoff with its clients, even more so because at that point Igoin was long deceased and his heirs didn't have his knowledge of financial markets.
Lecoq-Vallon's clients are seeking to reclaim 303 million euros they say were held in Madoff accounts as of Dec. 11, 2008, when the firm collapsed. 
Over the 30 years they were dealing with Madoff, they say they withdrew about 129 million euros to pay taxes on profits that turned out to be fictitious. They are seeking those funds back too.
As a result of the withdrawals they made, the Apfelbaums were sought out by Irving Picard, a trustee charged with tracking down any remaining assets from Madoff's scheme in order to recoup funds on behalf of others who were defrauded, Lecoq-Vallon said.
In a separate case resolved last year, the two women agreed to pay about 7 million euros to Picard to settle his claims. They are seeking that payment back via the suit, too.
They have pledged to hand over 35 percent of whatever they might get from Orange Bank to the Madoff recovery funds.

1043,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Carmakers on the Trade-War Front Line as Europe Factories Suffer,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s factories saw export growth stagnate this month as the economy feels the pinch from the global trade war that’s continuing to ratchet up.
The auto industry -- targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump -- is taking the brunt of the slowdown in demand, according to IHS Markit’s latest monthly survey. Overall manufacturing in the euro area grew the slowest pace in two years in September and new export orders failed to rise for the first time since 2013.
Markit’s comments echoes concerns voiced by European car manufacturers, who are particularly vulnerable to sustaining collateral damage in the trade-war salvos between the U.S. and China. But there are broader effects, with the OECD saying this week that global growth may have hit a plateau.
That warning came the same week that the U.S.-China trade war deepened, with Beijing saying it will retaliate against President Donald Trump’s order for more tariffs on imports from the Asian nation.
Trade tensions are “a real and true concern for our business because we’re always thinking of long-term cycles,”  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) CEO for trucks Martin Daum said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. “We depend on long-term stability.”
Automakers are Europe’s worst performing sector over the past six months, down more than 10 percent, versus a 2 percent gain for the Stoxx 600 Index.
In China, car sales dropped for a third straight month in August, as slowing economic growth are threatening to end the vehicle market’s almost three-decade expansion.
“The problem in China is the sentiment,” Klaus Rosenfeld, chief executive officer at a German industrial and autoparts supplier Schaeffler Group, said Thursday. “There is negative sentiment, and I think the trade war, the tariff discussion fuels this.”
Trade tensions are hanging over the whole industry, from trucks to luxury sports vehicles, with  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE) CEO Louis Camilleri telling analysts on an earnings call this week that he hopes that “rationality would prevail,” because a “tariff war between Europe and U.S. would be quite dramatic.”
And weaker demand for cars will have a fallout on other manufacturers. In Markit’s survey for France -- home to  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) -- it said “anecdotal evidence suggested that many manufacturers saw a reduction in demand from the automotive sector.”
In September, the weakness in the euro-area PMI was all due to manufacturing, with the measure for services rising to a three-month high. Markit said the combined index points to a quarterly expansion of about 0.5 percent.
But, according to Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson, weaker readings for backlogs and exports means “the risks to future growth appear tilted to the downside.” There’s also the turmoil in emerging markets, which is affecting sentiment more broadly.
“While the U.S.-EU dispute has been contained, uncertainty stemming from the global unrest continues to weigh on European manufacturers,” said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING. “Large emerging trade partners are struggling with depreciated currencies, limiting European export potential.”

1047,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Leveraged Loans Are Flying Off the Shelves,"(Bloomberg) -- Money managers, eager for assets whose yields rise as the Federal Reserve hikes rates, snatched up some of the year’s biggest leveraged loan offerings this week. Some caution that investors may be buying at the wrong time.
Usually after the Fed tightens the money supply, economic growth slows, which results in more defaults on corporate debt and lower returns for the whole loan market, said Gershon Distenfeld, co-head of fixed income at AllianceBernstein LP.
A good proxy for the potential risk is to look at returns when loan prices rise too high, Distenfeld said. When the average outstanding loan is around current levels of 98.5 cents on the dollar or above, annual returns are about 2.8 percent for the next two years, trailing five-year Treasuries and high-yield bonds, according to his analysis of market prices between January 1992 and May 2018. Distenfeld has long been skeptical of bank loans.
Sub-par returns are bad enough, but this time loans could perform worse than they usually do, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. Lender protections are worse than usual, and there are fewer other creditors to absorb losses.
“It’s not a good time to be buying bank loans,” LeBas said.
Whether or not that’s so, a lot of money managers are buying them. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP this week borrowed $9.25 billion in the U.S. and European loan market to fund its buyout of a stake in  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp.’s financial terminal business, and received orders far in excess of supply, in one of the biggest leveraged loan financings of the year.  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP cut rates twice on $6.4 billion of U.S. and European loans for its acquisition of AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals amid strong demand. New U.S. leveraged loans are on track for a record-setting year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and the U.S. market tops $1 trillion outstanding.
Retail investors have poured cash into funds that buy loans, with $282 million of inflows into mutual funds and exchange traded funds in the week ended Sept. 12, the 10th straight week of money coming in, according to Lipper data. Pension funds have also been big buyers of credit products broadly, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. And some $84 billion of collateralized loan obligations have been sold this year, a record pace, which fuel demand for loans by buying them and repackaging them into securities.
Investors are looking to buy instruments that pay floating rates, meaning their prices don’t fall as the Fed tightens monetary policy. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to hike rates when it meets next week, and futures markets also project increases in December and at least one more time next year. Loans are also attractive because they are first to be repaid if a company goes under, making them less risky than corporate bonds that are usually behind loans in the pecking order.
Inflection Point?
There are reasons to be sanguine about the market. Goldman Sachs Group’s Amanda Lynam wrote in a report this week that money managers are pushing back on deals that are too aggressively priced, profits are improving at many companies, and borrowers have cut debt levels, meaning the market isn’t overheating.
“The risks in the leveraged loan market, broadly, are manageable and not close to an inflection point,” Lynam wrote.
Even if an inflection point is far away, the risks are building up. Moody’s Investors Service in August highlighted how borrowers are eliminating investor protections on loans known as covenants. That could lead to lower recoveries in the next downturn, the ratings company said, predicting average U.S. first-lien term loan recoveries would fall to 61 percent, versus their 77 percent long-term historical average. For the second lien, recoveries could be 14 percent, compared with a 43 percent historical average.
In addition to weaker covenants, companies have taken on a lot more loan debt during this cycle, than they’ve had historically, and have comparatively fewer bonds. Those factors mean recoveries for first-lien loans could be closer to 50 cents on the dollar, said Tom Mansley, investment director at GAM Investments.
“There’s a tremendous supply in the marketplace and at the same time, we’ve definitely seen deteriorating fundamentals,” Mansley said. “That’s going to lead to low recovery rates going forward.”
Supply may not be strong for much longer, said Neil Desai, portfolio manager at Highland Capital Management. CLOs seem to be getting created faster than the loans needed to feed them at this stage, which eventually hurts the economics of putting together CLOs.
“We envision there being an inflection point where the decreased loan issuance pipeline could start to slow down the CLO machine,” perhaps as soon as year-end, Desai said."

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",New U.S. tax law could create underpayment headaches for retirees,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Internal Revenue Service hoisted a big red-flag warning to retirees earlier this month: take a look at how much income tax you are paying throughout 2018, because the amount could need an adjustment in the wake of the new federal tax law.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), signed into law by President Donald Trump last December, made important changes to tax rates, brackets, deductions and exemptions that affect all taxpayers. Retirees need to pay special attention to income coming from tax-deferred retirement accounts, pensions and annuities. Higher-income retirees may also owe taxes on Social Security benefits.
The amount of total income tax you owe could be going up or down, depending on your personal circumstances.
Failing to pay the right amount through the year could subject you to a penalty next April when your federal income tax return is filed. The penalty is determined by multiplying an interest rate, determined by the IRS, by your underpaid amount; the current interest rate is 5 percent. Taxation of retirement income by states is all over the map (https:// but your state tax return also could be impacted.
The IRS issued a bulletin earlier this month urging retirees to do a check-up on amounts that are being paid in quarterly installments or withheld (https:// Taxes are due throughout the year, either through quarterly estimated payments, or through withholding by pension plan sponsors or annuity providers. Taxes also are owed on Social Security.
The TCJA marks the first major revision of the tax code since 1986. It reduced tax rates and expanded income tax brackets. The standard deduction nearly doubled from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, and from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers. But the standard deduction actually is higher for most retirees, because taxpayers older than 65 can deduct an additional $1,300. In addition, the TCJA caps deductions for state and local income and property taxes at $10,000 for both married couples and single individuals, and personal exemptions were eliminated.
You may need to increase or reduce the amount of tax being paid during the year - and there is still time to make an adjustment before the year ends. “There are enough moving parts here that the only way to get the right answer is to run a projection,” said Greg Rosica, partner in EY's private client services practice in New York City.
HOW TO AVOID A PENALTY
One way to avoid a penalty, Rosica notes, is to base your payments on the prior-year taxes and pay “at least 100 or 110 percent of that amount.” Another way is to project the amount you owe for the current year and pay at least 90 percent in four quarterly installments. (The final quarterly payment for 2018 is due on Jan. 15, 2019.)
The third method is annualized income installment. This is used by taxpayers who receive uneven levels of income throughout the year; this approach smoothes the amount owed quarterly using a reasonable estimate of your income for the year. For more on this, see Chapter Two of IRS Publication 505. (https:// For retirees who receive a monthly pension or annuity check, this may mean changing the amount of federal income tax they have withheld.
If you are underpaying on income that requires quarterly payments, send in the unpaid amount as soon as possible to stop underpayment penalties from accruing. If additional payments are due on income that is withheld, contact your former employer to make a change. The IRS cautions that due to the limited amount of time remaining this year, you might need to cover this type of expected tax liability through an additional direct tax payment, as you would a quarterly payment.
Higher-income retirees also pay taxes on Social Security benefits. The TCJA does not change the formulas for taxation of benefits, but Social Security income does figure in to your total income tax liability as determined by the federal tax rates.
Social Security beneficiaries receive a form from the IRS during tax season (Form SSA-1099) that reports net benefit subject to tax after Part B Medicare premiums have been subtracted. No taxes are paid by beneficiaries with combined income equal to or below $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for married filers; above those levels, tax is determined according to two income tiers. (https:// The IRS notes it is possible to ask the Social Security Administration to withhold tax on benefits at one of four flat rates as part of an overall withholding plan; you can initiate withholding by filing IRS Form W-4v. Unsure of whether your withholding or quarterly payments should be adjusted? Rosica advises consulting an accountant, or using an online tool to analyze your situation. The IRS website offers a withholding calculator that offers a good start (https:// You will want to have last year’s tax return handy, and records of how much you have withheld or paid so far this year.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Australian mining's macho image worsens pain of labor shortage,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - When the song ""Eagle Rock"" played at a bar in an outback Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie late one night, a dozen young men scattered around a pool table dropped their trousers and heartily sang along in their underwear.
Later that night, they piled behind the counter of the bar attached to the Western Australian School of Mines (WASM), singing an anthem that began, ""We are engineers,"" and finished with an obscene description of how they treat women.
The scenes, in the background of an industry conference, cut against a hard reality the sector faces: a dearth of skilled applicants, and a workforce hurting for diversity and struggling to hire women.
""If we could attract more women, it could go a long way to helping any future skills shortage,"" said Paul Cooper, regional chief executive of mining for recruiting company Sodexo (PA:EXHO), which is a key supplier to the industry and whose workforce is almost half women. 
Without change, the outlook is grim. Enrolments in mining engineering courses across Australia have fallen to roughly 30 this year from more than 250 during the last boom a half decade ago. 
(For a graphic on 'Australian mining engineering enrollments slump' click https://reut.rs/2OVInz6)
""We've solved crazier problems than this. This is seriously not hard if people have the will,"" said Sam Retallack, head of hiring at miner Independence Group. 
It will require a ""big philosophical shift,"" but miners must offer more flexible working conditions to attract the next generation of workers, she said. 
The conversation is echoing around the industry. A WASM director, just hours before the carousing in Kalgoorlie, had delivered a pointed address about how the industry must change its testosterone-charged reputation.
""Mining has a dirty image,"" mining engineer Sabina Shugg of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mining Innovation Hub told a packed hall. ""You can have a lot of talk about intent, but really it's all about outcomes."" 
Curtin University, of which WASM is a part, said it promotes equality and diversity, and actively works to enhance opportunities for women, particularly in mining. 
Curtin said that it did not organize the event, did not receive any complaints and could not verify the reported behavior. 
""Curtin is very disappointed to receive this report of disrespectful behavior,"" it said in a statement.

HIRING DIFFICULTIES
Even top global miner BHP Billiton (LON:BLT), which has set an ""ambitious, aspirational goal"" of achieving gender balance globally by 2025, fell short of its yearly target, raising the proportion of female employees by 1.9 percent to 22.4 percent. In senior management positions, however, the proportion of women slipped by 1 percentage point.
""These results show we are making progress, although we did not achieve the 3 percent annual growth to which we aspire,"" BHP said in its annual report on Tuesday. 
Large-scale layoffs after commodity busts in recent years and an environmentally challenged image have also harmed mining's reputation among potential hires, industry sources said. 
Yet miners are hiring, with a big uptick in exploration investment. The industry spent A$547 million ($391.76 million) in the three months ending in June, an increase of 6.8 percent over the previous quarter and a jump of 28.9 percent for the year, according to Australia's Bureau of Statistics.
MARKETING IMAGERY
Part of the issue is the industry's marketing, which appeals to masculine stereotypes, said Gabriela Love, a mining engineer at ASX-listed Newcrest and chairwoman of Women in Mining and Resources Victoria. 
""Mining is marketed as dirty and dull. You think of BHP and its ads are all trucks and high-vis gear; that's painting the industry in a certain way,"" she said. ""But now we're in a digital age, with robotics, big data, high tech. Mining is all of that.""
BHP declined to comment about its marketing. 
Mining is the most male dominated-industry in Australia, with women making up 16 percent of the sector's national workforce for the past decade, according to government data on Friday.
""The sector faces an ongoing challenge to attract and retain the substantial number of additional women required to boost diversity and take advantage of a significant untapped workforce,"" the Department of Industry said in a report. 
Women can feel isolated in the industry and less inclined to speak up, which undermines the benefits of diversity, Love said.
""When you're walking round the mess hall, it's a sea of men,"" she said. 
Highly specialized positions that require workers to travel to a remote location for ""fly in, fly out"" work can be more difficult for parents in particular. 
One geotechnical engineer, among the most sought-after specializations, was laid off from a mining major last year as she prepared to return from maternity leave.
During her pregnancy, her manager had told her that if he gave her flexible working conditions, he'd have to give them to everyone.
""I was a senior engineer wanting to stay involved in the industry. When I needed the support, I found myself out of a job. I felt disillusioned with the industry and the company.""
Offering the option to work remotely or on secondment in consulting from a big city would benefit workers and the company, she said. 
To be sure, incremental changes at majors  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and BHP are rippling through the industry, particularly after the companies set up remote work centers in Perth so fewer employees needed to be at mine sites.
Among other measures, Rio has also introduced a global paid parental leave standard, while BHP is moving to replace heavy physical labor with robots, and is working with suppliers to redesign equipment so it is more ergonomic for women. 
""I think that the industry has a reputation that may not be well deserved in today's world,"" BHP's chief technology officer, Diane Jurgens, told Reuters. 
""I think it's a lot to do with the perceptions of the industry. We need to change that,"" she said.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Going long: Chinese steel mills chase iron ore contracts with Brazil's Vale,"By Muyu Xu and Manolo Serapio Jr
DALIAN, China (Reuters) - Chinese steel mills and traders are rushing to secure long-term contracts for high-quality iron ore ahead of winter steel output cuts, a boon for the main supplier of such grades of the commodity, Brazilian mining giant Vale.
China, the world's biggest consumer of the steelmaking ingredient, needs higher-quality, less polluting grades of iron ore as it battles to clear its notoriously smoggy skies.
That demand highlights how China's prolonged war on pollution is shaking global markets for iron ore, the world's most heavily traded bulk commodity.
The push to get contracts for quality ore is gathering pace as China gears up to enforce industrial production limits on its northern region for a second winter, with top-steel producing city Tangshan aiming to curb up to 70 percent of mill output based on each plant's carbon emission levels.
Hebei Jingye Group, a medium-size steel mill in the smog-prone northern province of Hebei, is looking for a contract with Vale for supplies of high-grade ore in 2019, a company official said.
That would follow on from a 2018 contract for 1.5 million tonnes of Vale's Brazilian Blend iron ore fines, or BRBF, with 63-percent iron content. 
""We have already regretted not buying more BRBF. Even if we don't use all of it, we can still sell it in the spot market and make lots of money since prices have gone up so much,"" said Jia Zhanhui, who purchases raw materials for Jingye.
Vale, the world's largest iron ore miner, said it was running out of immediate supplies of some of its top-grade products, with demand from China surging.
""Chinese companies are looking for more long-term contracts with us because of the quality,"" Peter Poppinga, executive director for ferrous and coal at Vale, said on the sidelines of an industry conference in China.
""We are completely sold out in Carajas,"" Poppinga said, referring to one of the company's high-grade ores, with iron content of around 65 percent.
""We will allocate Carajas according to long-term contracts and according to some spot opportunities.""

BIG FOUR
Of the world's big four iron ore miners, Vale stands to benefit the most from China's growing shift towards less pollutive raw materials due to its mostly high-grade products.
The firm on Thursday said it was looking to expand its flagship iron ore mine in Brazil to feed Chinese demand.
""If you have a long-term contract with Vale in hand right now, it is easy for you to sell it in the market with $5.50 extra per tonne on top of the agreed prices on the contract,"" said an iron ore trader with government-backed Zheshang Development Group. He declined to be identified due to company policy.
The price of 65-percent grade Brazilian-origin iron ore had risen by a fifth since March to $96.80 a tonne on Thursday. Its premium over 62-percent grade iron ore fines hit a record $29 this month.
""People are worried that the supply of high-quality material will not be able to meet market demand, so they are making some pre-orders to secure shipment,"" said the Zheshang trader.
Meanwhile, other miners such as Fortescue Metals Group Ltd said that appetite for lower-quality products remained robust. 

Fortescue Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said the company's customers were seeking longer term contracts for its mostly 58-percent grade iron ore as mills rein in costs by mixing it with higher grade material.

As of  June 30th, the nation’s fourth largest bank had roughly 264,500 employees, making a 10 percent reduction representative of about 26,450 jobs. Wells Fargo said the latest reduction would reflect displacements as well as normal team-member attrition.
The cuts will help Wells reach its goal of reducing costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to grow profits and recover from a series of scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve’s asset cap. 
Wells Fargo has also said it will reduce its branch count by about 800 by 2020 and sell non-core businesses to lower costs and become more efficient. Last month the bank laid off 600 employees in its mortgage division which has faced headwinds amid a slowdown in refinancing demand.
The layoffs were not a surprise according to Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl and that sentiment was reflected in Wall Street’s muted reaction to the news. The stock rose 0.6 percent to $55.55 during Thursday trading.
“Employee related costs are the largest expense so that was likely where the cuts were coming,” he said. Automation also lowers the need for staffing over time.” 
The bank did not specify which departments or regions would be impacted by the reductions, but it said the cuts will be made to reflect changing consumer preferences as more customers perform banking tasks using self-service technology.
“Wells Fargo takes very seriously any change that involves its team members, and as always, we will be thoughtful and transparent, and treat team members with respect,” said Chief Executive Tim Sloan in a statement.
Wells Fargo reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit in July as lending activity slowed and the bank said much of the decline had to do with moves to avoid riskier loans.

Wells Fargo's shares rose 0.6 percent to $55.55 in late afternoon trading on Thursday.

The letter comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
Walmart, the world's largest retailer, in its letter said the tariff would impact prices of everything from food products to beverages and personal care items. 
Walmart confirmed it sent the letter and in a statement to Reuters urged the two countries to find solutions. 
The U.S. Trade Representative's office was not immediately available for comment. 
Earlier this week, Trump escalated his trade war with China by imposing 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including consumer products like gas grills, luggage and travel bags, mattresses and helmets. 
""As the largest retailer in the United States and a major buyer of U.S. manufactured goods, we are very concerned about the impacts these tariffs would have on our business, our customers, our suppliers and the U.S. economy as a whole,"" Walmart wrote in its letter to Lighthizer.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 07:23PM ET</span>",Adobe to buy marketing software firm Marketo for $4.75 billion,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc on Thursday agreed to buy Marketo Inc for $4.75 billion from private equity firm Vista Equity Partners Management, adding heft to its cloud-based digital marketing business.
The U.S. Photoshop maker is sharpening its focus on the fast-growing cloud business, a fiercely competitive market dominated by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.
Marketo's business-to-business marketing applications will complement Adobe's digital marketing business, which provides cloud-based tools to help create, manage and analyze advertising and marketing campaigns, the companies said.
Marketo, started in 2006 as an email marketing service, was taken private by Vista for $1.8 billion in 2016.
The San Mateo, California-based company generated revenue of about $321 million in 2017, according to credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc. 
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of Adobe's fiscal 2018 and Marketo Chief Executive Officer Steve Lucas will join the company's senior leadership team and continue to lead the Marketo team, Adobe said.
After Vista acquired Marketo, it changed its management team, adding Lucas, a former SAP SE (DE:SAPG) executive, as the CEO in 2016, who helped revive sales growth at the company. 
Adobe has been on something of a shopping spree lately. In May it agreed to buy cloud-based e-commerce services provider Magento Commerce from private equity firm Permira for $1.68 billion.
Reuters had exclusively reported earlier this month that Adobe was in talks to buy Marketo.
JP Morgan advised Adobe, while its legal adviser was Hogan Lovells.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Kirkland & Ellis advised Marketo and Vista Equity Partners.

Adobe shares were up marginally in extended trading.

1064,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Xi's Demands for Loyalty Show China Pitfalls as Trade War Erupts,"(Bloomberg) -- As Chinese officials prepared a response to President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs, they spent hundreds of hours over the past few months on another urgent task: Demonstrating their fealty to President Xi Jinping.
In a meeting room in one government ministry in Beijing, officials stacked up piles of papers across a long meeting table to prepare a submission to Xi’s ruling Communist Party. The documents, painstakingly compiled from materials detailing party-government interactions over the last five years, were designed to demonstrate that the ministry had followed the party’s instructions, according to two people involved in the process.
The exercise came as part of Xi’s bid to consolidate power in the nation of 1.4 billion people, where he’s now China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It’s part of a wider campaign announced in March to revamp the government -- both in Beijing and administrations in far-reaching Chinese provinces -- to ensure it obeys the party’s wishes.
Xi’s success at exerting control over China’s vast bureaucracy stands in sharp contrast to Trump, who has faced resistance to some of his policies from officials within his administration. Generally, investors have viewed this is as a good thing: It allows Xi to rein in local government debt, collect more taxes and implement environmental regulations.
“From a markets perspective, the economy needs this,” said Jonas Short, who heads the Beijing office of Everbright Sun Hung Kai, a financial services firm. “The central government needs to have stronger reign over local government to stop intermittent blow ups from local government causing instability for the whole country.”
‘Bigger Risk’
But some analysts in Beijing worry that the centralization campaign could end up going too far, sapping dynamism from the world’s second-biggest economy. China’s growth spurt began after reforms in the late 1970s, when officials in Beijing allowed provincial officials to experiment with market-based reforms.
“In the longer term, centralization is a bigger risk for China’s development than the trade war,” said Ether Yin, a partner at advisory firm Trivium China in Beijing. “If they keep going with centralization, all the provinces will have to adjust their economic structure based on central government policies and orders. That kind of diversity might gradually vanish, and that’s not good for the economy in the long run.""
Xi has put himself at the center of the Chinese Communist Party since taking power in 2012, designating himself as its “core” and heading dozens of policy committees. He also abolished presidential term limits, enshrined his signature policies in the country’s constitution and laid out a 30-year development plan.
A new body created this year known as the National Supervisory Commission institutionalized an anti-corruption campaign that punishes wayward party members, threatening jail terms or termination for officials who resist central orders. One of its units, China’s top anti-graft body, submitted a report in late July detailing how cadres across the board -- from localities to state-run enterprises -- frequently failed to follow party instructions and demonstrate sufficient loyalty to Xi.
As a result of these shortcomings, the government told ministries to document how they are following Xi’s orders. Those were in addition to inspections from Beijing to force the implementation of environmental regulations, crack down on organized crime, and strengthen the party’s control over local tax authorities.
The changes mark a major shift in the development model that helped propel China to superpower status. Compared with the former Soviet Union, China has always allowed more experimentation at the local level, according to Yanmei Xie, a China policy analyst for Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.
“There is virtually no conceivable lever of opposition that anyone could pull,” she said. “Local diversity and experimentation were contributors to the dynamism of China for many decades. If the room for this is shrinking, what will happen to that dynamism?”
Xi’s Father
For Xi, it’s a change that puts him at odds with his own father, who headed Guangdong province -- now an economy roughly as big as Australia.
In early April 1979, Xi Zhongxun argued in a party meeting in Beijing that Guangdong and other provinces didn’t have enough autonomy to boost the economy, according to Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China, a book by Ezra Vogel. The elder Xi even suggested that if Guangdong were a separate country unshackled from Beijing, it would take off in just a few years.
Deng heeded those calls, setting the stage for special economic zones in China’s provinces that helped transform the country’s economy. Regional autonomy remained strong even as the government took moves to centralize tax collection in the mid-1990s.
More recently, in 2012, the leaders of Guangdong and Chongqing city presented different “models” for China’s development. Wang Yang, now a member of China’s elite Politburo Standing Committee, backed a relatively liberal package of policies called the “Guangdong model” that allowed a greater role for non-profits and trade unions. That contrasted with Bo Xilai’s “Chongqing model,” which emphasized social cohesion and the role of the state.
When Xi came in he believed decision-making had become deadlocked, policy implementation wasn’t working and corruption was rampant, according to Zhang Jian, an associate professor of government at Peking University. Six years later, displays of loyalty to Xi have taken precedence over local experimentation.
“Local bureaucrats have been put under too much discipline,” Zhang said. “Their hands have been bound by the newly centralizing Xi administration.”
Last year, Tianjin’s party boss instructed local cadres to organize study sessions of a new book about Xi’s experiences in the Cultural Revolution, while the city of Jiaxing in Zhejiang province ordered all of its 240,000 party members to wear a pin displaying the Communist Party’s emblem.
One major risk from this approach is that local officials are reluctant to question misguided policies. Last December, an order from Beijing to quickly transition away from coal left millions of villagers in rural areas without heat. A similar problem arose last November, when central orders for mass evictions of migrant workers prompted Beijing’s municipal government to urge greater care in implementing policies.
Another risk is to Xi himself. The more powerful he becomes, the more difficult it becomes to blame others when policies go awry -- particularly in China’s trade war with the U.S. Just this summer, the president faced unusual criticisms from officials and academics who said China may have overreached in its trade war with the U.S. and overplayed its hand internationally.
“Everyone is now looking at him from across all walks of life in China, from bureaucrats to Chinese entrepreneurs and even peasants,” said Peking University’s Zhang. “If China loses more than the United States, a lot of the blame will be put on the president himself.”

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 05:33PM ET</span>",American Airlines joins rivals in hiking U.S. baggage fees by five dollars,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc said on Thursday it would raise domestic U.S. baggage fees by $5, joining major rivals in the price hike amid higher fuel costs.
The largest U.S. airline said it would hike the price of a first checked bag by $5 to $30 and the second bag to $40 in the first price increase since 2010.
Other U.S. airlines, including Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc and JetBlue Airways Inc, have also announced price hikes recently.
The moves come at a time when Congress is considering whether to require the U.S. Transportation Department to assess if airline baggage and ticket change fees are ""reasonable and proportional.""
Airlines have cited rising costs as a concern, with high fuel prices and bumps in salaries and benefits for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics pushing up operating expenses.
In July, American cut its 2018 earnings forecast for the second time after it reported a 34.5 percent drop in quarterly profit, hurt by higher fuel costs.
U.S. airlines’ revenues from baggage and reservation-change fees increased from $5.7 billion in 2010 to $7.5 billion in 2017. Other fees are not reported to regulators.
United Airlines Chief Executive Oscar Munoz defended the price hikes last week, saying they were the first increases in eight years. 
Southwest Airlines Co, the No. 4 U.S. airline, has said it would continue to allow passengers to check two bags and does not charge reservation-change fees.
U.S. House of Representatives and Senate negotiators have been holding lengthy talks on a compromise bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, which could be unveiled as early as Friday. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to extend the FAA’s operating authority.
In May, the U.S. Transportation Department opposed provisions in a bill approved by a Senate panel that would require new rules prohibiting unreasonable airline fees, arguing it would mark a return to the pre-1978 era before airline deregulation.
Airlines for America, an airline trade group, has said the fee provision would result in ""government-mandated price controls"" and should be rejected.
American Chief Executive Doug Parker told reporters last week that if Congress moved to regulate ticket-change fees, the airline would likely stop selling nonrefundable tickets that could be changed to a new flight.

American's increase in the baggage fee will be effective for tickets bought beginning Sept. 21 for travel in the United States and other North America and Caribbean destinations, the airline said.

The value of the deal is not known, Bloomberg reported, adding that the offer would need to be considerably above Deliveroo's latest valuation.
London-based Deliveroo was last year valued at more than $2 billion after raising $98 million from private investors.
According to the Bloomberg report, the talks could fall apart because Deliveroo and its investors have been reluctant to relinquish independence.
Deliveroo, which competes with companies such as  Just Eat  (L:JE), said in July that an initial public offering is not off the cards but was not in a hurry.
Since it started its services in London in 2013, Deliveroo has expanded into 11 other countries, with new markets due soon.

1. Oil in Focus Ahead of Algiers Meeting
Oil will be in the crosshairs tomorrow, a day ahead of the meeting in Algiers between OPEC and Russia.
Crude oil settled lower today after President Donald Trump demanded the cartel push prices lower, but they are still on course for a weekly rise.
""We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!""
Tomorrow also bring the Baker Hughes rig count data at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT) for ongoing signs of expanding U.S. output, which rose to 11.0 million barrels a day last week.
2. Can Financials End the Week With a Big Win?
Financial stocks will be interesting to watch to see if they can finish their strong week on a high note or give back some gains.
The S&P Financial Sector index is on a track to have one of its best weeks in three months and is hitting levels not seen since the first quarter.
It closed up about 0.8% today, despite a selloff in bond yields.
The 10-Year yield approached 3.1% this morning, sold off and made a slight comeback in afternoon trading.
Trading could be volatile again tomorrow with a very sparse economic calendar.
3. Manufacturing and Services PMI Ahead
Although the calendar is relatively empty, investors will still get some economic data shortly after the opening bell.
Markit will release its measure of U.S. manufacturing and services activity at 9:45 AM ET (13:35 GMT).
Economists expect that the preliminary September manufacturing PMI rose to 55.1 from the month before, with the services PMI edging up to 54.9.
While the number will give some more insight into how the economy is faring, traders will already have one eye on the Federal Reserve policy meeting next week.
A rate hike is a foregone conclusion, but any tweak in the language could give hints to the Fed’s 2019 plan."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.97% to 26,661.72. The S&P 500 rose 0.85% to 2,932.58, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.00% to 8,029.27.
A wave of buying emerged across Wall Street, most notably in tech stocks on increasing hopes the United States and China will find a solution to their trade dispute after both nations imposed watered-down tariffs on each other earlier this week.
China said Tuesday it would impose new tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion on Sept. 24. The announcement arrived after the Trump administration announced the U.S. will impose 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods next week.
The levies imposed by both countries came at a lower rate than many had feared, helping lift sentiment on trade.
The optimism on the trade front was captured by strong gains in both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), both of which are believed to be a barometer of trade given their large exposure to China. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose products were scrubbed off a list of items subject to tariffs, rallied nearly 1%, boosting tech.
Not everyone is convinced, however, that the U.S.-China trade spat will be resolved sooner rather than later: Goldman Sachs said the trade dispute between the two nations is in its infancy, warning that Washington may take further action against Beijing in ""the next couple of weeks.""
""Additional tariffs [from the United States] are the most likely outcome, as the policy issues underlying the dispute will be difficult to resolve, the bilateral trade deficit at the heart of the dispute is unlikely to narrow substantially regardless of policy actions, and the White House will have greater political flexibility to increase tariffs after the midterm election,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.
The well of rising bond yields dried up Thursday, meanwhile, but that didn’t stop bank shares staging a rally for the second day in a row, pushing the broader averages to record highs.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) closed higher, adding to gains from Wednesday, which followed a rise in the 10-year treasury yield to its highest level since May.
Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Energy, meanwhile, struggled to keep up with the rally, following a slump in oil prices after President Donald Trump demanded OPEC find a way to slash oil prices.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery fell by 32 cents to settle at $70.80 a barrel.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Vista Global sees higher demand for Bombardier 7500 after certification,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian aircraft leasing company Global Vista, one of the largest customers for Bombardier's long-range Global 7500 business jet, said on Thursday it expects greater demand for the plane after Canadian and U.S. regulators certify the aircraft.
Bombardier expects Canadian certification this month, a necessity if the Montreal-based plane-and-train maker is to begin delivering its flagship business jet to clients, Reuters reported this week citing sources. Regulator Transport Canada has the final say on timing. 
""My personal belief is that after the aircraft is certified there will be pent-up demand because people want to see a certified aircraft,"" Vista Global Chairman Thomas Flohr said in a phone interview.
The Global 7500, which is sold out until 2021, is expected to enter service this year and is crucial to Bombardier's turnaround efforts after it sold a majority stake in its CSeries commercial jetliner program to Europe's Airbus.
Bombardier has not disclosed the number of orders it has received for the Global 7500, which will challenge U.S rival Gulfstream Aerospace's dominance of the top end of the market for long-range corporate planes. 
The aircraft has a range of 7,700 nautical miles and carries up to 19 passengers and crew.
Flohr said Vista Global, a business aviation group that operates separate divisions aimed at services like leasing and chartering aircraft on a pay-for-hours structure, said he expects to begin taking deliveries from Bombardier in September 2019. 
Flohr said he would make delivery slots for the 7500 available to customers through Vista Global's leasing arm in 2020. 
His remarks came after privately held Vista Global on Thursday agreed to buy California-based charter XOJET, which offers on-demand access to its 43 corporate planes through membership programs.
Vista Global expects further consolidation in the fragmented corporate charter market, as part of an industry trend that would help reduce costs and create more uniform standards for private jets.
Flohr would not disclose the deal's value, or Vista Global's revenues.

While a hefty supply of used aircraft has prompted planemakers to cut production of new corporate jets in recent years, some forecasters expect sales to pick up between 2019-2027, in line with global GDP growth. Buyers include individuals and corporations, but also owners of fleets who sell either on-demand programs, or equity in a plane through fractional ownership.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",AT&T asks U.S. appeals court to uphold approval of Time Warner acquisition,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) on Thursday asked a federal appeals court to reject the Justice Department's challenge to its acquisition of Time Warner, saying the government had offered no basis for second guessing key conclusions of a ruling upholding the transaction.
The government is appealing U.S. Judge Richard Leon's ruling in June that AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner could proceed. The government had said it would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law.
AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal.
AT&T's brief said the government did not meet its burdens. ""In the crucible of litigation, DOJ’s claims were exposed as both narrow and fragile,"" the company argued.
The Justice Department declined comment.
The merger, announced in October 2016 and closed on June 14, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, a frequent target of Trump’s ire.
AT&T's brief noted the government's lawsuit was the ""first litigated challenge to a vertical merger in four decades, prompting many press outlets to question whether the White House had improperly influenced DOJ’s decision to bring the case.""
Leon ""quashed discovery into that issue, effectively limiting the trial to the fundamental question"" of if the deal violated U.S. antitrust law,"" AT&T added.
In August, the Justice Department said Leon failed to take into account how companies negotiate with each other and seek to maximize profits in considering the Justice Department’s arguments about how the deal would decrease competition.
In its brief, the government argued the court should have concluded that the merger would give Time Warner more clout at the bargaining table.
Leon ignored evidence regarding how companies use leverage to bargain with each other and failed to consider corporate efforts to increase their revenues, the government argued.
The court’s errors “colored the court’s view of the facts, leading to a decision that is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented at trial,” the Justice Department said.
The core of the Justice Department’s concern about the deal is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner’s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.
Oral arguments have not yet been scheduled by U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

1080,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Investors Are Dumping Treasuries and Dollar to Take On More Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- As global risk assets regain momentum, investors are driving Treasury yields toward seven-year highs and dumping the dollar at the same time.
The greenback fell as much as 0.6 percent Thursday even as benchmark 10-year yields touched 3.09 percent, the highest level since May, and U.S. stocks rose to fresh records. While rising rates typically buoy the currency, a renewed appetite for risk is pulling that relationship apart. The message is simple according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s Alan Ruskin: while strong U.S. and global equity markets are supporting yields, demand for emerging-market currencies and other risk assets is hurting the dollar.
“Put the two together and you get a weaker dollar associated with higher dollar yields,” Ruskin, global co-head of foreign-exchange research, wrote in a note.
The march higher in Treasury yields is also coming as traders adjust expectations for U.S. rate hikes closer to the Federal Reserve’s path. Yet, focus is starting to shift on the tightening prospects of other developed nations, diminishing the dollar’s appeal in an otherwise “very bullish set up,” according to Brad Bechtel, global head of foreign exchange at Jefferies LLC.
“We are likely to see this theme of ‘buy everything else’ re-emerge back to the forefront of the market’s mindset,” Bechtel wrote in a note to clients. “This will help EM rally, G-10 as well, and put some slight downward pressure on USD.”
Thursday’s dollar selloff came on the heels of an overnight interest-rate hike from Norway’s central bank and the Swiss National Bank stopping short of toughening its rhetoric on a recent bout of franc strength. With Australia and Sweden looking for their next move in rates to be higher and the European Central Bank indicating a hike is possible as early as next summer, the greenback could remain under pressure in the months ahead, Bechtel said.
A combination of robust U.S. economic growth and haven flows have buoyed the dollar by roughly 5 percent since mid-April. However, the currency has tumbled nearly 2 percent since its 2018 peak reached in August as emerging-market turmoil ebbs and global growth firms. The dollar’s biggest losses Thursday came against the British pound and Swedish krona after unexpectedly strong U.K. retail sales and growing Swedish rate hike bets.
Even with fed funds futures showing that markets view a Fed rate hike next week as a near certainty, analysts and investors doubt it will lend much support to a floundering greenback.
That trend, however, may come to an end if Treasury yields break above this year’s highs.
“If the U.S. 10-year yield breaks into new terrain, through the cycle high above 3.13 percent, it will likely put an end to the short EM squeeze, and become a factor in its own right having a negative risk impact,” Ruskin said."

The company aims to cut production to 35 from 42 vehicles per hour, having lowered the output to 42 vehicles only last month, the VRM Gruppe, which publishes several local newspapers, reported on Thursday.
The plans have not yet been approved, VRM said.
VRM also said, citing an internal memo to employees, that the plant's management has filed for seven so called ""corridor days"" between Oct.1-29, which effectively means no production will take place those days as workers are reducing overtime.
A spokesman for Opel said that the group was regularly adjusting production plans at its sites, declining to be more specific.
PSA bought Opel and its British sister brand Vauxhall from GM (N:GM) last year in a $2.6 billion deal, and said it aimed to restore Opel to profitability by 2020.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Thursday that four of its new flagship power turbines in the United States have been shut down due to an ""oxidation issue"" and warned it expects the problem to affect more of the 51 units it has shipped, sending shares lower.
The giant machines form the beating heart of billon-dollar electricity plants around the world. Analysts consider GE's success with the new turbines, known as the HA class, critical to rescuing its power division from a steep decline in sales and profits. 
""This issue, if not quickly resolved, could hurt GE's turbine brand image and market share,"" Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, said in a note, cutting his price target to $14 from $15. 
GE stock was down 3 percent at $12.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The problem was first discovered on turbine blades in a natural gas-fueled turbine operated by  Exelon Corp  (N:EXC) in Texas a few weeks ago, GE told Reuters. 
The problem forced Exelon to shut down one turbine. Exelon said it shut down its three other units as a precaution. 
GE and Exelon said they expect the turbines to return to service soon. Neither company provided details about the oxidation or how it led to the shutdowns. 
GE is working with other customers ""to address any impacted unit,"" GE spokesman Chris Shigas said, adding that 10 other HA turbines in the United States were still operating.
But, he added, ""We expect the same issue will impact other HA units.""
GE has installed 27 HA units in seven countries since they were introduced two years ago, but faces competition from rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (T:7011) and  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn).
GE could be forced to pay millions of dollars in compensation to customers and make costly design changes if the problems persist, industry experts said. 
The HA turbines have had trouble before. A group of units in Pakistan required costly repairs.
The outage in Texas ""represents a negative development for a company that has little wiggle room for more 'shoes to drop,'"" J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Thursday, cutting his price target to $10 from $11 a share.
GE Power Chief Executive Officer Russell Stokes first mentioned the problem at the bottom of a post on its LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) internet page on Wednesday, without identifying the plant or providing details.
""The minor adjustments that we need to make do not make the HA any less of a record setting turbine – they are meeting – and in many cases exceeding – their performance goals at every customer site today,"" Stokes wrote. 

GE has received 82 orders for the HA turbine, which entered service in Bouchain, France, in 2016, and subsequently set a Guinness World Record for its high energy efficiency.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 01:35PM ET</span>",Animal health firm Elanco surges 41 percent on debut,"By Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) - Eli Lilly unit Elanco Animal Health Inc's  shares jumped as much as 41 percent on their stock market debut on Thursday, adding to investor enthusiasm for the fast-growing pet healthcare market.
Elanco's shares opened at $32.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, higher than their IPO price of $24 per share, giving the company a market value of $11.49 billion. As of 1641 GMT, the shares hit a high of $33.85.
The company raised $1.51 billion from the offering, which it expects to largely pass on to Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY).
The U.S. drugmaker is expected to own about 82.3 percent of Elanco after the IPO, which was announced in July following a nine-month review of Lilly's businesses which include diabetes and lung cancer drugs.
""We looked at the after-tax value to Lilly's shareholders during the separation, and that was an important metric during the discussions,"" Elanco CEO Jeff Simmons told Reuters.
Simmons emphasized Elanco's focus would be its core animal health business. ""We do not see the need for M&A to execute growth plans.""
Elanco has been spending 8 percent of sales on research and development, Simmons told CNBC earlier in the day.
The company sells medicines for both pets and livestock, and its Rumensin cattle feed additive accounts for 10 percent of its annual sales of about $3 billion.
Elanco sold 62.9 million shares as part of its IPO, and had targeted an offering price between $20 and $23 per share.
Rising demand for its pet healthcare products has driven much of the company's business in recent years, propelling Elanco to No. 4 globally in the list of animal healthcare groups by revenue.
The pet medicine and vaccine market is largely dominated by  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) animal health unit Zoetis (N:ZTS), which raised $2.2 billion in a 2013 IPO.
Zoetis' shares have nearly tripled since then and many analysts expect Elanco will replicate that success in an industry projected to grow at 5 percent from 2017 to 2023, according to data firm Vetnosis.
Elanco's listing should deliver more value to Lilly shareholders and help the company as it sharpens focus on cancer treatments and looks beyond the recent failure in trials of its experimental Alzheimer's drug.

The 16-member IPO underwriting team included Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 12:46PM ET</span>",Minneapolis prosecutors weighing evidence in JD.com CEO case,"By Lawrence Delevingne and Koh Gui Qing
(Reuters) - Prosecutors are weighing whether to bring charges against Chinese businessman Richard Liu after the Minneapolis Police Department turned over the findings of its initial investigation into accusations of rape against the JD.com (O:JD) chief executive, according to a statement released on Thursday by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.
There will be no further comment on the matter until that decision is made, the statement said, and there is no deadline for a decision. 
Liu, founder of head of China's second-biggest online retailer behind  Alibaba  (N:BABA), was visiting Minneapolis for an academic program at the University of Minnesota when he was arrested by city police on Aug. 31 on suspicion of rape. He was released in less than a day without charges or a bail requirement and has since returned to China.
A Minnesota-based lawyer for Liu, Earl Gray, previously said that Liu denies any wrongdoing, and that he does not expect his client to be charged. Gray declined to comment on Thursday. 
JD.com, backed by Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Alphabet Inc’s (O:GOOGL) Google and China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), wrote in a statement on Sept. 6 that Liu had ""resumed his work at JD.com and there is no interruption to our day-to-day business operations."" It added that he would be willing to cooperate further with law enforcement. 
The woman who accused Liu has cooperated with police and is prepared to do the same with prosecutors, two law firms representing her, Florin Roebig and Hang & Associates, said in an emailed statement on Thursday. They offered no further comment.

Liu is the highest-profile Chinese businessperson to be publicly accused of sexual misconduct. The case has raised concerns over JD.com in Liu's absence. The company's rules require Liu, who holds nearly 80 percent of the company’s voting rights, to be present at board meetings for the board to make decisions.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Your Money: What to learn from NFL rookies about getting rich quick,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - You could hardly design a worse scenario for smart money management than being a rookie in the National Football League. Young men in their early 20s, many from low-income backgrounds, are showered suddenly with millions of dollars, alongside teammates with millions of their own.
Meanwhile they are surrounded by people who have been preparing for this potential payday for years - childhood friends, extended family, shady advisers.
It's no wonder, according to Sports Illustrated, that 78 percent of NFL players go bankrupt or experience severe financial stress within two years of retirement. For young players, the football field is one big financial minefield.
Brooks Bollinger remembers it well. The 38-year-old former quarterback was a draft pick of the New York Jets before going on to play for the Minnesota Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys.
“It’s a situation you have never been in before, and that nobody around you has ever been in,” said Bollinger. “Everything moves so fast, and your world changes overnight.”
Bollinger’s job now: Private wealth adviser with NorthRock Partners in Minneapolis, where he helps professional athletes in the NHL, NBA and NFL build financially secure lives beyond football.
Those lessons of how to deal with a windfall are applicable far beyond the football field. 
In fact, you may one day deal with such a scenario yourself, whether it is an inheritance, or a lump-sum buyout from your job, or a legal settlement, or a lottery win.
So, as the season kicks off and players begin cashing in these big checks – the top pick in the draft, Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns, recently signed on for four years at $32.68 million – here are a few money tips on dealing with windfalls.
CURB YOUR IMPULSES
If you have spent your whole life on a modest budget, rein in your natural human instinct, which is to spend, spend, spend. 
“Athletes think they have to go out and buy a house, and a car, and take on all these other expenses right away. But they don’t have to do any of that,” said Lauryn Williams, a former Olympian who is now a financial planner in Dallas at her firm Worth Winning.
Instead, work on the basics: Get an emergency fund together, because things could go wrong at any moment. Set up your retirement accounts – the NFL, by the way, actually has a pretty good one. And the default place to put your money should not be your cousin’s bar or your friend’s laundromat; it should be a low-fee index fund that tracks the stock market.
Next, learn from the mistakes of others before you. Several NFL greats have sued former financial advisers: Cowboys legend Dez Bryant sued his for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence. Former running back Clinton Portis earned $43 million over nine years, and yet because of financial mismanagement had to file for bankruptcy. Indeed, he told Sports Illustrated in a 2017 interview that he at one point mulled killing his advisers (he changed his mind).
Even Lauryn Williams, a money professional herself, was taken for a ride. She was charged $10,000 a year by a financial adviser to pay her bills, even though these days you can arrange automatic bill payments for free. Another planner put some of her money in Bear Stearns, and then did not alert her when the company lost nearly all of its value during the financial crisis.
The NFL players association, for its part, offers a database of financial advisers who have clean records and have the certified financial planner or certified financial analyst designations, but even that is no guarantee of positive results. 
To be certain that your adviser has no potential conflicts, such as getting fat commissions to lure you into certain investments, consider a “fee-only” planner – like those in a database available at NAPFA.org. They get paid to offer advice, but do not get additional fees or an ongoing slice of your portfolio.
Another important tip: Do not think you have to spend like a Kardashian just because more money is coming in. If you were living like a normal person before, live like a normal person now, and just bank the rest.
If possible, do not even touch your principal. That is the money strategy of New England Patriots legend Rob Gronkowski, affectionately known as Gronk. He lives off cash from side deals like endorsements, but has not spent a penny of his actual salary, according to his 2015 memoir, ""It's Good to be Gronk."" (His last contract? Six years, $54 million.)
But such money smarts are the exception, not the rule. Said Bollinger: ""Boy, I wish I knew then what I know now.""

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",S&P sector reshuffle may do little for telecom stocks,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The S&P 500's three-company telecommunications services index (SPLRCL) is about to be folded into a much higher-profile group, but a brighter spotlight may not be enough to boost the stocks as investors continue to favor growth sectors. 
The three telecom stocks -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), AT&T Inc (N:T) and  CenturyLink  Inc (N:CTL) - will be included a newly-minted S&P 500 Communications Services Sector on Monday, along with high-flyers including Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB).
The telecom sector has been the biggest loser among the S&P's 11 major sectors with an 4.4-percent decline so far in 2018, driven by AT&T's 13.3-percent drop. In comparison, many of the other companies joining the group have shown strong gains for the year with Netflix rising 91.5 percent, Twitter (N:TWTR) rising 21.7 percent and Alphabet rising 10.8 percent.

To be sure, passive investors will end up with telecom exposure by default if they invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the new communications index. 
But many active investors may still ignore telecom stocks, which are typically viewed as defensive investments because of slower, though relatively predictable, growth rates and high dividends.
Instead, they may look to faster-growing internet or media companies for exposure to the growth oriented communications sector. 
""Telecoms are likely to fade into the background,"" according to Patrick Palfrey, equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). ""Investors aren't going to look to communications for dividend yield. They're going to look to it for businesses that have a tremendous opportunity to grow."" 
With interest rates rising and an economic expansion still intact, investors are putting more money into growth sectors than dividend stocks, which tend to do better in times of economic weakness. And investors looking to balance their portfolio across different sectors with some defensive bets would be unlikely to seek safety in the communications index.
""If you wanted to own safety or dividend yield you'd go to real estate investment trusts or utilities. Those sectors are uniformly one theme. That's dividend yield,"" said Palfrey. 
Wall Street expects the S&P 500 communications sector to generate 21 percent earnings growth and 11.1 percent revenue growth for 2018, compared with 16.7 percent earnings growth and 7.4 percent revenue growth for the telecom stocks, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
Estimates for the next 12 months imply a trading multiple of 18.4 for the communications sector compared with the telecom sector's multiple of 10.6, according to Thomson Reuters data.
GRAPHIC: S&P 500 current telecoms - https://reut.rs/2CHvx6F
State Street Global advisors created the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLC) ETF to mirror the reclassified sector while Vanguard created the Vanguard Communication Services index fund (P:VOX).
While the new ETFs will give some support to telecom stocks, the decisions of active investors, could have a bigger impact on performance after the reshuffle as passive investments represent a much smaller portion of equity investments. According to a 2017 estimate from BlackRock, less than 18 percent of the global stock market is owned by index-tracking investors.
Growth funds with large-cap investments have been sharply outperforming large-cap value funds with a 16.4-percent increase in value so far in 2018 while value counterparts gained 4.4 percent. In the last five years, growth funds rose 14.9 percent versus 10 percent for value funds, according to Lipper data.
Some stock pickers may take a fresh look at the telephone companies when they join the bigger index, which will make up 10 percent of the S&P 500 compared with the current telecom sector's a 2 percent weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.
And value investors seeking high dividends would still opt for telecom stocks over their faster growing counterparts in the sector because they are cheaper, he said.
But even the strategists who were most hopeful for a boost from the reclassification sounded cautious. 
""Telecoms is probably one of those areas where people have been leaning too heavily on the negative side,"" said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. 
""It's not so much that we like it. It may just be a good time to not be as negative on it.""

(Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 hit record highs on Thursday, clearing away investors' immediate concerns over trade at the start of this week and leaving Wall Street free to return to a rally that now dates back a decade.
Tech stocks were again at the forefront of gains, led by chipmakers and a 1.1 percent rise in Apple (O:AAPL), which has drawn heart from the exclusion of some products from the list of U.S. tariffs on China on Monday.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, and the Dow Industrials, which had lagged the Nasdaq and the S&P, quickly moved back into record territory in morning trade.
""The new record territories for the Dow and the S&P are fueled by lesser trade worries and just general enthusiasm about the economy,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
At 11:28 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 234.42 points, or 0.89 percent, at 26,640.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 19.10 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,927.05 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 64.81 points, or 0.82 percent, at 8,014.84.
Chipmakers Intel (O:INTC) and Micron (O:MU) rose 1.8 percent and 2.6 percent.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) said it was planning to lower memory chip growth output next year to keep supplies tight amid an expected slowdown in demand, Bloomberg reported.
The move could either help maintain or push semiconductor prices up, although it could also be another signal of weakening momentum in a sector which saw its first blips in years in the first half. 
""Many investors are currently looking for companies with more pricing power and is certainly a theme for semiconductors to move higher on,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
After having slapped new tariffs on each other's goods this week, China now hopes that Washington will show sincerity and take steps to correct its behavior.

Nike climbed 1.5 percent after brokerage Susquehanna highlighted the company's improving sales of footwear. 
However,  General Electric  (N:GE) dropped 3.7 percent after the company flagged issues with its new H-class gas turbine.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>","Under Armour to cut 400 more jobs in turnaround push, shares rise","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Under Armour  Inc (N:UA) (N:UAA) announced 400 job cuts on Thursday and raised its forecast for adjusted profit to the high-end of an earlier range, deepening cost-cuts in the face of rising competition from  Nike  (N:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGn). 
The company's shares rose over 5 percent to $19.74 in early trading, bringing gains for this year to more than 30 percent. 
That rise largely reflects a vote of confidence from investors in the company's shift to focus more on international expansion than a U.S. market where its bigger rivals have muscled it out over the past two years.
Under Armour sales and share value surged in the three years after 2013 on the back of big sponsorship deals with Scottish tennis star Andy Murray and NBA star Steph Curry, grabbing market share from Adidas, Nike and Puma.
Analysts still place it as the world's third-biggest sportswear maker but rivals have fought back in the years since and shares in the company fell steadily throughout 2016 and 2017.
""Competition still remains an issue,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.
Initial signs from channel checks and online sales are that Nike is also set to get a boost from a controversial ad campaign, launched earlier this month, featuring former NFL player Colin Kaepernick. 
Sales in North America have risen only once in Under Armour's past four quarters, also due to the bankruptcies of sporting goods retailers. 
""[Under Armour] has created a lot of confusion with too many ranges and by widening its distribution channels,"" Saunders said. 
To compensate for patchy sales in North America, Under Armour has ramped up spending on international expansion and improving its online business. International sales have been growing at a double-digit pace over the past few quarters.
The company now expects annual adjusted earnings of 16 to 19 cents per share, compared with a previous estimate of 14 to 19 cents. Analysts on average are expecting 16 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
This is the second round of job cuts for the Baltimore-based company, which cut 277 jobs last year. 
In February, Under Armour said it expects ""at least $75 million in savings annually beginning in 2019 and beyond"" from restructuring plans in 2017 and 2018.
Under Armour said it expects between $200 million and $220 million in expenses related to the latest rejig, slightly higher than an earlier estimate. The restructuring would reduce 3 percent of its global workforce and would be the final update to its 2018 plan, the company said. 
The job cuts are expected to be completed by March 2019.

""Today's announcement should squash any doubt surrounding the positive trajectory for sustainable operating margin improvement ahead,"" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 11:25AM ET</span>",Top French court throws out latest appeal by SocGen rogue trader,"By Emmanuel Jarry and Inti Landauro
PARIS (Reuters) - France's highest court of appeal on Thursday rejected the latest appeal by former rogue trader Jerome Kerviel against his three-year jail sentence for causing a 4.9 billion euro ($5.8 billion)loss to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The former trader was sentenced to jail after being convicted by a Paris court in October 2010 for breach of trust and fraud after making massive losses in unauthorized equity derivative trades in 2008.
The judges ruled Kerviel failed to present new facts to justify a fresh investigation. Societe Generale's lawyer Jean Veil said left Kerviel was left with no further avenues to appeal his criminal conviction.
""Justice has triumphed,"" Veil said.
However, Kerviel's lawyer Julien Dami Le Coz said his client would keep fighting, without giving details of how he might do so. ""It's certainly not the end of the Kerviel case,"" Dami Le Coz said.
The case has dogged France's third largest bank for more than a decade, with Kerviel successively characterized as an irresponsible and greedy trader, a victim of the system and eventually a reformed criminal eager to denounce the excesses of the finance industry. 
Kerviel, 41, has never denied masking his 50 billion euro positions but contends his managers should have been aware of his actions, something the bank has always rejected. 
He served a few months in prison in 2014 before being granted an early release, but sought to clear his name. At the time he was still locked in a battle in France's civil courts over damages.
In September 2016, the Versailles Court of Appeals slashed the damages liable to the bank from Kerviel to 1 million euros down from almost 5 billion euros, judging the bank to be partially responsible for failing to halt Kerviel's bets.
Months earlier, a labor court had ordered Societe Generale to pay Kerviel more than 450,000 euros for wrongfully firing him.
Societe Generale still faces a dispute with the French finance ministry over the tax treatment of the 2008 loss triggered by Kerviel.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","Emirates, Etihad airlines deny report they may merge","By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - State-owned Emirates and Etihad, two of the Middle East's top airlines, denied a Bloomberg report on Thursday which quoted unnamed sources as saying Emirates was seeking to take over Etihad to create the world's largest carrier.
""There is no truth to this rumor,"" an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters. Etihad made a similar statement.
Emirates is owned by the government of Dubai, the region's tourism hub, while Etihad is controlled by the government of neighboring Abu Dhabi, which thanks to oil exports is the wealthiest member of the United Arab Emirates.
Both airlines, which grew rapidly earlier this decade, have faced financial pressures in the past two years because of tough competition in the industry and a regional economic slowdown due to low oil prices.
Earlier this year, the two carriers signed agreements to cooperate in some areas, such as a deal under which Etihad pilots can join Emirates on a temporary basis for two years.
However, Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum ruled out a merger in May this year. A takeover could be politically difficult as Dubai and Abu Dhabi have long competed for business in some areas even as they cooperate in others.
A source close to Etihad told Reuters on Thursday that while a merger could conceivably happen in the future, Abu Dhabi would not quickly give up control of its airline and brand, especially after it had invested billions of dollars in its international airport and other aviation infrastructure.

A senior banker monitoring business in the Gulf said the idea of an Emirates-Etihad merger had been circulating ""on and off for at least five years"", but that he hadn't heard of any new development. No bank has been mandated to arrange a deal, which would be very difficult operationally, he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) has sued six brokers who left an Illinois branch of the firm last week to join competitor Stifel Nicolaus (N:SF), alleging that they have been soliciting Morgan Stanley clients in violation of employment agreements. 
Filed on Wednesday in Chicago federal court, the lawsuit said the team managed about $660 million in assets at Morgan Stanley's Bourbonnais office before their sudden resignations on Sept. 13. The brokers apparently took client files and contact information with them and have been asking clients to move to Stifel, the lawsuit alleged. 
""When departing advisors breach their agreements, remove confidential information or trade secrets, including personal client information, or engage in other misconduct, they should expect that Morgan Stanley will take appropriate legal action,"" spokeswoman Christine Jockle said in a statement. 
The departures include the former manager of Morgan Stanley's Bourbonnais office, Zachary Birkey, now branch manager of Stifel's Bourbonnais office. Birkey declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Neil Shapiro, a spokesman for Stifel, said the company does not comment on pending litigation. 
Morgan Stanley's lawsuit said the brokers each signed an agreement not to solicit the company's clients for one year after leaving the firm for any reason. It asked the court to order the brokers to stop soliciting clients or using any of Morgan Stanley's information. 
The complaint said the brokers also may be making false statements about their former employer. Some clients have been asking Morgan Stanley if its Bourbonnais office is closing or if Morgan Stanley is going bankrupt, the complaint said.
Files for one large client also appear to be missing, the complaint said. 

Lawsuits over broker defections had dropped after major Wall Street firms signed a pact in 2004 agreeing not to sue if brokers left for rival firms and took clients with them. Morgan Stanley left the so-called Protocol for Broker Recruiting last October, saying the move would allow it to invest more in its advisers.

U.S. sanctions against Iran, introduced by President Trump after his decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, have forced companies in Germany and across Europe to reconsider their investments there.
Ambassador Richard Grenell has appeared to take credit for this shift in a series of tweets and interviews over the past weeks, announcing the withdrawal of German blue chips like  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), BASF (DE:BASFn) and now Volkswagen, to the surprise of the companies themselves.
A Bloomberg News story on Thursday, quoting Grenell, said he had led talks with Volkswagen over the past weeks, hammering out the final details of its new Iran stance on Tuesday.
However, a company source said there had been no talks with Grenell on Iran. And a VW spokesman told Reuters that the company's position had not changed in recent weeks.
Asked about the VW response, U.S. embassy spokeswoman Christina Higgins said: ""The U.S. ambassador has been speaking for quite some time to CEOs and industry leaders urging that they comply with U.S. sanctions.""
VW has no major investments in Iran, although it had been considering establishing a sales network for imported cars. Its Spanish division Seat announced last year that it had abandoned exploratory plans to enter Iran.
Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations and outspoken defender of Trump, has ruffled feathers since arriving in Germany in May.
Within hours of landing he sent a tweet warning German firms to halt all activities in Iran. Weeks later he drew fire from German politicians for telling right-wing website Breitbart News that he wanted to empower ""other conservatives"" in Europe.
His remarks on Thursday about Volkswagen's Iran plans triggered more criticism.
Bijan Djir-Sarai, foreign policy spokesman for the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) in parliament, said it was ridiculous to think that German companies would make decisions based on pressure from the U.S. ambassador.
""The policies coming out of Washington are having an impact. But this has nothing to do with the ambassador,"" he said, urging Grenell to be more careful in his choice of words.

""The German and European economies are strong. We don't need to take orders as if we were an occupied zone.""

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 10:44AM ET</span>",Rare auction showdown could decide fate of broadcaster Sky,"By Ben Martin and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON (Reuters) - A protracted $34 billion bidding war for European broadcaster Sky (L:SKYB) between U.S. rivals Comcast (O:CMCSA) and Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) is likely to be settled by a quick-fire auction on Saturday.
Britain's Takeover Panel, which regulates merger and acquisition activity, said on Thursday it was preparing to take the rare step of intervening in the battle for London-listed Sky by running an auction for the pay-television business that lasts for a maximum of three rounds. 
The process will start if Comcast or Rupert Murdoch's Fox, which has the backing of partner Walt  Disney  (N:DIS), are still competing for Sky by 1700 London time (1600 GMT) on Friday, the Panel said. 
The auction will take place the following day in private and is slated to finish during the evening, when the regulator will announce the level of the bids submitted by the suitors.
It would mark a dramatic resolution of Sky's fate, which has been up in the air ever since Fox made its first bid for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own in December 2016. 
Fox's takeover was held up by prolonged regulatory scrutiny of the proposed deal and was then gatecrashed by cable giant Comcast earlier this year.
Comcast currently leads Fox with a 14.75 pound a share offer for control of the pay-TV group that values it at 25.9 billion pounds ($34.2 billion) and has been recommended to investors by Sky's independent directors.
That trumped the 14 pound a share offer made by Fox earlier in July and is 37 percent above Fox's original 10.75 pound a share bid in 2016.
Sky shares edged up less than 0.1 percent to 15.81 pounds on Thursday.
""Shareholders will be delighted at how this has all played out, having seen the share price double since just before the original offer was made by Twenty First Century Fox almost two years ago,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
British hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, whose firm is a shareholder in Sky, has previously said the company should be valued at a minimum of 18 pounds a share.
""We still have the ability at the end of it to say no, sorry, you still haven't bid enough,"" he told Reuters on Thursday.
Fox is vying for the broadcaster with the financial support of Disney, which in June agreed a separate deal to buy TV and film assets from Fox, including its existing 39 percent Sky shareholding, for about $71 billion.
The fight for the company is part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.
BIGGEST AUCTION
Sky was formed in 1990 when Murdoch merged his fledgling British satellite TV service with a rival, and is a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows.
An auction for Sky, which broadcasts to 23 million households across Europe, would be the biggest ever deal in the UK to be decided by a panel-run auction.
There have only been three British takeover situations since 2007 in which the regulator has run auctions, including the 6.2 billion-pound sale of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus to India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), according to analysis by Reuters.
The last time the Panel invoked the procedure was in 2012 when it almost intervened in the battle for Cove Energy until Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) abandoned its takeover attempt and let Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production clinch a $1.9 billion deal for the gas explorer just before an auction began.
In the first round of the proposed Sky auction, the suitor with the lowest offer at the start of the process, which as things stand is Fox, may make a higher bid. 
In the second round only the other suitor, currently Comcast, would be allowed to increase their offer. They would not be bidding blind and would know the outcome of the first round, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.
If the second round draws a bid, the Panel will then run a third stage when both suitors will have the opportunity to sweeten their offers further in what would essentially be sealed bids. In this round, Fox and Comcast can make their offers contingent on the other making a new bid.
It is possible the fight could end with both Fox and Comcast offering the same price for Sky, the regulator said. 

The Panel has not set any rules governing how Sky's independent directors should respond once the the auction is over.

LONDON (Reuters) - Luxury British carmaker Aston Martin is seeking a valuation of up to 5.07 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) from its stock market flotation next month and said it is prepared for any outcome from the Brexit talks. 
The company, famed for making the sports car driven by fictional secret agent James Bond, said last month it was pursuing an initial public offering (IPO), the first British carmaker to do so for decades.
The automaker will publish a prospectus later on Thursday and hopes to announce its final pricing on or around Oct. 3. 
It expects its shares to be admitted to the London Stock Exchange on or around Oct. 8 although some analysts have raised questions about the valuation the firm is aiming for. 
Carmakers have warned about the impact of any customs checks introduced as a result of a no deal or hard Brexit which could slow down production and add costs when Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.
The boss of Aston, which builds all its cars in Britain, said the company had boosted its stock of engines and components in case free and unfettered trade with the European Union ends in a few months' time.
""We're up to five days of engine stock for example and we've got a very large warehouse in Wellesbourne (in central England) where we have at least five days of car stock,"" Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters, an increase from the previous three days' worth of components held by the firm.
""If there are tariffs ... for every car we lose because of a 10 percent tariff into Europe, we presumably pick up from  Ferrari  (NYSE:RACE) and Lamborghini in the other direction because obviously their cars become more expensive in the UK,"" he said. 
""HALF WAY DOWN THE RUNWAY""
London and Brussels hope to conclude a Brexit agreement by the end of the year but fellow carmakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG) and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) (NS:TAMO) are worried that failure to agree could lead to snarl-ups at motorways and ports disrupting production. 
JLR boss Ralf Speth warned last week that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of car jobs and risk production at the firm, Britain's biggest carmaker.
Aston, which has set a price range of 17.50 pounds to 22.50 pounds per share for the 25 percent of stock it is floating, is targeting a market capitalization of between 4.02 and 5.07 billion pounds. 
The carmaker, which has long said it could pursue a listing, has undergone a turnaround plan since Palmer took over in 2014 as it boosts its volumes and expands into new segments with a new factory due to open in 2019. 
Aston sees Ferrari (MI:RACE), which made its Wall Street debut in 2015 amid strong investor demand, as a model to follow, raising some scepticism. 
""Aston Martin (AM) pricing demands high level of confidence in company’s plans,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. 
""We continue to flag AM’s extremely high R&D capitalization rate... which is elevating reported margins and earnings in the near-term."" 
But Palmer said investor interest had been ""unprecedented"" so far as he hits the road to tap into demand with his message that there is more growth to come.
""The tendency of the investors are 'long only' type investors, people that understand that this is a growth story"" he said when asked who he would be meeting. 
""The aeroplane is half way down the runway but there's still half the runway to go.""

The agency has been investigating crashes involving other Tesla models, which have raised questions over the functioning of the automaker's auto-pilot system. 
The company's shares were up 1.7 percent at $304.27 in early trading on Thursday.
The agency started the 5-Star safety ratings program in 1993 and Tesla's Model X and Model S, which has been the subject of at least one NHTSA investigation, have both received the top rating in the past.
The ratings provide information about crash protection and rollover safety of new vehicles.

Tesla's ability to deliver on production targets for Model 3 sedans has weighed on its stock in the past, and the company recently acknowledged there were delivery bottlenecks and promised to swiftly iron out the delays.

GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Investors in Italy's Carige (MI:CRGI) met on Thursday in the port city of Genoa to elect a new board, but shareholder infighting casts a shadow over the troubled lender's ability to solve its problems.
A boardroom fight that erupted over the summer has thrust Italy's last remaining large problem bank back into the spotlight, after it struggled to push through its third cash call in four years in late 2017. 
Heavily exposed to the battered economy of the northwestern Liguria region, Carige has been weakened by decades of mismanagement, with regulatory audits highlighting poor lending practices and questionable accounting methods.
Italy's worst post-war recession and a crisis in the shipping industry which Genoa-based Carige had been financing have saddled the bank with a pile of soured loans which it has been sweating to reduce.
Having failed to fill a gap in its second-tier capital by selling hybrid debt, Carige has been given until Dec. 31 by the European Central Bank (ECB) to do so, unless it embarks on a merger with a stronger peer.
The ECB has also taken aim at Carige's frequent management changes, demanding the bank fix its governance issues. 
Local businessman Vittorio Malacalza is the top investor in Italy's 10th largest bank after spending more than 400 million euros ($469 million) since 2015 on a 27.6 percent stake.
Malacalza, a feisty steel magnate, has fallen out with CEO Paolo Fiorentino, after pushing out his two predecessors, and is now seeking to replace him with UBS banker Fabio Innocenzi.
Malacalza is opposed by three other shareholders led by Italian financier Raffaele Mincione, who want to keep Fiorentino and steer Carige toward a merger.
""This bank ... needs a partner, strengthening it must be the goal,"" said Guido Alpa, a former Carige director representing Mincione at the meeting.
But Malacalza's representative Francesco Gatti told shareholders Carige had no suitors at present and Mincione's plan was ""as simple ... as it is dangerous"", and would put Carige at risk of being liquidated if a merger did not work out.
Bankers say Carige, which has been selling off assets to survive, still has a solid client base, but its bickering shareholders scare potential buyers away. 
Mincione and the other two local investors together hold 15.2 percent of Carige, but their voting rights are capped at 9.99 percent as they don't have regulatory authorization to hold more than 10 percent. 
Malacalza on Wednesday failed to win a court ruling to ban their list of board nominees altogether and Thursday's vote now risks producing a board narrowly split between the two factions. 
At current market prices, Carige is worth less than a quarter of the 2.2 billion euros it has raised in share issues since 2014, when it failed Europe-wide stress tests of the sector and moved under direct ECB oversight.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Frustrated Ryanair investors target chairman after year of strikes,"By Conor Humphries
GORMANSTON, Ireland (Reuters) - A significant minority of Ryanair (I:RYA) shareholders voted against the re-election of the airline's long-serving chairman on Thursday but they overwhelmingly rejected calls by trade unions to oppose Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. 
The votes at the company's annual meeting were the first chance for investors to give their verdict on a series of strikes and a year of management mis-steps that have seen the share price fall 17 percent. 
After a number of shareholders in the lead up to the vote publicly called for Chairman David Bonderman, 75, to step down, he was re-elected with 70.5 percent of votes, a significant fall from the 89 percent he received last year. Bonderman has chaired the company since 1996.
But they reaffirmed their support for O'Leary, who has pursued a tough line with trade unions, with 98.5 percent re-electing him to the board, down from 99 percent last year.
O'Leary, 57, said he would now negotiate a new contract to take him beyond 2019, but was reluctant to get tied into a five-year contract at his age.
""The overwhelming majority of our shareholders are supportive [of chairman David Bonderman] ... and we should be very appreciative,"" O'Leary, who became chief executive in 1994, told the meeting.
Ryanair has struggled with labor relations in recent months and endured its worst one-day strike last month, disrupting the plans of an estimated 55,000 travelers.
Another one-day strike by cabin crew is planned across five countries on Sept. 28.
Ahead of the meeting a number of institutional investors, including Royal London Asset Management and Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), had announced publicly that they would oppose Bonderman's re-election.
""We hope Mr Bonderman and the board will heed the message shareholders have sent today and announce plans for him to step down,"" said Ian Greenwood, chairman of the LAPFF said after the vote. 
""Ryanair should recruit an independent chairman who will strengthen the board to provide greater oversight and challenge to Mr O'Leary,"" he added.
Speaking to journalists, Bonderman, 75, declined to speculate on when he might leave, but said he thought criticism of the board in recent months had been ""way off base."" 
Bonderman, the founder of private equity firm TPG Capital resigned from the board of Uber in 2017 after an ill-judged joke that more women on the board means ""more talking"".
UNION ANGER
Ahead of the meeting, a number of trade unions issued statements calling for shareholders to oppose the re-election of both Bonderman and O'Leary. 
""While he (O'Leary) is still there as the embodiment of Ryanair's values, the distrust among many staff is likely to continue and with it the industrial unrest,"" BALPA pilots' union General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.
""If this opportunity is missed, it is difficult to envisage how Ryanair can move forward.""
While O'Leary said he did not expect many strikes over the winter, he declined to speculate when asked more than once if the industrial action could escalate. 
After the meeting, he told journalists he had been asked by the company's remuneration committee to extend his contract but that he did not want to commit to a new five-year deal. 
Instead, he said would rather move to a rolling 12-month contract at some point in the next few years. He has a stake in the company of just over four percent according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. 

Ryanair had initially banned media from the meeting, prompting some to buy shares and others to stay overnight at the meeting venue north of Dublin. At the last minute management decided to allow journalists to attend.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 08:14AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lloyds Banking Group to locate third EU subsidiary in Luxembourg - source,"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Bank (L:LLOY) is looking to set up a third European Union subsidiary in Luxembourg to serve longstanding life insurance customers after Britain quits the bloc, a source told Reuters, in its latest overhaul aimed at Brexit-proofing its business.
The UK's largest mortgage lender is seeking a license in Luxembourg to ensure continuity of service for customers based in the EU, the source familiar with the matter said.
Initial discussions with regulators in Luxembourg - home to one of Europe's most thriving insurance communities - have already taken place, with further talks planned over coming weeks, the source added.
Lloyds declined to comment.
If its application is successful, Lloyds will have legal bases in Britain, Berlin, Frankfurt and the Duchy, underlining the scale of reorganization underway at UK-based banks as Brexit draws nearer.
The bank has no plans to relocate UK-based employees to run the subsidiary. It is planning instead to hire around a dozen people to provide the necessary services to its EU-based Scottish Widows policyholders, the source said. These are holders of 'closed book' policies no longer being sold.
The bulk of Scottish Widows policyholders will continue to be served by its Edinburgh-based British business. 
Like its main German subsidiary, the Luxembourg entity will also need its own pool of capital but the total sum required is still to be discussed with local regulators. 
News of Lloyds' bid to set up a third base in the EU comes as Prime Minister Theresa May steps up efforts to secure a so-called 'business-friendly' Brexit deal with the EU before the end of 2018.
Britain's financial and related professional services sector, which employs 2.3 million people and represents nearly 10 percent of the UK's total economic output, is broadly considered the industry with most to lose in the event of a chaotic Brexit. 
Many global banks who have run European businesses from London for decades have begun to scatter senior executives and staff to a welter of new offices across the EU, amid fears they won't be able to serve EU-based consumers or companies easily after Brexit Day on March 29.
Swiss bank UBS (N:UBSG) said in March it would pursue a ""decentralized"" model, echoing moves by Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Bank of America (N:BAC) and JPMorgan (N:JPM).
GERMAN BASES
Sources told Reuters in February 2017 that Lloyds will locate its main European subsidiary in Berlin, after converting an existing Bank of Scotland branch that Lloyds inherited following its takeover of HBOS a decade ago.
In July, Reuters reported that the bank, a more than 250-year-old institution that has always concentrated its operations in Britain, will set up two additional hubs to better support its EU-based bond trading and insurance customers, and to comply with British regulations aimed at reducing bank risk.
Lloyds declined to give details on the amount of money it would need to capitalize its Frankfurt entity, but the sum required by the main Berlin subsidiary is expected to run to the ""low hundreds of millions of pounds"", representing less than 1 percent of the bank's overall capital.
Lloyds employs around 300 people in Berlin, including a full management team, finance, risk and human resources staff. It expects to shift no more than a handful of staff from Britain, the source said.
The Frankfurt subsidiary will not need a full banking license but Lloyds has applied to Germany's financial markets regulator for the requisite investment firm license, the source added.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 06:43AM ET</span>","Tencent-backed Meituan climbs 5 percent on debut, brightens outlook for HK IPOs","By Julia Fioretti and Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) rose 5 percent on debut in Hong Kong on Thursday, valuing the Chinese online food delivery-to-ticketing services firm at about $55 billion and sending a positive signal to companies lining up to list in the financial hub.
The stock's performance is being seen as a test of investor appetite for Hong Kong listings against a backdrop of weak markets and multi-billion dollar initial public offerings (IPOs) that have struggled to rise above their issue price, such as smartphone maker  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and China Tower (HK:0788).
The strong debut also reflects investor confidence that loss-making Meituan can fend off bruising competition from food-delivery platform Ele.me, which is backed by China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA). Both have been offering heavy discounts to win new customers and market share.
Shares of Meituan, which counts China's biggest gaming and social media firm Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) as a key investor, closed at HK$72.65 ($9.26) compared to its IPO price of HK$69 but below the opening level of HK$72.9.
Founded in 2010 by Wang Xing, Meituan, which has been likened to U.S. discounting platform  Groupon Inc  (O:GRPN), merged in 2015 with its then main rival Dianping, akin to U.S. online review firm  Yelp  Inc (N:YELP).
Meituan's market value today dwarfs Groupon's $2.3 billion and Yelp's $4.1 billion. Xing owns around 573 million shares in Meituan, making his holdings worth about $5.3 billion, more than either of the U.S.-listed companies.
""This may be the most important decision in our investment journey in more than 10 years,"" wrote Neil Shen, founding and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China, which owns about 12 percent of Meituan. ""In this scuffle, Wang Xing led the team to fight more and more bravely, and it was a bloody battle in the fierce competition.""
At the listing ceremony on the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday, Xing praised the role of the company's almost 600,000 delivery persons and 50,000 employees in fuelling its growth.
""I also want to thank Steve Jobs, thank Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), without iPhone, without mobile internet, everything we do today wouldn't have been possible,"" he said.
Meituan's wide variety of services has attracted users, but pushed it into the red. The company lost 22.8 billion yuan ($3.33 billion) in the first four months of this year, despite a big jump in revenue. It lost about $2.8 billion in 2017.
The company bought bike-sharing firm Mobike for $2.7 billion this year, an expensive acquisition that is straining its margins.
Alibaba, meanwhile, has been beefing up its offerings, snapping up food delivery service Ele.me and Baidu Waimai, which it plans to roll together with its lifestyle services app Koubei.
BUMPER IPO YEAR
Meituan's stock rise was also helped by broad gains in Asian shares on Thursday as investors took a less bearish view on the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on markets.
This year is set to be the biggest year for IPOs in Hong Kong since 2015, helped in part by a market rally late last year and rules introduced this year to attract tech companies by allowing them to weight voting rights in favor of their founders.
Hong Kong listings have raised $28.7 billion so far this year, compared to $33.8 billion raised in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.
But an 18 percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng index (HSI) from its January peak and an intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war have clouded the prospects for other companies looking to go public, as investors become more cautious and selective.
Of the biggest 10 listings in Hong Kong this year, just one, Zhenro Properties (HK:6158), is trading above its issue price.
Meituan is the second company with a dual-class share structure to go public in Hong Kong as well as the second multi-billion dollar tech float in the city this year, following in the footsteps of Xiaomi.
""It sends a relatively positive signal to the upcoming IPOs, but retail investors are unlikely to be particularly keen on this type (dual structure) of IPO for the time being,"" Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities, said of Meituan's performance.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Jean-Claude Biver is dropping his operational responsibilities as the head of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) watch division, he told Reuters over the phone on Thursday, confirming media reports.
""I am giving up my operational responsibilities, but I'm staying as non-executive president of LVMH's watch unit and its three watch brands, TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot,"" said Biver, 69.
""I'll no longer be cutting the onions and crying in the kitchen early in the morning, I'll just come later to see if they are ready,"" said Biver, who has been suffering from serious health problems in recent months. He said he was doing better, but had not yet fully recovered.
Biver, one of the Swiss watch industry's best-known and most successful managers, joined LVMH in 2008 when the Hublot brand he was leading at the time was acquired by the French group. He was appointed head of LVMH's watch business in 2014.
LVMH's watch and jewelry division had sales of 3.8 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2017, up 12 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions. Jewelry is being managed separately and is not part of Biver's responsibilities.
Biver declined to comment on a media report published in French magazine Challenges on Wednesday that he would be replaced by Stephane Bianchi, a former CEO of French cosmetics group Yves Rocher.
Challenges also reported that Frederic Arnault, the 23-year-old son of LVMH's Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, would take on more responsibilities at TAG Heuer, LVMH's biggest watch brand, as head of strategy and digital. 
LVMH - the world's biggest luxury goods group, which is controlled by the Arnault family - declined to comment.
Frederic Arnault had already been working at Tag Heuer over the past year as head of connected technologies, dealing with its smartwatches.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Scooter- and bike-rental startup Lime is expanding to dozens more cities this year, its CEO said, leveraging the hundreds of millions of dollars in funding it has raised in an effort to dominate the North American and European markets. 
The California-based company will launch its service in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Vienna, Austria, as early as next week, Chief Executive and Co-founder Toby Sun told Reuters.
Lime is one of several startups that offer dockless, electric scooters and bikes for rent, a burgeoning business that has rattled city regulators and cluttered sidewalks and bike lanes.
Sun said customers have completed 11.5 million rides on Lime e-scooter, e-bikes and pedal bikes since the company launched just more than a year ago. While the business resembles ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft - passengers use a smartphone app to find a vehicle nearby - the business model is more profitable, as there are no drivers to recruit or pay. 
However, many in the industry expect the crowded nature of the scooter business will force prices down, eating into profits.
Lime has raised $467 million from investors, including a $335 million round in July that involved a deal with Uber to include Lime scooters in the Uber app. Lime is available in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Spain and France.
Fort Lauderdale and Vienna mark the start of a rapid expansion, as the company plans to enter two to four new cities each week through the end of the year, Sun said. 
Electric bikes and scooters ""are well-positioned to solve the global problem"" of passengers completing the first- and last-mile of a trip, when public transit centers are just out of reach, Sun said. 
Meanwhile, one of Lime's chief competitors, Bird, said on Thursday its e-scooter service has completed 10 million rides since launching a year ago. Bird is available in 100 cities and has 2.1 million riders, and has raised $418 million from investors.
Investment in e-scooter and e-bike services has not been snarled by opposition from regulators or by safety concerns. Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, encouraged by the quick and loyal adoption from scooter riders, have rushed at the opportunity to provide more transportation solutions as urban areas get more congested and climate change poses a greater threat.
Sun said some cities were quickly loosening their regulations, with Austin, Texas, raising its limit on e-scooters and e-bikes to 2,000 from about 500 in just two months, for instance.
For now, Lime is focused on North America and Europe, while Bird has its eye on an expansion in Latin America.

However, basic issues for the industry remain unresolved, such as where scooter users should ride the vehicles, helmet laws and fixing the backlog at scooter manufacturers.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) faces a new Danish investigation into alleged money laundering a day after revealing payments totaling 200 billion euros ($234 billion) through its Estonian branch, many of which were suspicious.
Thomas Borgen, Danske Bank's chief executive, resigned on Wednesday after an investigation it had commissioned exposed failings in controls and compliance.
The bank's report prompted widespread political criticism and has persuaded Denmark's Financial Services Authority (FSA) to revisit a case which it had put on ice earlier this year, but is reported to have attracted the attention of U.S. authorities.
""We're reopening the investigation of the bank that we initially closed in May,"" FSA head Jesper Berg told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Thursday.
While authorities in the United States have yet to say whether they are investigating the payments, many of which came from Russia and other former Soviet states, Danske Bank's case will be high on the agenda of European Union states.
European Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said on Thursday she will discuss the Danske Bank case with the finance ministers of Denmark, Finland and Estonia on October 2.
""I want to understand better where the main errors happened, whether it was purely the fault of the lack of due diligence done by the bank itself or whether there was also some mistakes at the level of supervisory authorities,"" she told a news conference in Brussels.
She will also discuss the case with the European Banking Authority to see if mistakes were made at the supervisory level.
""STRIKING FAILURE""
Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen voiced his concern over the failings exposed by the country's biggest lender, saying he was ""shocked"" at the scope of the suspicious payments and pushed the bank for more answers.
""The fact that Denmark has been at the center of money laundering of this size is frankly quite horrible,"" Rasmussen told reporters outside a meeting of European Union leaders in Salzburg late on Wednesday.
Danske Bank already faces a criminal investigation after the Danish state prosecutor for financial crime said in August it had started its own inquiry.
""The case doesn't end with this,"" the PM said, referring to Wednesday's report from Danske Bank. 
Politicians, who are scrambling to show they take the problem seriously, agreed on a new anti-money laundering law this week that will include an eight-fold increase in the size of fines, making it one of the toughest in Europe.
""It's a striking management failure,"" Jeppe Kofod, who chairs the European Parliament's special committee on financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance, told Reuters. 
""The responsible people should be fired to show that such a failure has consequences,"" he said. Danske Bank said on Wednesday it had taken action against former and current staff.
In Denmark, which regularly feature in surveys as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, politicians were critical of Danske Bank for not revealing exactly how much money was laundered and not placing a legal responsibility.
Business minister Rasmus Jarlov told Reuters on Wednesday that Denmark wanted to avoid a scenario like the one in Latvia where ABLV was accused by U.S. authorities of covering up money laundering, leading to the bank being denied U.S. dollar funding and its swift collapse.
""We're dealing with it here, and we crack down hard on money laundering, and we hope this is being noticed abroad,"" he said.

Both Jarlov and Danske Bank's board chairman Ole Andersen have said they are not allowed to say whether they have been in contact with U.S authorities regarding the case.

This week, Nestle agreed to sell its Gerber Life Insurance business for $1.55 billion, while sources told Reuters it was also bidding for GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) Horlicks drink.
The skin health unit, which makes Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care brands, as well as Restylane wrinkle fillers, had sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs ($2.8 billion) last year, accounting for about 3 percent of the Nestle's total.
Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said he estimated the business was worth 6 billion to 6.5 billion Swiss francs, excluding financial debt, provisions and deferred taxes. He said it could fetch between 6 billion and 8 billion francs in a sale. Another analyst put the sale value at about 7 billion francs.
Jefferies analysts said Nestle's announcement was ""a significant and positive development, both in its own right and as a symbol of willingness to slay sacred cows in pursuit of shareholder value.""
They said a sale to L'Oreal or a leveraged buyout were the main exit options.
Nestle's skin health business sells dozens of different products via prescription, over the counter and as corrective and aesthetic products which are used by doctors.
""Sharpening our strategic focus on Nestle's core food, beverage and nutritional health products offers the best opportunity for long-term profitable growth and is fully in line with the pursuit of our company's purpose,"" Nestle Chairman Paul Bulcke said.
Nestle created the business in 2014 when it acquired L'Oreal's (PA:OREP) stake in their Galderma joint venture.
Skin treatments had been a major part of a push into higher growth and more profitable health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food businesses. But the division has struggled against generic competition and seen lean sales.
Nestle cut 450 jobs at a research and development centre in southern France last year and shut a Swiss factory in August.
Nestle has been conducting a review of its skin business that is due for completion by mid-2019. It has said it remains committed to its health science unit, which sells medical nutritional products. It bought a vitamin business this year. 
Nestle shares were roughly flat at 0730 GMT.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Japan clothing magnate Maezawa chases spot in business firmament,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese fashion billionaire Yusaku Maezawa's first meeting with role model and SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) boss Masayoshi Son came in 2010 when they bathed together - a popular communal activity in Japan - on the 26th floor of the tech giant's headquarters.
The next year, the two men teamed up to launch a business in China.
""If I was to work under somebody it would definitely by Son-san. He is the only executive I think that about,"" he said in a comment posted to a 2016 Newspicks article about the meeting. 
Although Son has been an inspiration for the 42-year-old billionaire, Maezawa has taken a different approach to publicity, saying on Monday he would be the first private passenger taken around the moon by Elon Musk's SpaceX.
In a project which Maezawa has dubbed Dear Moon, he will bring up to eight artists to inspire works based on the experience.
It will also shine starlight on his publicly listed company Zozo, officially known as Start Today (T:3092), and generate media coverage stretching to 2023 and beyond.
Yet his most expensive hobby - Maezawa declined to reveal how much the trip would cost but told Reuters it was ""much higher"" than the $110 million Basquiat painting he bought last year - may be his riskiest bet. 
Unlike a Basquiat or Picasso, a trip to the moon cannot be sold to another collector, and only 24 astronauts have ventured beyond Earth's protective magnetic field.
APPROACHABLE BILLIONAIRE
While success alone helped Son and Fast Retailing's (T:9983) Tadashi Yanai become household names, Maezawa is a new breed of Japanese billionaire adept at self-promotion, said Parissa Haghirian, professor of Japanese management at Tokyo's Sophia University.
That has made Maezawa a regular fixture in the country's gossipy weeklies with his collection of foreign and Japanese art, fast cars and celebrity girlfriend.
His heavy Twitter use bears more resemblance to Musk than Son, who effectively quit tweeting three years ago.
Maezawa uses Twitter to connect with his followers, frequently answering questions on everything from his art collection and hopes for world peace to customer service queries.
That off-the-cuff approachability has at times landed Musk in hot water, and the South African-born billionaire has been criticised for running electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) as a one-man show.
By contrast, Maezawa has in recent years surrounded himself with lieutenants as the business has matured, said Michael Causton, an analyst at JapanConsuming. 
CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS
The diminutive Japanese entrepreneur, who as a young man struggled to find clothes that fit, attended a feeder high school for the prestigious Waseda University.
But preferring to be a drummer in a punk band, he ditched college and the escalator to salaryman drudgery.
In 2004, he opened the Zozotown online fashion mall that has made him rich.
Zozo is now seeking to transform itself into a fashion brand, with a large-scale deployment of its polka-dot Zozosuit, which allows users to upload body measurements and order made-to-measure clothing.
That growing ambition is causing friction with established big personalities, such as Yanai, the founder of the Uniqlo chain, who called the Zozosuit ""a toy"" in comments to the Nikkei business daily. 
""That's the highest praise. It's what we're aiming for,"" Maezawa responded on Newspicks. ""We will increase the numbers of people having fun measuring themselves all over the world.""
Zozo's growth targets are ambitious, with the company shooting for 80 billion yen ($713 million) in overseas sales in three years.
But it faces stiff competition, with big names such as Amazon (O:AMZN) making a major push into fashion in Japan. Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is also behind Blue Origin, a rival to SpaceX.
Zozo's recent share price decline - down a third from record highs hit in July - reflects concerns over its ambitions. The company has a market valuation of $9 billion.
""Amazon doesn't like us,"" Maezawa told Reuters. ""We're a competitor.""
Regardless of his company's fortunes, Maezawa has already made an impact on society, experts say.
His public displays of conspicuous consumption - he tweeted last month that his new jet's interior is being fashioned by luxury label Hermes, and he is considering buying a baseball team - stand out in a country where humility is seen as a virtue.
That shows young Japanese people that you can make a lot of money and be open about it, Sophia University's Haghirian said.

""That's affecting a lot of people in a positive way - people get inspired,"" she said.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 04:49AM ET</span>",World stocks rise as trade relief bounce continues,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - A bounce in world stocks in relief that the fresh U.S. and Chinese tariffs on reciprocal imports were less harsh than feared continued on Thursday, although investors remained wary about the next steps in the US-Sino trade war.
An MSCI index tracking shares in 47 countries rose 0.2 percent, supported by gains in Europe and Asia, but Chinese equities dipped after a rally on bets of government stimulus to limit the economic damage of new trade barriers.
The pan-European STOXX benchmark rose 0.3 percent, while Japan's Nikkei ended little changed, barely moving after a well-anticipated win by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a ruling party leadership vote.
Markets were also watching a European Union summit where Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to fellow EU leaders on Wednesday to drop Brexit demands that she said could rip Britain apart. 
After a knee-jerk negative reaction to the new tariffs announced by Washington and Beijing on Tuesday, markets have been speculating that an immediate escalation could be averted. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has not made fresh threats that he would seek to extend tariffs to all Chinese imports. 
""Making forecasts on Trump is always a risk but it's a fact that at the moment the escalation has taken a break,"" said Anthilia Capital fund manager and strategist Giuseppe Sersale.
For his part, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week he would not would not weaken the yuan to boost exports. 
Broader market sentiment was at odds with a new Reuters poll that showed unanimous agreement that an escalating trade war with China was bad economic policy for the United States and could cause economic growth to slow. 
Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING, said he saw more reasons to take a ""glass-is-half-full"" approach, given the recent emerging market selloff.
The consensus of the poll for U.S. growth showed a slowdown to 2.0 percent in the final quarter of 2019, less than half the last reported rate of 4.2 percent.
Meanwhile, S&P 500 E-mini futures were little changed following strong gains on Wall Street on Wednesday.
The rally in global stocks has been accompanied a drop in demand for safe-haven assets, boosting U.S. bonds yields and sending the dollar to seven-week lows. The Japanese yen has also been under pressure. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which on Wednesday touched its highest level since May 18, eased back to 3.0682 percent on Thursday.
This move comes ahead of what is expected to be a hawkish meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve next week. 
All 113 economists in the Reuters poll forecast the Fed would hike rates when it meets Sept. 25-26. It is expected to follow that up with one more before the end of this year, taking the fed funds rate to 2.25-2.50 percent.
The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six major rivals, dipped 0.18 percent at 94.371. 
The dollar was 0.04 percent lower against the yen at 112.25, while the euro was 0.26 percent stronger against the greenback at $1.1700.
The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.3188 versus the dollar, helped by growing confidence that a Brexit trade deal can be clinched in the coming months. 
On Thursday Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Britain was over 85 percent of the way to agreeing a deal with the European Union on its exit from the bloc. 
The Norwegian crown slumped versus the euro after the country's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in seven years, as expected, but trimmed its policy rate forecasts. The crown fell 0.9 percent versus the euro to 9.5990 EURNOK=D3. 
In commodities, news of another drawdown in U.S. crude inventories and signs that OPEC may not raise output enough to compensate for the loss of Iranian exports hit by sanctions, lifted benchmark Brent crude 0.11 percent at $79.49. [O/R]

Base metals rose, buoyed by relief over trade and a shortage of the metal in top consumer China, with London Metal Exchange zinc hitting its fortnight before paring some gains and trade up 0.50 percent at $2,446 a tonne. [MET/L]

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 03:09AM ET</span>",Tidal wave of Chinese marine parks fuels murky cetacean trade,"By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Eight beluga whales jump in unison out of a bright blue indoor pool, flipping their tailfins and spewing fountains of water, as a packed audience cheers and snaps photographs.
Whale shows like the one at Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, located in Zhuhai on China's southern coast, are proliferating at new marine parks across the country, driving demand for threatened species, according to scientists, executives and activists.
Orcas and beluga whales are among the marine animals caught up in a shadowy trade in which individual cetaceans - often caught illegally - sell for millions of dollars, they say.
Marine parks and aquariums are opening monthly in China, with more than 36 large-scale projects set to launch in the coming two years. This comes as many live animal shows in the United States and Europe are being scrapped due to widespread opposition.
""We've had great progress in shutting down marine parks in the West but China is saying, 'it's my turn now',"" said Ric O'Barry, founder of the Dolphin Project, an advocacy group.
Lured by booming domestic tourism, companies such as Haichang Ocean Park (HK:2255), Guangzhou R&F Properties (HK:2777), Dalian Shengya and Chimelong Group are spearheading the rapid growth of the industry.
Haichang's Shanghai Ocean World, which is due to open in November, and Chimelong's Ocean Kingdom are preparing live orca shows for the first time in China.
O'Barry, who captured and trained dolphins and orcas before launching a campaign against captive marine mammals in 1970, said China was the main driver of the industry globally.
Over 60 marine parks already operate in China, ranging from large-scale developments like Chimelong's Ocean Kingdom, to small facilities which are typically add-ons to big property projects, said industry executives.
(For a graphic on 'China's ocean theme parks' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2oPi030)
Chimelong, Haichang, Dalian Shengya, Zhonghong Group and Rizhao Ocean Park did not respond to multiple requests for comment. R&F said its planned resort would only include wild captured cetaceans if they had been rescued, or came from reputable zoos and aquariums.
Cities often initiate marine park projects as an eye-catching way of raising their profiles, and offer developers vast tracts of land and cheap loans to build them.
Noble Coker, president of Apex Parks and Entertainment Services, which works with theme parks in Asia, said marine facilities were often a secondary consideration in an overall deal to acquire land from municipal governments.
Developers benefit from the quick development and sale of residential or commercial property, he said, with elements like marine parks typically paid for by the property sales.
""All of the incentives for the developers are in the short-term, so the 20-year moral and ethical impacts of the park or aquarium they are building are rarely, if ever, considered,"" said Coker.
ILLEGAL CAPTURES
Since 2014, 872 cetaceans - which includes whales, dolphins and porpoises - have been put into captivity in China, according to the China Cetacean Association.
There are currently no local government regulations or international standards to monitor the trade, said Lucio Conti, vice president for marine facilities at Atlantis Sanya, a resort located in China's tropical Hainan province.
Conti said Atlantis was working with the government to establish an animal welfare standard at a time when there was growing illegal trade of endangered wildlife.
""If you go to the fishermen here on the island they can get you whatever you want. They can get you a whale shark, they can get you every species, endangered or not because there is no such control.""
China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism referred a request for comment to the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, which is in charge of wildlife issues.
The administration referred questions to the State Oceanic Administration, which in turn referred questions to the Ministry of Natural Resources. That ministry referred questions to the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Many Chinese marine parks feature whale sharks, belugas, dolphins and manta rays. But no orcas - or killer whales, known for their distinctive black and white coloring - have been displayed publicly up to now.
At least 13 Russian orcas were imported to China between 2013 and 2016, according to CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Another two were sent in 2017 and more are set to be imported this year, according to Oxana Fedorova, head of Dolphin Project Russia.
CITES did not reveal the companies involved.
Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a UK-based group, said Chimelong Ocean Kingdom possesses nine orcas, Shanghai Haichang Polar Ocean World has four and two more are at Wuxi Changqiao Ocean Kingdom.
Russia, which is the sole supplier of wild orcas and beluga whales to China, in July announced an investigation into the illegal sale of 7 killer whales.
Four companies were involved in the sale of the orcas to China, according to a statement from the Russian Prosecutor General's Office. It did not name the companies or the destination of the orcas.
Russia approved a capture quota for 13 orcas in 2018. Several killer whales have already been caught in Russia's Sea of Okhotsk, said activists monitoring the hunt in August.
""The problem is the demand that is being created in China,"" said Fedorova, who worked with the team, organized by Ocean Friends. She said the team of seven had been threatened, shot at and robbed by the hunters.
The activists said they were unable to record the captures on film as their drone was shot down.
However, a photograph from Ocean Friends showed transportation tanks on a Russian ship called Jurii Shvezov holding two orcas.
A representative from Kupets, the company that owns the ship, said it was engaged in the transportation of orcas and did not catch them. She declined to comment further.
DISPOSABLE MANNER
Naomi Rose, a Washington-based marine mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute, said the captures were unsustainable and inhumane.
She added that the prospect of high profits would continue to attract a criminal element.
""When you have that much money involved - where an animal is worth several million dollars- you are going to have crime and danger.""
Once in captivity, the rate of mortality is extremely high, said activists. This forces companies to continually repurchase marine animals.
""They just suffer in captivity. Especially for orcas, they are the most unsuitable to be put in a tank. Their culture is in the wild,"" said Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society.
Squalid conditions and poor welfare practices are growing concerns amid the increasing flood of marine parks.
In June, for example, an online video showed a trainer from Ocean World in China's port city of Dalian applying bright red lipstick on a beluga whale. The company later apologized and promised to strengthen the animal protections, according to local media.
Activists worry that once China's biggest players start orca performances, it will spawn a copycat effect at smaller, less experienced parks around the country.
Peng, who was watching the beluga show at Ocean Kingdom with his wife and son, said he had not realized belugas were endangered and that he had enjoyed the show.
""It's not cruel for them. They feed them and didn't beat them.""

“The solid rise in GDP in the second quarter will give the RBNZ more confidence in its view that GDP growth will rise back above 3% next year. In contrast, we believe that low confidence, a soft housing market and easing net migration will result in growth slowing further next year, perhaps to around 2%,” said Capital Economics economist Paul Dales.
The kiwi rose following the data release, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4%.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 11:45PM ET</span>",Alibaba's Jack Ma says U.S.-China trade war ends 1 million U.S. jobs promise: Xinhua,"(Reuters) -  Alibaba  (N:BABA) Chairman Jack Ma said the company can no longer meet its promise to create 1 million jobs in the United States due to U.S.-China trade tensions, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.
Ma has already warned that the trade war between the world's two largest economies could last decades and that China should focus exports on the ""Silk Road"" trade route, citing Africa, Southeast Asia and Europe.
Ma met U.S. President Donald Trump two years ago and laid out the Chinese e-commerce giant's plan to bring one million small U.S. businesses onto its platform to sell to Chinese consumers over the next five years.
""This commitment is based on friendly China-U.S. cooperation and the rational and objective premise of bilateral trade,"" Ma told Xinhua on Wednesday.
""The current situation has already destroyed the original premise. There is no way to deliver the promise.""
While Ma had not detailed how he would add those jobs, he has said that he wanted to encourage American small businesses to sell on Alibaba marketplace Tmall and Taobao, reasoning that every new business that joined the platform would have to hire a person to manage the extra sales.
Investors seemed unfazed by Ma's comments, with Alibaba shares closing up 3.8 percent on Wednesday. They have declined 5.7 percent so far this year, including those gains.
Trump on Monday imposed 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of imports from China, and threatened duties on about $267 billion more if China retaliated.
China responded a day later with tariffs on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods as planned, but reduced the level of tariffs it will collect on the products.
Ma's latest comments come on top of others he recently made about the escalating trade skirmish and show his support for Beijing's stance on how additional tariffs will affect businesses and the country's cornerstone One Belt One Road foreign policy initiative.
""The U.S. like competition, China likes harmony, they're two different cultures,"" Ma said at an investor conference in Shanghai on Tuesday.
Ma, expected to step down as Alibaba chairman in a year, predicted on Tuesday that trade frictions would lead to ""a mess"" for all parties involved.
He added U.S. tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products could prompt the country to export elsewhere.

""We should work more in Africa, SEA (South East Asia), Europe,"" he said.

""I don't want to die in the office, I'd rather die on the beach,"" Ma said on Thursday during an event at a World Economic Forum summit in the Chinese coastal city of Tianjin.

1155,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Trump's Early Trade-War Advantage May Be Slipping by the Day,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump may find it harder to claim victory over China the longer his trade war runs, even as he points to America’s ebullient economy and stock market as evidence he’s winning for now.
The president this week ordered his officials to slap tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods on Sept. 24. In retaliation, Beijing said it would hit $60 billion in U.S. products with duties. Yet even as the conflict escalates, the Trump administration signaled it would still be open to talks as soon as next week.
In confronting China, Trump is using the same strong-arm tactics he employed as a real-estate mogul, taking care to snuff out any suggestion he’s under pressure to strike a deal.
But Trump’s leverage may be short-lived. The president’s political power will be curtailed if the Democrats win the House in congressional elections in November, as they are favored to do. While the U.S. economy has so far appeared resilient to the trade war, the boost from this year’s tax cuts is expected to fade.
Meanwhile, China’s economy is showing some signs of cooling, but it’s still growing at a brisk pace, giving Beijing room to cushion the blow. President Xi Jinping, who cemented his hold on power in March with the repeal of term limits, has reason to be patient.
“The issue of leverage varies with time. If you ask the same question tomorrow, the calculus will have shifted ever so slightly in favor of China,” said Stephen Jen, CEO of Eurizon Slj Capital Ltd., an asset-management firm based in London. “If you ask the question a week from now, things will be even more in favor of China.”
Trump does have a point about how markets have reacted to the conflict. Since the president ordered his officials to ready tariffs on a first round of $50 billion of Chinese goods in March, U.S. stocks have risen about 10 percent, while Chinese equities have dropped more than 16 percent.
There’s a lot to like about the U.S. economy, which is enjoying its second longest expansion on record. Growth in the second quarter was the fastest in four years, while the unemployment rate of 3.9 percent is near its lowest since the 1960s.
China, by contrast, is showing signs of softness. Fixed-asset investment growth in the first eight months fell to the slowest pace since at least 1999. The yuan is down about 8 percent since Trump ordered tariffs.
“China should really wait another five years to stand up to the U.S.,” said Jen.
China’s economy was expected to slow as it relies less on debt and shifts to a growth model driven more by consumption, a shift touted Wednesday in a speech by Premier Li Keqiang. Beijing has already unveiled measures to shield itself against the trade war, including infrastructure spending and looser bank capital requirements. While high debt levels may constrain the ability to respond, Xi still has plenty of ways to ease the pain.
The U.S. has already used a lot of fiscal ammunition. The $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that took effect in February gave the economy a boost, but the IMF expects the stimulus to wear off by 2020, when growth will slow. It still sees China becoming the world’s biggest economy by 2030.
Xi has sweeping authority to conduct the trade war.
Meanwhile, Trump’s latest weekly approval rating is 38 percent, according to polling firm Gallup. His Republican party could lose control of the House in Nov. 6 congressional elections. Senior Democrats such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have urged Trump to keep up pressure on China, but Democrats are not guaranteed to back his tariffs.
“We actually have to deal with something called elections,” said Stefan Selig, managing partner at BridgePark Advisors LLC and a former senior trade official in the Obama administration. “Culturally, they are just going to be able to withstand more pain for a longer period of time.”
U.S. business opposition to the tariffs is growing. The administration says it’s trying to minimize the direct cost to consumers. Still, Trump has said he’s willing to slap duties on effectively all Chinese imports, suggesting it’s only a matter of time before mobile phones and other popular items get hit.
“The idea that you’re going to punch China in the face or otherwise make China look weak is not a recipe for resolving our differences,” said Jake Colvin, vice president for global trade at the National Foreign Trade Council in Washington. “The quicker both sides realize that the current situation is untenable, and that they need to come to an agreement that allows each side to see the value, the better off we’ll all be.”

1157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",The Bigger Question for Stock Investors in Japan's Upcoming Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- At first glance, Japan’s ruling party leadership election may seem like the dampest of squibs. It’s widely expected that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will claim victory, and in doing so, be in a position to lead the country for three more years.
But under the surface, stock investors are looking at a different question. They want to know how well Abe’s rival, the former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba, will fare, even in defeat. And at least some of them are hoping that he’ll get crushed.
A narrow win for Abe would send a negative signal as Ishiba’s influence within the ruling party would increase, according to UBS Wealth Management. That would put the era of full-throttle stimulus policies ""on its last legs,"" according to Toru Ibayashi, head of Japanese equities at the money manager, who points out Ishiba’s perceived hawkish stance on monetary and fiscal policy.
""The market seems to be underestimating the impact if Ishiba garners” a lot of votes, Ibayashi said in an interview. ""That would be the beginning of the end of Abenomics.""
Abe faces off against Ishiba today in the Liberal Democratic Party presidential election, with the winner getting the role for a three-year term and the prime minister post. They’ll be competing for 810 votes, 405 from the party’s lawmakers and the same number apportioned to its rank-and-file members.
Ibayashi even has a number in mind. If Ishiba gets more than 270 votes, or 33 percent of the total, that would be bad news for stocks, he said. A recent poll of LDP party members and supporters by the Yomiuri newspaper showed he’s expected to win 36 percent of their votes.
Ishiba has repeatedly emphasized the importance of having a balanced budget. In August, he said he’d manage the economy with ""fiscal balance"" in mind. In an interview with Bloomberg last year, he said Japan must stick to its target of having such a balance by fiscal 2020. He added it would be a ""problem"" if the current unprecedented easing policy continued indefinitely.
""Ishiba has quite strong fiscal discipline,” which would be negative for stocks, Naoki Kamiyama, chief strategist at Nikko Asset Management Co., said in an interview. ""That’s the only thing we know.""
How much support Abe has is ""almost the same thing as support for the Bank of Japan,"" Ibayashi said. That’s all the more reason why the market would be nervous about bigger-than-expected support for Ishiba, he added. The bank has been carrying out an unprecedented program of monetary easing under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
The benchmark Topix index is down 1.8 percent this year, after falling by as much as 8.4 percent amid huge net selling by foreign investors. The market has been whipsawed by everything from concerns about trade wars to the impact of next year’s sales-tax increase.
In that context, UBS’s Ibayashi says, he knows what he’ll be looking at on Sept. 20.
“Two hundred and seventy is the magic number,” he said. “It may be the clear beginning of the end.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York on Wednesday dismissed a criminal case brought against General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in 2015 over the largest U.S. automaker's handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan approved a request filed Monday by federal prosecutors to dismiss the two-count criminal information.
In 2015, GM entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York after the Detroit automaker was charged with concealing information from government officials, and wire fraud. GM agreed to pay a $900 million fine and accept three years of oversight by an independent monitor.
Federal prosecutors in New York told Nathan in a letter Monday that GM had complied with the terms of the agreement.
GM has paid more than $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements, including the fine, over faulty ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes. The defect was linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries, and prompted a recall that began in February 2014 of 2.6 million vehicles.
GM spokesman David Caldwell said in an emailed statement on Wednesday the government had finished monitoring the company.
GM has made substantial safety improvements over the last few years and added a new product safety structure, Caldwell added.
No individuals were criminally charged, but Chief Executive Mary Barra fired 15 people, including eight executives, over the issue. Barra said last year the ignition recall was ""a moment in time where the company committed deeply to safety.""
Federal officials said in 2015 that GM concealed the deadly defect and could have significantly reduced the risk by improving its key design for less than $1 dollar per vehicle.
In October 2017, GM agreed to pay $120 million to resolve ignition switch claims from 49 states. The states said GM knew as early as 2004 that the ignition switch posed a safety defect because it could cause airbag non-deployment, but company officials decided it was not a safety concern and delayed recalls.
The issue prompted an industrywide jump in recalls in 2014 to an all-time high and cast a spotlight on GM's safety record as Barra testified before the U.S. Congress.

GM still faces some pending civil lawsuits over the ignition switch issue, including some economic loss claims.

South Korea’s individual investors are emerging as staunch defenders of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. against bearish institutional Korean firms and foreign sellers as the tech giant faces an uncertain outlook.
Overseas stock pickers and South Korean institutions have sold almost a combined $7 billion net worth of Samsung stock this year, just as domestic individuals have bought $6.2 billion in the electronics giant, according to flow data compiled by Bloomberg from Korea Exchange. Samsung is the Korean company that’s the most sold among foreigners and institutions, while it’s the biggest buy for domestic retail investors, the data show.
“If you’re a global investor right now the question is, ‘I’ve run tech meaningfully for the last five years, does it make sense for me to start rotating to other opportunities?’ And I think you’re seeing this,” Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking with Union Bancaire Privee, said in an interview in Hong Kong. The firm managed 128.4 billion Swiss francs ($133 billion) at the end of June.
As for domestic retail investors, many are sticking with the name and betting on its long-term growth, said Kim Nam-su, prime broker at Samsung Securities’ wealth-management unit in Gangnam, Seoul. A 50-for-1 stock split earlier this year also may have encouraged some buying.
“Those who bought Samsung Electronics are long-term investors not swayed by concerns about the memory-chip industry,” Kim said. “Some of them bought the stock before the stock was split, believing it could rise with new inflow.”

Samsung, which by itself accounts for about a fifth of the benchmark Kospi Index, has lost 9.4 percent in 2018 after almost doubling in value over the past two years. The company’s key semiconductor business is under increasing pressure amid persistent concern that slowing demand for smartphones also means weaker chip sales.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts removed Samsung from their conviction list last week, warning the supply and pricing issues that have plagued the wider industry all year may worsen into 2019. Last year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) faced “strong” pushback from some investors after its analysts lowered Samsung’s rating to equal-weight and slashed its price target.
“Everyone is cautious about Samsung Electronics,” said Hyun Choi, head of equities at Barings Korea. “As the biggest stock in South Korea, it is being affected by so many factors: not just the semiconductor industry’s circumstances, but also macro issues like inflow into emerging markets and the trade war.”
Competitive Edge
Interestingly, one of the beneficiaries of this shift may be Samsung’s smaller chip competitor, SK Hynix Inc. Foreign investors have bought a net $1 billion in the stock this year, the most of any company in the Kospi for the group, while Korean institutions and individuals are both net sellers.
That may be due to SK Hynix being more attractive to short-term investors, who have traded the shares within a fairly tight range and not on long-term growth expectations, said Samsung Securities’ Kim. Since the end of June, foreigners have sold more than $680 million net of the company’s stock.
Analysts are nowhere close to going full-bear on Samsung yet -- the stock has 42 buy ratings, three holds and only one sell, with a consensus price target of 65,643 won implying a 42 percent increase from Wednesday’s closing price.
“Some people say the stock may fall up to 15 percent more from the current level, considering DRAM prices continue to fall next year,” said Park Sung-shin, a fund manager at KTB Asset Management Co. “I think differently. The memory-chip industry is different from what we’ve seen in the past.”
Industry consolidation means fewer players have greater control over supply and demand, and Samsung is near its bottom and unlikely to fall more than 5 percent from current levels, Park said."

1163,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","Bond Traders Move Closer to Fed, Ramping Up 2019 Rate Hike Bets","(Bloomberg) -- For the world’s biggest bond market, 2019 is turning into a battleground for bets on the path of U.S. monetary policy. Treasury yields are rising across the curve, even as skepticism lingers about whether the Federal Reserve will hike as aggressively as policy makers anticipate.
Two-year U.S. rates on Wednesday climbed to levels unseen in more than a decade, while a selloff in the past two days is driving the benchmark 10-year yield above 3 percent and near its highs for the year. Investors in recent weeks have moved closer to the Federal Reserve’s projected path of three rate hikes next year and are now pricing in two, following expected increases next week and in December.
The resolution of the debate over the course of interest rates could prove to be a slow meeting in the middle of the two camps. But it may also deliver a painful blow to bond bulls or even the Fed’s credibility. Either way, the standoff sets the stage for heightened turbulence in debt markets after one of the most subdued stretches in decades.
“There’s a view that the Fed has largely converged to the market,” said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). “From 2012 to 2016, that was true. The period before that it wasn’t true, and the period since then it hasn’t been true.”
Hatzius is among Wall Street economists predicting the Fed will tighten even faster than policy makers indicate. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Royal Bank of Canada all forecast four increases in 2019.
Traders ramped up bets on 2019 Fed hikes after labor-market data released Sept. 7 showed wages jumped in August by the most since the end of the recession.
On Wednesday, the three-month London interbank offered rate jumped by the most since May, while the two-year Treasury yield touched 2.81 percent, the highest since July 2008. The 10-year rate rose to just over 3.09 percent.
Inflation Doubts
Yet even with recent moves, some still doubt that inflation will be enough of a threat to warrant as much tightening as officials have projected. That view gained traction after unexpectedly tame consumer-price figures last week.
“The bond market doesn’t believe in the inflation story,” said James Camp, director of fixed-income at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees about $34 billion. “This sets up for a very interesting 2019.” He’s holding 10-year Treasuries and sees the Fed pausing in 2019 after two more hikes this year, starting with next week’s decision.
The market has been reluctant to price in the Fed’s projected path since this tightening cycle began in 2015, especially after the central bank fell short on delivering the multiple hikes it projected for 2016, eventually moving only once. The dynamic started to change ahead of the March 2017 tightening, when traders had to scramble to price in a hike in response to Fed signals.
Derivative traders see the funds rate only reaching about 2.8 percent by the end of 2020, whereas in June, the median of Fed officials’ forecast was for 3.4 percent.
Investors, for their part, may be signaling dimming confidence in the durability of the economic expansion in the face of rising rates and trade tensions.
The gap between 2-year and 10-year yields last month shrank to as little as 18 basis points, and though the curve has steepened back to around 26 basis points amid in an uptick this week in 10-year yields, the curve remains close to its flattest level since 2007. Back then was the last time the market saw a curve inversion, a phenomenon that has been a reliable predictor of recession.
“The market is starting to price in a Fed pause” around mid-2019, said Gene Tannuzzo, a fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.
2019 Doubts
Bob Parker, a member of Quilvest Wealth Management’s investment committee, predicts economic growth will level off, so the Fed “actually does very little next year.” Jerome Schneider at Pacific Investment Management Co. sees two hikes in 2019, as does Anne Mathias, a strategist at Vanguard.
Part of the reason Camp expects the Fed to stand down next year is to avoid inverting the curve.
New York Fed President John Williams has pushed back on that sentiment.
""We need to make the right decision based on our analysis of where the economy is and where it’s heading in terms of our dual-mandate goals,” he said this month. “If that were to require us to move interest rates up to the point where the yield curve was flat or inverted, that would not be something I would find worrisome on its own.""
What it comes down to is that the Fed and markets differ on when rate hikes will start crimping growth. The Fed forecasts policy becoming restrictive by the end of 2019, with the funds rate at 3.1 percent.
So one way or another the gap in views will have to be bridged. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will have more opportunities to do that and head off potential market volatility starting in January, when he’ll begin holding press conferences after every meeting, Schneider said.
“The question is, is there a moment of reckoning coming?” said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. “Will Jay Powell have to at some point stand up in front of markets and say, ‘Hey guys, you have this wrong, you need to price more out the curve.’
“But to communicate that is quite tricky because a hawkish surprise risks upsetting stock markets,” Brooks said. “And that risks upsetting some of his main constituents, including in the White House.”

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 04:53PM ET</span>","What sector overhaul means for tech stocks, Wall Street","By Alden Bentley
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The most significant changes to Wall Street's broad industry sectors since 1999 will take effect Monday, reclassifying many of the hot growth companies that have been nearly synonymous with the ""tech"" rally that has fueled the stock bull market.
While any immediate market impact will be hard to gauge, investors are preparing for volatility in stocks being moved from one industry to another when some investors readjust portfolios. 
It may affect how mutual fund managers chose stocks and force passively-managed sector exchange traded funds (ETFs) to reallocate billions of dollars. 
WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES?
S&P Dow Jones Indices is reorganizing the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). 
It means none of the so-called FANG stocks -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - will remain in the S&P's information technology sector (SPLRCT). 
Facebook and Alphabet will leave tech to join an expanded S&P telecom group, renamed communications services, along with  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR). They will accompany AT&T Inc (N:T),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and  CenturyLink  Inc (N:CTL), which made up the old telecommunications services sector (SPLRCL).
Apple Inc (O:AAPL), part of the extended FAANG group, will stay in the S&P technology index. It will account for 20 percent of the index's market capitalization, up from 16 percent, once Alphabet and Facebook leave. 
Other names moving from technology to communications services include  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) and videogame makers  Electronic Arts Inc  (O:EA) and Activision Blizzard Inc (O:ATVI). 
Netflix will move to communications services from the consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD), where it resided alongside Amazon.com, which will remain. Consumer discretionary heavyweights Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) will also move to the new sector. 
For a table of affected stocks, see. 
S&P will make the changes after the close on Friday. MSCI, another index provider, will make the changes in November.
WHY IS IT HAPPENING? 
The changes are meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved. 
Maintained by S&P and MSCI since 1999 and widely used by portfolio managers, the taxonomy classifies companies across 11 sectors. The most recently created sector was real estate <.SPLRCR>, split off from financials (SPSY) in 2016. The move allowed an easier route to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs).
""The changes are a step towards acknowledging the convergence of telecommunications, media, and select internet companies and the overlapping services rendered by these companies, within the GICS Structure,"" S&P wrote in a note. 
UBS in a research paper said telecoms have moved away from voice telephony to focus on fixed and mobile broadband data that is increasingly bundled with video content.
""This business model looks a lot like what cable TV companies are offering,"" the investment bank said. 
Meanwhile, with only three constituents, the old telecom sector was only 2 percent of the S&P 500 ""making it somewhat of an afterthought for many investors.""
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 
Stocks being shifted account for about 8 percent of the S&P 500, and S&P sub-indexes will also reflect the changes on Monday. Select Dow Jones indexes will be affected, S&P said.
A higher weight in communication services and lower profile in technology will make sector composition more balanced, BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski wrote. 
The renamed communications services sector will include three out of four FANGs, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market in recent years.
While the technology sector's importance in the S&P 500 will fall from 26 percent to 20 percent, the changes will also increase the weight of smaller tech companies. After Apple,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Visa Inc  (N:V),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) will round out the S&P tech index's largest five components.
HOW ARE INVESTORS POSITIONING?
UBS said it did not expect the reclassification to significantly impact the trading of the three sectors. ""It has been well telegraphed by S&P and MSCI and market participants have been preparing for these changes for several months."" 
Leading fund provider Vanguard Group started transitioning its sector ETFs in the June quarter, while  State Street  Global Advisors (N:STT) has already launched a new fund tracking communication services. 
Some active portfolio managers may ignore the new sector classifications. A number of telecommunications funds, for instance, compare their performance to utilities indexes or other benchmarks that will not be affected by the GICS changes.
A technology mutual fund could hold Facebook even though it is no longer in the information technology index that the fund is measured against. And some funds use their own customized sector groupings that differ from GICS. 
""Managers are going to be reluctant followers (of the sector changes) because they're still going to want to choose stocks that fit their criteria,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.
Still, many such rule-based investment managers are constrained by contracts or company policy from deviating too much from specific sectors, according to Rosenbluth. 
""For some funds, being significantly underweight or overweight a sector that's as sizeable as communication services, or as sizeable as tech or consumer discretionary, is going to be problematic ... so I do think there are going to be stock movements as a result of this."" 

(This version of the story corrects paragraph five and six to clarify that only two FANG stocks were in information technology sector.)

1165,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 04:44PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Will Pot Stocks Continue to Cause Investor Nausea?
Cannabis stocks have been dominating momentum trading talk and tomorrow’s action will likely garner lots of headlines after Tilray’s head-spinning move today.
Tilray soared in premarket trading on a CNBC appearance, nearly doubled on a short squeeze and then crashed in the last hour of the session, forcing several halts in trading due to volatility.
In the end, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) finished up about 38% at around $214 from an intraday high of around $300 and a low of around $150.
The inflows into marijuana stocks have been astounding of late.
During its rally earlier in the day, the stock was up more than 600% since its July IPO, giving it a market cap ahead of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and CBS (NYSE:CBS).
The strong bull run in the sector started when Corona beer owner Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested about $4 billion in  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC), resulting in a fever to own other stocks in the space before the next big deal.
2. Existing Home Sales, Philly Fed Seen Rising
The housing data saga of the week continues with the release of existing home sales numbers at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
So far, the numbers have been mixed.
The National Association of Home Builder’s September housing market index held steady, beating expectations for a small decline. And housing starts posted a much-stronger-than-expected rise in for August.
But building permits, an indicator of future activity, showed an August decline that was much larger than forecast.
On average, economists expect that existing home sales rose 0.3% in August to an annual adjusted rate of 5.35 million.
In addition, the Philly Fed manufacturing index arrives at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with economists predicting a jump to 17 for September from 11.9 in August.
At the same time there will be the weekly initial jobless claims figures, with the market looking for a small rise to 210,000 from the week before.
3. Chip Investors Await Micron Numbers
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) reports after trading tomorrow and will give investors more insight into whether the chip sector is heading from a cyclical downtrend.
The stock has already been hit by warnings and indications from other companies that demand in the memory market is waning.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example, warned that revenue had dried up for chips used for cryptocurrency mining, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been beset by delays.
Shares of Micron have fallen to about $45 from about $60 three months ago.
Sales will be the focus, with analysts, on average, predicting $8.25 billion for the quarter. Investors will be particularly keen to see the split between DRAM for PCs, where a big jump is expected, and NAND flash memory.
Wall Street forecasts a profit of $3.32 per share."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.61%. The S&P 500 rose 0.13%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.08%.
The 10-year Treasury Note yield rose to its highest level since May, lifting bank shares and locking in a day of gains on Wall Street.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America NYSE:BAC) closed around 3% higher.
Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
In contrast, utilities, which serve as a bond proxy, fell sharply as a rise in bond yields made them less attractive to income-seeking investors.
Sentiment on stocks was also helped by easing investor fears that the recent round of tariffs launched by the United States and China would set both nations on a path to a full-blown trade war.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday trade disputes ""need to be worked out through consultation,"" and stressed the importance of ""upholding the basic principles of multilateralism and free trade.""
China said Tuesday it would impose new tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion on Sept. 24. The trade barb arrived after the Trump administration announced the U.S. will impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods next week.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stocks, which have been swayed by trade-war tensions given their significant exposure to China, rallied to end the day higher.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell nearly 1% as the European Union opened a preliminary anti-trust investigation on concerns the retailer may gaining a competitive advantage by using data it gathers from third-party sellers on its platform.
The e-commerce giant pared some losses moments before the close on a report of plans to open up to 3,000 cashierless stores by 2021.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dropped 1.3% as it raised its quarterly dividend nearly 10%.
Energy, meanwhile, also played a role in lifting the broader markets, as oil prices surged on data showing domestic oil supplies fell to multi-year lows.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose by 1.8% to settle at $71.12 a barrel.
In corporate news, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock ended the day 38% higher after rallying as much as 90% on a short-squeeze and positive remarks from the company's CEO in an interview with CNBC. The stock had to be halted from trading on several occasions in volatile trading.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Delta joins United, JetBlue in hiking U.S. baggage fees to $30","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) Inc, the second-largest U.S. airline, on Wednesday joined other major airlines in hiking domestic flight baggage fees by $5 per bag to $30.
The price hike follows similar moves by United Continental Holdings Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp in August and comes as Congress is considering whether to require the U.S. Transportation Department to assess whether airline baggage and ticket change fees are ""reasonable and proportional.""
Delta, United and JetBlue are now charging $30 for the first checked bag on domestic routes, up from $25 previously, and $40 for the second bag, up from $35.
Airlines have cited rising costs as a concern, with high fuel prices and bumps in salaries and benefits for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics pushing up operating expenses.
U.S. airlines’ revenues from baggage and reservation change fees increased from $5.7 billion in 2010 to $7.5 billion in 2017. Other fees are not reported to regulators.
United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz defended the price hikes last week, saying they were the first increases in eight years. Munoz said the airline would use some of the added fees to reinvest in operations. 
Southwest Airlines Co, the No. 4 U.S. airline, has said it would continue to allow passengers to check two bags and does not charge reservation change fees.
U.S. House of Representatives and Senate negotiators have been holding lengthy talks on a compromise bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, which could be unveiled as early as this week. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to extend the FAA's operating authority.
In May, the U.S. Transportation Department opposed provisions in a bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee that would require new rules prohibiting unreasonable airline fees, arguing it would mark a return to the pre-1978 era before airline deregulation.
American Airlines Group Inc Chief Executive Doug Parker told reporters last week that if Congress moved to regulate change fees, the No.1 U.S. airline would likely stop selling nonrefundable tickets that could be changed to a new flight. ""That's where I think we would end up,"" he said.
American has not followed its competitors in raising baggage fees.
Airlines for America, an airline trade group, has said the fee provision would result in “government-mandated price controls” and should be rejected.

A Senate aide involved in the talks predicted the fee provision would not be included in the compromise bill but would include other consumer protections such as requiring the Transportation Department to set minimum standards for seat size.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 03:52PM ET</span>",SEC sues U.S. breast-implant company's ex-CEO after stock dive,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday sued the founder and former chief executive of  Sientra Inc  (O:SIEN) for fraudulently concealing problems with his company's breast and other implants as it was raising $61.4 million in a public stock offering.
Hani Zeini, 54, was accused of letting the offering close on Sept. 23, 2015, despite having learned three days earlier from the chief executive of the company's sole supplier that European implant sales would be suspended because contamination had been detected in an audit of manufacturing procedures.
Sientra's share price sank 52.9 percent on Sept. 24, 2015, to $9.70 from $20.58, after it disclosed that the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency had suspended the certificate needed for the supplier, Brazil's Silimed, to sell the implants.
Zeini could not immediately be reached for comment, and a lawyer for him could not immediately be identified. 
The SEC said Zeini had hid ""damaging"" details from ""every other professional"" working on his Santa Barbara, California-based company's 3 million share offering, including its chief financial officer, directors, lawyers, auditors and bankers, and tried to cover his tracks after it was done.
""Zeini acted knowingly, recklessly and without reasonable care,"" the complaint said.
The SEC is seeking a civil fine and an officer and director ban for Zeini. It filed its lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, on Wednesday said bond prices across the U.S. Treasury yield curve could fall if the 30-year yield closes above 3.25 percent twice in a row.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) and 30-year Treasury bond (US30YT=RR) both hit four-month highs early Wednesday. The 10-year yield was currently trading around 3.08 percent and the 30-year around 3.22 percent. 
Gundlach told Reuters he was still forecasting 6 percent on the 10-year yield by the next presidential election or a year after. 
""I first made that statement in July 2016 when the overwhelming consensus view was the 10-year was soon headed to 1 percent,"" he said. ""So the observation is right a little over two years later with 10s a little over 3 percent.""
He added: ""My 6 percent by 2021 call is perfectly on track. No reason at all to change it. A move soon to higher yields would be signaled by the 30-year closing two days in a row over 3.25 percent.""

Last week, Gundlach likened debt-financed U.S. budget deficits to Miracle-Gro plant food and remarked that the benefits of the ballooning deficit, stemming from tax cuts, were not permanent. On Wednesday, Gundlach said, ""The deficit is insane. A truly strong economy produces a fiscal surplus.""

1175,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Mexico's Upstart Stock Exchange Is Betting on Private Equity Exits,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico’s upstart stock exchange needs private equity to go public.
The Bolsa Institucional de Valores, the bourse known as Biva that began operations in July, is trying to gain market share from the dominant Bolsa Mexicana de Valores by focusing on private equity managers ready to exit their investments and sell shares. The industry has grown 15 percent annually over the past decade, according to a report by El Financiero.
“The story of private equity is very recent in Mexico,” Biva Chief Executive Officer Maria Ariza said in an interview at Bloomberg’s offices in Mexico City. “Companies are starting to mature, they’re starting to leave, and they’re starting to look for an opportunity to exit their investments. Ideally, one of the ways to do that is through the capital markets.”
Companies controlled by private-equity firms tend to already have institutional funding and understand the transparency requirements they’ll have to meet, according to Ariza. She says the exchange is also trying to make it easier for smaller, family-owned companies to list themselves. Mexico’s public equity markets are dominated by large, often international firms.
The new exchange, which went live on July 25, has struggled to make headway against the BMV. Its share of trading volume in Mexico has ranged anywhere from 0.3 percent to 15 percent over the past month.
To lure companies to list on the exchange, Ariza said the smaller bourse can offer more individual service, lower costs and technology that it licenses from New York’s Nasdaq.
To attract traders, Biva plans to create a new platform that will make shorting stocks easier, though Ariza declined to provide a time frame. She said the exchange is also working with high-frequency and hedge funds in an attempt to attract their business.
Ariza is a former private-equity executive, having led an industry association in Mexico for five years before joining the stock exchange in April. Earlier this month, she scored a win by persuading Mexican lender Credito Real to switch a 700 million peso ($37 million) bond offering from the Bolsa Mexicana to Biva. Private equity manager LIV Capital also handed Biva a small win, with plans to move a recently issued development equity certificate fund -- known as a CKD -- to Biva from the Bolsa Mexicana effective Sept. 21.
Analysts at Banco Santander’s Mexican unit have said that Biva could eventually capture as much as 28 percent of the larger bourse’s revenue. Jose-Oriol Bosch, the CEO of the 120-year-old exchange, told Mexican news agency Notimex this month that his exchange would revise its prices and fees in response to the competition.
But to capture more market share, Biva needs more companies to list, and so far, the pipeline is uncertain. Ariza says that some initial public offerings can be expected over the coming months, but declined to offer specifics. The company seeks to increase the total trading volume in Mexico by as much as 30 percent over the next five years.
“The idea behind Biva is to deepen the market,” Ariza said. “Both in the number of companies that are participating today, as well as the number of individual investors that can participate.”"

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 01:17PM ET</span>",Belgian union rejects Ryanair offer ahead of planned strike,"By Daphne Psaledakis
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The union representing Ryanair (I:RYA) cabin crew in Belgium has rejected an offer from the Irish airline ahead of a planned one-day strike across five countries on Sept. 28, the union said on Wednesday.
Separately, European pilots threatened new strikes against Ryanair if talks with unions did not progress more quickly.
The company's shares have fallen around 9 percent this year, but gained about 1 percent on Wednesday, a day before shareholders were set to meet at the annual general meeting. 
Europe's biggest budget airline offered to follow Belgian employment law from March 2020 for Ryanair contracted employees, seeking to address one of the major complaints over the company's policy toward staff under Irish contracts.
However, the Belgian union, CNE, said that would only help about half of its workers, as Ryanair had also been hiring using recruiter Crewlink, which issues its own contracts.
The union said the offer was an ""unacceptable"" attempt to divide workers in order to buy time ahead of the planned strike.
""It's a deception on the part of Ryanair,"" CNE spokesman Yves Lambot told Reuters.
The threatened strike by cabin crew in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain is aimed at pressuring shareholders set to meet on Thursday to address Ryanair's labor agreements, union officials announced last week.
The 24-hour strike is planned for Sept. 28 and unions will strike once a month until their demands are met. 
The Belgian union met Ryanair officials before announcing the strike and received an offer on Tuesday evening, Lambot said. 
Ryanair stood by its statement last week that, even if there is a strike, it expects a significant majority of its cabin crew in the five countries to work normally, as they have during previous strikes.
The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said on Wednesday that it expected industrial unrest at Ryanair across Europe to continue for the foreseeable future.
""The industrial unrest in Ryanair across Europe and among pilots and cabin crew is, in my opinion, likely to continue for the foreseeable future,"" BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.
The German pilots’ union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) also issued a similar statement.
BALPA called on Ryanair shareholders to replace CEO Michael O’Leary and Chairman David Bonderman at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. 
The statement echoed the European Cockpit Association, which represents pilots in Europe, and also called on Wednesday for shareholders to pave the way for a change in the management and board of the airline, saying industrial unrest was more likely in the future.
Separately, Swedish Ryanair pilots urged shareholders to ""immediately replace the current leadership and management at your annual general meeting.""
""We have lost all confidence in the current leadership and management and their ability to guide the company in a unionized environment,"" the statement said.
A senior Ryanair executive said on Tuesday that CEO Michael O'Leary would continue at the company's helm for at least five more years. 

In another setback for the airline, a Spanish judge has ruled a former Ryanair pilot should have been considered an employee and not an independent contractor.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials Average rose on Wednesday, helped by upbeat housing data and a gain for bank stocks driven by rising Treasury yields, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was weighed by a drop in Microsoft.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) moved back above the symbolic 3 percent mark on Tuesday and hit its highest in four months on Wednesday, while two-year rates (US2YT=RR) reached 2.8 percent, the highest in over a decade. 
Rises in market interest rates tend to boost banks and the S&P financial sector (SPSY) rose 1.64 percent, lifted by a 2.6 percent increase in shares of JPMorgan & Chase (N:JPM). The KBW bank index (BKX) was up 1.90 percent.
Also helping lift yields was data that showed U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in August. 
When yields are high, investors tend to favor bonds over defensive sectors such as utilities, consumer staples and real estate, which promise high dividends. 
""The yield curve seems to be holding steady with the 10-year above 3 percent, which bodes well for the financial group and investors are seeing broader economic stability,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equities strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
The Dow Industrials (DJI) was about 0.6 percent away from a fresh record high after touching its highest since Jan. 29. 
The technology sector (SPLRCT) dropped 0.50 percent, led by a 1.9 percent decline in Microsoft (O:MSFT) and a 0.2 percent decline in shares of Apple (O:AAPL). 
Microsoft on Tuesday raised its quarterly dividend by about 10 percent, but  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the hike was below the company's 12-month trailing operating income growth. 
Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. The Dow Industrials (DJI) was boosted by a 2.5 percent gain in  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and 1.7 percent rise in Boeing (N:BA).
But the utilities (SPLRCU) fell 1.71 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. 
At 12:49 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 191.94 points, or 0.73 percent, at 26,438.90, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 2.79 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,907.10 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 31.21 points, or 0.39 percent, at 7,924.90. 
U.S.-China trade spat continues to weigh on the minds of analysts and investors but the broad conclusion from this week's exchange of blows was that China may be running out of options, given how much less it imports from the United States.
""We are not currently at a trade escalation, we are at status quo,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. 
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) was up 2.5 percent, after Reuters reported that the company was in advanced talks with several financial companies to spin off its app, which sells complex financial products to retail investors. 
 Copart Inc  (O:CPRT) tumbled 16.5 percent, the most on the S&P, after the online vehicle auction company fell short of profit estimates, hurt by higher costs from the impact of Hurricane Harvey.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian oil firm seeks dollar alternative amid U.S. sanctions threat - traders,"By Gleb Gorodyankin and Olga Yagova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil producer Surgutneftegaz (MM:SNGS) is pushing buyers to agree to pay for oil in euros instead of dollars if the need arises, apparently as insurance against possible tougher U.S. sanctions, traders who deal with the firm told Reuters.
Russia has been subject to Western sanctions since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, but Washington has threatened to impose extra sanctions, citing what it has called Moscow's ""malign"" activities abroad.
The prospect that causes most alarm for Russian firms is inclusion on a Treasury Department blacklist that effectively cuts them off from conducting transactions in dollars, the lifeblood of the global oil industry.
Surgutneftegaz, whose chief executive Vladimir Bogdanov is already on a U.S. blacklist in a personal capacity, declined to respond to Reuters questions.
""We do not comment on our commercial activity,"" said the company, Russia's fourth largest by output.
To date, Russia's oil industry has been able to weather Western sanctions. In response to restricted access to Western finance and technology, firms have switched to borrowing from Russian state banks and developed their own technology.
Most Russian oil majors, including Rosneft and Lukoil, also sell the lion's share of output via long-term contracts with clients, giving them more time to work out alternative forms of payment when the contracts expire.
But most of Surgutneftegaz's exports -- around 2 million tonnes per month -- is sold through monthly tenders on the spot market, the largest volumes by far among its Russian peers. So it would have only around 30 days to find alternative payment methods.
""AVOIDING PROBLEMS""
Six traders who regularly deal with Surgutneftegaz said the company had been asking buyers to agree to an addendum to their contracts stating that they accept the option of settling payments in euros.
According to a message sent by Surgutneftegaz to one of its customers asking them to sign the addendum, the oil company cited the need to ""avoid any possible problems with payment in USD."" Reuters has seen a copy of the message.
Three of the traders said Surgutneftegaz had already begun discussions with its partners last summer about the possibility of settling payments in euros.
But the company was now raising the issue with greater urgency, and had in some cases warned it would reject bids from buyers for cargoes of oil unless the buyers signed the addendum, according to four of the traders.
In its message to customers, Surgutneftegaz did not mention the risk of new sanctions, but two traders said from their interactions with the company it was clear to them that this was the reason behind the change.
""Surgut is afraid of sanctions,"" a source in a European oil major which has dealings with Surgutneftegaz told Reuters, on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
The U.S. government cannot forbid anyone from using dollars, but it can prevent U.S. banks from doing business with a sanctioned entity.
Most dollar-denominated transactions pass through the U.S. banking system, and those banks, to avoid violating sanctions, can refuse to handle money linked to blacklisted companies or individuals. 
It is not clear how widely the Russian oil sector is preparing for the possibility of tougher sanctions.
A source at Gazpromneft, Russia's third-biggest oil company by output, said most of its contracts already contained a clause on possible payments in non-dollar currencies.
A second source at the company said that when it is drafting supply contracts with customers for 2019, it will make sure they include a non-dollar payment option in all cases.
Gazpromneft was not immediately available to comment.
Several other oil firms also already have clauses in their contracts allowing non-dollar payments under some circumstances, said four industry sources.
TURNING UP THE HEAT
Washington's decision in April to include on its sanctions blacklist Russian firm Rusal, one of the world's biggest aluminum producers, signaled to Russian business that Washington was ratcheting up the pressure.
It was the first time a major Russian company with international partners had been blacklisted.
Some elements of the sanctions have been temporarily watered down, but Rusal's inclusion has disrupted its access to raw materials, led to the cancellation of some orders and prompted some foreign partners to sever ties. 
Washington has not spelled out when or how it plans to toughen sanctions further, but it has signaled that they are coming this year, partly in response to the poisoning in Britain of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.
Britain and its Western allies say Russian intelligence agents carried out the poisoning using a military-grade nerve agent, an allegation Moscow has denied. 
State Department official Manisha Singh said this month there would be a ""very severe second round of sanctions"" unless Russia meets a November deadline to comply with international chemical weapons law.
The source in the European oil major said Surgutneftegaz, in its push to arrange the option of payments in euros, was focused on what might happen in November.
There is no indication from Washington if Surgutneftegaz would be a target for the next round of sanctions.
But CEO Bogdanov was included on the Treasury Department list, published in January, of Russian oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more.
In April, the Treasury Department added Bogdanov to its ""Specially Designated National"" list, freezing any U.S. assets he owns and barring him from travel to the United States.

It said he was being blacklisted ""for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.""

PARIS (Reuters) - The boss of telecom group Orange's (PA:ORAN) online bank will resign in the next few weeks, three sources close to the matter told Reuters, underscoring operational challenges at the lender less than a year after its launch.
Andre Coisne had been hired to run and develop Orange Bank, which was formed after Orange acquired a majority stake in Groupama Banque in 2016. He had previously launched online banks in France for ING Direct and Credit Agricole's BforBank.
The nomination in May this year of a new group head for mobile financial services at Orange Bank, Paul de Leusse, precipitated Coisne's departure, as a new management structure is being prepared at the banking unit, two of the sources said.
Orange's Chief Executive Stephane Richard has championed the new division as a key driver for growth and a new way to attract customers as a price war continues to rage in France's telecoms market. 
Orange has set a goal to get two million bank customers within 10 years, or a quarter of France's online banking sector. 
But the group has declined to update the markets on its progress since February, when it said the service had a total of 100,000 clients. 
""Paul de Leusse came in with his team, perhaps Andre Coisne felt excluded from this new organization,"" one of the sources said. 
""The operational integration hasn't been done yet. The culture clash between Groupama and Orange hadn't been anticipated,"" another source said. 
De Leusse, a former chief financial officer at Credit Agricole's investment bank, is set to have broad authority over Orange Bank, with the aim of developing the service internationally, two of the sources said. 

Orange Bank is only present in France and offers customers services that include instant mobile payment, free debit card, current and savings accounts as well as consumer loans.

1192,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Peter Thiel-Backed Fund Hits the Jackpot With $12 Billion Tilray Stake,"(Bloomberg) -- The massive surge in pot stock Tilray Inc. has delivered a multi billion dollar windfall for a little-known private equity fund backed by investor Peter Thiel.
Privateer Holdings Inc., a Seattle-based fund started seven years ago to focus on the marijuana business, holds 76 percent of Tilray, a stake now worth more than $12 billion after the stock soared more than 10-fold from its July public offering.
Tilray, a Canadian company with just $20 million in revenue last year, has benefited from the surge in demand for pot stocks as Canada gears up to legalize the drug next month, and companies including Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. and  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc show interest in the sector.
Thiel’s Founders Fund became the first institutional investor in the cannabis industry through Privateer Holdings’ $75 million Series B financing round in December 2014, according to the company’s website.
Thiel, 50, was an early investor in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and is known for making unconventional investments in different industries. Founders Fund has also backed Airbnb Inc., Lyft Inc., Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc.
Tilray, based in the Vancouver Island town of Nanaimo, has drawn more interest than most, in part due to its listing on the Nasdaq, making it easier for U.S. investors and hedge funds to get a piece of the action. The limited number of shares available for trading may also be adding to the volatility, making it more expensive for skeptical investors to short the stock.
Citron Research said it remains short on Tilray, calling the stock’s surge “beyond comprehension” in a Tweet Wednesday.
Bigger Than American
Tilray has surpassed Canopy Growth Corp. as the world’s largest cannabis company, with a market value of more than $20 billion. Canopy, which added a New York listing in May, is worth $12 billion.
Tilray jumped another 38 percent to $214 at 10:25 a.m. in New York Wednesday, giving it a value higher than American Airlines Group Inc. Cowen & Co. took the company public in July at $17.
When Tilray’s unlisted Class 1 shares are included, Privateer’s holdings rise to almost 75 million shares, worth more than $15 billion.
Privateer’s partners include Brendan Kennedy, 46, who serves as Tilray’s chief executive officer, Michael Blue and Christian Groh. Kennedy and Blue are both graduates of Yale School of Management’s MBA program. Kennedy and Groh both formerly worked together at SVB Analytics, a non-bank affiliate of Silicon Valley bank.
Tilray, which has agreements to sell pot in Canadian pharmacies including Shoppers Drug Mart, has ambitious plans well beyond Canada. It’s focused on medicinal marijuana in 12 countries that span five continents.
“Our long-term vision is if a patient walks into any pharmacy in any country in the world that has legalized cannabis that patient should be able to obtain a Tilray product. That’s our global goal,” Kennedy said in an interview this week from New York.
Tilray is investing in production capacity in Portugal so it can supply products to the EU from within Europe, he said. The company also has its High Park brand for the recreational market in Canada, which has secured supply agreements with seven provinces and territories, Kennedy said. The company also has a deal to develop medicinal cannabis with the Canadian division of Novartis AG of Switzerland.
Kennedy said he’s not interested in getting taken over by a large consumer company. In a testament to the euphoria surrounding the space, he claimed the company may one day be worth more than $100 billion.
“I don’t want to get bought by AB-InBev or Diageo, I want to be that company,” he added.

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - A rally in European shares extended for a second day on Wednesday thanks to gains in trade-sensitive mining and autos stocks as investors saw a China-U.S. trade war approaching its endgame.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) and leading euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) both rose 0.3 percent to two-week highs with sentiment buoyed by hopes that the United States and China will return to the negotiating table after the latest tariff round. 
Washington and Beijing both announced fresh tariffs on reciprocal imports this week, though the measures were less severe than initially expected, bolstering hopes of a deal.
""Our base-case scenario sees both parties negotiating a settlement in the next 6–9 months,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategists said in their daily note to clients.
Caution however remained, with some investors still wary that U.S. President Donald Trump could seek to extend tariffs to all Chinese imports.
Earlier on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said his country would not engage in competitive currency devaluation and would not weaken the yuan to boost exports.
Basic materials (SXPP) were the biggest sectoral gainer, up 3.1 percent, after copper prices rose sharply as investors shrugged off the risks of an escalation of the U.S.-China trade row. 
It was the sector's best day in two months.
Heavyweight miners  Antofagasta  (L:ANTO) and  Anglo American  (L:AAL) rose 5.9 percent and 5.1 percent respectively.
Financials also provided support, although Danske Bank (CO:DABA) fell 3.4 percent following the resignation of its CEO and an updated on a money laundering probe that prompted the bank to cut its full-year outlook. 
MERGER
Progress in the planned merger between Linde and Praxair (NYSE:PX) drove shares in the German industrial gases group (DE:LIN1) up 7.8 percent, a top STOXX gainer. 
A source said Linde was set to sell additional assets to a consortium of Messer Group GmbH and CVC Capital Partners for about $200 million, moving closer to U.S. antitrust approval for the deal.
Belgian biopharma firm Argenx (BR:ARGX) sank 11.8 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after a share offering. 
Argenx offered 3.5 million American Depositary Shares at a 0.9 percent discount to Tuesday's close, for a gross raise of $300 million.
Elsewhere earnings updates drove share price moves.
 Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) fell 6.2 percent after the world's largest staffing firm said it has seen a slowdown in growth so far in the third quarter. Its fall also weighed Dutch peer  Randstad  (AS:RAND) down 5.1 percent. 
RBC Capital said Adecco's slowdown was bad news but added that the stock's valuation was cheap and that the company's end markets remained relatively robust. 
 Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) reported a 15 percent fall in half-year profits, sending its shares down 6.3 percent.
A solid update however lifted German automotive parts maker Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) up 3 percent. The company kept its guidance for overall sales this year thanks to stronger orders at its industrial division.

Its gains helped the autos sector (SXAP), which has been penalized this year by growing trade concerns, rise 1.5 percent.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>","EU says McDonald's, Luxembourg tax deal not illegal","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - McDonald's (N:MCD) avoided having to repay millions of euros in back taxes after EU antitrust regulators said that its tax deal with Luxembourg was not illegal, citing quirks in the Grand Duchy's bilateral tax treaty with the United States.
The decision by the European Commission came after a three-year long investigation, part of its crackdown on illegal sweetheart deals between EU governments and multinationals that has resulted in Apple (O:AAPL), Starbucks (O:SBUX) and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) paying billions of euros in back taxes.
The Commission said McDonald's tax deal was in line with national tax laws and the Luxembourg-U.S. double taxation treaty.
""Our in-depth investigation has shown that the reason for double non-taxation in this case is a mismatch between Luxembourg and U.S. tax laws, and not a special treatment by Luxembourg. Therefore, Luxembourg did not break EU state aid rules,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
""Of course, the fact remains that McDonald's did not pay any taxes on these profits – and this is not how it should be from a tax fairness point of view,"" she said.
The investigation had focused on McDonald's Luxembourg-based subsidiary Europe Franchising which receives royalties from franchisees in Europe, Ukraine and Russia.
Luxembourg in a 2009 tax ruling said the company did not have to pay corporate taxes as its profits would be taxed in the United States. In a second tax ruling, the Grand Duchy said that the company was no longer required to prove that its royalty income was subject to U.S. taxation.
""HAPPY MEAL""
The Commission said 70 companies benefited from the bilateral tax treaty but were not being investigated. In June this year, Luxembourg presented draft legislation to avoid double non-taxation. 
Luxembourg said in a statement that it welcomed the Commission's recognition of the steps it had taken to avoid similar cases in future. It had been ordered to claw back millions from Engie (PA:ENGIE), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Fiat (MI:FCHA) in the last three years.
""We pay the taxes that are owed and, from 2013-2017, McDonald’s companies paid more than $3 billion just in corporate income taxes in the European Union with an average tax rate approaching 29 percent,"" McDonald's said. ""We will continue to invest in Europe and expect to create 50,000 new jobs over the next four years.""
Sven Giegold, a Greens lawmaker at the European Parliament who has been pushing for more action to tackle tax loopholes, criticized the EU decision. 
""Luxembourg and other EU countries are serving McDonald´s a happy meal with tax loopholes, and taxpayers must pay the bill,"" said Giegold.
The ruling is a recognition by enforcers that they cannot make unlimited use of their state aid powers on taxation issues, said Natura Garcia, a partner at law firm Linklaters.

""This is a welcome development given the wider context of other state aid investigations into tax rulings and will give some comfort to companies which have obtained similar tax rulings in Luxembourg or elsewhere in the EU,"" she said.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",Britain's Tesco takes on discount rivals with new Jack's chain,"By James Davey
CHATTERIS, England (Reuters) - Britain's biggest retailer  Tesco  (L:TSCO) is going head-to-head with fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl on price with a new grocery store it says will be the cheapest in town. 
Chief Executive Dave Lewis unveiled Tesco's new Jack's format on Wednesday, saying it would sell 2,600 essential items including 1,800 Jack's-branded products. 
That compares with the thousands of goods on sale in its traditional supermarkets, and mimics the German chains' focus on simplicity and own-brands to keep costs down - a strategy that has seen them grab 13 percent of Britain's grocery market. 
Some 10-15 Jack's stores will open over the next six months, with the first two on Thursday - at Chatteris and Immingham in eastern England. 
Jack's is named after Jack Cohen, who in 1919 founded the business that became Tesco, and is a significant move by Lewis, who has rebuilt Tesco after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading.
But the limited number of openings and initial capital expenditure of about 25 million pounds ($33 million) disappointed some analysts, as media reports had said that up to 60 existing Tesco outlets could be converted.
""This is first and foremost about how we celebrate the centenary,"" Lewis told reporters at the Chatteris store, which was built as a Tesco supermarket but mothballed in 2015 when the group was in crisis. 
""We only have plans for 10-15. If we feel that customers are absolutely supportive of what we're doing then yes of course we have optionality going forward,"" he said.
And he played down Jack's' financial significance to the group: ""It's not a calculation that we're currently doing,"" he said.
Shares in Tesco were up 0.5 percent at 1515 GMT.
Patrick O’Brian, research director at GlobalData, had expected a bolder store opening schedule. ""Aldi and Lidl are unlikely to be too concerned about this opening salvo,"" he said.
CONSUMER ZEITGEIST 
Some Tesco investors were, however, thrilled.
""Jack's fits perfectly into the current consumer zeitgeist and will drive revenues as well as protecting margins across the Tesco group,"" said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management.
Aldi and Lidl have steadily grown market share in Britain since the 2008 financial crisis, chipping away at Tesco and its three biggest rivals Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW).
""The intention is for us to be the cheapest in town,"" said Lewis, adding Jack's could benefit from Tesco's buying power.
Eight out of ten of Jack's food and drink products are grown, reared or made in Britain. A large chicken is priced at 3.19 pounds, while four pints of semi skimmed milk will cost 1.09 pounds.
The stores will also stock some familiar major brands, such as Coca Cola, as well as a range of general merchandise on a ""When it's Gone, It's Gone"" basis.
Jack's stores will be a mixture of entirely new sites, sites adjacent to existing Tesco stores, and converted Tesco stores.
Tesco currently has a 27.4 percent share of Britain's grocery market, according to the latest industry data, although it could be overtaken by Sainsbury's proposed 7.3 billion pound takeover of Asda.
The tie-up between Tesco's two nearest competitors, which regulators on Wednesday said would be scrutinized in depth, is also driven, at least in part, by the rise of the discounters.
Britain's ""big four"" grocers are trying to adapt to changing habits, including the declining popularity of big weekly shops and the growth of online shopping.
They have cut prices and improved service, but analysts say that with sales at Aldi and Lidl growing at 10 percent each year it makes sense for Tesco to try to capture some of that growth. 
Analysts do, however, have concerns that Jack's could take sales from Tesco's existing stores - fears played down by Lewis. 
""I'd rather cannibalize myself than somebody else cannibalize me,"" he said.

""The single biggest threat facing the economy right now is the potential for a real trade war. I don't think we're there right now,"" Donohue told a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor.
But if Trump puts in place all the tariffs on Chinese goods that he has threatened and China fully retaliates and talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement break down, a damaging trade war would be underway, Donohue said.
Talks to update NAFTA, which U.S. President Donald Trump says is unfair to the United States, have been bogged down amid disagreements between Canadian and U.S. negotiators. Trump announced a side deal with Mexico last month. 
""If we can do something next week and get NAFTA done and we do it on a tripartite deal, if we make progress, by the way we are talking in Europe, if we can get that done...we can pretty quickly resolve some of this,"" Donohue said.
He added that trade differences with China will take longer to resolve, but he does not believe that the Trump administration wants its tariffs on Chinese goods to become permanent.
""No, I don't think the tariffs will be permanent,"" Donohue said, adding that this would ""screw the economy"" in ways similar to the 1930s Smoot-Hawley Tariff, referring to a protectionist law that raised thousands of U.S. tariffs and which many economists believe exacerbated the Depression.
""I don't believe the White House believes that's a positive thing to do.""
He added that it was better for the United States and China to continue talking rather than resorting to trade retaliation.
He suggested the Trump administration should consider alternative pressure tactics other than tariffs, such as limiting specific Chinese exports to the United States and leveraging the help of other U.S. trading partners to help change China's policies.
Regarding NAFTA, Donohue added that he did not believe it was possible to do a U.S. Mexico-only trade deal, because Congress prefers a trilateral deal and has not granted authority for a bilateral deal.
""If Canada doesn't come into the deal there is no deal,"" Donohue said of NAFTA. ""You can't do a deal with Mexico ... just because you had discussions with them. First of all Trade Promotion Authority for that is not there, so 435 members of the House and 100 members of the Senate would be free to edit the agreement.""

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 11:14AM ET</span>",Danske Bank CEO quits over $234 billion money laundering scandal,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) chief executive Thomas Borgen resigned on Wednesday after an investigation revealed payments totaling 200 billion euros ($234 billion) through its small Estonian branch, many of which the bank said were suspicious.
The Danish bank detailed compliance and control failings amid growing calls for a European Union crackdown on financial crime after a series of money laundering scandals which have attracted the attention of U.S. authorities.
""Even though I was personally cleared from a legal point of view, I hold the ultimate responsibility. There is no doubt that we as an organization have failed in this situation and did not live up to expectations,"" Borgen, who will stay on until a new CEO is appointed, told a press conference.
Borgen, 54, was in charge of Danske Bank's international operations, including Estonia, between 2009 and 2012.
While the report shed some light on the bank's activities in Estonia, investors are concerned whether the United States, which has placed sanctions on Russia, will punish it.
""As this is the largest money laundering scandal in European history, and  Danske Bank  is a major bank that sends dollars around the world, I imagine that this will certainly get the attention of the U.S. authorities,"" Bill Browder, the founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management who has campaigned against corruption in Russia, told Reuters.
Danish politicians were critical of Danske Bank for not revealing exactly how much money was allegedly laundered and not saying who was legally responsible for the lapses.
""It is deeply embarrassing that for so many years there have been transactions that should not have taken place. Much of it is expected to be money laundering, and that is simply not good enough by Danske Bank,"" business minister Rasmus Jarlov, who oversees Denmark's banking sector, told a press conference.
Danske Bank said in its summary of a report covering around 15,000 customers and 9.5 million payments between 2007 and 2015 that Borgen, Chairman Ole Andersen and the board ""did not breach their legal obligations"".
Andersen said the bank had made an assessment of whether it violated U.S. laws but declined to share its conclusion when asked at a press conference.
The Estonian non-resident portfolio's around 10,000 customers were registered in 90 different countries, with Russia, Britain, the British Virgin Islands and Finland the main ones, Danske Bank said, adding that around a third of them became clients of the branch in 2007.
Danske Bank, whose already battered shares fell by nearly 8 percent, said some 6,200 customers had been examined and it expected ""a significant part of the payments to be suspicious"".
Shares in Danske Bank had doubled in value from when Borgen took over in 2013 to July 2017, but have since lost more than a third as allegations of suspicious transactions increased and Denmark and Estonia began criminal investigations. 
The bank said it had taken action including ""warnings, dismissals, loss of bonus payments and reporting to the authorities"" against current and former staff, as well as overhauling systems found to have failed.
In an indication of the costs such lapses can have, Dutch bank ING (AS:INGA) agreed to pay 775 million euros ($900 million) this month after admitting criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts.
And earlier this year U.S. authorities accused Latvia's ABLV of covering up money laundering, leading to the bank being denied U.S. dollar funding and its swift collapse.
While Danske does not have a banking license in the United States, banning U.S. correspondent banks from dealing with it would amount to shutting it out of the global financial network. 
SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS
The report found that Danske Bank failed to take proper action in 2007 when it was criticized by the Estonian regulator and received information from its Danish counterpart that pointed to ""criminal activity in its pure form, including money laundering"" estimated at ""billions of rubles monthly"".
And when a whistleblower raised problems at the Estonian branch in early 2014 the allegations were not properly investigated and were not shared with the board, Danske said, adding that measures to get its business there under control had been insufficient.
Danske Bank also said the Estonian branch did not employ its anti-money laundering procedures because it had not migrated its Baltic banking activities onto the bank's IT platform as this would have been too expensive. 
""The report describes serious shortcomings in the organization of Danske Bank, where risk-appetite and risk control were not in balance,"" the head of Estonia's FSA financial regulator Kilvar Kessler said in a statement. 
Danske Bank, which cut its forecast for annual net profit to 16-17 billion Danish crowns, from a previous 18-20 billion, has successfully overcome previous traumas.
The government had to step in when international markets froze in 2008 and in 2012 it was criticized for an advertising campaign that sought to improve its image, borrowing symbols linked to anti-establishment movement Occupy Wall Street.
Prior to the money laundering scandal, Borgen had managed to improve the bank's image and earnings in part by cutting costs, shifting its focus to wealthier clients and expanding in Sweden and Norway to rival the Nordic region's biggest bank, Nordea (ST:NDA).

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor said on Wednesday it will sell 1,000 hydrogen-powered trucks in Switzerland over the next five years through a new tie-up, betting the vehicles could beat battery-powered models sold by the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
South Korea's Hyundai and Japan's Toyota are among a handful of car makers doubling down on hydrogen vehicles amid an intensifying global race to develop greener technologies to replace combustion engines, as regulators around the world crack down on emissions.
The deal, which will double Hyundai's hydrogen vehicle sales, marks its latest push into a technology that has lagged battery electric vehicles. Hyundai, whose profits have tumbled due to a heavy reliance on low-demand sedans, hopes to burnish its brand image by taking the lead in hydrogen cars. 
On Wednesday, Hyundai said in a statement it will partner with Swiss hydrogen company H2 Energy and fuel cell operators to provide 1,000 hydrogen trucks in the country after launching at the end of 2019 what it says will be the world's first commercial hydrogen trucks. It did not provide any financial details.
The launch timeline is ahead of battery-powered trucks Tesla and Daimler plan to introduce in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Hyundai announced a partnership with Audi in June to share each other's hydrogen car technology and components to bring down production costs and make the technology profitable. 
For long-haul, hydrogen trucks have a huge advantage over battery rivals as heavy batteries can reduce cargo capacity and require longer charging times, Mark Freymueller, a commercial vehicle director at Hyundai Motor, told Reuters. Hyundai said its hydrogen trucks are expected to deliver a single-fueling travel range of around 400 kilometers.
""We are not planning just purely 1,000 vehicles and then stop the business... We expect that much more is coming afterwards,"" he said, adding Hyundai would look at launching it in the United States, China and other European countries. 
Freymueller said expanding into other markets, however, will depend on finding partners such as pump operators and hydrogen suppliers.
The uptake of hydrogen cars, which are propelled by electricity generated by fuel cells, has been held back by a lack of infrastructure, which costs 3 billion won ($2.7 million) each to build in South Korea. 
Hyundai Motor launched the industry's first mass-produced hydrogen car Tucson Fuel Cell in 2013, followed by NEXO this year. It has sold about 1,140 fuel cell vehicles so far, while Toyota sold 6,700 Mirai hydrogen cars since its launch in 2014.
Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors are hedging their bets on hydrogen cars with a plan to release 14 battery electric vehicles by 2025.

The British Columbia, Canada-based cannabis company opened higher by 50.7 percent Wednesday, bringing its total market value to $21.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This exceeds the values of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL. at $18.7 billion,  Clorox Co .(NYSE:CLX) at $19.5 billion, and CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS). at $20.9 billion as of Tuesday’s close, while closing in on Hershey Co. at $21.7 billion.
Its market value is now half that of Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ)., the Corona parent that recently dipped its toe into the marijuana industry through an investment in  Canopy Growth  Corp. (NYSE:CGC) -- the same company Tilray dethroned this week as the largest cannabis firm.
Tilray, with 330 total employees as of June 4 (versus American Airlines’ more than 131,000), has more than 76 million shares outstanding, although the largest holder, Chief Executive Officer Brendan Kennedy’s Privateer Holdings, holds more than 58 million of that total, as of July 18. The low float may be at least partially responsible for the recent volatility, while short sellers may find it difficult to provide a counterbalance.
Kennedy hit the interview circuit Tuesday, culminating with an appearance on CNBC’s Mad Money with Jim Cramer, after the company won approval to import marijuana to the U.S. for a clinical trial.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Music Entertainment Group, China's biggest music-streaming company, is seeking to raise about $2 billion in a U.S. listing, according to three people close to the deal, down from the up to $4 billion that had been touted earlier.
The subsidiary of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings filed confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) two weeks ago, three people with knowledge of the matter said, in what will be one of the biggest listings in New York by a Chinese company this year.
Tencent Music had earlier been seeking to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported, which would have made it the biggest Chinese float in the United States so far in 2018, ahead of streaming company iQiyi's $2.42 billion IPO in March.
The company then was seeking a valuation of about $25 billion, according to IFR. The sources did not disclose whether the now smaller deal related to a lower valuation or fewer shares to be sold. 
Tencent said in a statement in Chinese the Reuters report was not accurate. It did not elaborate or say which part of the report was inaccurate. ""Please refer to official statements or announcements by the company for facts relating to the proposed offering,"" it said.
Tencent Music runs the music service providers QQ Music, KuGou and Kuwo, controlling three-quarters of China's booming music streaming market.
Users can listen to both Chinese and international artists such as Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars.
The filing was submitted to the SEC on Sept. 7, according to two of the people close to the deal.
The sources declined to be named because the information was not public.
The rapid growth in streaming music services in recent years has led to a recovery in the fortunes of the global recorded music industry, which enjoyed its third year of positive revenue growth in 2017, according to a report by industry body IFPI.
Tencent Music's float follows that by Swedish music streaming service Spotify earlier this year as online streaming becomes a bigger part of the recording industry's revenue.
In December last year, Tencent and Spotify agreed a share swap after which Tencent ended up with a 7.5 percent stake in Spotify, including shares held through Tencent Music, according to the prospectus filed by Spotify ahead of its own IPO in April.

Tencent Music will be the latest in a series of Chinese companies to have tapped U.S. markets this year. Other groups to have held IPOs include electric vehicle start-up NIO Inc - which raised $1 billion - and online group discounter Pinduoduo, which raised $1.63 billion.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 06:37AM ET</span>","Toshiba Memory chief shrugs off price concerns, sticks with IPO plans","By Makiko Yamazaki
YOKKAICHI, Japan (Reuters) - The chief executive of Toshiba Memory Corp, the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash memory chips, on Wednesday brushed aside concerns about falling memory chip prices and reaffirmed the company's plan to go public in two to three years.
""Prices fluctuate in the short term to reflect the demand-supply balance,"" Toshiba Memory CEO Yasuo Naruke said at a news conference with joint venture partner,  Western Digital  Corp (O:WDC), to mark the opening of a new production line.
""But we are addressing long-term demand"" driven by increasing amounts of data storage due to the rise of powerful smartphones and efficient data centers, he said.
Oversupply has weighed on NAND flash memory contract prices, resulting in an average drop of 15 to 20 percent in the April-June quarter, according to market research firm TrendForce.
Nevertheless, Toshiba Memory and Western Digital started mass production this month at the new line, their fifth, in Yokkaichi in central Japan.
The two companies are also building a new memory chip plant in Kitakami in northern Japan.
The new production lines will make advanced 3D NAND chips, with a stacked cell structure giving them far more storage capacity than conventional planar chips.
Toshiba and Western Digital held a combined 33.8 percent NAND market share in terms of revenue in the April-June quarter, trailing Samsung Electronics' (KS:005930) 36.4 percent, according to TrendForce.
Naruke said the firm is sticking to its plan to go public ""as soon as possible,"" adding that it had started preliminary work to prepare for an initial public offering (IPO).
""No changes to our plan, to aim for an IPO in 2-3 years,"" Naruke said.
Toshiba Corp (T:6502) sold Toshiba Memory in June to a consortium led by Bain Capital LP, which also included Apple Inc (O:AAPL), South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix (KS:000660), Dell Technologies and Seagate Technology (O:STX).
The deal saw Toshiba reinvest and hold some 40 percent of the unit.
Escalating trade friction between the United States and China is also adding to uncertainty over the flash memory market. Washington plans to impose 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from Sept. 24, including some electronic components.
""The impact of the first two rounds of tariffs was small, but the latest round could affect various set products that use our memory chips,"" Naruke said of the trade measures.
Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan also voiced concern about the worsening trade tensions, pointing out that some of its products assembled in Shanghai are exported to the U.S.

""We'll do everything we can to influence things in a positive way, whether it be with the U.S. government or the Chinese government,"" Milligan said at the news conference.

German manufacturers rely on the world's two largest economies for growth, and businesses have warned that an escalation in the tariffs war between them could hurt exports.
The IW economic institute in Cologne lowered its growth forecast to 1.8 percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2019 from a previous estimate of 2 percent for both calendar years.
""The power struggle between the United States and China is being felt here - exports are falling and companies are investing less,"" it said in a statement.
China said on Tuesday that it had no choice but to retaliate against new U.S. trade tariffs, raising the risk that President Donald Trump could soon impose duties on virtually all of Chinese goods that Americans buy.
Trump had said he was imposing 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of imports from China and threatened duties on about $267 billion more if Beijing retaliated.
Germany's Ifo institute said on Tuesday that the escalating dispute could be good for European Union countries.

The EU could use China's need to compensate for falling trade with the United States in other markets to get Beijing to make concessions that allow European manufacturers to boost their competitiveness in the Chinese market, it said.

(Reuters) - KPMG and one of its partners have admitted to serious failings in compliance reports for Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), Britain's accountancy watchdog said, potentially leading to heavy fines as the auditor comes under unprecedented scrutiny.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said on Wednesday that KPMG, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accountants, and partner Richard Hinton admitted to misconduct after an investigation into 2011 reports on client assets held by BNY Mellon and its London branch.
A disciplinary tribunal will be convened to decide what sanctions should be imposed, the FRC said, adding that no client money or assets were lost as a result of the misconduct.
The accounting watchdog, which issued new so-called CASS guidance for client assets reports in 2011, has already responded to pressure to crack down on auditors and imposed larger fines for misconduct or failings. 
KPMG and Hinton failed to give adequate consideration on whether the records of custody relationships maintained by BNY Mellon were compliant with certain rules, the FRC said on Wednesday.
'REGRET'
""We accept and regret that our work did not fully reflect all aspects of this new (CASS) guidance,"" KPMG said in an email. 
""There has been further fundamental change in the regulatory environment and we have significantly enhanced our CASS procedures and training to reflect this.""
KPMG partner Hinton did not respond immediately to a request for comment via the LinkedIN social network. 
The firm said it had cooperated with the FRC but could not agree with the watchdog on the level of appropriate sanctions. KPMG also emphasised that no clients suffered actual financial or other loss. 
The FRC told Reuters that there is no upper limit to any financial penalty the tribunal might impose and that the largest fine issued under the relevant guidance scheme was 10 million pounds. 
A spokeswoman for BNY Mellon, which was fined 126 million pounds ($166 million) in 2015 for failing to keep customer money safe during the financial crisis, said: ""BNY Mellon is aware of the conclusions from the Financial Reporting Council's investigation ... We have no comment to make.""

KPMG and rivals PwC, EY and Deloitte have all caught the attention of the FRC after the collapse of large British companies such as  Carillion  (L:CLLN) and Poundworld raised questions over standards in the auditing industry.
The FRC is investigating KPMG's audit of drinks firm Conviviality's financial statements after highlighting an ""unacceptable deterioration"" in the auditor's work with top British firms. KPMG is also being investigated over its work for construction company Carillion.
The watchdog fined KPMG 3 million pounds this year for misconduct related to auditing of British fashion retailer Ted Baker's (L:TED) accounts and has said that a higher than usual number of the accountant's 2018/19 audits would face FRC scrutiny.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Medicare supplement plans are changing: What you need to know,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are buying a Medicare supplemental policy in the United States, make sure you choose your insurance carefully over the next few months.
At the end of 2019, the doors will close on Plan F, which is considered the Cadillac plan of supplemental insurance policies known as Medigap. Designed for people who do not like healthcare cost surprises, it is the most popular of supplemental plans used to pay for services that Medicare does not cover. 
But unless prices increase significantly, the existing Plan G may be a better deal.
The government is cutting off access to Plan F for new Medicare enrollees to control costs. Eight other supplements (https://www.medicare.gov/supplements-other-insurance/how-to-compare-medigap-policies) will remain open. 
Insurance experts expect Plan G to become the new draw for people wanting the most coverage without surprises. 
Although Plan F is the most expensive option, retirees pay top dollar because they can go to any doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare patients. There is no surprise bill afterward – no deductible, co-payments or coinsurance. 
Participants already in Plan F when the doors close at the end of next year will be able to stick with the plan (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-medigap/u-s-medigap-plans-fall-short-on-protections-for-pre-existing-conditions-idUSKBN1K91IK). But if you turn 65 any time after the beginning of 2020, you will not be able to buy Plan F. 
In addition, if you are in Medicare now and buy a Medicare Advantage plan or another Medigap insurance plan, switching after Jan. 1, 2020 could be difficult. Most states allow insurance companies to screen for conditions ranging from diabetes to heart attacks and cancer. On that basis, you could be turned away from Plan F or face high premiums. 
Plan G is currently identical to Plan F except for the $183 deductible participants must pay at the beginning of the year. 
Rates differ by state and insurance company, but the national average for Plan F premiums is $185.96 a month, compared with $155.70 for Plan G, said Kris Schneider, vice president of consumer and carrier engagement for AON Retiree Health Solutions.
“Buying G is a no -brainer,” said Jeff Goldman, an insurance agent at G.M. Goldman & Associates in Skokie, Illinois. “You save about $350 a year on premiums, so it makes no sense to buy F to cover the $183 deductible.” 
Lower costs have been drawing an increasing number of Medigap customers into Plan G in the last three years – about 37 percent of new enrollees versus 53 percent in Plan F, according to CSG Actuarial. 
Experts are not sure what will happen to costs once insurance companies see the effects of the 2020 changes. Some expect Plan G rates to jump because under Medicare rules, the plan must accept new enrollees regardless of health conditions.
Others estimate Plan F premiums to soar because new healthy 65-year-olds will no longer come into the plan, resulting in an older, sicker pool of people to cover. 
“I see no way around Plan F rates continually increasing, perhaps exponentially after 2026,” said Adam Wasmund, chief marketing officer of Jack Schoeder & Associates, which advises health insurance brokers.
There will be more clarity as state regulators approve rates and insurance companies examine the claims of participants in both Plan F and Plan G. But Wasmund is concerned that the federal government could raise Plan G deductibles in an attempt to curb more Medicare usage in the future.
“Could the deductible be $200, $1,000 or $2,000?” said Wasmund. “Who’s to say what the government will do?”

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 05:19AM ET</span>","World stocks bat aside trade war fears, rally for second day","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities rallied for a second straight day on Wednesday while safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds and the Japanese yen slipped to multi-week lows as investors bet the escalating U.S.-China trade spat would inflict less damage than feared.
The deepening tariff row between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains and undermine the world economy. 
But markets appear to have taken cheer from China's move to levy only 10 percent duty on $60 billion of U.S. imports. Washington removed some 300 Chinese-made items from the list of dutiable goods.
World growth is undoubtedly at risk -- a survey by ThomsonReuters and INSEAD showed confidence among Asian companies at the weakest in almost three years as businesses feared blowback from the trade war
Dutch bank ING estimates 2.5 percent of world trade is now affected by tariffs, rising to 4 percent should U.S. President Donald Trump slap levies on all Chinese imports.
But hopes of Chinese stimulus to counter the impact on the economy, as well as a pledge by premier Li Keqiang to not use yuan devaluation as a tool in the trade war, reassured investors to some extent, allowing markets to build on Tuesday's gains.
MSCI's index of global equities rose 0.2 percent to a two-week high while emerging stocks too firmed for a second day, led by a one percent jump in Shanghai markets.An index of non-Japan Asian stocks also rose one percent < 
Government bonds from the United States and Germany, typically instruments that benefit from political or economic turmoil, saw yields race to multi-week highs. U.S. 10-year yields stayed firmly above the key 3 percent mark.
""Where we are today, is in a period of relative calm as U.S. bond yields probe their highs, and we become accustomed to trade rhetoric and perhaps, blasé about the economic damage it will cause,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes
""All things considered, though, the tariff spat could have been a lot worse. Investors reacted relatively well to the news.""
European share markets followed Asian counterparts higher and U.S. equity futures were modestly higher after Wall Street's bounce on Tuesday (N). 
Analysts noted that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week had invited Beijing to a new round of talks but some also reckon on a more conciliatory stance from China. 
""China are out of bullets. The fight is done and dusted. Now it's just a question of how the Chinese can save face and say 'alright we're going to change, going to open up wider access not only to the U.S. but to the EU and Japan', said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth in London.
""Their economy is export-led, they can't afford for it to go out of control.""
But for now, the yuan was lifted by Premier Keqiang's pledge, up 0.15 percent at 6.8504 per dollar, allowing an index of emerging currencies to rise to its highest since last Friday.
The dollar continued to lose ground, slipping 0.3 percent to stay near seven-week lows against a basket of currencies
In another sign of markets' new-found optimism, the safe-haven yen slipped to two-month lows against the dollar. The Bank of Japan kept policy unchanged as expected. 
The British pound was volatile, rising half a percent to an nine-week high of $1.3215 after data showed inflation hitting a six month high while 10-year British government bond yields rose to the highest since February.
U.S. and German bond yields also rose. German yields surpassed 0.5 percent for the first time since mid-June, lifted by the equity rally and signs of calm on markets in Italy, where the coalition government is now widely expected to deliver a budget that respects EU fiscal discipline rules.

Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) will merge Damco Supply Chain Services and Maersk Line's Ocean Product, the Danish shipping giant announced on Wednesday, as it seeks to offer customers the chance to deal with one firm when shipping goods across the world.
The operator of Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipping company, kicked off a restructuring drive in 2016 that saw it sell its oil and gas business last year to focus on transport and logistics business. 
Maersk said its latest change would take effect on January 1, 2019, and be headed by Vincent Clerc, Maersk's chief commercial officer. 
Damco CEO Klaus Rud Sejling will take on a new position as head of Maersk's logistics and services products, reporting to Clerc, Maersk said.
In addition to Maersk Line, Maersk includes port operator APM Terminals, freight forwarder Damco, towage company Svitzer and container manufacturer Maersk Container Industry.

After selling its oil and gas business to  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), Maersk sold its oil tanker unit. It has also announced plans to list its offshore drilling business in Copenhagen.

McDonald’s may have escaped the fate of other U.S. giants ordered to repay EU nations back taxes deemed to be be unfair state aid, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision isn’t yet public. EU officials have often described the McDonald’s case as challenging because they had to take account of double-tax and other international treaties.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager plans to give a press conference at 11:30 am in Brussels on Wednesday to announce a state aid matter. The EU’s press office didn’t give details on the announcement. A McDonald’s representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
A tax announcement comes just over two years after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). was handed a record multibillion-euro tax bill over its revenue arrangements in Ireland. Luxembourg has already faced three negative decisions amid the EU crackdown, being ordered in June to recoup 120 million euros ($141 million) from French energy utility Engie SA and in 2017, to reclaim 250 million euros from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). over selective tax benefits granted to the U.S. tech giant.
Vestager says she is standing up for fairness by cracking down on special tax deals that benefit only a select few companies. At stake are billions of euros that multinational companies have squirreled away in tax havens, out of the reach of authorities in the countries where they make most of their sales."
1229,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",World’s Most Valuable Pot Company Envisions $100 Billion Future,"(Bloomberg) -- To hear its chief executive tell it,  Tilray Inc  (NASDAQ:TLRY), the cannabis company that has seen its valuation double since the beginning of the month, is only getting started in the stock market.
Tilray is interested in the burgeoning market for consumer products that use ingredients from marijuana, CEO Brendan Kennedy said in an interview in New York Tuesday. “We’ve had lots of conversations with lots of companies,” he said, though he declined to provide specific details about any potential partnerships.
His comments come in the wake of high-profile cannabis industry investments by Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ). in  Canopy Growth  Corp (NYSE:CGC), the company Tilray just dethroned to become the largest pot stock. Beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. is also studying the potential of drinks infused with CBD -- the non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.
But Kennedy said he’s not interested in getting taken over by a large consumer company. It’s perhaps testament to the euphoria surrounding the space that he claimed the company may one day sport a valuation north of $100 billion.
“I don’t want to get bought by AB Inbev (BR:ABI) or  Diageo  (LON:DGE), I want to be that company,” he added.
Tilray, based in British Columbia, Canada, has seen its shares soar nearly 800 percent since it debuted in public trading in July. The stock spiked again on Tuesday, rising as much as 28 percent to a record $153.88 per share after the company announced it had received U.S. approval to import medical cannabis to California for a research project.
The company’s market value has surged more than Kennedy expected in such a short period of time, but he’s not worried it’s overvalued. Well-known activist short-seller Andrew Left has suggested Tilray’s shares are destined to fall, and there have been calls for the company, which only listed a small percentage of its shares, to release more.
Kennedy noted that Tilray’s IPO was just two months ago, although he added that he’s always looking for ways to raise capital.

1233,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>","After Shrugging Off New Tariffs, We Can Talk About Them Forever","(Bloomberg) -- Looking at how well stocks performed Tuesday, you might be surprised to remember that Washington announced tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and Beijing then retaliated the same day. But even if markets shrugged off the news, it’s a sign trade fears will endure longer.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered additional duties to take effect this month, with the rate set to more than double in January if no agreement is reached. That stocks still edged higher shows traders took the move in stride, but beyond the calm, the announcement indicates the White House is pushing more aggressively, and that trade headlines may keep coming even beyond November’s mid-term elections.
That’s bad news for stocks in emerging markets, Europe and cyclical sectors, which have all suffered on concerns rising trade protectionism will hit global growth. It’s likely good news for U.S. stocks, which have outperformed so far this year thanks to a relatively closed economy.
“The major drivers behind this hawkish stance on trade from Washington’s side are structural in nature; they’re not tactical; they’re not short-term politically moderated,” said Witold Bahrke, a senior macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds in Luxembourg. “It’s a proxy war over future economic supremacy.”
The timing of the trade war is also perfect: A strong U.S. economy and earlier tax cuts make it easier for Trump to drag this on, he added.
The U.S.-China trade war matters for Europe, whose economy is dependent on exports. Fears over rising trade barriers and the Italian budget have overshadowed solid economic and earnings growth in the region this year. Now even though there are signs Italy won’t seek to breach EU budget rules, trade worries look set to linger for much longer.
In a sign of caution, while cyclical shares like autos rallied this week, their relative performance is still lagging the recent rebound in bond yields.
Markets would react more negatively if China retaliates through means other than tariffs, Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, wrote in a note. These measures include impeding U.S. companies’ business in China, actively weakening the yuan and selling its U.S. Treasury holdings.
“Regardless of next steps, we expect trade tensions between the U.S. and China to linger long past the midterm elections,” he wrote. “Trade tensions will get worse before they get better.”"
1234,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 03:15AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Sees $2.5 Billion Equity Raise for Troubled Tesla,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. could raise funds as soon as this year as Elon Musk’s company ramps up production and prepares for maturing debt, analysts at Morgan Stanley predict.
The company, whose stock has slumped 25 percent in the past six weeks amid a string of controversies, could raise $2.5 billion in equity in the fourth quarter from investors that have a strategic interest in its business model,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts including Adam Jonas wrote in a note dated Sept. 18 outlining various possibilities.
Musk has repeatedly said Tesla doesn’t need to raise capital as the electric-car maker’s finances improve. Musk said last month he expects the company to generate positive free cash flow in the second half of this year, and become sustainably profitable for the first time in its 15-year history. He also said he expects to be able to use cash flow to repay around $900 million of convertible debt maturing early next year.
“Bulls may say that if Tesla generates enough cash” it doesn’t need to raise equity, the Morgan Stanley analysts said. “In our view, it is far better for a company to raise when it doesn’t need to.”
The analysts said they don’t have knowledge of any specific transactions under consideration, offering the scenario as part of a forecast for an “event path” unfolding in the next several quarters that could result in Tesla’s share price fluctuating between $97 and $441.
Morgan Stanley reiterated an equal-weight rating for the stock with a target price of $291. The shares fell 3.4 percent to $284.96 on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. Justice Department has started an investigation over public statements made by Musk and the company. Federal prosecutors opened a fraud probe after Musk tweeted last month that he was contemplating taking Tesla private and had “funding secured” for the deal, only to later abandon the idea.
Tesla has also been hit by several executive departures, while Musk drew criticism for his decision to smoke marijuana on a comedian’s podcast this month. This week, Musk was sued for defamation by an English caver the CEO called a pedophile.
Morgan Stanley was among the advisers Musk had tapped for his plan to study taking the company private, a person familiar with the matter said last month.

WUXI, China/LONDON (Reuters) - With smart cancer diagnostics, one-stop-shop diabetes kits and AI systems to improve ambulance pick-ups for patients with chest pain, AstraZeneca (L:AZN) aims to move from simply supplying drugs to become a broad healthcare provider in China.
Tech tie-ups with the likes of  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700) will not directly lift the British group's drug sales, since they are not specific for any one company's products and in many cases will be low-cost or free.
But it will expand the overall market and represents a soft power play that dovetails neatly with Beijing's support for Internet-based healthcare systems to alleviate a lack of doctors, overcrowding and poor grassroots healthcare. 
""Down the line we benefit, our products benefit, because we have better relationships with doctors and hospital managers and also because we diagnose more patients and they get better treated,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told Reuters. 
Surrounded by the latest gizmos at the World Internet of Things Exposition in Wuxi, eastern China, Soriot says he wants to use the power of artificial intelligence, robots and apps to help transform diagnosis and disease management. 
AstraZeneca has been on a tear in China, more than doubling its sales since 2012, helped by regulatory reforms to fast-track new drugs, and today generates 18 percent of revenue in the country -- a far higher proportion than rivals.
Yet Soriot is anxious to do more to keep doctors and government officials on-side in the world's second-biggest drugs market, as soaring demand strains the state insurance system and squeezes medicine prices.
The company's underlying conviction is that it has the right medicines across chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes and respiratory disorders to win in China.
Soriot believes that can keep AstraZeneca growing in a pivotal market in the coming years, even though annual growth is likely to slow to nearer 15 percent from the breakneck 33 percent seen in the first half of 2018.
The company has moved quickly to exploit China's new-found willingness to use innovative Western drugs.
Last year it won a record-fast approval for lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which is designed for patients with a genetic mutation that is particularly common in China.
It hopes to get a green light before the end of 2018 -- well before U.S. approval -- for a new anemia drug called roxadustat being developed with FibroGen (O:FGEN).
China-first approvals for drugs like roxadustat and Elunate, a colorectal cancer treatment from Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and Hutchison China MediTech (L:HCM), mark a reversal of the historical pattern of Chinese patients getting new drugs years after their launch in the West.
There is, however, a trade-off. Multinationals that relied in the past on selling older drugs at premium prices in China are seeing prices slashed. AstraZeneca took a 50 percent haircut last year on the price of Iressa, its predecessor to Tagrisso.
""The government wants to give access to better medicines to more people,"" said Soriot, who admitted that pressure on prices had come sooner than he expected.
""To some extent the economy is growing so there is more money to do that, but there is not enough money ... They have to make room in the budget for innovation.""
""UNMET NEEDS""
With 1.4 billion people, around 18 percent of the world's population, China has more cases of cancer and diabetes than any other nation, fueled by fast food, smoking and pollution, global health data show. 
""There are enormous unmet medical needs in China, particularly in oncology, and 30 percent of the world's cancer patients are in China,"" Christian Hogg, Chief Executive of Hutchison China MediTech, told Reuters.
""There is almost an inevitability that the Chinese pharmaceutical industry is going to grow to be the largest in the world in due course.""
The firm, also known as Chi-Med, is working with AstraZeneca on a novel oncology drug targeting kidney, lung and stomach tumors.
AstraZeneca is bolstering its sales force to meet this growing demand. It has around 7,500 sales staff in China and is looking to push into smaller cities -- boosting volume and helping offset lower prices.
It aims to get more drugs onto a list of medicines covered by basic insurance schemes -- the national drug reimbursement list -- and onto fast-track approvals, Soriot said. The list was most recently updated last year after an eight-year hiatus.
A drug joint venture, Dizal Pharmaceutical, backed by the China State Development & Investment Corporation, will promote Chinese-discovered drugs -- another priority for Beijing.
""It's the first time a government fund works with a foreign company in researching new drugs for Chinese patients,"" Leon Wang, AstraZeneca's China head, said in an interview at the firm's Shanghai headquarters. ""So we like that.""
Wang added there were still many patients who went undiagnosed or untreated, and that the firm's aggressive expansion, even to ""village clinics"", was helping make the difference against rivals tapping growing demand.
""Chronic disease, oncology drugs, specialty care, rare disease, these will all explode I think,"" he said.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","Renault, VW and Fiat Chrysler sales surged before stiffer EU emissions tests","PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Fiat Chrysler led a 29.8 percent European car sales surge last month, the main regional industry body said, as automakers used discounts to clear inventory ahead of tougher emissions tests.
Registrations across Europe rose to 1.17 million cars, well above usual levels for the slow month of August and the 902,870 achieved in the same month last year, Brussels-based ACEA said on Wednesday.
The tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including Renault and Volkswagen to halt deliveries of some model versions that had yet to be re-certified for emissions.
Ahead of the deadline, many boosted financial incentives and registrations of their own new vehicles to be sold on the used car market, analysts have said.
""Some auto manufacturers offered pre‐WLTP vehicles at extremely attractive prices,"" ACEA said. ""As a result, double-digit percentage gains were registered in many EU countries.""
The numbers published on Wednesday for the European Union and four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries reveal that France's Renault posted the steepest increase in regional sales, with a 56.4 percent gain. Its alliance partner Nissan's sales rose 46.3 percent.
VW Group sales jumped 39.3 percent, while Fiat Chrysler registrations rose 38.9 percent, with sales by its Jeep brand leaping by 158 percent.
Forecasters expect the market surge to be offset by a sales slowdown in the remaining months of the year, in which the August discounters are likely to come off worse.
By contrast, Peugeot maker PSA Group and Japan's Toyota, which both had WTLP-compliant line-ups before the deadline, recorded August sales gains of 17-18 percent.

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) unit  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) on Tuesday asked a California judge to throw out a $289 million jury verdict awarded to a man who alleged the company's glyphosate-based weed-killers, including Roundup, gave him cancer.
The company said in motions filed in San Francisco's Superior Court of California that the jury's decision was insufficiently supported by the evidence presented at trial by school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson.
Johnson's case, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, that he alleged was caused by years of exposure to Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto herbicide that contains glyphosate.
Monsanto asked Superior Court Judge Suzanne Bolanos, who oversaw the trial, to set aside the verdict or, in the alternative, reduce the award or grant a new trial. A hearing on the motions is set for Oct. 10.
The company, which denies the allegations, has previously said it would appeal the verdict if necessary.
Johnson's case was the first to go to trial over allegations that glyphosate causes cancer. Monsanto is facing some 8,000 similar lawsuits across the United States.
Shares in Bayer, which bought Monsanto this year for $63 billion, slid following the Aug. 10 jury decision and the stock was still trading some 20 percent below its pre-verdict value of 73.30 euros ($85.45) on Tuesday.
""The jury's decision is wholly at odds with over 40 years of real-world use, an extensive body of scientific data and analysis ... which support the conclusion that glyphosate-based herbicides are safe for use and do not cause cancer in humans,"" Bayer said in a statement on Tuesday.
Bayer said Johnson failed to prove glyphosate caused his cancer and the scientific evidence he presented at trial ""fell well below the causation standard required under California law.""
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical is not a likely carcinogen to humans. However, the cancer unit of the World Health Organization in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
The jury found Monsanto failed to warn Johnson and other consumers of the cancer risks posed by its weed-killers. It awarded $39 million in compensatory and $250 million in punitive damages.

The company in its motion for a new trial also said statements by lawyers for Johnson inflamed and inappropriately influenced the jurors. Some legal experts have said Monsanto faces long odds on appeal on those grounds.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 12:12AM ET</span>",Asian firms' confidence sinks to near three-year low on trade war fears: Thomson Reuters/INSEAD poll,"By Gayatri Suroyo
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Confidence among Asian companies slumped to the weakest in almost three years in the third quarter as businesses feared blowback from a worsening global trade war, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
Representing the six-month outlook of 104 firms, the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS>  fell to 58 for the July-September quarter, its lowest since the fourth quarter of 2015, from 74 three months before. 
It was a second straight quarter-on-quarter decline for the index and the pace of the fall was the steepest recorded since the survey began in 2009. A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
""The fall in the index could be a strong signal of an economic slowdown,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD, adding that the survey results had historically correlated well with changes in economic growth in Asia Pacific.
""We have witnessed a cyclical upturn in the world economy that had to come to an end. We see the end of the cycle in advanced economies as well as emerging markets. This survey confirms that these fears are real,"" he said.
A global trade war was cited as the chief business risk by respondents, while the second most identified risks were a China economic slowdown and currency fluctuations. The survey was conducted from Aug. 31 through Sept. 14.
U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with China on Monday, imposing 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and warning of further tariffs if China takes retaliatory action. China responded by adding $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list.
Analysts say a trade war between the world's two biggest economies may only modestly impact growth in both countries, but will have far reaching implications on others due to global value chains, especially with much of Asia depending on China for trade.
Nevertheless, the subindex for China nosedived to 25 from 63, representing the lowest reading ever and its first negative outlook. Japanese companies also turned pessimistic.
""Because China has become the main target for the U.S., there is increasing uncertainty about the Chinese economy,"" Fatas said.
EMERGING MARKETS SUFFER
The souring Sino-U.S. relationship has also reduced investors' risk appetite and exacerbated outflows from emerging markets, which have also been hit by rising U.S. interest rates and fear of contagion from financial crises in Turkey and Argentina.
Battered by outflows, the Indian rupee , the Indonesian rupiah  and the Philippine peso  have been emerging Asia's biggest currency decliners so far this year. Delhi, Jakarta and Manila have raised interest rates to support their currencies, among other measures.
Despite these developments, the survey's subindexes showed firms in Indonesia and India were the most optimistic after Thailand. 
Some in the Philippines were losing confidence, with its subindex sliding to 61 from 94. But survey participant Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co (PS:MBT) remained upbeat, citing the government's infrastructure push and steps to contain inflation as the main reasons for the view.
""Any infrastructure expenditure is good for the economy. This creates economic activity. This will help grow businesses of all sizes,"" Anna Dominique Cudia, from the bank's investor relations department, said in an email. 
In Indonesia, a perceived lower trade risk for Southeast Asia's largest economy compared to some other countries supported business confidence, said Shinta Widjaja Kamdani, deputy chairwoman of the chamber of business and commerce. 
""Even though we're optimistic, we are very cautious in our expansion because we factor in external risks,"" she said, referring to Indonesian businesses.
By industry, construction and engineering was among the weakest with its subindex at 45, the lowest since 2012. Auto and real estate firms were the most pessimistic, but the number of respondents for each of those sectors was low at three companies.
Firms in metals and chemicals were the most upbeat.
Respondents to the survey included Oil Search (AX:OSH),  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), Suzuki Motor (T:7269), Asahi Group (T:2502), Canon (T:7751),  Central Plaza  Hotel (BK:CENTEL) and Delta Electronics (TW:2308).

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 12:11AM ET</span>",Norway's Aker bets on software engineers for its oil business,"By Shadia Nasralla and Gwladys Fouche
STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - When the owners of Norwegian oil firm Aker BP (OL:AKERBP) decided to digitize its assets and operations, they searched high and low for the right software company. But they failed to find a suitable one.
So instead they set up their own, Cognite https://www.cognite.com, to create digital maps of Aker BP's oil industry assets, integrating data from equipment such as pumps, heat and pressure sensors, maintenance records and even staff rotas to improve efficiency and safety.
Less than two years later, Cognite is selling its software to Aker BP's rivals and one competitor, Sweden's  Lundin Petroleum  (ST:LUPE), has even agreed to share its real-time oilfield data with Aker in what they say is an industry first.
""This will be the first time two different operators, or oil companies, will share operations/production data live from two producing fields, that is between Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen,"" a Lundin Norway representative told Reuters.
By combining all the data that typically sits in different digital silos - such as matching flow sensors with the piece of machinery they actually sit on - Cognite says its software can help reduce maintenance costs, extend the lifespan of equipment and avoid damaging breakdowns.
Digitizing industrial assets can also mean fewer people need to be offshore, less downtime for oil platforms, more targeted maintenance and better analysis of information such as geological data and valve pressures.
For Lundin Petroleum, sharing information from its Edvard Grieg field on the Norwegian continental shelf with Aker BP's adjacent Ivar Aasen field makes sense because getting more real-time production data from a rival in a similar geological area could help it improve its own oil output.
""Aker BP's view is that, unlike seismic data interpretation for oil exploration, operational data is not a strategic know-how to be protected,"" said its chief Karl Johnny Hersvik.
For Aker ASA, the biggest shareholder in Aker BP and Cognite, the Lundin Petroleum deal is part of its plan to create software for an industry that can be improved and refined the more it gets used by different clients - rather than just focusing on an in-house model for Aker BP.
""The value that Cognite's technology brings to the Aker companies will increase with the number of customers Cognite serves,"" Aker Chief Executive Oeyvind Eriksen told Reuters. 
Aker ASA, which together with Aker BP owns more than 75 percent of Cognite, is even considering floating the company on the stock exchange within two years.
Controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke https://eng.akerasa.com/About-Aker/Board, Aker also has interests in oil, engineering and construction services as well as fishing.
'THAT'S RIDICULOUS'
John Markus Lervik, a software engineer who founded Cognite, said it has grown from just 2 people to about 110 in 18 months, has clients in oil and shipping and is only planning 12-months ahead for now because ""things are happening so quickly"".
It might seem counterintuitive to share technological expertise with rivals, but by learning from usage across companies and industries, software can be improved - even if no oilfield specific data is exchanged. Improvements can then be rolled out to clients, including Aker BP.
""To provide the algorithm and the software to be able to map or connect sensors to the right equipment, that's a big challenge all oil companies and also other companies have,"" Lervik said. 
""The more companies we work with to create advanced algorithms to do this mapping, the more advanced, the more automatic, that mapping will be.""
While Cognite is not alone in developing systems that can link masses of data historically kept in different systems, Alfonso Velosa at tech advisory firm Gartner https://www.gartner.com/en reckons when it comes to oil and gas, Aker is out in front for now.
""Those systems tended to be stuck in proprietary legacy systems and this is now an approach that is trying to marry (them) together,"" he said. 
""This is a trend that's coming down and they're just ahead of the trend at the moment in the oil sector.""
Other companies looking to bring thousands of data points together in the oil sector include Eigen http://www.eigen.co, a software firm in the United Kingdom founded by oil and gas engineers. 
Chief strategy officer Gareth Davies said a new generation of people entering the oil and gas industry is partly behind the drive to come up with better digital systems. 
""The guys who come in now who are in their 20s expect to have the information,"" said Davies.
""It's like, well you have to go to that system, you have to ask him to log in there and he'll export it here, and they look at you like: What are you talking about? That's ridiculous."" 
In one of its recent projects, Eigen digitally linked up 10,600 sensors on Italian oil company ENI's (MI:ENI) Goliat http://www.eninorge.com/en/Field-development/Goliat/Development-solution/The-platform---FPSO floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, the world's most northerly oilfield in production.
The system brings together gas and pressure detection to prevent accidents and fire detectors, sprinklers and extinguisher systems, evacuation plans, life boats and other data into one stream of integrated information.

""Up until now this would have been done through a monthly report,"" Davies said. ""You don't want to know it every month, you want to know now.""

China is in the middle of an ambitious corporate restructuring program aimed at reducing debts and improving the performance of its huge but lumbering state-owned sector. 
Since the reforms began in 2015, Beijing has pushed through several big industry mergers, closed down dozens of zombie"" enterprises and allowed new ownership structures and debt-to-equity deals that will see more private capital injected into state firms.
The 96 giant firms now administered by the central government are under pressure to cut their total debt ratios by 2 percentage points by the end of the decade. 
According to the latest Ministry of Finance data, total debts among China's state-owned firms amounted to 112.2 trillion yuan ($16.36 trillion) by the end of July, up 8.8 percent on the year. The total debt amounted to 64.9 percent of assets, down 1 percentage point compared to last year.
New guidelines published by the cabinet last week said China would establish a system enabling financial institutions to take action against state-owned enterprises when their debt-asset ratios exceeded warning lines, which range from 60 to 70 percent depending on the sector. 
Amid concerns about rising local government debt, the guidelines also prohibited authorities from ""disguising"" liabilities by borrowing through corporate debt channels.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 08:37PM ET</span>",U.S. senators seek punishment if China's ZTE violates deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would reimpose sanctions on China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) if it does not fully comply with U.S. laws and an agreement with the Trump administration that ended stiff restrictions on the telecommunications equipment company.
President Donald Trump angered many members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans, in July when he decided to lift a ban on U.S. companies selling to ZTE, allowing the giant company to resume business. 
Lawmakers have introduced several pieces of legislation since then that seek to clamp down on the company, China's second largest telecommunications equipment maker. Most have failed to advance in the face of administration opposition.
Senate aides said they thought the latest measure - led by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Chris Van Hollen and focused on adherence to an agreement reached by Trump's Commerce Department - would get support from congressional leadership.
Senate aides said the purpose of the bill was to make it clear to the administration that Congress wants a strong response if ZTE violates the deal. Many members of Congress view the Chinese firm as a national security threat, worrying that the use of its technology in the United States could make it easier for China to steal secrets.
Among other things, the legislation, introduced by three Republicans and three Democrats, would require reports from the Commerce Department every 90 days on ZTE's compliance with the agreement and sharing with congressional committees ZTE audits conducted under the agreement.
If ZTE is not in compliance, it would face stiff penalties, including paying $400 million now held in escrow.

""This bipartisan legislation would ensure that if ZTE once again violates trade restrictions or its agreement with the U.S., it will be held accountable in a significant, painful way,"" said Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a co-sponsor of the bill.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Danske Bank set to shed light on Russian money flows to Europe,"By Teis Jensen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  will on Wednesday lift the lid on how billions of euros from Russia and ex-Soviet states flowed through its accounts in Estonia, the latest scandal to highlight Europe's inability to tackle alleged money-laundering.
Regulators are eagerly awaiting the Danske Bank (CO:DANSKE) report, which will mark a critical milestone for the Danish lender and follows calls by Brussels for a new European Union watchdog to crack down on financial crime.
The Danske Bank case has led to speculation in Denmark that its chief executive Thomas Borgen, who was in charge of its international operations, including Estonia, between 2009 and 2012, will step down.
Borgen has said that he was not informed in detail at the time about the problems at the Estonian branch, whose non-resident portfolio has been at the center of allegations of flawed money laundering controls from 2007 to 2015. 
Danske Bank and Borgen have declined to comment on recent media reports, which have said the scandal could involve as much as $150 billion worth of transactions, until the findings of the report it commissioned are published.
Investor uncertainty has seen a third of Danske Bank's stock market value wiped out in the last six months, mainly driven by concerns over the possible involvement of U.S. authorities.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that the United States is already investigating the case as many of the transactions under review were processed in dollars. 
Authorities in the U.S. earlier this year accused Latvia's ABLV of covering up money laundering and the bank was promptly denied U.S. dollar funding, leading to its collapse.
While Danske does not have a banking license in the United States, banning U.S. correspondent banks from dealing with it would amount to shutting it out of the global financial network. 
INDEPENDENT INQUIRY
In Denmark, the country's business minister Rasmus Jarlov, who oversees its banking sector, and other politicians have been critical of the probe, which Danske paid law firm Bruun & Hjejle to coordinate with help from Promontory Financial, PwC and EY.
""I don't think the investigation has any legitimacy. We need to have an independent investigation into the case,"" Lisbeth Bech Poulsen, MP for the Socialist People's Party, said.
The scandal marks the latest recent low for Danske Bank after the government had to step in and ensure it could pay its short-term dollar debt when international markets froze in 2008.
It has also led to pressure for a wider overhaul of the bank and its leadership once the report is out, while Danish lawmakers on Monday agreed to tighten anti-money laundering laws including a rise of up to 700 percent in fines, making its rules among the toughest in Europe.
While the report will help determine the outcome of current criminal probes in both Denmark and Estonia, Danish expert on money laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft says potential court cases and fines could come years into the future.

Despite the new tighter anti-money laundering laws, a potential case would be gauged under the less rigorous rules in force at the time of the alleged offences, he said.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Indian police scrutinize major law firm in PNB fraud probe after documents moved,"By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's largest law firm, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas (CAM), is being scrutinized by federal agents after they seized documents related to the $2 billion fraud at state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) from CAM’s premises in February, a lawyer representing the government and a police source told Reuters.
In what has been dubbed as India's biggest bank fraud, PNB in January alleged that billionaire diamond jeweler Nirav Modi and his uncle had for years fraudulently raised billions of dollars in foreign credit by conspiring with staff at the bank.
In mid-February, Modi's aides packed cartons of documents at one of his diamond firm’s offices in Mumbai and sent them to CAM’s office nearby, from where police seized them within a week on Feb. 21, a review of the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) court filings and witness testimonies showed.
K. Raghavacharyulu, a prosecution lawyer in the Modi case, and two CBI sources who declined to be named, said CAM possessed documents detailing Modi's dealings with PNB, even though the firm wasn’t representing the diamond magnate or his companies.
""CAM was not their attorney in the PNB fraud case, 100 percent sure ... that’s why they could not cite attorney-client privilege,"" Raghavacharyulu said, adding that his assessment was based on regular briefings he received from CBI investigating officers.
CAM declined to comment on its relationship with Modi, who is on the run overseas. Its spokeswoman, Madhumita Paul, said the firm ""strictly follows the legal best practices and does not comment on matters that are sub-judice or are under investigation”.
In CBI’s first charge sheet in May in the fraud case against Modi and others, the agency said that “incriminating documents/articles relevant to the case” were concealed in the office of CAM. No charges were brought against the law firm and it was not named as a witness in the case.
Since then, Raghavacharyulu said, police have not interviewed any CAM official in the case, though one CBI source said that before filing the first charge sheet, police summoned, questioned and recorded the statement of at least one junior CAM lawyer.
That statement has still not been produced in court because the agency is deliberating whether to charge the law firm for concealment of evidence or name it as a prosecution witness to testify against Modi, the source said.
Raghavacharyulu said it is possible the police could bring charges against CAM for helping conceal documents. “Who told you we are not going to charge them?” he said. “The possibility of naming CAM in the next Nirav Modi case charge sheet has not been ruled out.""
CAM declined to comment on the possibility of being charged or being named as a witness, and said the Reuters findings were “full of false and speculative statements”. It did not elaborate. 
The firm didn’t comment on why it possessed the documents seized by the CBI.
CBI’s spokesman, Abhishek Dayal, declined to comment for this article, saying the PNB fraud case was under investigation and it will not be appropriate to say anything at this stage.
The CBI first learned of CAM’s possession of the documents when it questioned Modi's office staff, the police source said. The documents were moved in a mini-truck in 50-60 cartons to the law firm, according to two witness testimonies seen by Reuters.
On the afternoon of Feb. 20, CBI officers went to CAM’s office with a legal search authorization and the documents were found in a meeting room, according to a previously unreported 10-page CBI ""search list"" seen by Reuters.
The CBI search – which involved eight federal police officers – included locking and sealing the meeting room overnight as the search dragged on over two days. On the night of Feb. 21, CBI officers left with 24,625 pages of documents, which included copies of financial statements of Modi’s firms and details of interbank fund transfers, according to the search list.

CAM has more than 600 lawyers. It has advised companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), Microsoft (O:MSFT),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and India's ICICI Bank (NS:ICBK), according to research firm The Legal 500. It also advises Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters, the company’s news division.

WeWork, a provider of co-work spaces with flexible leases that now has more than 50 locations in Manhattan, said in a blog post on Monday it signed a lease for 258,344 square feet at 21 Penn Plaza. The move makes it the largest private occupier of office space on the island with more than 5.3 million square feet. 
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has 5.2 million square feet, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.
Flexible space accounted for 12 percent of Manhattan leasing activity in the first six months of the year, according to brokerage CBRE, and WeWork was responsible for about half of that as companies in search of extra space embrace coworking. Flex space providers sign long-term leases with a landlord and then rent the leased space to clients on a short-term basis. 
Coworking's appeal has become more mainstream across the United States, not just in New York. Mall operator  Macerich Co  (N:MAC) in August announced a partnership with Industrious to roll out flexible workspaces in its portfolio of high-end U.S. shopping centers.
WeWork's torrid growth has not gone unnoticed. Brookfield, one of the world's largest property owners, plans on offering flexible space in most of the 1,000 office buildings it owns globally.
""Anybody that's not thinking about it now and not doing it risks being road kill,"" said Kevin Danehey, global head of corporate development at Brookfield Properties. 

""From an owner's perspective, this isn't something where we're just seeing this as a trend but as something that's core to how we're viewing the operation of our assets,"" he told a Rethink conference about the future of the office two weeks ago.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",New Illinois laws no panacea for state's unpaid bill backlog: Moody's,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - New laws enacted by Illinois in response to a huge backlog of unpaid bills fail to address the underlying problems that led to the state's reliance on payment deferrals, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday.
Illinois has the lowest credit ratings of any U.S. state, and its pile of unpaid bills is currently estimated at $8.1 billion. Moody's said that three measures signed into law by Governor Bruce Rauner last month are aimed at making management of the bill pile less costly and more transparent.
However, the credit rating agency said the underlying problem of the state's chronic budget deficits and ability to push bill payments into future years remains.
""To fully eliminate the backlog without resorting to non-recurring tactics such as further bonding, the state would have to do something that the new laws do not require: achieve budget surpluses over the course of several years,"" Moody's said in a report.
Illinois sold $6 billion of general obligation bonds last year to shrink the backlog, which ballooned to more than $16 billion in the wake of a political impasse that left the state without complete budgets for two-straight fiscal years. State officials have estimated the deficit in the fiscal 2019 budget at $1.2 billion.
The state accrued from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018 $1.14 billion in late bill payment penalties that could reach as much as 12 percent annually, according to Moody's, which rates Illinois at Baa3, a notch above junk. One of the new laws requires state agencies to budget for late-payment interest. 
Another law authorizes the Illinois treasurer to use up to $2 billion in available state funds to help pay down the backlog at a lower interest rate.
Treasurer Michael Frerichs said on Tuesday he expects to begin implementing the law by year end, pending the completion of an intergovernmental agreement with the state comptroller, who is responsible for paying Illinois' bills. 
""We are very close to doing something,"" Frerichs said in an interview. 
Moody's noted the law will not eliminate the backlog.
""In fact, by making the backlog appear smaller, it might well dampen the current urgency to address the state's fiscal
challenges,"" Moody's added.
A third law, which Moody's said is expected to have no credit impact, requires enhanced disclosures of Illinois' vendor payment program. Private lenders qualified by the state purchase unpaid receivables from vendors and pocket late-payment penalty fees once the bills are paid.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rebounded on Tuesday in a broad-based rally as investors brushed aside intensifying trade rhetoric between the United States and China.
All three major U.S. indexes closed higher following Monday's sell-off.
Late Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in imports from China would go into effect next week, escalating the tit-for-tat trade spat between the world's two largest economies. 
China responded on Tuesday by unveiling 10 percent tariffs on about $60 billion of U.S. goods effective Sept. 24. 
""Initially they were talking about tariffs in the 20 to 25 percent range, and that's actually been lowered to 10 percent,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""Maybe these numbers aren't going to be as bad as initially thought.""
""There's much more pressure on the Chinese to reach a deal than there is on (the United States), at this point,"" Massocca added. 
Tech stocks (SPLRCT) were bolstered by news that Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and fitness gadget-maker  Fitbit Inc  (N:FIT) would escape the tariffs. Apple shares closed up 0.2 percent while Fitbit shares rose 6.4 percent. 
Trade-sensitive industrials (SPLRCI) gained ground, with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) ending 2.1 percent higher. The planemaker, the biggest U.S. exporter to China, led the Dow Jones Industrial Average's advance.
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE) also boosted the blue-chip index as Telsey Advisory Group hiked its price target. The stock was reached an all-time closing high, up 2.4 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 184.84 points, or 0.71 percent, to 26,246.96, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 15.51 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,904.31 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 60.32 points, or 0.76 percent, to 7,956.11.
Consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) was the best performing of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.3 percent.
The energy sector (SPNY) advanced 0.7 percent as crude prices (LCOc1) rose on signs that OPEC is not prepared to boost output to address shrinking supplies from Iran.
Among losers, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) sank 3.4 percent after disclosing that it had received a request for documents from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding Chief Executive Elon Musk's public statements about taking the company private.
Insurer Marsh & McLennan (N:MMC) slid by 4.0 percent on news that it will buy British insurance and reinsurance broker  Jardine Lloyd  Thompson (L:JLT) for $5.7 billion.
Defensive groups lagged, with consumer staples (SPLRCS) ending down 0.4 percent.  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) dropped 7.6 percent after missing analysts' quarterly sales estimates, extending the packaged food company stock's near-26 percent year-to-date decline.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 83 new lows.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nestle, Unilever, Coke make bids in $4 billion-plus GSK India sale - sources","By Martinne Geller, Pamela Barbaglia and Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN),  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) and Coca-Cola (N:KO) are among bidders for GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) Indian Horlicks nutrition business, expected to fetch more than $4 billion, four people familiar with the matter said. 
Initial bids were due on Monday and the three consumer goods giants are seen as frontrunners for a business that offers a significant footprint in a fast-growing emerging market.
Even though Indian shoppers have lately been pressured by a currency devaluation and goods and service tax, the country's growing population and rising wealth make it attractive for companies trying to offset weak growth in Western markets. It was not clear which other companies were bidding, although  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), a company eager to build up its consumer health operation, did not make an offer, two sources said. 
GSK, Nestle, Reckitt and Unilever declined to comment. Officials at Coca-Cola were not immediately available. 
Horlicks is a malt-based drink dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, founded a company in Chicago to manufacture it. It was taken to India by soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War.
Sold as a bedtime drink in Britain, Horlicks has been developed into a much bigger brand by GSK in India. But the drugmaker started a review of that business and some smaller products, after buying  Novartis  (S:NOVN) out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion in March. 
GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year, is looking to sharpen the focus of what is one of the world's more diversified pharmaceuticals companies. 
The main asset on the block is GSK's 72.5 percent stake in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (NS:GLSM), which is famous for Horlicks but also makes products including the chocolate-flavored malt-based drink Boost. One source said Nestle was particularly well-suited to buy the business, as the world's biggest packaged food company already owns rival malt drink Milo and has a big presence in India, which bodes well for synergies.
Nestle has told GSK privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions over the years, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year. 
For Coke, buying the Horlicks business would mark another multibillion-dollar acquisition, following a deal to buy Costa Coffee for $5.1 billion last month.
GSK is being advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Greenhill.

The company sold its much smaller UK Horlicks business to Aimia Foods earlier this year for an undisclosed amount.

1256,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Housing Starts Expected to Jump
The focus on the economic calendar is on housing again tomorrow, with data on home construction coming in before the bell.
Numbers on housing starts and building permits arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Housing starts are expected to have risen by 5.8% to an annual rate of 1.235 million in August.
But economists predict that building permits, an indicator of future activity, edged down 0.1% to a rate of 1.31 million in August.
Today, the National Association of Home Builders said its housing market index for September was unchanged from the month before at 67.
2. Oil Prices a Bit Frothy Ahead of Inventories
Oil prices were buoyed today by some indications that OPEC wasn’t concerned about the current level of output, so traders will turn their attention to inventory numbers out tomorrow.
Official data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is set to be released Wednesday at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
The EIA is expected to report U.S. crude stockpiles fell 2.741 million barrels last week, down from the 5.836 million barrel decline in the prior week.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers will meet in Algiers on Sunday, but do not have plans to propose an immediate increase in crude output, but rather will discuss how to share a previously agreed output increase, according a report from Reuters.
Also helping expectations for tighter global crude supplies was a report from Bloomberg, citing unnamed Saudi sources, claiming the Kingdom was comfortable with Brent crude prices above $80 barrel, easing fears that Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of OPEC, would push for an increase in output.
3. Will Elon Musk Tweet About DoJ Request?
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors will be on the lookout for any follow-up to news the company is facing a criminal investigation, especially from CEO Elon Musk.
The company confirmed it had received a request to voluntarily supply documents from the Justice Department, following a report from Bloomberg.
This is the latest development after Musk tweeted that he had the funds to take the company private for $420, but later did a U-turn.
“We respect the DOJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received,” the company said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.
It’s possible the outspoken Musk will tweet something out regarding the investigation, but for now his feed has been focused on SpaceX.

1262,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","America First Won't Last Much Longer in Stocks, JPMorgan Warns","(Bloomberg) -- For the last few months in stocks, the world’s loss has often seemed like America’s gain. The S&P 500 is up almost 9 percent while everything else is down more than 6 percent, taken as a whole. It won’t last.
This is the latest warning from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists led by Marko Kolanovic, who say to cut holdings in U.S. equities and add money in emerging markets. As the benefits from President Donald Trump’s tax cuts dissipate, the world’s largest economy is set to lose its edge in growth, they said.
“The large U.S. fiscal boost this year, as well as the delayed positive impact of weak USD and low rates from last year created a ‘sugar high’ for U.S. assets this year,” the strategists wrote in a note to clients. “We expect convergence of macro fundamentals between U.S. and international markets in the coming quarters; with equity markets tending to price forward fundamentals by six to 12 months, the time for the rotation may be now.”
The call goes against a herd of money managers who are embracing U.S. stocks with increasing ardor. According to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch’s latest investor survey, allocation to America rose to the highest since January 2015 while exposure to emerging-market equities fell to the lowest in more than two years.
It’s a preference that’s been working. The S&P 500 is hovering near a record high and in the midst of its sixth straight monthly advance. Developing countries are mired in a bear market and equity gauges in Europe and Asia are down for 2018.
While Trump’s policies partly explain the divergence, with a new around of tariffs just imposed on China this week, Kolanovic said that assuming the U.S. is immune to a trade war is a risky bet. Additionally, should trade tensions ease, the stocks that have been battered amid fear of a global trade war should start rebounding.
Last week, JPMorgan estimated that the combined per-share earnings for S&P 500 companies could drop by as much as $10 if bilateral tariffs of 25 percent are imposed. This year’s earnings forecast for the benchmark is $165 per share.
“We gradually trim exposure to U.S. stocks and dollar assets, as they acted as a trade war ‘safe haven’ so far, but investors may ultimately rotate into more attractive foreign assets if trade concerns ease,” Kolanovic wrote. “The trade war and asset outflows already impacted foreign assets, creating an FX advantage and attractive valuations.”"
1263,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Rallies as Tech Rebounds, Tariffs Less Harsh Than Feared","Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed higher on Tuesday as softer-than-expected tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China put the brakes on the prospect of a full-blown trade war, prompting a wave of buying across stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.71%. The S&P 500 rose 0.54%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
The latest merry-go-round in the U.S.-China trade dispute did little to suggest that a full-blown trade war near. Both nations' trade salvos were less harsh than many heard feared.
China said it will impose new tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion on Sept. 24, but levies would be instituted at lower rates than had been expected, according to a Reuters report. China's tariff rate on a list of 5,207 U.S. products will range between 5% and 10%, below the previously touted 10% to 20% rate.
The announcement arrived after the Trump administration announced the U.S. will impose 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods next week. Those duties will more than double to a rate of 25% on Jan. 1.
""As before, we estimate the direct effects of these tariffs on Chinese export volumes and GDP to be low,"" Goldman Sachs said.
With the United States only set to hike up the levies in 2019, some suggested there was ample opportunity for the both nations to seek a resolution.
President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are slated to meet in November.
In a sign of optimism on the trade-war front, both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which have significant exposure to China, ended the day higher.
A rebound in tech, also lifted the broader averages higher as bargain-seeking investors swooped in on beaten-up tech stocks, which had come under pressure Monday.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) posted gains for the day. Both were helped by easing fears over loss of revenues from smartwatches and Bluetooth devices -- two items, among others, that were scrubbed off the list of products subject to levies.
Rising energy stocks, fuelled by a sharp uptick in oil prices, also led the broader market higher, as investor expectations for tighter global crude output received a boost.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for November delivery rose 1.4% to settle at $69.85 a barrel.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares slumped after the electric automaker confirmed the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating Chief Executive Elon Musk's public statements in August, in which he claimed to have secured funding to take the company private.
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) stock, meanwhile, also saw sharp losses amid a mixed fiscal first-quarter report as earnings topped estimates, but revenue fell short. And FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock slumped 5.5% after its quarterly profit missed consensus.

Tilray is interested in the burgeoning market for consumer products that use ingredients from marijuana, CEO Brendan Kennedy said in an interview in New York Tuesday. “We’ve had lots of conversations with lots of companies,” he said, though he declined to provide specific details about any potential partnerships.
His comments come in the wake of high-profile cannabis industry investments by Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ). in Canopy Growth Corp., the company Tilray just dethroned to become the largest pot stock. Beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. is also studying the potential of drinks infused with CBD -- the non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.But Kennedy said he’s not interested in getting taken over by a large consumer company.
“I don’t want to get bought by AB-InBev or  Diageo  (LON:DGE), I want to be that company,” he added.
Tilray, based in British Columbia, Canada, has seen its shares soar nearly 800 percent since it debuted in public trading in July. The stock spiked again on Tuesday, rising as much as 28 percent to a record $153.88 per share after the company announced it had received U.S. approval to import medical cannabis to California for a research project.
The company’s market value has surged more than Kennedy expected in such a short period of time, but he’s not worried it’s overvalued. Well-known activist short-seller Andrew Left has suggested Tilray’s shares are destined to fall, and there have been calls for the company, which only listed a small percentage of its shares, to release more.
Kennedy noted that Tilray’s IPO was just two months ago, although he added that he’s always looking for ways to raise capital.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>","SeaWorld, ex-CEO settle SEC charges they hid 'Blackfish' impact","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - SeaWorld Entertainment Inc and former Chief Executive James Atchison will pay more than $5 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that they misled investors about the negative impact of the documentary ""Blackfish"" on the company.
""Blackfish,"" released in July 2013, had depicted as cruel the captivity and exhibition of orcas, or killer whales, including by SeaWorld.
The SEC on Tuesday said SeaWorld and Atchison downplayed the documentary's impact from Dec. 2013 to Aug. 2014, even as bad publicity began hurting attendance and SeaWorld's reputation.
SeaWorld's share price tumbled 32.9 percent on Aug. 13, 2014, wiping out more than $832 million of shareholder value, after the Orlando, Florida-based company finally acknowledged the ""Blackfish effect,"" the SEC said.
""This case underscores the need for a company to provide investors with timely and accurate information that has an adverse impact on its business,"" Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement.
SeaWorld decided in 2016 to end its orca breeding programs and phase out killer whale shows.
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, SeaWorld agreed to a $4 million fine, and Atchison agreed to pay more than $1 million in fines and disgorgement.
The SEC said Atchison avoided $730,860 of losses by selling SeaWorld stock at inflated prices under a prearranged trading plan during the first quarter of 2014.
Both defendants had been accused of violating a federal law that lets the SEC pursue civil fraud claims based on alleged negligence, rather than an intent to defraud.
Atchison resigned as chief executive in January 2015.
In a statement on behalf of itself and Atchison, SeaWorld said it was pleased to settle, and to continue focusing on customers, rescuing animals and providing ""world-class animal care.""
A former SeaWorld communications vice president, Frederick Jacobs, agreed to pay $100,000 to settle a related SEC charge. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The settlements require court approval.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",EU to step up legal battle with Britain over import scam,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected to step up a legal battle on Wednesday against Britain to recover 2.7 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in lost revenues due to an import scam, two European officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
Commission officials will send a second letter urging Britain to pay back the lost revenues, which follows a first letter sent in March, steps that could lead to a referral to the EU court of justice.
The move is considered ""politically sensitive,"" a third official said, as it would come in the crucial phase of Britain's negotiations with its European Union partners over its departure from the bloc in March.
The Commission is seeking to recover customs duties that should have been collected on imports of Chinese footwear and textiles but were not, due to fraud. The scam caused losses to the EU budget, which is partly funded with customs duties. It could also have led to a loss of VAT revenue, EU officials said.
A British government spokesperson said: ""The UK does not accept liability for the alleged losses or recognize the estimate of alleged duty evaded. We take customs fraud very seriously.""
The move is part of a lengthy procedure that could eventually lead to financial sanctions, although the process usually takes years to complete and only in rare cases has ended with fines for states.
The EU has also said it will try to block what it sees as British moves to expand the list of services and goods exempted from Value Added Tax (VAT).
Under EU rules, member states can grant VAT exemptions only in exceptional circumstances. In contrast to other countries, Britain has a long list of VAT-free products and services because they were subject to a zero rate well before the EU rules entered into force.

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","SunPower receives exemption from Trump tariffs, shares soar","(Reuters) - SunPower Corp (O:SPWR) on Tuesday said some of the solar cells and panels it produces overseas will be excluded from the Trump administration's 30 percent import tariffs, sending the company's shares up 15 percent.
SunPower is based in San Jose, California but produces most of its solar products in Mexico and the Philippines. The company has publicly lobbied for its products to be exempt from the tariffs, arguing the funds it was spending on duties were being diverted from investments in American jobs in research and development and domestic manufacturing.
The exemption covers SunPower's premium, high-efficiency interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells and modules, which the company argued stood apart from the cheap, commoditized imports that dominate the market and were the target of the tariffs.
""With today's decision that SunPower's highly differentiated IBC cells and modules are excluded from tariffs, we are able to turn the page,"" SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner said in a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump in January announced a 30-percent tariff on all imported solar panels, an opening salvo in an escalating global trade dispute he said was aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers and other businesses rebound from years of decline. Much of the U.S. solar industry protested the move, saying it would chill one of America's fastest-growing sectors.
SunPower, which earlier this year agreed to buy a U.S. solar manufacturing facility in Oregon from SolarWorld Americas to expand production in its home market, said the deal would close before the end of this quarter. 
SunPower said the decision by the U.S. Trade Representative to exempt some of its products from tariffs would be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

SunPower shares were up $1.01, or 15 percent, at $7.59 on the Nasdaq. SunPower is majority owned by France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF).

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland has fully recovered 13.1 billion euros in disputed taxes from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) plus interest of 1.2 billion which it will hold in an escrow fund pending its appeal against an EU tax ruling, Ireland's finance minister said on Tuesday.
The European Commission ruled in August 2016 that Apple had received unfair tax incentives. Both Apple and Dublin are appealing against the original ruling, saying the iPhone maker's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law.
While the 14.3 billion euros would be enough to fund the country's health service for a year, the government says it has never given any company a special deal and that the appeal is important to preserve Ireland's attractiveness for investment.
""While the government fundamentally disagrees with the Commission's analysis and is seeking an annulment of that decision, as committed members of the European Union, we have always confirmed that we would recover the alleged State aid,"" Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.
Ireland's finance ministry, which began collecting the back taxes in a series of payments in May, estimated last year the total amount could have reached 15 billion euros including EU interest.
Ireland has appointed investment managers to oversee the disputed cash, whom Donohoe said would make low-risk investment decisions and the Irish taxpayer would be protected from any losses.
For its part, the Commission said it will scrap its lawsuit against Ireland which it initiated last year because of delays in recovering the money.
""In light of the full payment by Apple of the illegal State aid it had received from Ireland, Commissioner (Margrethe) Vestager will be proposing to the College of Commissioners the withdrawal of this court action,"" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email.
Ireland's finance ministry said its appeal had been granted priority status and is progressing through the various stages of private written proceedings before the General Court of the European Union (GCEU), Europe's second highest court. 

The matter will likely take several years to be settled by the European courts, it added.

Visa and Mastercard previously reached a $7.25 billion settlement with the merchants in the case, but that deal was thrown out by a federal appeals court in 2016 and the U.S. Supreme Court last year refused to revive it.
The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers opted out.
The card issuers named in the class-action lawsuit include JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The lawsuit, brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers and dating back more than a decade, accuses the credit card companies of violating federal antitrust laws by forcing merchants to pay swipe fees and prohibiting them from directing consumers toward other methods of payment.
In rejecting the earlier settlement, which was opposed by retailers including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, a federal appeals court found that the accord was unfair because some retailers would receive little or no benefit.
The card companies have already paid $5.3 billion and will now pay an additional $900 million.
Mastercard will pay an additional $108 million from funds set aside in the second quarter, the company said https://reut.rs/2OA2V0i.
Visa's share represents around $4.1 billion, which the company expects to pay using funds previously deposited with the court, and from a litigation escrow it set up on June 28.
The settlement must still be approved by a court.

MARANELLO, Italy (Reuters) -  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) plans to launch 15 new models, including hybrid cars, a utility vehicle and more special editions as part of its new chief executive's efforts to double core earnings by 2022.
The supercar maker shifted to a guidance range for adjusted core earnings of 1.8-2.0 billion euros ($2.1-2.3 billion) by 2022, rather than the 2 billion figure set by late Ferrari boss Sergio Marchionne. But his successor sought to reassure investors that the company can maintain recent strong growth.
""This is an ambitious plan, but a doable one based on a concrete, detailed framework,"" Louis Camilleri said on Tuesday at the company's Maranello headquarters in Italy.
Ferrari shares gained 0.6 percent by 1330 GMT, recovering from earlier losses. The stock slid more than 8 percent on Aug. 1 when Camilleri described Marchionne's targets as ""aspirational"". 
Marchionne's sudden death in July jolted investors who had expected the auto industry grandee to remain at the wheel until 2021, having more than doubled Ferrari's market value since taking it public in 2015.
Camilleri and his team outlined a plan to show how a brand known for its racing pedigree and roaring combustion engines will shift to making a utility vehicle and hybrid cars and boost margins to over 38 percent without sacrificing exclusivity.
The company increased its dividend payout ratio and announced a 1.5 billion-euro share buyback plan. 
Its marketing chief also promised a ""significant increase in average retail price"".
FOLLOWING THE MAP
With margins at 30 percent now, strong pricing power and an enviable customer waiting list, Camilleri inherits a business firing on all cylinders and is not expected to stray far from his predecessor's script.
Marchionne had orchestrated Ferrari's spin-off from parent  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), positioned it as a luxury brand rather than a carmaker, and managed to do what few thought possible: sail through a self-imposed production cap of 7,000 cars a year without sacrificing pricing power or its exclusive appeal.
Ferrari has clocked up years of record earnings, helped by special editions and a customization program.
But it could prove tough to maintain the company's high valuation as emissions rules tighten, capital spending increases and the diverging interests of investors, racing fans, owners and collectors become harder to balance.
A total of 3.6 billion euros will be spent over the period to develop new vehicles and shift toward hybrids, aiming to remain compliant with gradually tougher emissions regulations.
The company said hybrid vehicles would make up around 60 percent of its product mix by the end of the plan, while a smaller six-cylinder engine would be added to its lineup of internal combustion engines.
At the time of the IPO, Marchionne had promised to expand Ferrari into other luxury categories beyond cars, but the plan was put on ice to focus on vehicles first. Camilleri said that expansion was still a ""work in progress"". 
THOROUGHBRED
Ferrari declined to give any forecast for shipments other than saying that more than half of those would be sportscars. 
This year's deliveries are forecast at over 9,000 vehicles. 
At the event, Ferrari unveiled the single-seater Monza SP1 and two-seater Monza SP2, a pair of open-topped, limited edition sportscars, as part of a new segment dubbed ""Icona"" inspired by past Ferraris but boasting the latest technologies. 
Ferrari ruled out a self-driving model, but added that its much-debated utility vehicle would come by the end of the plan. 
The vehicle, called ""Purosangue"" (Thoroughbred), could potentially lead to a substantial growth in sales, analysts have said, while Ferrari expects the car to also help lure the super rich in China.
Camilleri sought to sooth concerns the vehicle could dilute Ferrari's exclusive status.
""As a die-hard Ferrarista, I have been a little sceptical when the concept was first voiced at the board,"" the known Ferrari collector said. 

""Having now seen the wonderful design concept, the extraordinary features ... I am a hugely enthusiastic supporter."" ($1 = 0.8548 euros)

1294,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Tilray Is First Canadian Company to Import Medical Pot to U.S.,"(Bloomberg) --  Tilray Inc  . (NASDAQ:TLRY) has received approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to import cannabis into the U.S. for medical research, the first Canadian company to do so.
Tilray will work with the University of California San Diego’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research on a clinical trial to test whether the drug can effectively treat essential tremor, a common neurological disorder that causes uncontrollable shaking and affects more than 4 percent of people over age 65.
“I think it’s really exciting that we’re targeting this indication that no one else has thought of targeting,” said Catherine Jacobson, director of clinical research at Nanaimo, British Columbia-based Tilray. “It’s showing that these cannabinoids may be effective at treating a number of diseases that people hadn’t thought of before.”
Dr. Fatta Nahab, a neurologist at UC San Diego and the principal investigator for the study, said his first exposure to the idea of using cannabis to treat the disorder came a few years ago when a young male patient who he’d been tracking suddenly showed an improvement in his tremors.
“In talking to him further, he indicated he’d smoked some marijuana the night before, which led me to wonder whether this could be a feasible therapy,” Nahab said in an interview. A second elderly female patient also showed an improvement after trying cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound in cannabis that doesn’t have the same “high” effect as the THC compound.
The issue for medical researchers and doctors is that they don’t know what formulation or dosage works best when patients self-medicate using medical marijuana. Meanwhile, other patients who’ve tried cannabis and didn’t notice an improvement may have used an ineffective product or dosage.
“Patients are put in the uncomfortable position of having to go to a dispensary without any understanding of how cannabis works and just pick a product and hope that they get the dose right, hope that they get the product right,” Jacobson said.
The clinical trial will test an oral capsule with a 20-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC on 16 patients who have been diagnosed with essential tremor. Currently, the disorder is treated using drugs originally developed for high blood pressure or seizures.
Tilray is conducting four other clinical trials on the benefits of medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chemotherapy-induced nausea, the side effects of glioblastoma -- an aggressive type of brain cancer -- and Dravet syndrome, a rare form of pediatric epilepsy.
The company’s stock price has soared since its trading debut in July, gaining over 600 percent to Monday’s close and surpassing a market value of $11 billion. Shares added another 9 percent in pre-market trading in New York on Tuesday."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's High Court on Tuesday rejected a second extradition request from Switzerland against Herve Falciani for leaking details of thousands of clients of HSBC's (L:HSBA) private bank.
Hailed as a hero by some for triggering tax evasion investigations in several countries by leaking details of HSBC clients, Swiss courts sentenced Falciani, a French citizen who worked for the bank, in absentia to five years in jail.
The Spanish court denied the extradition request over alleged industrial sabotage by Falciani in 2008 because the charges in the Swiss ruling are not considered a crime in Spain.
""The Spanish Criminal Code does not include any charge similar to the crime of 'aggravated financial espionage' for which the Swiss justice had sentenced Falciani to a 5-year prison sentence,"" the court said on Tuesday.
Last week, Falciani told an extradition hearing that he had helped other countries uncover tax frauds.
Spanish courts and anti-corruption prosecutors have played a key role in such investigations by passing on information that originated from Falciani.
France, Austria, Belgium, Spain and Argentina launched investigations based on the leaked data, but Swiss authorities insist it was stolen and therefore legally inadmissible.
APPEAL POSSIBLE 
The Spanish prosecutor said last week that charges were different in both countries and that the information Falciani collected from HSBC was never transmitted to private individuals, but only to official organizations.
The Spanish ruling can be appealed within three days, although Switzerland's Federal Office of Justice, which lodged the extradition request, declined to comment on it.
If Switzerland were to appeal, a special section of the High Court would rule on it, but the Spanish government would have the final say as extradition requests are usually submitted to the Justice Ministry.
Falciani was arrested in Madrid in April while on his way to speak at a conference on whistleblowing. Spain's High Court released him the next day, but ordered him to remain in Spain while the extradition request was considered.
Falciani had been detained once before in Spain on Switzerland's request - on a trip in 2012. He was released after the High Court ruled against his extradition.

On Tuesday, the Spanish court said Switzerland's extradition request was identical to that of March 2013 and it deferred to the previous rejection in its ruling.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), the world's top maker of diabetes drugs, said on Tuesday it will lay off 400 staff in Denmark and China in order to divert funding toward investment in biological and technological innovation.
The firm, which employs more than 42,000 people in 79 countries, has seen growth slow due to pricing pressures in the United States, from where it sources about half its revenue.
""This is not a cost-cutting exercise,"" Novo's chief science officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in an interview, noting that his research and development budget will be larger in 2019 than this year. 
""Our analysis shows that we have a surplus of manual labor and are lacking competences in the digital sphere, informatics, data science, artificial intelligence and automations.""
The company plans to increase investment in innovation within both its core therapy areas and new ones. 
As part of this it will establish four new ""biotech-like units"" this year in Denmark, the United States and the United Kingdom to pursue innovation in areas like stem-cell research. 
Novo Nordisk will also increase its investment in automation and digital capabilities, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, it said.
It announced 1,000 job cuts in 2016 as competition among insulin producers increased and prices were squeezed by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who administer drug programs for employers and health plans.
Novo Nordisk said in May that new U.S. legislation aimed at reining in high drug prices would cut its 2019 sales by 1-2 percent.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. technology giants, facing tighter content rules in China and the threat of a trade war, are targeting an easier way into the world's second largest economy - artificial intelligence. 
Google (O:GOOGL), Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT) and Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) showcased their AI wares at a state-backed forum held in Shanghai this week against the backdrop of Beijing's plans to build a $400 billion AI industry by 2025.
China's government and companies may compete against U.S. rivals in the global AI race, but they are aware that gaining ground won't be easy without a certain amount of collaboration.
""Hey Google, let's make humanity great again,"" Tang Xiao'ou, CEO of Chinese AI and facial recognition unicorn Sensetime, said in a speech on Monday.
Amazon and Microsoft announced plans on Monday to build new AI research labs in Shanghai. Google also showcased a growing suite of China-focused AI tools at its packed event on Tuesday.
Google in the past year has launched AI-backed products including a translate app and a drawing game, its first new consumer products in China since its search engine was largely blocked in 2010.
The World Artificial Intelligence Conference, which ends on Wednesday, is hosted by China's top economic planning agency alongside its cyber and industry ministries. The conference aims to show the country's growing might as a global AI player.
China's ambition to be a world leader in AI has created an opening for U.S. firms, which attract the majority of top global AI talents and are keen to tap into China's vast data. 
The presence of global AI research projects is also a boon for China, which aims to become a global technology leader in the next decade. 
Liu He, China's powerful vice premier and the key negotiator in trade talks with the United States, said his country wanted a more collaborative approach to AI technology.
""As members of a global village, I hope countries can show inclusive understanding and respect for each other, deal with the double-sword technologies can bring, and embrace AI challenges together,"" he told the forum.
Beijing took an aggressive stance when it laid out its AI roadmap last year, urging companies, the government and military to give China a ""competitive edge"" over its rivals.
STATE-BACKED AI
Chinese attendees at the forum were careful to cite the guiding role of the state in the country's AI sector. 
""The development of AI is led by government and executed by companies,"" a Chinese presenter said in between speeches on Monday by China's top tech leaders, including  Alibaba  Holding Ltd (N:BABA) chairman Jack Ma, Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) chief Pony Ma and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) CEO Robin Li.
While China may have enthusiasm for foreign AI projects, there is little indication that building up local AI operations will open doors for foreign firms in other areas. 
China's leaders still prefer to view the Internet as a sovereign project. Google's search engine remains blocked, while Amazon had to step back from its cloud business in China.
Censorship and local data rules have also hardened in China over the past two years, creating new hoops for foreign firms to jump through if they want to tap the booming internet sector.
Nevertheless, some speakers paid tribute to foreign AI products, including  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) chief executive Lei Jun, who hailed Google's Alpha Go board game program as a major milestone, saying he was a fan of the game himself.
Alibaba's Ma said innovation needed space to develop and it was not the government's role to protect business.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. will put 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, which will go up to 25% at the end of the year.
Trump added that ""if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports.""
China said Tuesday that it has no choice but to retaliate against the tariffs.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up 0.46% in premarket trading after the White House spared a category of high-tech products from tariffs that Apple uses for its Watch and AirPods.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 2.53% while  Avon Products  Inc (NYSE:AVP) surged 10.58% amid reports that Brazil’s Natura Cosmeticos (SA:NATU3) has approached the cosmetics company about a takeover.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Shares shrug as Trump fires off $200 billion of China tariffs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Who's afraid of the big bad trade war? Not world stock markets it seems.
The response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to go ahead next week with collecting 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, ratcheting up to 25 percent in January, was unusual and unexpected on Tuesday.
It initially hit U.S. stocks, Treasuries and the dollar while stirring a rally in Chinese equities (SS) and the yuan. 
China then confirmed it would retaliate but still traders refused to flinch. 
European stocks inched toward a third day of gains, futures pointed to a rebuond from Wall Street (ESc1) (N) and even copper and the Aussie dollar , which have been highly sensitive to the trade tensions, held firm.
""In a way it is remarkable that the market is holding up so well,"" said Rabobank's Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot.
""This is clearly a further ratcheting up of the trade war and we are now getting close to a situation where you can almost speak of a full-fledged trade war. Clearly that is not positive."" 
One theory for the becalmed reaction was that the $200 billion U.S. move had been largely priced in to markets following weeks of reports and social media speculation.
Chinese shares had initially dipped as Asia digested the details but then rallied to the point where the blue-chip CSI index (CSI300) closed up 2 percent. Some locals were betting that Beijing will step up infrastructure investment to keep the economy humming.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) also ended 1.4 percent higher and MSCI's 24-country emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five as 1 percent gains in Poland (WIG20), Russia (IRTS) and Turkey (XU100) added to Asia's rebound.
Trump's announcement ""is largely consistent with the claims made earlier,"" Citi analysts said in a note, estimating a 33 basis point drag on China's economic growth from the 10 percent tariff.
Dutch bank ING, meanwhile, estimated that 2.5 percent of world trade was now affected by the tariffs and will be 4 percent if Trump carries out a threat to put them on the remainder of Chinese imports unless Beijing meets his demands.
""Although this percentage may seem small, the tariffs will disrupt Sino-American supply chains, and may, therefore, triple the effects on world trade,"" ING warned.
LIQUIDATING SHORTS
China's promise to respond to the new U.S. tariffs also came as The South China Morning Post newspaper reported Beijing was reviewing plans to send a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He to Washington for trade talks.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing later that the U.S. steps had brought ""new uncertainty"" to talks between the two countries.
""China has always emphasized that the only correct way to resolve the China-U.S. trade issue is via talks and consultations held on an equal, sincere and mutually respectful basis. But at this time, everything the United States does not give the impression of sincerity or goodwill,"" he added.
In currencies, the dollar was broadly flat at 94.438 (DXY) although on an individual basis it was a fraction firmer against the Japanese yen at just shy of 112 .
At the same time it was down slightly against the Chinese yuan in 'offshore' markets . The sensitive Australian dollar  also moved up 0.4 percent to $0.7212 having also initially been hit when the tariff details broke. 
With FX participants wary that Beijing authorities may quickly step in to markets at any point, investors were ""spontaneously"" liquidating their short yuan positions said a trader at one Chinese bank.
""China is likely to reject the invitation from the U.S. Treasury for the new round of trade talk,"" OCBC Bank also said in a note on Tuesday. 
Oil prices fell on worries rising trade tensions could dent global demand for crude. 
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) fell 21 cents to $68.70 a barrel while international benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) lost 35 cents to $77.70 per barrel.

Gold was weaker too, with spot prices  down 0.1 percent at $1,199.2 an ounce.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","EU probes VW, BMW, Daimler over alleged emissions collusion","By Philip Blenkinsop and Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are investigating whether BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) colluded to restrict the rollout of clean emission technology, a move that could lead to hefty fines for the German carmakers.
The European Commission opened an in-depth investigation on Tuesday, nearly a year after it raided the companies and two years after it slapped a record 2.93 billion euro ($3.4 billion)fine on a group of truckmakers including Daimler for fixing prices and delaying the adoption of cleaner engine technology.
The EU executive said the ""circle of five"" - BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen Group's VW, Audi and Porsche - held meetings where they may have colluded to limit the development and roll-out of certain emissions control systems for cars sold in Europe.
""These technologies aim at making passenger cars less damaging to the environment. If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The Commission said the technologies involved were selective catalytic reduction systems, which reduce nitrogen oxides from diesel car emissions, and ""Otto"" particulate filters that reduce particulate matter emissions from petrol cars.
The EU antitrust enforcer said the carmakers had also discussed other technical issues, such as common requirements for car parts and testing procedures, but it did not have sufficient indications that these meetings were anti-competitive.
It also said there were no signs that the companies illegally coordinated with each other in the use of so-called defeat devices to cheat regulatory testing. Volkswagen admitted to using such illegal software in 2015, sparking a scandal that has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.
Volkswagen and Daimler, which has claimed whistleblower status to avoid any fines, said they were cooperating with the Commission. BMW said it would continue to support the EU authority.
Campaign group Transport & Environment said it was time for regulators to take action.
""The automotive industry was once a jewel in Europe’s industrial crown, but its global reputation is now deeply tarnished and cannot be trusted anymore,"" said Greg Archer, a director at the group. 
""It has become its own worst enemy and needs regulators to act with strength and decisiveness to clean it up and establish rules that put it on a path to zero emissions.""
Companies can face fines up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU rules. The car industry has in recent years faced billion euro fines worldwide for fixing prices of various auto parts.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (N:BABA) chairman Jack Ma said on Tuesday that trade frictions between the United States and China could last for two decades and would be ""a mess"" for all parties involved, citing weak trade rules. 
Ma was speaking at an Alibaba investor conference hours after Washington said it would impose duties on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, drawing a warning from Beijing that it would retaliate.
Ma said trade tensions would likely impact Chinese and foreign companies immediately and negatively. He predicted that Chinese businesses would move production to other countries in the medium-term to get around the tariffs. 
""You may win the battle, but you lose the war,"" Ma said at the shareholder event in Hangzhou.
""Middle term, a lot of Chinese business will move to other countries,"" he added.
Ma said new trade rules were needed over the longterm. 
""Even if Donald Trump retired, the new president will come, it will still continue...We need new trade rules, we need to upgrade the WTO,"" he said, referring to the World Trade Organization. 
Ma made the comments in what he said was his last speech to shareholders as chairman of the Chinese internet giant.
He announced last week that he will step down within a year and hand the company reins to chief executive Daniel Zhang. 
Ma met with U.S. President Donald Trump last year in a high-profile meeting where he promised to create 1 million U.S. jobs linked to small merchants selling items on Alibaba platforms. 

Trade relations have since deteriorated between China and the U.S. in a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs.

The move is part of a mid-term strategy which Chief Executive Louis Camilleri will present on Tuesday. 
The Monza models were inspired by the style of the ‘barchetta’, a term originally used for lightweight, open-topped racing cars of the 1940s and 1950s. 
They will offer 810 horsepower and a lightweight carbon fiber body.
""Barchettas were the most intoxicating experience for any pilot,"" head of product marketing Nicola Boari told a news conference to unveil the new models. 
Ferrari will build fewer than 500 of the two models combined and all have been assigned to eligible clients already.
They were first shown to investors and customers late on Monday. They will be shown to the public at the Paris auto show next month where the company will also unveil pricing details. 
Ferrari will release photos of the cars at 1700 GMT on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares followed their Asian peers upwards after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and warned of duties on more products if China took retaliatory action. 
After opening flat, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent at 0837 GMT, weighed down by a 0.1 percent dip in the FTSE 100. 
Trading centers in the euro zone such as Germany's DAX posted strong rises. Home to large exporters and carmakers which are seen likely to suffer badly from an all out global trade war, Frankfurt was up 0.5 percent.
Other bourses in Europe such as Paris were also in positive territory, with the CAC 40 <.FCHO> up 0.6 percent. 
Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet, said ahead of the U.S. trade announcement investors might well be prepared for it and take the view that the Trump administration had shown some restraint as it could have imposed even higher tariffs.
""Ten percent could actually come as a relief"", he said, adding that such a figure would be ""bad but manageable"". 
Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said on Tuesday the fine print of the new tariffs could also be seen as providing some relief. 
""Exemptions have turned this into something of a sell the rumour, buy the fact type scenario for investors"", he said.
Mergers and acquisitions prompted steep moves across European bourses. 
The top gainer was Norway's Schibsted ASA, up 11.1 percent after it said it would spin off its international online classifieds. 
Denmark's  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) jumped 9 percent in large volumes. A trader cited a report that private equity funds were considering a possible offer for the company as a reason for the share price rise. 
Swiss chemical group  Clariant  (S:CLN) was up 6.5 percent after it announced it would merge its high-performance materials business with that of new anchor shareholder Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) (SE:2010), to focus on higher-value speciality chemicals.
Zalando (DE:ZALG) Europe's biggest pure online fashion retailer, was the worst performer, down 14 percent after blaming a long, hot summer for cutting its 2018 outlook.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian farmers and U.S. manufacturers of medical devices could be among the main winners in a trade package under negotiation, as Washington and New Delhi look to remove long-standing irritants to ties, sources familiar with the talks said.
Having skirmished for months over tit-for-tat tariffs on steel and some agricultural products, the two sides began talks in June that also cover India's concerns over U.S. steel tariffs and U.S. problems with Indian tariffs on imported IT equipment.
""We are closely negotiating a discrete package of trade issues. It will amount to a pretty substantive agreement,"" said a source with knowledge of the negotiations.
Neither the office of the United States Trade Representative or India's trade ministry responded to a request for comment.
The source said the two sides expected to close the deal in the next few weeks.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who dislikes multilateral trade agreements, said earlier this month that India had approached the United States to ""start doing a trade deal,"" without giving any details.
The current discussions, however, are focused on removing outstanding sources of friction, and are not aimed at creating a bilateral free trade agreement, sources from both sides said.
Having already waded into bigger fights with China and the European Union, Trump has previously called out India for unfair trade practices. At an estimated $126 billion, U.S. goods and services trade with India last year was less than a fifth of its trade with China.
Unlike some other countries India failed to be given a waiver after the Trump administration imposed new import tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March.
New Delhi retaliated by raising tariffs on a number of U.S. products but has held back from implementing them while it negotiates a package to soothe ties. The tariffs were to go into effect from Monday midnight but the government issued an order saying these had been deferred until Nov. 2.
""Our relationship with the U.S. unlike many other nations has not deteriorated,"" said an Indian government official involved in the talks. ""But if you think relations have become very friendly with a lot of bonhomie, I don't think that has happened either.""
CAPPING MARGINS, NOT PRICES
U.S. companies are hungrily watching an Indian economy that is growing at more than 8 percent, as they seek presence in a market that has potential for massive growth.
One of the most prominent trade issues to erupt during Trump's presidency has involved India's treatment of medical devices imported from the United States. Last year, U.S. exports of medical devices and equipment to India totaled $863 million.
India last year equated high profit margins of medical device makers with ""illegal profiteering"", capping prices for some heart stents - small wire-mesh structures used to treat blocked arteries - and knee implants, to help poor patients.
That measure provoked a storm of criticism from U.S. companies, such as  Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT), Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (N:JNJ) and Boston Scientific (N:BSX), which said such controls hurt innovation and future investment plans.
In June, India's federal think tank Niti Aayog invited industry views on a new policy which would cap trade margins, and not prices, to help patients while allowing the industry ""reasonable profits"".
Two Indian government sources said the think tank had recommended allowing a maximum 65 percent trade margin -- the difference between the price at which a company sells to its stockists, after recovering its operational expenses, and the price paid by patients.
The recommendation has still to be accepted by Modi's office, another source said.
The new policy proposal, which is favored by both J&J and Boston Scientific according to company letters seen by Reuters, would help manufacturers who have argued that outright price caps were at times below their import costs and led to losses.

One of the main areas where India is likely to benefit will be agricultural trade, with Washington expected to grant concessions making it easier for Indian exporters of products like rice, mangoes, table grapes and lychees the sources said.
Currently, the United States imports just a small fraction of the $5.5 billion of rice shipped annually from India, the world's top rice exporter. New Delhi wants to sell basmati rice but U.S. agencies have in the past flagged concerns over the presence of chemical residues in the rice.
New Delhi is also discussing how to meet stringent U.S. standards to sell bovine meat. India is the world's biggest buffalo meat exporter but has failed to make much headway in the U.S. market because of Washington's insistence that a country be free from foot-and-mouth disease.
The two sides are exploring ways to open the U.S. market for certain grades of bovine meat from India, according to the Indian government negotiator and the other sources familiar with the talks.
For its part, the United States wants to sell more almonds to India, the world's top buyer, cherries and eventually dairy products.
The United States has also been urging India to lower the input costs of components for IT that would allow U.S. companies to manufacture in India as part of Modi's flagship Make-in-India campaign. These affect firms such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) with plans to set up operations in India.
The United States has complained that India's tariffs are among the highest in the world, and cover a range of IT equipment, including circuit boards, screens and memory chips.
""In this kind of a package, everything is interlinked even though our mutual concerns are on different issues,"" one of the sources said.

""But we need to reach an agreement on everything that's on the table.""

The yuan and the dollar traded slightly lower following the news.
Trump, in a statement, said that the tariffs would rise to 25% in January 2019, adding that ""if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports.""
According to reports, the U.S. removed about 300 goods from a previously proposed list of affected products, including smart watches, some chemicals, along with some other products.
Markets are now likely to shift focus towards Beijing’s response to the development, according to analysts.
The South China Morning Post newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source in Beijing, that China is now unlikely to send a delegation to the U.S. next week for fresh talks as previously planned.
“China may be limited in its ability to impose similar tariffs in volume terms, but it can still aim to disrupt the US supply chain with those tech exports an obvious target and the cancelation of trade talks is also likely to dampen the mood,” Rodrigo Catril, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at the National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 12:27AM ET</span>",Headwinds before takeoff for new Thai Airways team,"By Chayut Setboonsarng and Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Struggling national carrier Thai Airways International PCL is pinning hopes of a revival to its 1990s heyday on a new leadership team, jet purchases and improving its brand as tourism booms in the region. 
But the new president and chairman taking the helm are political appointees without aviation experience and several executives told Reuters the airline needs to adjust to a market where the good times of having a near-monopoly at home are long over. 
Challenges for the new team include cutting costs, managing a mixed fleet, coping with loss-making subsidiaries as well as healing long-time rifts between government-appointed management and airline veterans. 
Thailand has been the beneficiary of a boom in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, but as foreign airlines like Qatar Airways and China Eastern Airlines Corp have rushed to add flights, Thai Airways has reported annual losses for four of the last five years. 
""Thai Airways did not adapt quickly enough and competes in one of the world's toughest industries,"" former Thai Airways president Piyasvasti Amranand said. 
The structure of state enterprises in Thailand slows decision-making because the carrier needs to seek approval from many agencies for decisions, he said. 
Other national carriers in the region where the government takes an active role have had similar struggles; Malaysia Airlines has yet to return to profitability after two disasters in 2014 and Garuda Indonesia last week replaced its latest CEO after 17 months. 
In contrast, Singapore Airlines Ltd, majority-owned by state investor Temasek, and government-controlled Air New Zealand Ltd, are run in a hands-off manner and are profitable.
On paper, prospects are good for Thai Airways. Air traffic is booming in Asia - the International Air Transport Association forecast profits of Asia-Pacific airlines to increase 8.4 percent from last year to $9 billion in 2018. 
Also, Thailand expects 37.5 million visitors this year, up 6 percent from 2017, most of whom arrive by air.
UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT
But Thai Airways' new president, Sumeth Damrongchaitham, who started the job this month after an 18-month search, has his work cut out. 
The 53-year-old has to turn around the national carrier, which reported $93 million losses in its April-June quarter amid higher fuel prices.
Thai Airways last posted a profit in the first quarter of 2018. On an annual basis it posted a profit in 2016 and before that in 2012.
Sumeth's previous experience has been in managing government property and in the music industry
The military-led Thai government, which owns 51 percent of the airline, has representation on the board and oversight of investment plans. 
Jothin Pamon-Montri, a former senior vice president at the airline, said the lack of aviation experience was not necessarily a problem, but Sumeth would need to work closely with career employees.
""The president must consult management and listen to staff to solve problems and forget the outside advisers,"" Jothin said.
Sumeth will be working with a new board chairman, Ekniti Nitithanprapas, who ran the State Enterprise Policy Office from 2015 to 2018, a government unit that oversees the airline.
Ekniti, who took over in July, is seen as a capable bureaucrat but may have his plate full heading the government's revenue department and as chairman of the state-owned Krung Thai Bank.
Sumeth and Ekniti declined interview requests. 
Thai Airways did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
NOT ALL SMILES
Sources close to Thai Airways said a pressing issue was what to do with loss-making subsidiary Thai Smile, which was set up in 2012 as a mid-range brand when Piyasvasti was president.
Piyasvasti, who was president from 2009 to 2012, brought the airline into profitability but was removed abruptly by the then democratically-elected government.
In 2014, Thai Smile began operating under a separate license, in a move that airline sources said led to problems with service, network connectivity and to tension with the parent airline.
Jothin, who was at Thai Airways for 35 years, says a priority for the new team is to reintegrate Thai Smile under the Thai Airways brand and license.
""We had no plans to spin off Thai Smile into its own airline at the time. It was going to be another brand under Thai Airways,"" Piyasvasti said.
Singapore Airlines Ltd is planning to do that with its regional offshoot SilkAir to provide a more consistent experience for customers.
In the budget market, Nok Air, in which Thai Airways holds a 20 percent stake, has been unprofitable for the last four years in the face of rapid growth from competitors like Thai Lion Air and Thai AirAsia. 
""There could be an opportunity for Thai Airways to increase its involvement and potentially take over Nok,"" CAPA Center for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. ""Developing a new multi-brand strategy could be an important initial task for the new CEO. Such a strategy would strengthen Thai's long term position.""
TRIMMING THE FAT
Thai Airway's legacy of a mixed fleet after purchases by previous governments is another challenge. Most airlines like to operate only a few types of jets to gain economies of scale in areas like maintenance and pilot training.
But Thai Airways, which requires government approval for fleet purchases, operates almost every available type of Airbus SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co widebody jet, from A380s to 787s, but none in particularly large numbers.
The new leadership should ""focus on reducing expenses and trimming the fat,"" Piyasvasti said, adding that a fleet strategy should include a rolling plan for new aircraft and decommissioning old jets that are not fuel efficient. 
In July, the Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith said that the carrier would be purchasing 23 new jets for $3 billion but it has yet to place a formal order or disclose the types involved.
Thai Airways shares have fallen by 25 percent since January. Most analysts have ""neutral"" or ""sell"" recommendations on the stock as they wait to see Sumeth's strategy for reviving the carrier.

""It is important for Thai Airways to move forward with fleet renewal and acquisition, which has been repeatedly delayed and is now a pressing issue,"" CAPA's Sobie said. ""There is still work to do in the transformation and there are many challenges to overcome.""

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 11:32PM ET</span>",U.S. duties spare Apple gadgets but hit cloud industry,"By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - The United States will spare Apple Inc's Watch and other consumer gadgets from the latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods, according to a list of products released by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on Monday.
But parts for the computer servers and networking gear that power ""cloud"" data centers and internet-based services now face a levy, as do some of the parts for the machines used to make semiconductors.
U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with China on Monday, imposing 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and he warned that if China takes retaliatory action against U.S. farmers or industries, ""we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports.""
The administration's proposal drew protest from technology companies earlier this year, but the final list of taxed devices from the USTR avoids many big consumer brand names and products.
The iPhone was not among the 'wide range' of products that Apple told regulators would be hit by the $200 billion round of tariffs in a Sept. 5 comment letter to trade officials. Apple feared for its Apple Watch and its wireless AirPods headphones, but both were left off the list announced on Monday.
The new round of tariffs will take effect on Sept. 24 at a 10 percent level and rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019. 
However, if Trump expands the tariffs to an additional $267 billion worth of goods then nearly every Chinese import would be affected, including the iPhone, along with all other smart phones. Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 0.7 percent to $216.29 after hours.
Shares of China and Taiwan-based Apple suppliers slipped Tuesday morning in Asia. Foxconn, a Taiwan-based manufacturer formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, fell 2 percent, while assembler Pegatron Corp dropped 2.4 percent. Camera lens-maker Largan Precision Co Ltd slid nearly 9 percent.
In an earlier round of tariffs on $50 billion of goods, the Trump administration removed proposals on flat-panel television sets for the final list in June.
The new list would also spare fitness trackers from Fitbit Inc, which had said in a comment letter to regulators that the tariffs would compromise its own investment in the United States. Fitbit shares closed down 1 percent on Monday.
""We welcome this development and we appreciate the administration's time and effort to listen to industry and consumer concerns,"" a Fitbit spokeswoman told Reuters.
NEW LIST
However, some products that help computer networks operate, such as routers, will remain on the new list, the official said. That could affect smaller technology firms such as Eero, a startup company that makes home routers and had asked to be exempted from the tariffs. Altogether about 300 product categories were given reprieves, including some non-tech consumer devices such as bicycle helmets and baby car seats.
Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, and Eero declined to comment. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump last month, though neither gave details of discussions.
Apple had said the U.S. tariffs would affect prices for a ""wide range"" of Apple products, including its Watch, in a letter commenting on administration proposals earlier this month.
""Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,"" Apple said earlier in a letter commenting on the proposal.
After Apple's comments, Trump said in a tweet said that there was an ""easy solution"" for Apple to avoid tariffs. ""Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now,"" he tweeted on Sept. 8.
An array of equipment used to make servers and networking gear for data centers is on the list announced on Monday. 
A group of tech companies including Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), Dell Technologies Inc, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) had asked that many of those items be dropped, but they remained on the list with only a few exceptions such as a group of networking-related accessories.
The group said in a comment to trade regulators on Sept. 6 that ""by raising the cost of networking products, the proposed duties would impede the development and adoption of cloud-based services and infrastructure.""
Apple also told regulators earlier that some of the gear in its data centers was likely to be hit by tariffs.
The chip industry was also hit by the new levies. 
 Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX), a company that makes gear for manufacturing chips, said in a Sept. 6 letter to trade regulators that duties on raw silicon, ceramic machinery parts and other items ""add costs to our U.S. manufacturing operations and reduce our competitiveness in the global semiconductor manufacturing market."" All of the items in Lam's letter were included in the final list.
Neither Lam nor the group of enterprise technology companies immediately responded to request for comment.

The pledge from the Japan-led bank comes amidst a vigorous new campaign by the United States and its allies to check China's rising sway in the region, where it has sought deeper diplomatic ties and emerged as the second-largest donor.
The battle for influence in the sparsely populated Pacific matters because each of the tiny island states has a vote at international forums like the United Nations, and they also control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean. 
The ADB said it will open offices in the Cook Islands, Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and Tuvalu, as well as expand missions in Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu.
""The new country offices will allow ADB to have more regular contact and substantive communication with government and development partners,"" the bank said in a statement.
Its overall assistance to the Pacific, which stands at $2.9 billion, is expected to surpass $4 billion by 2020, it added, with the money destined for economic and social development projects and disaster resilience.
China has likewise pledged to keep lending to a region where it says its aid is supporting sustainable development.
However, it has spent $1.3 billion on concessionary loans and gifts since 2011, stoking concern in the West that several tiny nations could end up overburdened and in debt to Beijing.

Australia in particular, which has long viewed the Pacific as its backyard, has been critical of some Chinese aid projects, and a former foreign minister has warned that the lending could undermine the long-term sovereignty of recipients.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gary Cohn, the former economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, gave a ringing endorsement of Wall Street bankers on Monday, arguing that borrowers were just as responsible for the 2007-2009 financial crisis as lenders and ridiculing rules intended to make the system stronger in its aftermath.
In a wide-ranging conversation at an event hosted by Reuters Breakingviews that was pegged to the 10-year anniversary of Lehman Brothers' collapse, Cohn's comments mostly tracked the sentiment of Wall Street bankers and other wealthy Americans who have felt unfairly maligned for the mortgage market’s collapse and the economic downturn that ensued.
He also praised JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who last week made waves by saying that he could beat Trump in an election. Calling Dimon a ""phenomenal"" choice, Cohn said, ""Jamie would be a spectacular president... After having seen the inside of the Oval Office and worked inside there for hours upon hours a day, it's in many respects very similar to running a complex multi-national global (company).""
Shortly after making his comments Dimon, said he was not running for president.
Once the No. 2 executive at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Cohn argued that no top bankers should have gone to jail for their role in the crisis because they did not necessarily do anything illegal, despite what populist movements like Occupy Wall Street have demanded.
Defending his fellow bankers, who are often blamed for causing and worsening the crisis, Cohn said borrowers played a hand in their financial disasters as well.
""Who broke the law? I just want to know who you think broke the law,"" said Cohn. ""Was the waitress in Las Vegas who had six houses leveraged at 100 percent with no income, was she reckless and stupid? Or was the banker reckless and stupid?""
Cohn also mentioned former Lehman Chief Executive Dick Fuld who lost a big chunk of his net worth when his company filed for bankruptcy. ""Who was Dick Fuld defrauding? Himself?""
In the aftermath of the crisis, Cohn said regulators and legislators went too far in creating restrictions that forced banks to grow in size because only the large could afford to pay for the added layers of oversight.
He criticized Elizabeth Warren, a prominent Democratic Senator who often attacks big banks, for using a simplistic measure of industry profitability and said rules that were part of the Dodd-Frank reform package have only solidified big banks’ competitive position.
""We haven't ended 'too big to fail,'"" Cohn said. ""We made rules and regulations that made (the big banks) bigger. Congratulations.""
After 26 years at Goldman, Cohn left Wall Street for Washington and the Trump administration because he worried that regulation and taxes were constricting growth in the United States, he said.
""We needed to get competitive with the rest of the world,"" Cohn said. He spent a little over a year in the White House, and left after pushing through a major tax overhaul Trump signed in December. ""We now have taxes to a point where we are globally competitive at 21 percent.""
Since leaving the Trump administration in March, Cohn has been spending time with his family and exploring business opportunities, he said.
Cohn, 58, resigned after trying to soften Trump's plans for hefty steel and aluminum tariffs. Since his departure the administration has strengthened its protectionist stance, passing tariffs against China, the European Union and other large trading partners.
Trump escalated his trade war with China by slapping 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
Cohn defended Trump's stance against China, saying the Asian country was taking advantage of the United States.
""If we are not getting paid specifically by the Chinese for what we have invented and the Chinese are just stealing it and knocking it off, the global economy, globalization doesn't work,"" Cohn said.

1324,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Samsung Back in Favor as Moon Tries to Kick-Start Korean Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- In a meeting that was unthinkable 19 months ago, South Korea’s president will this week introduce the head of the country’s biggest conglomerate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang.
The parley caps a remarkable period for Jay Y. Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., who since the start of 2017 has been arrested, tried and jailed before being released a year later. Meanwhile, President Moon Jae-in is finding his political fortunes tied to the company and South Korea’s other conglomerates amid a sputtering economy, even though he swept to an election victory promising to rein in the power of the chaebol.
While close links between politicians and chaebol aren’t new in South Korea, Moon talked tough about cutting that influence before his election, a poll that only took place because his predecessor was brought down by a bribery scandal involving Lee. With exports of semiconductors one of the few bright spots in an economy that’s showing signs of strain, the country’s reliance on its most profitable company is deepening and thus reducing regulatory pressure on Samsung.
“The government needs Samsung now,” said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive officer of corporate analysis firm Chaebul.com. “Samsung also has nothing to lose by complying.”
The president’s office and Samsung haven’t said what Lee would discuss on the trip. The company doesn’t have any businesses in North Korea, which is subject to international sanctions.
Lee’s trip comes less than two months after he appeared at a photo opportunity at Samsung’s latest and biggest chip factory in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, where he met with Kim Dong-yeon, South Korea’s finance minister. There, Samsung pushed for lower regulations on pharmaceuticals, construction of plants, mobile networks and other business areas, which the minister planned to look into, Kim told reporters after the meeting.
When Moon was elected in May last year, expectations were high that the government would force the chaebol to improve their corporate governance and reduce the power held by founding families such as the Lees at Samsung.
In a sign of how that dynamic has changed, Moon has called for easing a law that limits companies from owning a bigger chunk of a bank, generating criticism by activists that it could pave the way for chaebol families to use financial units to increase their control.
Samsung has an outsized influence on South Korea. Not only is it the biggest private employer in the country, but its flagship electronics business alone accounts for a staggering 20 percent of the nation’s benchmark Kospi index, and it has five other affiliates in the top 30.
Lee, son of South Korea’s richest man, was arrested in February 2017 on charges including bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye. After a six-month trial, he was sentenced to five years in prison, a term reduced and suspended earlier this year. He is appealing the remaining jail term while prosecutors seek a harsher punishment. The Samsung heir has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
On Tuesday, Lee and other chaebol leaders will join Moon at his third summit with the North Korean leader. It will be the second public meeting between Moon and the Samsung boss this year after a brief handshake at the opening of an Indian smartphone factory.
Moon’s chief of staff said Monday it isn’t unusual for conglomerate chiefs to visit North Korea on the occasion of a summit, as they have previously done so. Samsung declined to comment.
While Samsung is coming off a year of record profits, South Korea’s economy and Moon’s own approval ratings are struggling. The president’s so-called wage-led growth plan is failing to increase jobs, with the August unemployment rate hitting the highest since early 2010 and consumer confidence tumbling to its lowest in 17 months.
Companies filing for bankruptcy jumped 9.2 percent to 994 this year through July, the most ever for the period, according to Supreme Court of Korea data going back to 2012.
“Slow economy means a halt in chaebol reforms,” said Bruce Lee, chief executive officer at Seoul-based Zebra Investment Management. “It’s become really hard to reform chaebol because they are the biggest employers.”
That’s not the only concern for South Korea. As one emerging-market nation after another feels the impact of rising U.S. interest rates and the trade spat between China and the U.S., the importance of foreign reserves is greater than ever and making exports more important.
That’s where Samsung becomes a powerful ally with about 90 percent of its revenue coming from overseas sales, where it leads the world in smartphones and TVs. The Suwon-based company is also the world’s biggest maker of semiconductors and, along with local rival SK Hynix Inc., a member of another chaebol, it dominates supply of critical memory chips.
Semiconductors accounted for 23 percent of South Korea’s exports last month, more than any other product. That forces Moon and Samsung into a delicate situation. Too much reliance on the chaebol could further harm his political stock, but it also means any downturn in chip demand spells trouble for the company and Asia’s fourth-largest economy. “Its pricing has been very good and margins for Samsung have been really strong,” said Erik Zipf, head of emerging market equities at DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) Capital Management “We don’t think that’s sustainable. We think as capacity comes on, that’ll kind of reduce margins.”
Still, Samsung continues to play along. Two days after the meeting with the finance minister, Samsung announced a three-year plan that includes 180 trillion ($160 billion) of investment, with the promise to hire 40,000 more people. That’s a shot in the arm for a president under pressure and a company under scrutiny.
“Reforms are dying on the vine,” said Kwon Young-june, a professor who researches corporate governance at Seoul’s Kyung Hee University. “The government will find itself more and more in need of conglomerates as long as it is fixated on quick results rather than long-term reforms.”

1325,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>","Trump Confirms Tariffs, BOJ's End Game, Rupee Unrest: Eco Day","(Bloomberg) -- Welcome to Tuesday, Asia. Here’s the latest news from Bloomberg Economics:"
1326,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Should Cut Stock-Trading Taxes,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is poised to lead the world in IPOs. In the past eight months, the city hosted 132 initial offerings to raise a total of $23.8 billion, surpassing the $20.6 billion garnered by the New York Stock Exchange’s 40 sales.
That’s an impressive record. Now for a less impressive metric: Hong Kong trails New York in the key category of post-IPO liquidity.
For example, of Hong Kong’s 174 IPOs in 2017, the great majority — 153 stocks — suffered a 70 percent decline in trading volume within three months of being listed. More recently, only four companies maintained or increased volume since their offerings, while 89 had average daily turnover of less than $50,000.
For many companies, the drop in post-IPO liquidity reflects low market capitalization and little early attention from institutional investors. After all, financial firms account for close to 80 percent of daily trading volume at the Hong Kong exchange, with the rest coming from retail investors.
There’s another issue, however — stamp duty, the trading tax on stocks.
The Hong Kong government currently imposes 0.20 percent stamp duty on a round-trip (buy and sell) trade, the highest in the world. In New York and Tokyo, there is no stamp duty. In China, only the seller pays 0.10 percent. In London, the buyer pays 0.50 percent, but there’s an exemption for financial institutions; the effective rate is therefore less than that of Hong Kong.
While the stamp duty on Hong Kong stocks is high, there may not be much incentive to reduce it, as this tax contributes about 8 percent of total government revenue.
So here’s an idea: Lower stamp duty just for small- and mid-cap shares.
There are currently 2,309 stocks listed in Hong Kong. The top 10 by market cap account for about 30 percent of the exchange’s total daily volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The next 90 account for another 40 percent, leaving 2,209 stocks jostling for the remaining 30 percent.
Quant trading may be one of the reasons why large stocks dominate liquidity. Various sources suggest that quant strategies now account for 50 percent of total daily trading volume. As many such funds bet on thin margins, they can only target large-cap, actively traded shares. With some brokerage commissions as low as 0.03 percent, a 0.20 percent tax takes a big bite from their trading profits.
A tax cut for smaller stocks would avoid too great a hit for government revenue, while helping broaden the Hong Kong market. A wider pool of investments for traders would jump-start liquidity in smaller stocks. Based on current volumes and capitalization, an additional 200 to 300 stocks should benefit.
Reducing stamp duty would also increase trading volume. Look at Australia: The nation halved stamp duty from 0.30 percent to 0.15 percent in 1995, which led to a 50 percent surge in volume. In 2001, the country eliminated the duty entirely, giving trading another lift.
A targeted tax reduction by Hong Kong could be almost neutral for the treasury: Total government revenue is projected at about HK$600 billion ($76 billion) this year. Assuming stamp duty were cut by 50 percent and trading volume subsequently rose 50 percent as a result, the coffers would be just 0.5 percent (or HK$3 billion) lighter.
The government should look beyond any immediate impact of a cut in duty — the ripple effect would further strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a global financial center and make it the go-to IPO destination for entrepreneurs."
1327,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>","Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna","By Caroline Humer
(Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp's (N:CI) $52 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co has passed U.S. antitrust scrutiny, the companies said on Monday, allowing them to proceed with a combination they say will lead to lower costs by better coordinating pharmacy and medical benefits.
Wall Street analysts had expected antitrust approval as the companies have little overlap in their businesses. The decision bodes well for the pending U.S. antitrust review of CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET).
The new company will marry Cigna's business of managing health plans for corporations and the government with Express Scripts' (O:ESRX) role handling pharmacy benefits for those same customers. Express Scripts also owns specialty pharmacies that distribute pricey drugs.
""We are pleased that the Department of Justice has cleared our transaction and that we are another step closer to completing our merger,” Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in a statement.
The Justice Department review of CVS’s planned purchase of Aetna may conclude this month, but will take longer because of divestitures needed to resolve competitive concerns, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the company continues to expect to close its deal late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, a forecast it gave investors on Aug. 8 during a conference call.
The Justice Department in 2016 successfully blocked a pair of large health insurance mergers it believed would limit competition in the industry. Those were Aetna's plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) for $37 billion, and a planned $54 billion combination of insurers Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) and Cigna.
Aetna and Cigna, however, were determined to seek growth through deals while responding to a changing healthcare landscape, eventually targeting mergers with the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).
""We believe these two transactions add more pressure on Humana to move further down the path of vertical integration,"" William Blair analyst John Kreger said. ""We suspect other health plans will look to follow suit."" 
FEELING THE PRESSURE
Antitrust experts have described the current deals as vertical combinations that present fewer issues than the failed insurer mergers. That view was bolstered after the Justice Department lost its case to stop AT&T's (N:T) acquisition of media company Time Warner. The department is appealing the decision.
""Everyone is feeling the pressure right now ... to react to disruption in the healthcare industry,"" said Brad Haller, a director in West Monroe Partners’ mergers & acquisitions practice.
That disruption includes Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) moves into healthcare. The world's largest online retailer purchased online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it undercut traditional prescription drug sales.
Amazon has also aligned itself with JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) to experiment with new business models for employee healthcare - one of Cigna's target markets.
Cigna's purchase of Express Scripts comes as PBMs' role in prescription drug costs has come under scrutiny.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said it is looking at how so-called industry middlemen and pharmacies such as Express Scripts and CVS impact drug costs for U.S. consumers. The administration is looking at implementing a rule that could change or eliminate the use of rebates from drugmakers to PBMs that critics say contribute to higher drug prices.
Cigna and Express Scripts said they have already obtained clearances for the deal from departments of insurance in 16 states and are working with regulators in remaining jurisdictions to obtain clearance for the merger.
""States could still conduct a public hearing ... though it is very unlikely that they do not align with the U.S. Department of Justice's decision,"" Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. 
The companies continue to expect the deal to close by the end of the year, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions.

Cigna shares closed up 1.4 percent at $197.84, while Express Scripts shares closed up 3.7 percent at $95.23. CVS and Aetna shares also rose, closing up 1.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) expects its Global 7500 to receive certification from Canada's transport regulator this month, a milestone needed for the plane-and-train maker to begin delivering its flagship business jet to clients, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The Global 7500, which is sold out until 2021, is expected to enter service this year and is crucial to Bombardier's turnaround efforts after it sold a majority stake in its CSeries commercial jetliner program to Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR).
Montreal-based Bombardier has not disclosed the exact number of orders for the Global 7500, set to challenge U.S rival Gulfstream Aerospace, which has dominated the top end of the market for long-range corporate planes.
""So far, there's a broad expectation that it will happen by the end of the month, but the decision will be taken by Transport Canada,"" said one of the sources on Monday. 
Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the company's internal discussions are private.
Regulator Transport Canada, which will make the final decision on the timing of the certification, said by email it could not provide ""further details"" on Bombardier’s Global 7500 because the information was confidential.
Bombardier spokesman Mark Masluch declined on Monday to comment on expected milestone dates for the Global 7500, but reiterated that the luxury jet was ""on track to enter service this year.""
The Global 7500 comes to market as corporate plane makers expect to generate higher revenues during a time of recovering appetite for business jets.
Bombardier, now halfway through a turnaround plan after facing a cash crunch in 2015, is counting on deliveries of the long-range business jet to achieve a 25 percent jump in total company revenues to $20 billion by 2020, compared with 2017. Originally called the Global 7000, the business jet was renamed the Global 7500 in May.
Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), received Federal Aviation Administration certification for its G500 this year and soon expects certification for a second plane, the G600.

Global 7500 would have a range of 7,700 nautical miles, 300 longer than initially expected, and be able to connect far-flung destinations like New York and Hong Kong.

NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Major U.S. ethanol producer Green Plains Inc is shutting down two ethanol plants in Iowa and cutting output at another in Minnesota due to low profit margins, three industry sources told Reuters.
The production cuts come after the Trump administration's escalating trade disputes cut off U.S. access to ethanol markets in China, contributing to a domestic supply glut that has pushed biofuel prices to near their lowest in over a decade. 
Green Plains idled until further notice its facility in Superior, Iowa, and soon will shut down the plant in Lakota, Iowa, while the company's plant in Fairmont, Minnesota, was running at half of its capacity, said the sources, who asked not to be named.
Company spokesman Jim Stark did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. Green Plains in an Aug. 30 regulatory filing said, ""Based on current market conditions, the company is re-assessing our production levels.""
Together, the plants represent about 20 percent of Green Plains' annual ethanol production capacity of roughly 1.48 billion gallons. Green Plains is about tied with  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) as the No. 3 ethanol maker in the United States, behind POET LLC and Archer Daniels Midland Co.

Wall Street is looking for a profit of 64 cents a share on sales about about $4.1 billion.
2. Trade Talk Likely to Dominate Again
Trade worries will dominate market chatter again tomorrow. Stocks sold off today after President Donald Trump said an announcement on trade would come after the market close.
Trump was widely expected to implement 10% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.
Some products, like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) AirPods, will be exempt.
China has vowed to retaliate against any tariffs and will likely refuse and trade talks, which were recently mooted by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
3. NAHB Housing Marker Index Expected to Dip
The economic calendar is fairly light, but there will be more numbers coming on the housing market, which should be of special interest as it’s the one sector of the economy showing weakness.
The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index for September. Economists expect a reading of 66, down from 67 in August.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.35%. The S&P 500 fell 0.56%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.43%.
Investors fled U.S. stocks, bracing for the impact of a deeper rift in U.S.-China trade relations, which could dent global growth, as both countries get ready to fire another volley of trade tariffs against in each other.
President Donald Trump said an announcement on U.S.-China trade will be coming after the close on Monday. ""We can't do that anymore,"" Trump claimed, saying the U.S. deficit was too big.
The latest round of tariffs from U.S. would impose a 10% levy on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods.
Beijing has reportedly vowed to hit back against any new tariffs imposed by the United States, throwing into doubt the prospect of renewed trade negotiations.
Trade-sensitive names like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which have significant international exposure, ended the day mixed, as the latter deftly sidestepped trade tensions after reporting a 23% jump in global retail sales for the three months ended August 2018.
Beyond trade, a wave of selling pressure emerged in tech, driven by a slump in shares of Apple and Amazon.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) dropped 3% as The Wall Street Journal reported that the e-commerce giant is investigating suspected data leaks and bribes among employees. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell nearly 3% as Rosenblatt Securities reportedly said pre-orders for Apple's iPhone XS and Max were weaker than the X model.
""We believe iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max preorders to be weaker compared to the iPhone X preorders, which we had estimated last year to be about 12 million in the first three days, with lead times of 3-5 weeks,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a note to clients Monday.
Apple received a modicum of relief, however, amid reports the Apple Watch and AirPods would be spared from latest China tariffs.
Energy, meanwhile, rose modestly, shrugging off fears that rising trade war tensions would hurt global crude demand.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for November delivery fell 19 cents to trade at $68.58 a barrel.

1354,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","U.S. to Spare Some Apple Goods From Latest China Tariffs, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration will spare a category of high-tech products that includes the Apple Watch and AirPods headphone from the next round of tariffs it’s imposing on Chinese goods, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The government is expected to release as early as Monday the final list of as much as $200 billion of Chinese products that will be hit with a new 10 percent tariff, according to five people familiar with the matter. A product code that covers Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s Watch and AirPods -- as well as similar smart watches, fitness trackers and other goods made by competitors -- is not on the list, the two people said.
The people asked not to be identified because the new round of tariffs hasn’t yet been announced. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The product code covers wireless devices, and it was included on a preliminary list the administration released in July. Other Apple products under the code include the HomePod speaker, BeatsWL headphones, and AirPort and Time Capsule internet routers. The value of such imports from China is about $12 billion, according to one of the people.
Earlier this month, Apple said a “wide range” of its products would be hit by the proposed tariffs. The company didn’t identify the iPhone as a product that would be subject to duties in a Sept. 5 letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
Apple asked Lighthizer to reconsider imposing the tariffs and instead take other measures that would support the U.S. economy and American consumers.
“Tariffs increase the cost of our U.S. operations, divert our resources, and disadvantage Apple compared to foreign competitors,” according to Apple’s letter. “More broadly, tariffs will lead to higher U.S. consumer prices, lower overall U.S. economic growth, and other unintended economic consequences.”
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook -- who dined with President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, at Trump’s Bedminster, New Jersey golf resort in August -- has said he hopes “calm heads prevail” in the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. The company’s sprawling production chain is centered in China. Earlier this year, a Chinese Communist Party newspaper named Apple among the American companies that would be “most damaged” if a trade war erupted.
American industry has come out strongly against Trump’s tariffs, saying cost increases could raise prices for consumers.
The administration has revised the list of Chinese goods that will be hit by tariffs following a feedback period and more than a week of public hearings last month. Like Apple, most U.S. businesses that submitted comments were opposed to the tariffs being enacted.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) has revealed its employees only get a bonus if they meet or exceed expectations for ethical behavior as it seeks to address past shortcomings that have damaged its reputation. 
Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has made strengthening the Swiss drugmaker's ethics culture a priority after costly bribery scandals or legal settlements in South Korea, China and the United States. 
Employees now receive a 1, 2 or a 3 score on their values and behavior. Receiving a 2, which Novartis said denotes meeting expectations, or a 3, for ""role model"" behavior, would make them eligible for a bonus of up to 35 percent of their total compensation. 
Novartis said it began the scoring system in 2016 but details have not been widely reported. Company officials outlined the system on Monday on a call about its ethics efforts with analysts and journalists.
""Unless the sales representative scores a two or a three, they will not be eligible for their variable compensation,"" Samir Shah, Novartis's head of investor relations, said of the company's values and behaviors scoring system. 
""That's how we've tried to make sure we've got the right balance between pay for performance and having the right behavior,"" he added.
Shah, who said the standard applies in all countries where Novartis does business, did not immediately know how many employees will be ineligible for bonuses at their next appraisals in October or November.
Novartis said additional action may be taken where an employee falls short on their ethics score, or they could be dismissed. 
The company was also this year embroiled in a political controversy over payments it made to U.S. President Donald Trump's ex-attorney.
Narasimhan has said he did not learn of the $1.2 million payments to Michael Cohen, until well after his predecessor, Joe Jimenez, struck the deal in 2017. Narasimhan has labeled the Cohen contract a mistake but said the company did nothing illegal.
Basel-based Novartis recently hired a new ethics chief, Klaus Moosmayer, 49, from Siemens, where he spent more than a decade helping oversee the German engineering company's efforts to build its compliance system.
Two years ago, Novartis was forced to pay $25 million to settle U.S. civil charges it had bribed Chinese healthcare professionals to boost sales in China. To remedy weaknesses in that country, the company now has a pilot project in China in which expense reports are scrutinized before money is reimbursed. 
""This allows us to look at the behavior metric before any money leaves Novartis, and catch potential misconduct before there is any risk to our reputation,"" said Novartis general counsel Shannon Klinger, promoted to the post this year after Felix Ehrat resigned to take responsibility for the Cohen contract.

""You can expect us to continue focusing on resolving the legacy issues that we read about in the press, ensuring we address any remaining underlying behaviors,"" she added.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) shareholder Lindsell Train is likely to use at least some of its shares to vote against the company's planned move to the Netherlands, which will cost the consumer goods giant its spot in the benchmark FTSE 100 (FTSE) index. 
The British asset manager - the third-largest owner of Unilever Plc shares, according to Thomson Reuters data - joins a growing chorus of concern against the move, aimed at simplifying Unilever's dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure. 
""We admire Unilever as a company and have a high regard for its current executive team and board, but on this issue we will vote in the interests of our various clients as we judge appropriate,"" Nick Train, co-founder of the British asset management firm, said in an emailed statement.
He spelled out various reasons why its British clients would be disadvantaged by the move to end its dual-headed structure.
He said Unilever ceasing to be a benchmark UK stock was ""at the very least an inconvenience"" for all UK funds, while those who only invest in the benchmark may become ""forced sellers"".
Train also cited ""a new risk"" from the possibility of a Dutch withholding tax on dividends once Unilever redomiciles to the Netherlands.
He noted the mitigation Unilever has offered against this threat but said the company is not offering ""a perpetuity guarantee"" that shareholders will never suffer from future changes in Dutch tax policy.
Lindsell Train, which owns a 2.38 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data, did not give a breakdown on how many of its clients were based in Britain.
Train's comments come after a fellow top-20 shareholder,  Aviva  (L:AV), told the Financial Times that it plans to vote against the proposal. 
A third, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, has also voiced concern about the move, though some non-British investors are more sanguine.
A fourth investor, invested in both the UK and Dutch shares, said it made sense to rationalize the headquarters. 
""Having two sets of headquarters and two listings is not always the most efficient,"" said the investor, who declined to be identified. 
The Unilever move requires approval by 75 percent of UK shareholders and 50 percent of Dutch shareholders. The votes will take place on Oct. 25 in the Netherlands and Oct. 26 in London. 
Unilever has said it is ""very confident"" of securing the required votes.

Unilever shares were down 0.2 percent in London at 1518 GMT.

""Sorry, we've gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable,"" Musk said in a tweet https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1041500594467270656 on Sunday, in response to a customer complaint on delivery delay. 
""We're making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly."" 
The 47-year-old billionaire, who earlier this month faced investor ire over smoking marijuana on a live web show, has indicated in the past that Tesla's customers may face a longer response time because of a significant increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America.
Tesla's ability to deliver on production targets has weighed on its stock in the past, and the company has been working to iron out bumps after failing to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedans.
The company has eliminated some color options for its cars to streamline operations to ramp up production.
Musk also tweeted on Sunday that Tesla would bring most collision repairs in-house, saying owners were experiencing excessive wait times at body shops.
Separately, aspiring rival Lucid Motors announced a $1 billion investment on Monday from Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund PIF.
Earlier this year, PIF built a stake of just under 5 percent in Tesla by snapping up shares in the open market, rather than acquiring newly issued shares.

Tesla's shares were down nearly 1 percent at $292.76.

James Giddens, the trustee overseeing the liquidation, on Monday said just 381 of the roughly 140,000 claims against the brokerage remain unresolved.
Customers and secured creditors have been repaid in full. Unsecured creditors have received about $9 billion, or 39.75 cents on the dollar, roughly double what was once expected.
In a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan, Giddens said the wind-down is in its final phase, and that resolving all claims and making a final payout ""could occur in the next year"" if the court's schedule permits.
Giddens said the bankruptcy estate still has $543 million of assets.
Lehman had been Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank before filing the largest U.S. bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008.
Its collapse remains controversial, with much debate over whether and when companies should be allowed to fail, and how to prevent another crisis.
""Ten years later the key lesson of Lehman remains that such a failure should be avoided altogether, for the benefit of all stakeholders,"" said Giddens, senior counsel at the law firm Hughes, Hubbard & Reed.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","U.S. Air Force seeks sharp growth to stay ahead of China, Russia","By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force is predicting it will need to grow sharply over the next decade or so, boosting the number of operational squadrons by nearly a quarter to stay ahead of increasingly muscular militaries in China and Russia, officials said.
Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters that the preliminary analysis drew partly from classified intelligence about possible threats in the 2025 to 2030 time frame, showing that the service, at its current size, would be unable to preserve America's edge.""The Air Force is too small for what the nation is asking us to do,"" Wilson told a small group of reporters ahead of a speech on Monday that will lay out her arguments.
The Air Force analysis did not include a price tag and Wilson declined to speculate on costs. But such growth could conceivably cost billions of dollars, given the need to hire more personnel and buy substantially more aircraft, from refueling tankers and fighter jets to bombers, made by companies like  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT). 
Wilson estimated the Air Force would need about more 40,000 personnel as part of the plan to have a total of 386 operational squadrons, up 24 percent from the 312 today. The increase would bring the Air Force to about 717,000 personnel, including the Guard and Reserve.
The U.S. Air Force had 401 squadrons in 1987, at the peak of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Usually commanded by a lieutenant colonel, squadrons are the core fighting units of the Air Force and are often composed of about 18 to 24 aircraft. 
The Air Force estimate is likely to set the stage for greater debate about military spending priorities, including within the Pentagon, where branches of the world's most powerful military already fiercely vie for resources. 
That competition is set to grow if President Donald Trump succeeds in creating a new ""Space Force"" as the sixth branch of the military, something he hopes to do by 2020.
About one-sixth of U.S. federal spending goes to defense, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Although some lawmakers complain the Pentagon gets too big a share of U.S. resources, defense spending enjoys broad support in Congress.
GROWING RISK
Trump last month signed a massive, $716 billion defense policy bill meant to help address shortcomings in the U.S. military, which is trying to shift its focus to challenges posed by countries like China and Russia after nearly 17 years fighting militants in places like Afghanistan.
Wilson declined to get into details about classified analysis of future military threats. 
But she pointed to events already making global headlines, like how Russia staged its largest military exercise this month since the fall of the Soviet Union, mobilizing 300,000 troops.
Pentagon officials believe the bigger challenge, however, will be staying ahead of China's rapidly expanding military capabilities. 
""The threat is growing,"" Wilson said. ""We have to be clear-eyed about the world in which we live.""
Wilson acknowledged that the Air Force's estimates would be further refined in the weeks and months ahead. The latest analysis would be among the reports submitted to Congress in March next year that seek to address a basic question: What kind of Air Force America does America need? 
Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein noted that was different from the typical question of what is the best Air Force that the United States can afford, given current budget priorities. 
Wilson said: ""We also know that there will be a debate about what we can afford - and that's fair.""

""But I think we have to be clear on what is needed to protect our vital national interest in this country,"" she said.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 10:48AM ET</span>","Jaguar Land Rover to cut output at UK car plant after warnings on Brexit, diesel","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) said it will go down to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in central England just days after its boss warned about the impact of Brexit and diesel policy on manufacturing.
The Castle Bromwich facility will operate a three-day week from October until the beginning of December in a move which will affect around 1,000 staff but avoid job cuts, a spokeswoman said.
""In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some temporary adjustments to our production schedules at Castle Bromwich,"" the company said in a statement.
Last week, the firm's boss Ralf Speth warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of car jobs and risks production at the firm, especially if there are delays at ports and on motorways due to customs checks. 
He also said that the government had demonized diesel cars, contributing to 1,000 job losses at the company earlier this year. 
Conservative lawmaker and Brexit supporter Bernard Jenkin earlier on Monday accused Speth of ""making it up"" when asked about the automotive boss's comments, which included a warning that it was already more attractive to build cars abroad with Brexit adding uncertainty.
The Unite union blamed Prime Minister Theresa May as she battles to convince many of her own lawmakers to support her Brexit proposals which she says will maintain frictionless trade and protect jobs, but have angered many Brexiteers. 
""This is the continuing effect of the chaotic mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations by the government which has created uncertainty across the UK’s automotive industry and the manufacturing sector generally,"" said Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke. 
A slump in demand for diesel cars is also having a big impact on the firm. 
About 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) sales in Britain are diesel models, which compares with around 45 percent globally, the company said earlier this year. 
Diesel sales have fallen this year nearly 30 percent in Britain, Europe's second-biggest car market, mirroring similar drops in other major markets, as governments crack down on the segment in the wake of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) emissions scandal. 
JLR said on Monday it was investing to protect its plants in the future.

""We have invested more than £4bn since 2010 to future proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models,"" its statement said.

(Reuters) - DowDuPont (N:DWDP) Chief Executive Edward Breen will oversee the specialty-products unit that carries most of the company's legacy DuPont operations after the chemicals major splits back into three different businesses, the company said on Monday.
Dow and Dupont, which completed a $130 billion merger last September to form DowDuPont, also immediately announced plans to create three separately traded companies focusing on agriculture, plastics and specialty products. 
Breen, who was CEO of the erstwhile DuPont, had spearheaded the merger of the two companies and has since led a plan to cut $3.3 billion in expenses. 
He will be executive chairman of the chemicals business, called DuPont, from June 1 next year. The specialty products unit's current Chief Operating Officer Marc Doyle will become its Chief Executive Officer. 
""Breen will work closely with the senior leadership team and focus on the company's portfolio management strategy, capital allocation decisions, and, in conjunction with Marc Doyle, shareholder engagement,"" the company said in a statement.
The specialty products business, which makes products that go into construction materials or semiconductors and microchips, accounted for about a quarter of the company's total sales as of June 2017. 
Its materials science plastics unit is the largest by sales, but was stripped of an extra $8 billion worth of annual business as part of the division, after pressure from hedge fund investors Trian Partners and Third Point LLC.
James Collins Jr. currently the chief operating officer of DowDuPont's agriculture business, will be heading the new agriculture business called Corteva Agriscience. 

The company confirmed that Jim Fitterling, the chief operating officer of its materials business will be the new chief executive officer of the firm under the name Dow.

The move comes as a series of scandals in Europe have undermined trust in authorities' ability to tackle money laundering.
A broad majority of parties in the Danish parliament agreed at a meeting on Monday that financial penalties should be increased by up to 700 percent, Lisbeth Bech Poulsen of the Socialist People's Party told Reuters.
Business minister Rasmus Jarlov confirmed in a tweet that a new anti money laundering strategy was being negotiated, but said a final agreement had not been reached.
The new rules are expected to be presented in detail on Wednesday, after Danske Bank has presented its long-awaited internal probe into allegations money from Russia and former Soviet states was laundered though its Estonian branch.
""It is important to get one of the toughest levels of fines in Europe to signal we're taking this very serious, because this case has damaged Denmark's image a lot,"" Poulsen said.
Danske Bank shares have shed a third of their value in the last six months as allegations about its involvement in money-laundering in Estonia have intensified. Authorities in Denmark and Estonia are investigating, while the United States has said it is following the matter.
The new rules will most likely not apply to Danske Bank's case, as the alleged breaches were in the past, but would mean the authorities would be able to crack down harder on future cases.

Jarlov did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.

(Reuters) - Coca Cola Co (N:KO) said on Monday it was closely watching the growing marijuana-infused drinks market, responding to a media report that the world's largest beverage maker was in talks with Canada's  Aurora Cannabis  Inc (TO:ACB).
The discussions over a possible product tie-up, reported by Canadian financial channel BNN Bloomberg, could open a new front in Coke's battle to overcome sluggish demand for its sugar-heavy sodas by diversifying into coffee and health-focused drinks.
The report said there was no guarantee that talks between the companies would be successful but Aurora shares responded by soaring 22 percent. Coke stock gained slightly on a New York market weakened by concerns over trade tariffs. 
The marijuana industry has been attracting interest from a handful of big corporate names as Canada and a wave of U.S. states move to legalize recreational use of the drug. 
However, U.S. corporations are still cautious about taking steps into a business that remains illegal under U.S. federal law. 
Both Coke and Aurora, in separate statements, said they were interested in cannabidiol infused beverages but could not comment on any market speculation. 
Coke and Aurora would likely develop beverages that will ease inflammation, pain and cramping, the BNN report said, citing sources familiar with the matter
A partnership between Coke and Aurora would mark the first entry of a major manufacturer of non-alcoholic beverages into the market for cannabis-related products, up till now a hunting ground almost solely for the alcohol industry.
Corona maker Constellation Brands (N:STZ) is plowing more than $4 billion into marijuana producer Canopy Growth (TO:WEED) to make cannabis based products, while  Molson Coors  Brewing Co's (N:TAP) Canadian arm has said it will make cannabis-infused drinks with Hydropothecary Corp (TO:HEXO).
The size of the Constellation investment, announced a month ago, sparked speculation of other buy outs, investments and partnerships in the industry, pushing Canadian marijuana stocks higher. 
""We continue to expect to see more deals between Canadian cannabis companies and the larger players in the global alcohol market who have yet to gain exposure to the category,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said.

Azer said he would not be surprised by a similar move from Pepsi with ""with CBD seemingly a good compliment to their market share leading Gatorade franchise"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) is inviting financial investors to bid for its 60 percent stake in chemical park operator Currenta after initially failing to agree a sale to its former chemicals subsidiary Covestro, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Bayer, which is focusing on healthcare and crop protection after the takeover of U.S. seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), has mandated  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to help with the transaction. Buyout firms and infrastructure investors have been asked to put in initial bids by the middle of October, the sources said.
Currenta, which operates infrastructure facilities at German chemical complexes in Leverkusen, Dormagen and Krefeld-Uerdingen, could be valued at upwards of 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) and possibly more than 2 billion, according to one of the sources.
Covestro, Morgan Stanley and Bayer declined to comment.
Currenta's three industrial sites were once dominated by Bayer but after the drugmaker's staggered exit from the production of industrial chemicals and plastics, Bayer no longer plays a major role among Currenta's more than 70 customers.
Bayer needs to rebuild its financial firepower after the $63 billion takeover of U.S. seeds maker Monsanto.
It is competing with larger pharma rivals as it bids for the rights to promising new treatments from biotech firms to try to strengthen its drugs development pipeline. 
Despite the widened group of prospective buyers, a sale to Covestro, whose products include transparent plastics for road-side noise barriers and panoramic car roofs, can still not be ruled out. 
""Covestro is half in, half out. They're just not finding any common ground,"" said one of the sources, describing the state of negotiations with Bayer.
Currenta mainly supplies Bayer's former subsidiaries Covestro and the special chemicals company Lanxess, which owns the remaining 40 percent in Currenta, with electricity, steam and natural gas.
It also provides services including transportation, maintenance, waste management and workers' safety and employs 3,200 staff.
Even prior to Covestro's 2015 carveout from Bayer and subsequent stock-market listing, no internal agreement could be reached about transferring Bayer's Currenta stake to Covestro, even though the subsidiary was set to replace its parent as Currenta's main customer, the sources said.
Standard & Poor's cut its credit rating of Bayer to triple-B in the wake of the Monsanto deal and Bayer has vowed to pay back debt to return to a single A rating over the long run.
Covestro, in turn, is buying back shares and has bolstered its investment ambitions, banking on stable demand for specialty materials even beyond the industry's current upswing.
The maker of transparent polycarbonate plastics and chemicals for padding foam in mattresses and car seats expects to rake in more than 2 billion euros in cash flow after investment expenditure this year, boosted by stronger-than expected demand. ($1 = 0.8579 euros)

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) has hired three investment bankers for its technology investment banking group focused on software in the United States and in Europe, according to a memo published internally at the bank and confirmed by a spokeswoman on Monday. 
Technology and non-technology companies alike have been acquiring software companies to help modernize a range of various industries from retail to industrials. Citigroup's move shows how bankers specializing in the sector have become sought after on Wall Street. 
Brian Marshall will join Citigroup from  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) in San Francisco, the memo said. Marshall was a former research analyst and also worked as head of corporate development at analytics software company Hortonworks (O:HDP). 
Marshall will be the bank's co-head of software, alongside Sam Kumar, who joined the bank in 2015 and covers Softbank Group Corp (T:9984). 
Citigroup has also appointed Jim Mackey, a former executive at Canada's Blackberry Ltd (TO:BB), to be chairman of software based in San Francisco. Mackey had also worked at Canadian software company  Open Text  Corp (TO:OTEX) and German technology company SAP SE (DE:SAPG), where he helped lead SAP's acquisitions of Sybase, Business Objects and SuccessFactors.

""Jim’s senior relationships, sector knowledge, and deal experience will help accelerate our momentum in the Software sector,"" Citigroup's global head of technology investment banking Herb Yeh said in the memo. Yishai Fransis, a managing director, will join Citigroup's London Office from  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in October as the head of European, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Technology.

1395,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 09:17AM ET</span>",Here's how the Fed could trigger the next big stock market meltdown,"When it comes to the 9-1/2-year bull market, stock enthusiasts are quick to highlight the strong corporate profit growth that has led the way higher.
But what helped catalyze such impressive earnings expansion? Why, the Federal Reserve's historically easy monetary policy, of course.
That's the premise of Stifel's view that this has been a ""policy bull market,"" built on the shoulders of the Fed's extremely accommodative lending conditions.
Sure, it's a cynical way to look at the longest bull run in history. But Stifel has a point. Back in 2008, when companies were going bankrupt in droves, the Fed stepped in to suppress bond yields of all types, forming a market backbone of sorts.
""US equities have become extensions of policy decisions rather than reflections of economic value,"" Barry Bannister, Stifel's chief equity strategist, wrote in a recent client note.
By this logic, Stifel thinks it will be the Fed that ultimately causes the next big market meltdown — undoing much of the progress it made following the financial crisis.
At the center of this forecast is a neutral Fed funds rate monitored by Stifel. The firm argues that, following two more rate hikes, this measure will cross a so-called bear-market trigger, which occurs on the rare occasions that the neutral reading climbs above the actual Fed funds rate.
As you can see in the chart below, this also happened in 2000 and 2007, right before large bear-market sell-offs.
""A 'maximum tolerable peak' for the Fed funds above the neutral rate has been associated with bear markets since the late-90s global debt boom,"" Bannister said. ""The line connecting the tops has trended down, perhaps due to diminishing productivity of debt (ability of debt to generate GDP), which magnifies the rate sensitivity of borrowers.""
In terms of how bad any stock sell-off can get, Stifel estimates that it could reach bear-market territory. As for the timing of that 20% drop, Bannister says it could happen within six to 12 months.
But it doesn't end there. If that bear market does transpire, Bannister says, it could be followed by eight years of sideways trading for the S&P 500.
Before you go dismissing Bannister's grim forecast, consider that he was one of the Wall Street strategists who predicted the market correction that rocked stocks back in early February.
In terms of how traders can combat an imminent market crunch, Bannister recommends his ""tight policy"" trade. It involves going long defensive industries like utilities, real-estate investment trusts, and household products while shorting areas like construction, energy, raw materials, and insurance."

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Ferrari investors want assurance on targets and SUV plans,"By Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo
MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari's (MI:RACE) new boss has his work cut out on Tuesday to convince investors that the supercar maker can hit mid-term targets he described last month as ""aspirational"".
The company's share price slid more than 8 percent on Aug. 1 after Louis Camilleri said he saw ""risks"" ahead, with investors worrying he may have sought to lower expectations on the targets set by his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne.
Camilleri was appointed  Ferrari  (NYSE:RACE) CEO in July, succeeding auto industry grandee Marchionne, who died after suffering complications following surgery.
The sudden change jolted investors who had expected Marchionne to remain as CEO and chairman until 2021, having more than doubled Ferrari's value since taking it public in 2015 and pledged to double core earnings (EBITDA) to 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) by 2022.
It also left Camilleri to finish scripting a strategy to show how the company known for its racing pedigree and roaring combustion engines would shift toward making a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and hybrid cars while increasing shipments without sacrificing its exclusivity. 
""Investors want to hear whether Ferrari confirm the 2 billion euro figure, which was already seen as ambitious and now somewhat put in question by the new CEO,"" said Emanuele Vizzini, general manager at Milan-based investment fund Investitori Sgr. ""And how they plan to expand the portfolio, including an SUV.""
When Camilleri faces investors at Ferrari's Maranello headquarters on Tuesday he is not expected to stray far from his predecessor's script.
Marchionne had orchestrated Ferrari's spin-off from parent  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), positioned it as a luxury icon rather than a carmaker and managed to do what few thought possible: sail through a self-imposed cap of 7,000 cars a year without sacrificing pricing power or its exclusive appeal.
""Ferrari is running almost on autopilot ... Camilleri should not take any risks at this stage but nurture what he's found,"" said Carlo Gentili, CEO at asset manager Nextam Partners. 
When Ferrari's share price hit a record high of 129.50 euros in June, the company that sold slightly less than 8,400 vehicles last year was worth about 24 billion euros. That is almost as much as Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which shipped 4.7 million cars.
FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS
With profit margins above 30 percent, strong pricing power and a healthy customer waiting list of more than a year, Camilleri inherits a business that is firing on all cylinders.
Ferrari has clocked up several years of record earnings, helped by special editions and a customization program. 
But maintaining Ferrari's high valuation will not be easy as emissions rules tighten, capital spending increases and the diverging interests of investors, racing fans, owners and collectors become increasingly difficult to balance.
Ferrari has said it would unveil a new vehicle at Tuesday's event, but did not divulge any details. 
Some investors expect Ferrari to premiere a model within a new range aimed at a larger demographic by focusing on characteristics other than extreme performance.
Ferrari is also expected to provide details of its hybridization strategy and the SUV, potentially opening the way for shipments to grow substantially in future. Analysts expect annual shipments could reach as many as 15,000 by 2022. 
One of Camilleri's toughest challenges will be to alleviate fears that any push into new territories would happen on Ferrari's terms without sacrificing its exclusivity.
""I don't see a dilution risk from an SUV,"" said one of the company's 40 biggest investors. ""Look at Lamborghini's Urus, Bentley's Bentayga -- they are selling well, the market is in love with SUVs and luxury right now."" 
Marchionne had sought to calm fears by saying that any Ferrari utility vehicle would be ""Ferrari style"" for ""the selected few"" and that ""being able to climb rocks"" would not be a key attribute. 
But analysts wonder whether any such SUV -- extreme, track-focused, niche and highly priced -- would limit the number of customers it can attract, especially in markets such as China. 
Investors said they are confident Ferrari would continue powering ahead over the next 12-24 months because its fundamentals are strong and there is upside to the stock, despite it riding on multiples higher than any other automaker and above many luxury goods companies.
""Even if there is a correction after management's comments on Tuesday, I'd see that as a buying opportunity rather than a chance to review my investment,"" Investitori's Vizzini said.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 08:12AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to move assets from London to Frankfurt after Brexit,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said on Monday it would move assets from London to Frankfurt after Britain's planned exit from the European Union next year, in line with demands from British and EU regulators.
Deutsche Bank said in a statement it would make Frankfurt rather than London the primary booking hub for its investment banking clients, as per an announcement made last year.
""By definition this involves moving assets from London to Frankfurt, a process which is already underway with the full understanding of UK and EU regulators,"" it said, declining to specify the volume of asset shifts.
A source familiar with the matter said the European Central Bank, as Europe's main financial supervisor, was putting pressure on banks to shift investment banking activities from London to the continent.
The ECB thereby wants to prevent investment banks setting up empty shells on the continent while still supplying their services from London, the source added.
Regulators are demanding that capital, risk management, governance structures are set up on the continent to support investment banking activities, the person said.
With passporting for financial services off the table Deutsche Bank illustrates what to expect from Brexit, analysts from think-tank Eurointelligence said.
While the least disruptive possibility would have been that only new business would move to the continent, a disruptive option is to actually shift existing portfolios.
""This is not only a major cross-border financial flow in itself but also a huge logistical and legal undertaking for the banks involved, and their clients. Contracts need to be modified, one by one,"" Eurointelligence said. 
The ECB declined to comment.
According to a report by the Financial Times, Deutsche Bank could over time move about three quarters of its estimated 600 billion euros ($700 billion) in assets from London to Frankfurt.
One option being considered is to shrink the London balance sheet so it ends up being smaller than its U.S. holding company, which has roughly $145 billion of assets, the paper said.
According to a source close to the matter, Deutsche Bank is also considering transforming its UK arm into a smaller, less complex and ring-fenced subsidiary. 
Analysts at Eurointelligence said this was costly in terms of capital. ""We presume this is because of netting effects between the London and Frankfurt books which would disappear if the London business becomes a separate firm,"" they said. 
Deutsche Bank said while the terms on which banks will operate in the EU and Britain after Brexit remained unclear, the lender plans to operate in the UK as a branch in line with the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority's guidance.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 07:49AM ET</span>",Shares knocked lower after new U.S. tariff threat on Chinese goods,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets headed south on Monday as investors took fright at news that Washington was set to announce a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods in the latest escalation of their trade conflict.
U.S. President Donald Trump's expected announcement of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods drew an immediate threat of reprisals from Beijing. 
Trump took to Twitter early on Monday to say: ""If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be ""Tariffed!""
The growing trade conflict between the world's two largest economies has long unnerved investors who fear an escalation could eventually whack global growth, while talks between the two countries have failed to make much headway.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 0.2 percent, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI), home to large exporters and carmakers, dropped half a percent. France's CAC 40 (FCHI) and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) each fell 0.3 percent.
Last week, Europe's STOXX 600 had enjoyed its best weekly gain since July as the Turkish central bank's interest rate rise brought a broad relief rally, but the mood was less buoyant on Monday. 
The falls in Europe followed weakness across Asian markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) dropped 1.2 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, remains more than 5 percent off its record high touched in January, and down 0.8 percent in September.
""On the Chinese side, Mr. Trump has burned a lot of political capital so it's hard to see how talks can resume if Mr. Trump goes ahead on the $200 billion,"" Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
""China's scope to retaliate is surprisingly limited, however, especially since the outbreak of swine flu, which will anyway push up CPI inflation,"" Beamish said, referring to the deadly swine fever strain that is seen impacting Chinese pork prices. 
The S&P 500 e-minis (ESc1) fell 0.1 percent, indicating Wall Street would open slightly weaker.
FURTHER ESCALATION
Beamish doubted whether the United States would slap 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, as the Trump administration has said it is considering, and the Wall Street Journal reported the tariff level would probably be about 10 percent.
Market watchers reckon further escalation is likely, although some investors think Trump's tariff threats are largely rhetoric aimed at a domestic audience before the mid-term elections in November. They expect tensions to ease once the vote is out of the way.
""I think the market has digested more or less all this rollercoaster with tariffs and I think [Trump is] trying to finish off with this matter until November,"" said Dimitrios Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at Alpha Trust in Greece.
The dollar fell on Monday, suggesting investor nervousness was limited. The greenback tends to firm during bouts of trade tension as investors seek safety in the world's most liquid currency. 
The greenback index (DXY) slipped 0.2 percent at 94.725, having bounced from a low of 94.359 at the end of last week as Treasury yields rose. 
The euro added 0.3 percent to $1.1659 (EUR=) and the yen strengthened 0.1 percent to below 111 , with broader foreign exchange moves limited.
Emerging market currencies were mostly weaker after a strong run last week following the Turkish central bank's decision to sharply raise interest rates to shore up confidence in the lira.
The lira fell more than one percent to 6.2340  while Russia's rouble dropped 0.2 percent to 68.17 (RUB=) as the effect of a Russian central bank rate hike on Friday faded.
European government bond markets were quiet and yields mostly flat, but Italian yields fell 6-8 basis points (IT5YT=RR) (IT2YT=RR) amid growing hopes that Italian ministers, who meet later on Monday, will agree a market-friendly 2019 budget. 
Oil prices rebounded from earlier losses despite assurances from Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States can raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) rose 0.78 percent to $78.70 a barrel. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was up 0.75 percent at $69.51.

Gold traded 0.28 percent higher at $1,197.51 an ounce , but was still some way from last week's top at $1,212.65.

But another metric of financial health suggests all may not be as rosy as it first appears. The tangible net worth, or book value, of S&P 500 companies has been falling this year. The last time it had a sustained drop was right after the financial crisis in 2008. The time before that was in the previous recession in 2001.
The latest dip is not a new trend. The tangible book value of the S&P 500 companies peaked in 2014 and has dropped ever since. But tangible book values had begun to bounce back last year. What’s more, with this year’s dip, the S&P 500’s tangible book value has surrendered nearly all of its gains since the rebound from the financial crisis. At $2.45 trillion, the value, which is a calculation of assets minus liabilities, is the lowest since the end of 2010.
Several trends are converging to deflate corporate net worths. Low interest rates have encouraged borrowing, doubling corporations’ debt load in the past decade, which subtracts from book value. Stock buybacks, too, thanks to the change in the tax law, have boomed this year. That drains cash from corporate balance sheets and has also lowered book values. But the fact that earnings are not adding enough new cash to refill corporate capital buckets and then some is also contributing to the drop. Despite the jump in earnings, cash flow from operations is up much less, just 4 percent in the past 12 months, compared with the period a year earlier."

1406,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Turkey Planning Help for Banks on Anticipation of Bad Loans,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish government will unveil measures to help banks tackle the expected pile-up of bad loans resulting from the lira’s plunge and soaring interest rates, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The plan will seek to mitigate the need for capital injections and propose carving out non-performing loans for transfer to a state-designated entity, said the people, who asked not to be named because the deliberations are confidential. The plan is likely to be announced Thursday, one of the people said.
Shares of Turkish banks rallied on the news. Even before the currency crisis worsened in August, Turkey’s lenders were struggling to deal with a pile-up of restructurings. The lira has dropped about 40 percent against the dollar this year, matching the Argentine peso as the world’s worst-performing currency and hurting Turkish firms’ ability to repay foreign-currency loans.
The measures were discussed in a series of meetings between bank executives and senior government officials last week, according to one of the people. On Thursday, Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is expected to announce a medium-term economic program with fiscal and macroeconomic targets for the next three years, and the help for banks will likely be unveiled then, the person said.
The Borsa Istanbul Banks Index pared its loss from as much as 2.6 percent to a 1.7 percent decline as of 1:15 p.m. in Istanbul.
The Treasury and Finance Ministry didn’t immediately comment on the plan when reached by Bloomberg.
The lira’s losses in August were triggered by U.S. sanctions on two Turkish ministers over the detention of an American pastor, and they accelerated when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on some of the nation’s imports. That exacerbated existing concern about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s unconventional economic views and opposition to interest-rate increases.
Last week, the central bank defied Erdogan, jacking up rates to 24 percent, more than expected, though the currency is still trading below where it was in July.

 Disney  sought EU approval for the deal on Sept. 14, according to a filing on the EU competition website. It can either clear the deal with or without concessions or open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.
The U.S. Justice Department gave the green light to the deal in June on condition Disney sells Fox's 22 regional sports networks.
Acquisition of Fox's assets would broaden Disney's unrivaled portfolio of some of the world's most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox's X-Men, ""Avatar"" and ""The Simpsons"" franchises.

Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox's stake in Hulu.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","China Southern Airlines plans to grow fleet to 2,000 planes by 2035: CEO","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Southern Airlines (SS:600029) (HK:1055) plans to more than double the size of its fleet to 2,000 aircraft by 2035 and is exploring ways to cooperate with low-cost carriers, its chief executive said at a conference on Monday. 
Tan Wangeng told the World Routes conference that China's largest carrier by passenger numbers is also looking to fly to South America within the next three years, according to the official conference website.
""By 2020 there will be 200 million outbound tourists from China. This provides us with a lot of opportunities for development,"" Tan told the conference in Guangzhou. 
""We plan to have 1,000 aircraft by 2020 and by 2035 it will increase to 2,000,"" he was quoted as saying.
The company said last month that it had a fleet of 786 passenger and cargo aircraft at the end of June. 
China Southern was not immediately able to confirm Tan's comments. 
Tan said the airline was looking for ways to cope with a rising number of budget carriers, especially in China and Southeast Asia where they compete for market share. 
""All major airlines need partners and we are looking into the possibility of establishing more joint ventures. We haven't tried with low-cost carriers yet, but we are considering how to cooperate with them,"" he said. 
Chinese airlines, including the firm's main rivals  Air China  (SS:601111) (HK:0753) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) (HK:0670), have been aggressively expanding their fleets and launching new routes in response to booming travel demand in the country. 
However, passenger returns are now falling on some routes due to stiffer competition and the impact of higher capacity.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 05:54AM ET</span>",H&M shares jump as logistics revamp helps speed sales,"By Helena Soderpalm and Olof Swahnberg
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M's (ST:HMb) sales bounced back in the third quarter, helped by a new logistics system, as the world's second biggest fashion retailer said a revamp to meet growing online and budget competition was paying off. 
The Swedish company's shares, which have lost nearly two thirds of their value since record highs in 2015, jumped as much as 13 percent in early Monday trade. 
Dealers said the stock was also boosted by a report in Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper that H&M chairman and main owner Stefan Persson had talked to banks about ""a massive debt financing package for further share purchases and a mega deal to take the firm private"". H&M declined to comment.
H&M has seen profits shrink and inventories pile up over the past couple of years as its core budget brand has lost sales to low-price rivals like Primark and Forever 21 as well as online competitors such as ASOS (L:ASOS) and Zalando (DE:ZALG).
However, the company has invested heavily in digitalization, cut prices and launched a review of its mix of stores and brands, closing some H&M stores and expanding its newer brands more quickly. It is also working on a new H&M store concept.
The firm, which will report full fiscal third-quarter figures on Sept. 27, said the steps it had taken ""to face the major shift within the industry"" had contributed to gradually improved sales and increased share in many markets.
""We are in a transition year and see that things are starting to go in the right direction,"" Nils Vinge, head of H&M investor relations, told Reuters.
H&M's local-currency sales including value added tax (VAT)rose 4 percent in the June-August period, against a mean Reuters poll forecast for a 1.9 percent increase. They were flat in the second quarter. 
Reported sales excluding VAT were up 9 percent to 55.8 billion Swedish crowns ($6.2 billion), beating a forecast 5.5 percent rise to 54.0 billion crowns.
Bigger rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, last week reported 3 percent sales growth for the six months to the end of July, and forecast second-half like-for-like sales growth of 4-6 percent as well as improved profitability.
""We think H&M has done the right thing in lowering entry point prices and investing in its offer for the long term, but expect this to lead to margin pressure in the short term,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.
Lars Soderfjell, portfolio manager at Alandsbanken, agreed, noting like-for-like sales were probably still down 1 to 2 percent in the quarter: ""There is a headline surprise, which is enough to lift an underowned stock significantly.""
H&M shares have been heavily shorted recently, which traders said exacerbated Monday's recovery.
GRAPHIC: H&M share price gyrates in 2018 - https://reut.rs/2MDS8k1
LOGISTICS
The stock has gyrated this year as the founding Persson family has made large stock purchases, stoking rumors of buyout plans. Persson dismissed the talk in June.
H&M shares have also lagged Inditex, which has been helped by a more flexible supply chain and earlier integration of online and stores with services such as click-and-collect.
H&M is rolling out a new logistics system to make its supply chain faster and more efficient and better integrate its more than 4,700 stores with its website, which Vinge said had overall been helpful in the quarter.
However, the retailer said the introduction of the system had hit sales and raised costs in important markets such as the United States, France, Italy and Belgium. Vinge said the logistics problems should be over after the fourth quarter.
""We have solved the fundamental problems. It will have an impact on the fourth quarter as we have a backlog with the supply of new fashion garments especially in the U.S., but it will be smaller for each and every day,"" he said.
H&M has forecast a continued slowdown in comparable sales at its physical stores this year, and a return to growth in 2019.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 05:04AM ET</span>",Swiss watchdog raps Credit Suisse for anti-corruption failings,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) failed to adequately combat money laundering in suspected corruption cases linked to soccer's ruling body FIFA and Venezuelan and Brazilian state oil companies, Switzerland's financial watchdog FINMA said on Monday, dealing a blow to the bank's reputation.
Watchdog FINMA will appoint an independent auditor to oversee the bank's anti-money laundering processes, but stopped short of forcing it to return any profits that it might have illegally reaped. FINMA has no authority to fine banks it supervises.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank behind UBS (S:UBSG) also fell short of its obligations to fight corruption while managing ""a significant business relationship"" with a politically exposed person, the authority said on Monday.
Credit Suisse said in a statement the Swiss watchdog had uncovered ""legacy weaknesses"", adding it has acted to bolster compliance since Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam took over from his predecessor, Brady Dougan, in March 2015.
Instead of disciplining a star private banker who breached compliance regulations for years, FINMA said Credit Suisse boosted his pay. 
A banking source identified the manager as Patrice Lescaudron, jailed for five years in February. 
""The identified shortcomings occurred repeatedly over a number of years, mainly before 2014,"" FINMA said, adding that many of the problems emerged from group subsidiary Clariden Leu AG, which was fully merged into Credit Suisse in 2012. 
""FINMA identified deficiencies in the anti-money laundering process, as well as shortcomings in the bank's control mechanisms and risk management,"" the authority added.
The independent auditor will monitor Credit Suisse to ensure it follows through on improvements.
The enforcement action against Credit Suisse emerged from FINMA's investigation into several Swiss financial institutions starting in 2015 in relation to suspected corruption involving FIFA, Brazil's Petrobras (SA:PETR4) and the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. [PDVSA.UL]
The shares fell 0.1 percent at 0840 GMT, in line with the benchmark Swiss Market Index (SSMI). 
PAST FAILINGS
Thiam has been forced to manage repeated allegations of wrongdoing that Credit Suisse said preceded his arrival, including charges of foreign exchange rates rigging in Europe, a hiring corruption probe in Asia and a $1 billion graft probe involving Venezuela's state oil company. 
FINMA last year reprimanded Credit Suisse over its dealings with Malaysian state fund 1MDB. Singapore's central bank also fined the bank for breaching money laundering rules in the case.
Analysts said the regulator's harsh tone and the instalment of a monitor could dent confidence in Credit Suisse's efforts to fix problems of the past.
""FINMA's statements will hardly calm things down, since it put it out there in black and white what it thinks about the quality of the bank's efforts to fight money laundering,"" Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Javier Lodeiro said.
""Still, this enforcement action did focus on the time between 2006 and 2015."" 
FINMA acknowledged Credit Suisse has undertaken measures since 2015 to strengthen compliance and anti-money laundering protections, but said more must be done ""to prove that higher-risk business relationships and transactions are adequately detected, categorised, monitored and documented"".
Lescaudron, the Geneva-based relationship manager, was found guilty of serious fraud and forgery in his handling of clients, including former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and Russian oligarch Vitaly Malkin, over an eight-year period.
That case reveals weaknesses in the bank’s organization and risk management, FINMA said. ""Instead of disciplining the client manager promptly and proportionately, the bank rewarded him with high payments and positive employee assessments.""
Credit Suisse said it has not been fined, ordered to hand over profits or had any curbs on its business activities, suggesting its failings were less serious than those committed by some other Swiss financial institutions.
Earlier this year, FINMA ordered PKB Privatbank SA Lugano to surrender 1.3 million Swiss francs ($1.35 million) in unlawfully generated profits after concluding it committed serious breaches linked to its business with Petrobras.
Credit Suisse said that it has already made thousands of improvements to correct weaknesses as part of a restructuring program that Thiam began, including hiring 800 compliance specialists in the last three years.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered rapidly from a weak start on Monday after reports U.S. President Trump plans new 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, with investors focusing on strong results.
Despite China's Foreign Ministry also saying it would respond to Trump's threat, an early fall across European benchmarks evaporated with just Germany's DAX still in the red by 0840 GMT.
The pan-European STOXX 600 reversed early losses to rise 0.2 percent, while Germany's DAX, home to large exporters and carmakers, was down 0.2 percent. Chinese stocks had fallen to their lowest close in nearly four years overnight.
""I think the market has digested more or less all this rollercoaster with tariffs,"" said Dimitrios Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at AlphaTrust in Athens, adding that investors believe Trump will seek a deal ahead of U.S. mid-term elections. 
The market was buoyed by strong defensive telecoms and utilities stocks. Cyclicals sectors, which are more sensitive to trade and economic growth, have lagged as the trade war ramped up over the past months.
""If the trade war hits the economy, then defensives will be better off,"" said Stefanopoulos.
On Monday several stocks shone after results, helping support risk appetite. 
Forecast-beating sales from H&M (ST:HMb) sent the shares up 12.6 percent, an encouraging result for the world's second-biggest fashion retailer whose shares are down 43 percent from their level a year ago.
The large amount of H&M shares being shorted by investors makes any positive news a significant boost for the stock as short sellers are ""squeezed"" to unravel their position. 
Belgian biotech firm Argenx (BR:ARGX) jumped 13 percent after it reported positive results from a trial of its Efgartigimod drug for primary immune thrombocytopenia.
 Casino  (PA:CASP) shares rose 2.9 percent after the French supermarket's parent  Rallye , through which Jean-Charles Naouri exercises control of the firm, got a new 500 million euro credit facility.
Rallye (PA:GENC) shares - which are highly shorted - jumped 6.9 percent.
 Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) shares dipped 0.1 percent after Swiss regulator Finma said the lender had failed in its duty to combat corruption in cases linked to FIFA and Venezuelan and Brazilian state oil companies.
The stock was likely supported by an interview with CEO Tidjane Thiam in Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag, in which he said Credit Suisse was aiming for an annual profit of 5 to 6 billion francs for the next two years.
And on the M&A front, reinsurer  Scor  (PA:SCOR) rose 1.7 percent after sources told Reuters unlisted French cooperative insurer Covea was working on a new approach for Scor after its friendly 8.2 billion euro offer was rejected last month.
While the potential tariffs on China were reported to be 10 percent, lower than the 25 percent the administration had previously said it was considering, economists said this would still have a significant impact on markets. 

""Our U.S. economists expect that even a 10 percent tariff rate will slow growth in Q4, resulting in the Fed skipping a December hike,"" wrote UBS strategists.

""This is the first step in incorporating loans and debt instruments into PIF's long-term funding strategy,"" the fund's managing director Yasir al-Rumayyan said in a statement.
He added that the PIF would ""develop into one of the most prominent users of banking services in the region"".
The PIF, which is to play a leading role in Saudi Arabia's drive to develop non-oil industries, said it would use the loan for ""general corporate purposes"".
The fund, with assets estimated at over $250 billion, originally sought to raise between $6 billion and $8 billion, according to sources, but Rumayyan said the size had been increased because of strong interest among banks and favorable pricing.
He did not give details of the loan, but banking sources previously said it would have a five-year maturity and be structured as a club loan, with 14 to 16 banks making commitments of up to $1 billion at three different levels.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last month that the PIF would pay a margin of 75 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate on the loan.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 01:40AM ET</span>",Australia's AMP charged life insurance premiums to dead clients - inquiry,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's biggest listed wealth manager AMP Ltd charged life insurance premiums to dead customers even after concerns over the practice were raised by a staff member, a powerful misconduct inquiry heard on Monday.
The disclosures at the inquiry, called a Royal Commission, heaps further pressure on one of the country's biggest financial institutions which previously revealed it had charged thousands of customers for financial advice it never gave, then doctored a supposedly independent report to the corporate regulator about it.
AMP is not the only major Australian company to admit to charging dead client accounts. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank Ltd, the nation's No.1 and No.4 lenders, have told the inquiry they engaged in similar practices.
""Charging premiums for life insurance to someone who is dead, that is the position isn't it?"" said Kenneth Hayne, the former judge leading the inquiry. 
Under questioning, AMP's head of wealth solutions Paul Sainsbury told the inquiry the company's systems are set up to continue deducting amounts from the pension fund accounts of its deceased customers for life insurance cover, even after it knows the people have died.
AMP then refunds the extra charges when the policies are approved and paid.
""Yes that is the way the system is treating it today, for a portion of our business,"" said Sainsbury, replying to Hayne's question about premiums being charged for the dead. 
While the inquiry was presented with evidence that a staff member had raised concerns over dead client account charges in 2016, Sainsbury said AMP only became aware of the problem in April this year after similar admissions by CBA at the inquiry prompted AMP to launch an investigation.
He said the company is investigating if other types of fees had also been deducted from deceased customers' accounts. 
Sainsbury also said that about A$1.3 million ($930,280.00) of life insurance premiums collected from over four thousand dead customers had yet to be refunded, blaming ""record-keeping system"" errors.
The insurance sector is loosely regulated in Australia with no formal regulator. Australia's regulators have come in for criticism at the inquiry and are under pressure to demonstrate they are reining in the finance sector amid daily revelations of misconduct by firms.
Later this week, the inquiry will explore whether the insurance industry's largely self-regulatory regime should continue. 
AMP's reputation has been one of the worst hit by the inquiry. 
While its shares were up 2.2 percent in a broadly unchanged market on Monday afternoon, they are down 33 percent since evidence of poor business practices began to emerge in April.
The powerful inquiry, which can recommend criminal prosecutions and tougher regulations, is scheduled to complete its investigation into the insurance sector this week, after having already found widespread wrong-doing in the consumer credit, rural lending, small business banking and pension sectors. 
It will hold a final set of hearings in November and will provide a report to the federal government in February that could recommend legislative changes to the financial sector.

While Bridgewater Associates Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are starting to fret that tighter fiscal and monetary policies will create problems for the world’s biggest economy in two years’ time, Goldman Sachs sees just a 36 percent chance of recession over the next three years. That risk is below the historical average.
“There has been increasing investor interest in the chance of a recession in the U.S. over the next few years,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report published on Sunday. “Our model paints a more benign picture.”
They reckon growth will stay robust and are less worried than they were that financial conditions had become unsustainably easy.
Still, they noted that the U.S. still has the power to pull down other economies. If America is in a recession, the chance other developed economies will suffer the same fate over the subsequent year is almost 70 percent, according to Goldman Sachs’s analysis of four decades of data.
“Historical experience suggests that recessions in the U.S. have gone hand in hand with recessions elsewhere,” Hatzius’s team said. “But even though the U.S. cycle matters for other economies, we remain sanguine about the outlook.”"
1424,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>","High U.S. stock valuations hinge on inflation, interest rates","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are banking on tame inflation and interest rates to support U.S. stock prices and help counter any concerns over an anticipated slowdown in corporate earnings growth next year.
As they have recently, stocks in general are poised to trade at valuations, based on price-to-earnings ratios, higher than they have traded on average since the mid-1980s, investors said.
Yields on U.S. government securities and consumer prices overall have been moving higher, although they remain relatively moderate. Investors said low bond yields mean reduced investment competition for stocks, and relatively subdued inflation supports low interest rates.
""There’s an argument historically with that type of inflation backdrop and rates where they are, that you can justify a higher valuation,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.
The ability of stocks to hold relatively high valuations is important because an expected slowdown in corporate profit growth in 2019 could otherwise temper stock returns. Analysts will increasingly focus on next year's outlook as third-quarter reports arrive next month. 
Spurred by corporate tax cuts that took effect this year, earnings of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) are expected to climb 23 percent in 2018, and then 10 percent in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Stocks are commonly valued by their forward P/E ratios, meaning their prices divided by earnings estimates for the next 12 months. 
The S&P 500's average forward P/E over the past 33 years has been 15 times earnings estimates, but the index has traded above that level for more than two years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
This year, the index peaked at about 18.5 times in late January before the market's 10 percent correction, and now trades at about 16.8 times.
(For a graphic on 'U.S. stock market valuation over time' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2p5ZRyc)
More than 60 years of data show that the S&P 500 trades on average at higher valuations when the consumer price index (CPI), a common measure of inflation, is rising annually between 0 to 4 percent, compared to when it is higher or when there is deflation, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. 
Annual CPI last topped 4 percent about 10 years ago.
When the CPI increases 0-2 percent, the index trades at 16.6 times forward P/E. At 2-4 percent CPI growth, the average is 16.4 times. In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 2.7 percent, according to data on Thursday.
Lerner calls a P/E of 16 to 17 times a fair current valuation, with global trade tensions and other issues causing fluctuations within that range. 
""The way the market is looking at this is a 16 level on a forward P/E basis is pretty good support,"" Lerner said. 
(For an interactive graphic on 'Low inflation, high stock valuations' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CTrTq7)
Equity strategists at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) project the forward P/E will drift higher and end 2019 at 18 times. They project the S&P 500 will finish next year at 3,350, a roughly 15 percent rise from current levels.
Credit Suisse equity strategist Patrick Palfrey said tax cuts and other factors are propping up results in 2018, so next year's decline in earnings growth is less severe that it seems. 
This year's underlying earnings growth is closer to 9-10 percent, Palfrey said, which would be only slightly ahead of the nearly 8 percent expected by Credit Suisse next year.
Credit Suisse also sees limited risk of a recession on the horizon, Palfrey said. 
""The economy actually is still moving at a very healthy clip,” Palfrey said.
While current P/Es are higher than average historically, strategists point to a change in the composition over time of the S&P 500, including a greater weight for higher-valued tech companies, as a reason why those historical comparisons may not be as appropriate.
Another factor is the relative attractiveness of equities to bonds and other assets. For example, the earnings yield, which is earnings divided by a stock's price, for the S&P 500 is currently 6 percent, against a roughly 3 percent yield for U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR).
A spike in bond yields would change the valuation equation, could be put to the test as the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its tightening cycle. 
Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, said a 4 percent yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note would pressure equities, although he doesn't see that level in the near term.

“Every investment is competition for that next dollar,” Hackett said.

1425,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",Noble Group's Top Creditors Seek to Draw a Line Under Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Noble Group Ltd. plans to introduce the schemes of arrangement that underpin its restructuring this week, a key step in the creation of a new company that senior creditors signaled will hold to the highest standards of corporate governance after a drawn-out crisis.
The schemes, which buttress the $3.5 billion debt-for-equity rescue, will be introduced in courts in London and Bermuda by Sept. 21, the commodity trader said on Monday. In a separate release, the company’s ad hoc group, or AHG, of senior creditors said they expected “Old Noble” to file for insolvency, while its successor entity revives the core business overseen by a tough new board.
After years of crisis, losses and defaulting, Noble Group has been putting in place the final elements of the rescue, which will see control handed to the senior creditors. Last month, Noble won shareholder backing for the plan, and it’s said more than 85 percent of senior creditors are in support. Completion of the overhaul will likely bring fresh scrutiny on whether the slimmed-down company can both turn a profit and service its reduced debt burden while also moving on from the claims of impropriety that marked its implosion.
The ad hoc group “believes that the current management team, coupled with a new governance structure, is well-positioned to execute on the proposed turnaround,” Joseph Swanson, senior managing director at Houlihan Lokey Inc., a financial adviser to the creditors that are backing the rescue, said in a letter. Candidates for the new board “must be committed to international best practices and the highest levels of ethical comportment.”
New Structure
Under Noble’s revamp, 70 percent of the equity in a new company will go to the senior creditors, 10 percent to management and the rest to existing stockholders. The debt burden will be halved. After asset sales, Noble has shrunk back to its roots and it’s now focused on coal, LNG and freight.
Iceberg Research -- a long-time foe of Noble led by a former employee, Arnaud Vagner -- has said the debt-for-equity proposal won’t revive the trader’s fortunes and has criticized Noble’s management and accounting, including claims profits were overstated. In response, Noble Group has consistently stood by its accounts and defended its actions.
The ad hoc group said members had weighed up the merits of winding down the business or selling the trader to a strategic investor, but both options were rejected in favor of keeping Noble together as a rejuvenated standalone business. In reaching that decision, the group checked out the claims against Noble Group, including suggestions its accounts weren’t rigorous enough.
‘Public Critics’
As part of their review, “the AHG and its financial advisors conducted a financial and business diligence exercise giving specific attention to matters raised by public critics,” Swanson’s letter said. “The new board will conduct a comprehensive review of corporate accounting and risk-management policies as part of its commitment to best practice governance arrangements.”
Noble Group is in the process of finding a new chairman to replace incumbent Paul Brough, and has said the successful candidate will come from outside the company. In their letter, the AHG said there’d been good progress on drawing up the new board, including a slate of independent directors.
“It is important to note that for the AHG, the balance sheet write-downs over the past 12 months conservatively recalibrated asset valuations,” Swanson’s letter said. “The AHG looks to the new board to take a similarly conservative approach to non-cash accruals specifically, and accounting matters generally.”
In an indicative outline released in March, Noble had aimed for the rescue to be done by July but that timeline slipped after it faced opposition from some shareholders and it revised the terms. The restructure should be completed in two to three months, the company said at the shareholder meeting.
“They have missed some deadlines on the restructuring path, so it’s now rushing to turn a page in its history,” said Ang Chung Yuh, senior fixed-income analyst at iFAST Corp. in Singapore. “It remains to be seen if the new entity can service the debt load. We can only tell if the same management can deliver the turnaround, when we get the first few quarters of results.”
Moody’s Investors Service has also highlighted the challenges. While the agency recently raised Noble’s corporate family credit score two steps to Caa1 as the rescue was on track, it also said that score reflects a “high level of uncertainty surrounding the company’s ability to turn around its operations.”

The tariff level will probably be about 10%, the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. This is below the 25% the administration said it was considering for this possible round of tariffs.
The decision came despite a Treasury invitation last week to senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, for more talks to try to resolve trade differences between the world\'s two largest economies.

The factory produces Model 3 electric motors and battery packs, according to the electric carmaker's website. The company said there were no injuries in the fire.
The Storey County Emergency Management department said the county's fire department responded to a reported fire at the factory on Saturday at about 10:12 p.m. PDT (0512 GMT) and the fire was suppressed by the sprinkler system and with the help of fire personnel.
The scene of the fire was turned back over to Tesla for cleanup and repairs at about 2:00 a.m. PDT. on Sunday, the department's director, Joe Curtis, said in a statement.
A Tesla spokesperson said employees had been evacuated as a precautionary measure, but there were no injuries and production began again on Sunday morning. 
The fire was in the cooling tube coating oven on the third floor of the factory, and it was quickly contained, the spokesperson said in a statement, adding the cause was under investigation.
The spokesperson did not give details of any damage.
Saturday's fire was the latest fire at a Tesla factory. There was a minor fire last month on the grounds of the Tesla factory in California.

In August, Tesla said it expects to produce 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter and said it expects to turn a profit in the second half of this year. The company has been trying to iron out production bumps after struggling to produce Model 3's and failing to meet several production deadlines.

Andreas Scheuer was quoted as saying that German carmakers should offer owners of older diesel-fuelled cars attractive incentives to replace them, but added that no state money would be offered.
""The government is not a car dealer,"" he told the newspaper's Monday edition, according to extracts of the interview released by the newspaper on Sunday. 
Germany's existing or planned local environmental rules could see 1.3 million older diesel cars banned from several cities soon, Funke Mediengruppe reported on Sunday, citing government papers. 
While car owners should be given attractive incentives, retrofits should only be applied when they make technical and economic sense, Scheuer said.
The car industry has lobbied against equipping old diesel models with extra emissions control technology because that could cost billions of euros.
According to Scheuer, 3.1 million diesel cars with the Euro-4 emission standard and 3.5 million Euro-5 diesels cannot be retrofitted, adding that for other cars the fix would cost at least 3,000 euros ($3,488) each. 

The minister has been tasked by Chancellor Angela Merkel to come up with a solution to make older diesel cars cleaner and to avoid large-scale bans on diesel cars.

Deutsche will also transform its UK arm into a ringfenced subsidiary after Brexit and reduce the size and complexity of its British operations, the source said.
The Financial Times reported earlier on Sunday, citing people familiar with the thinking of the bank's executives, that Deutsche could eventually move about three-quarters of its estimated 600 billion euros in capital back from London to its headquarters. 
No final decision has been made on the size of the asset move, it added. 
Deutsche Bank and the ECB declined to comment.
According to the Financial Times, one option being considered is to shrink the size of the London balance sheet so it ends up smaller than its U.S. holding company, which has roughly $145 billion of assets.

Any large-scale transfer of assets would not happen overnight, but would take between three and five years or even longer, the paper reported, adding that setting up a ringfenced UK subsidiary would potentially cost Deutsche hundreds of millions of euros.

Dimon said he was speaking ""more out of frustration and my own machismo,"" and had no plans to run for president.
""I never say never to anything, but no,"" Dimon said when asked if he would run for president.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Arabia to auction detained tycoon's real estate assets - sources,"By Marwa Rashad and Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will auction real estate owned by indebted billionaire Maan al-Sanea and his company starting next month to help repay billions of riyals due to creditors, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Sanea, ranked by Forbes in 2007 as one of the world's 100 richest people, was detained last year for unpaid debts dating back to 2009 when his company, Saad Group, defaulted.
His case is separate from the scores of Saudi businessmen and prominent figures who were held on corruption charges last year at Riyadh's Ritz Carlton hotel, although it touches on similar investor concerns about corporate governance.
In what was Saudi Arabia's longest-running debt dispute, creditors have spent the past nine years pursuing Saad Group, which is based in the Eastern Province, for debt repayment.
Etqaan Alliance, the consortium appointed late last year by a three-judge tribunal to resolve Saad's debt dispute, will sell the assets over five months at auctions in the Eastern Province, Riyadh and Jeddah, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The first auction - of undeveloped and commercial land plots, a farm, and income-generating residential buildings in Eastern Province's Khobar and Dammam - will take place in late October, the sources added.
One source estimated sale proceeds at one to two billion riyals ($267-$533 million). 
A creditor source said the auction had been delayed because of weakness in the local property market.
In March, Etqaan launched the first phase of the auction with around 900 vehicles owned by Saad Group, including trucks, buses, diggers, forklift trucks and golf carts.
That auction raised around 125 million riyals, which went to repay some creditors, including unpaid workers. Proceeds from upcoming auctions will go to 34 creditors, mostly banks, the sources said.
It is unclear whether Sanea, who remains in detention, will be released after his assets are sold.
Saad Group, with interests spanning banking to healthcare, defaulted together with Ahmad Hamad al-Gosaibi and Brothers (AHAB) in 2009, leaving banks with unpaid debt of about $22 billion in what was Saudi Arabia’s biggest financial meltdown.
Earlier this year, Reemas, a financial consultancy advising al-Sanea, reached out to some creditors to try to agree to a settlement that could involve swapping creditor debts for real estate assets, but the terms are still under negotiation.
Local, regional and international banks eligible for a settlement have claims totaling 16 billion riyals, with international banks such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Citi (N:C), and regional lenders such as Mashreq, having claims of over 1 billion riyals each, sources told Reuters previously.
Some observers estimate Saad's total debt to be between 40 billion and 60 billion riyals.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Islamic banks face outdated property rules: industry body,"By Bernardo Vizcaino
(Reuters) - Regulators overseeing Islamic banking must revise guidance on real estate exposures to align with the post-financial crisis capital rules of Basel III, a global industry body said on Sunday.
The Bahrain-based General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (CIBAFI) said treatment of real estate across Islamic finance jurisdictions still reflected Basel II or pre-reform Basel III rules.
But a revised version of Basel III, finalised in December 2017, introduced additional requirements including concentration limits and independent asset valuations.
Such requirements are important for Islamic banks as many have high exposure to real estate in both their investment and financing activities, coupled with the illiquid and cyclical nature of the asset class, CIBAFI said.
""As a result, Islamic banks may be hit particularly hard by any downturn in the real estate sector.""
Islamic commercial banks are estimated to hold more than $1.3 trillion in assets globally, a sector considered systemically important in countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Malaysia.
Around half of large Islamic banks and two-thirds of small Islamic banks have a high to very high exposure to real estate and mortgages, according to a CIBAFI industry survey.
Islamic banks in Bahrain, Jordan and Kuwait recorded roughly a 25 percent exposure to real estate in their activities, CIBAFI data showed.
CIBAFI said national regulators must incorporate the Basel III revisions, while the Malaysia-based Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) should also revise its own capital adequacy standard for Islamic banks.
That standard, known as IFSB-15, had initially proposed concentration limits on real estate but these were not adopted in a final version, CIBAFI said.
This would have placed a cap on aggregate real estate investment exposures of 60 percent of regulatory capital, with a 15 percent limit on single real estate investments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - German luxury vehicle maker BMW AG (DE:BMWG) plans more deals with mining companies to secure electric vehicle battery materials, and is open to forming alliances to share the costs of developing autonomous-vehicle systems, the automaker's research and development chief told Reuters. 
BMW management board member Klaus Froehlich said automakers and large suppliers are beginning to discuss how to agree on one standard for autonomous-vehicle systems. Froehlich has said in the past automakers and suppliers should agree on a single standard.
""Everybody has an interest or should have an interest"" in common autonomous-vehicle standards, Froehlich said earlier this week during an event to show off a futuristic, electric and autonomous sport utility vehicle. 
Froehlich made his comments before a report in Automotive News on Friday that Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is interested in an industry alliance to standardize autonomous vehicle systems.
On batteries, Froehlich said, BMW is pursuing a strategy aimed at securing lower-cost batteries than rivals, in part by controlling the supply of raw materials for its battery-making partners.
""We will have agreements with mining companies,"" Froehlich said. ""We have one agreement. There will be more."" A key issue, he said, is securing cobalt from mines that do not exploit workers or employ children.
BMW rode a wave of electric vehicle marketing this month by European luxury brands. The German automakers and rivals, including Tata Motors Ltd's (NS:TAMO) Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo Cars, a unit of China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Inc[GEELY.UL], are gearing up new electric models. The legacy automakers are under pressure from regulators in China, Europe and the state of California to field more clean vehicles. The European brands also want to keep more affluent consumers from flocking to vehicles made by Silicon Valley automaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
BMW has previously disclosed agreements with Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300750) (CATL) and South Korea's  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930). However, Froehlich said those companies will supply batteries using a proprietary BMW design.
""In electromobility, you have to be a cost leader,"" he said. ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive."" 
BMW on Saturday showed off the electric, autonomous ""Vision iNext"" SUV in Beijing as part of a publicity tour in which the prototype car and a stage have traveled around the world in the hold of a Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) cargo jet. The vehicle, with gas and brake pedals that sink into the floor during autonomous driving and touch-screen controls embedded in the rear seat cushion, hints at an electric vehicle BMW could launch among 12 fully electric models it has promised by 2025. 
On Monday, Volkswagen's Audi brand plans a splashy launch for its e-Tron sport utility, the same day Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he plans to make news about the first passenger for his space launch company SpaceX's slyly named BFR rocket.

""For the future our goal is business as usual,"" Thiam said in the interview. ""We have worked night and day over the last three years to eliminate the problems from the past. 
""For the next two years a profit of between 5 and 6 billion francs is realistic."" 
For 2018, Thiam said he expected the bank's profits to be ""a little lower"" as it is still dealing with high financing costs.

""In the next year this will be reduced...which will have a positive effect on our profits."" 
Despite the recent reduction of 1,600 jobs, Switzerland remained important for the bank, Thiam said.

""Particularly when risks across the world increase, customers are looking for security."" 
The CEO, who took over in 2015, also appeared to increase his commitment to Credit Suisse after recent comments where he ruled out a political career in his native Ivory Coast.

In a round of interviews with newspapers published on Saturday, Frydenberg said he would demand answers from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), over mounting troubles in the financial services sector. 
""I'm appalled by the behavior that has been exposed through the banking royal commission,"" Frydenberg told Guardian Australian.
A Royal Commission inquiry has exposed systemic wrongdoing at some of Australia's top institutions, airing almost daily allegations of misconduct across the consumer credit, business lending, farm finance, pension fund and insurance sectors.
Flexing its muscle amid the criticism, ASIC on Friday sued Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) over a troubled A$2.5 billion (1.4 billion pounds) share placement. [nL3N1W02KF]
Frydenberg, a former energy minister who became treasurer in last month's major overhaul of the center-right government, told the Australian Finiancial Review Weekend the remediation changes were needed to compensate aggrieved customers.
""A new ASIC remediation power, as recommended by the ASIC capability review, and accepted in principle by the government, is one potential solution to ensure better and speedier consumer outcomes,"" he added.
Frydenberg also said he would be willing to extend the Royal Commission inquiry, if needed. The Commission is due to present to government its interim report on Sept. 30th.
He also said company tax cuts for big business, a policy abandoned last month, would not be reconsidered, but the government would focus on a deregulation agenda that would streamline approvals process for big businesses.
""The big focus for me is going to be on the productivity agenda, and the productivity agenda involves cutting regulation which is really important to business,"" he said. 

Frydenberg told Guardian Australia the government plans a series of big spending initiatives, such as more cash for Catholic schools, healthcare and the national disability insurance scheme. He said, however, that the government still has a target of balancing the budget in 2019-2020.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. technology and consumer discretionary stocks have been insulated from global trade tensions, but if another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods goes into effect, even those high-flying sectors could come down to earth.
The United States and China have already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods. The White House has proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including furniture, handbags and some computer parts. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to move forward with levies on an additional $267 billion - in essence, all Chinese imports into the United States.
The inclusion of consumer goods is a shift from previous rounds of U.S. tariffs, which have primarily hit the industrial sector. Shares of companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) have risen and fallen in tandem with trade sentiment.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration said that it invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks, which has been welcomed by Beijing. U.S. stocks have perked up on the news, but that optimism could be fleeting.
""Investors in general are too predisposed to react too positively to any signs of improvement in the situation,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""I don't expect the (Trump) administration to back down.""
Companies in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors have begun sounding alarm bells. A broad array of U.S. industry groups, representing companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT), has voiced opposition to the new tariffs.
Even Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose stock has contributed heavily to the S&P 500's gains, has warned that the proposed tariffs would affect several of its products, including the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, though it did not mention the iPhone.
In part because of trade issues, shares of tech companies have gotten off to a rocky start in September. As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 tech sector had fallen 1.2 percent this month, versus a 0.1 percent rise for the S&P 500 as a whole. S&P 500 consumer discretionary stocks had risen 0.2 percent, less than the 2 percent advance in industrial stocks.
""The next round of escalation really does impact the leadership of the market,"" said Lisa Shalett, head of investment and portfolio strategies at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management.
In anticipation of heightened trade tensions, companies have built up inventory, which could have an adverse effect on supply chains later on, Shalett said. Inventory pile-ups have already pushed down pricing in the semiconductor industry. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index had fallen 2.8 percent in September as of Thursday's close. 
Consumer-oriented companies face a catch-22 in their response to tariffs. Those that compete on price, such as Walmart, will likely have to absorb the cost of levies, which will cut into their margins. But companies that pass costs onto consumers, as Apple has indicated it will do, risk dampening demand for their products. 
Invesco's Hooper pointed to washing machines as an example. Tariffs on steel and aluminum caused Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR) to raise prices on its appliances, and its second-quarter earnings slumped as a result.
To be sure, consumer electronics are flashier products than a washer-dryer set. And U.S. tech companies can skirt some tariffs by shipping Chinese-made parts directly to other countries for assembly and then importing the finished items into the United States, said Scott Yuschak, equity strategy analyst at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. The list of targeted items in the next round of tariffs excludes cell phones, for instance.
With such mitigating factors, many investors are reluctant to make sweeping changes to their portfolios, though Morgan Stanley's Shalett has recommended a rotation into defensive sectors. 
Many are likely waiting for third-quarter earnings for more details on the impact of trade, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston.
But further signs of escalation in the U.S.-China trade war could quickly raise the stakes for the S&P's leading sectors. The final round of levies would include consumer electronic products imported from China. Some market watchers fear that China, which cannot match the United States in tit-for-tat tariffs, would respond by restricting U.S. companies' ability to sell products in the country.

""If you look at the broad base of technology, there isn't much impact at this point,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. ""But if you include the iPhone into tariffs, then that changes the whole game.""

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 08:41PM ET</span>",Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"By Anthony Boadle
ALCANTARA SPACE CENTER, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil is ready to launch small commercial rockets from its space base near the equator as soon as it agrees to safeguard U.S. technology that is dominant in the industry, the Brazilian Air Force officer managing the space program said on Friday.
Brig. Major Luiz Fernando Aguiar said Brazil wants to get a piece of the $300 billion-a-year space launch business by drawing U.S. companies interested in launching small satellites at a lower cost from the Alcantara base on its north coast.
""The microsatellite market is most attractive today and we are interested in the 50 to 500-kilo niche,"" Aguiar told Reuters at the base's main launch pad. ""We are developing a rocket for microsatellites. For that this tower is totally ready.""
Space cooperation between the United States and Brazil took a big step forward when they signed a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) agreement last month during a visit to Brasilia by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
The accord on sharing real-time tracking data on objects and debris in space is needed to develop a satellite launching business without the risk of collision.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) in December visited the Alcantara space center, which is especially attractive to smaller firms, such as Tucson, Arizona-based rocket-maker Vector Launch Inc, because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third allowing heavier payloads.
But Brazil's plan to become a new hub in the space industry will depend on concluding a technology safeguard agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology, Aguiar said. Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country.
A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the TSA ran into resistance from the leftist government of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers. 
Aguiar said that agreement floundered because it allowed the U.S. unverified access to the Alcantara base that was not acceptable on sovereignty grounds. A new Brazilian proposal under consideration by the U.S. government will be more ""palatable"" to the Brazilian Congress.
The TSA is seen by Washington as opening opportunities for greater cooperation in aerospace and defense between the two countries.
The market for small satellite launches is expected to grow fast in the next few years and the U.S. space industry is keen to see new launch capacity in the world and a quick resolution to the negotiation of the TSA with Brazil.
""Demand for launch services has outstripped supply globally and another launch site is needed. Because of its location, Alcantara offers advantages no other site in the world provides,"" an industry source said.
Aguiar said the government will set up a company called Alada to market the launch site. He said the Air Force has been in talks with Brazilian aerospace company Embraer SA on how to manage the business going forward.

One possibility, Brazilian Air Force officials said, is a joint venture with Embraer's satellite company Visiona, which is not part of the planned $4.75 billion tie-up between Boeing and Embraer's commercial aviation arm.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",UK Labour warns big banks must never again be masters of the economy,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - London's vast financial services industry must never again be the ""master of the economy"", the opposition Labour finance spokesman will say on Saturday in a speech accusing bankers of profiting from speculation at the expense of ordinary people.
John McDonnell, a veteran socialist who is now seeking to reassure business, promised higher taxes and tougher regulation on banks on the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers – the pivotal moment in the global financial crisis.
In a speech outside the Bank of England, McDonnell will say ordinary people are still paying the price for the crisis through falling living standards and cuts to public services. 
""One of the key lessons to be learned from the crash is that never again must we allow finance to become the master of the economy, rather than its servant,"" McDonnell will say, according to excerpts of his speech. ""Labour in government will put finance to work for the real economy.""
With Prime Minister Theresa May's government weakened by her Conservative Party's infighting over Brexit, Labour is hoping her minority government will collapse.
Most recent opinion polls show Labour level with the Conservatives, meaning they could form the next government, although the next election is not due until 2022.
Despite his previous antipathy toward bankers, McDonnell is trying to win the support of financial leaders just as former Labour leader Tony Blair helped prepare his party for power with what was dubbed the ""prawn cocktail offensive"" in the 1990s.
For example, McDonnell went for talks with the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) earlier this week to discuss Britain's upcoming departure from the European Union. 
However, his speech will be clear that Labour will seek to extract more revenue from the City of London, including proposals to expand an existing tax on shares to trading on other assets such as bonds and derivatives.
He will say the financial industry needs to do more to rebalance the economy toward manufacturing and technology industries rather than lending to invest in property.
""The crash also exposed how far the balance in the role of the City had been tipped away from securing long term investment in our economy toward short-term, high-stakes gambling,"" he will say. ""We will restore balance to the role of finance in our economy.""

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 07:02PM ET</span>",Lockheed wins contract for U.S. Air Force GPS satellites,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Friday it had chosen  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) to build 22 next-generation Global Positioning System satellites worth up to $7.2 billion, part of a major effort to modernize the GPS constellation of satellites.
The so-called GPS III follow-on satellites are expected to be available for launch into space beginning in 2026, the Air Force said.
""The world is dependent on GPS, from getting directions to getting cash from an ATM machine or trading on the stock exchange,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said in a statement. ""These satellites will provide greater accuracy, and improved anti-jamming capabilities making them more resilient.""
General David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, said the new-generation satellites would provide important improvements to the system.
Since the 1991 Gulf war, the U.S. military has ""relied on uninterrupted position, navigation and timing signals to employ precision on and over the battlefield,"" Goldfein said. ""This investment in GPS III continues to advance our capabilities into the future.""
Lockheed program manager Johnathon Caldwell said the GPS III follow-on contract would lift the GPS system to a ""whole new level.""
""It takes full advantage of our flexible satellite design to incorporate additional new technology like a 100 percent digital navigation payload, regional military protection and new search and rescue payloads,"" Caldwell said in a statement.
Lockheed took over GPS manufacturing work from Boeing (NYSE:BA) in 2008 and has been building the first 10 GPS III satellites in a planned network of 32.
The program is years behind schedule. The first GPS III satellite was declared available for launch in September 2017 and is expected to be fired into orbit on a SpaceX rocket sometime before the end of this year, Lockheed said last month as it announced that the second GPS III was ready for launch.
The first 10 of the GPS III satellites are expected to be in orbit by 2023. 

Lockheed said the GPS III will be the most powerful GPS satellite ever in orbit, with three times better accuracy and up to eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities.

(Reuters) - A U.S. government attorney told a federal judge on Friday the Trump administration would quickly begin to implement an agreement to reconsider asylum for hundreds of families who were separated at the U.S. border with Mexico.
The government agreed this week to settle three lawsuits being overseen by Judge Dana Sabraw, a move that plaintiffs' attorneys said would allow more than 1,000 immigrant parents and their children to have their asylum claims reconsidered.
""Our point of view is we can get moving on this,"" Scott Stewart, a Department of Justice attorney, told Sabraw during a hearing in San Diego. 
The lawsuits covered families separated under President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" policy aimed at discouraging illegal immigration. Trump abandoned the policy in June after global outcry over the detention of 2,600 children.
The agreement gives parents and children a second chance to prove they had a ""credible fear of persecution or torture"" if sent back to their home countries.
Most asylum seekers have traditionally passed credible fear interviews, which prevents quick removal from the United States.
However, lawyers have argued that many parents detained under the zero-tolerance policy failed those interviews because they were traumatized by the separation from their children.
Stewart indicated some individuals could have their asylum claims reconsidered in a matter of weeks. ""The government is looking to make sure, wherever it can, to make things go swiftly,"" Stewart said.
The settlement must be approved by Sabraw and has to clear procedural hurdles. The judge praised the work of government and the civil rights groups that brought the lawsuits and said he did not expect any delays.
""From the proposed settlement, it appears excellent,"" he said.
Soon after Trump abandoned the family separation policy in June, Sabraw issued an injunction that ordered the families reunited and temporarily prevented the administration from deporting them.

On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to fight back against federal judges who have used nationwide injunctions to block several of the administration's policies.

1464,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 05:04PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Trade's Zig-Zags End With Pessimism About Deals
Many investors may be inclined to dismiss yet another headline on global trade and focus on the more granular aspect of the markets. But make no mistake, the markets were gyrating with the twists in the saga between the U.S. and its trading partners.
The latest salvo came Friday, when Bloomberg reported that Trump instructed aides the day before to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion more in Chinese products, but that the announcement has been delayed as the administration considers revisions based on concerns raised in public comments.
Earlier in the week, China had welcomed an invitation by the United States to hold a new round of trade talks.
The Trump administration had invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks, the White House's top economic adviser said Wednesday.
In addition to those tariffs, Trump has said he’s ready to add an additional $267 billion in tariffs “on short notice if I want.”
Earlier in the week, Beijing indicated it will ask the World Trade Organization for permission to impose sanctions on the U.S. as part of a dispute over U.S. dumping duties that China started in 2013.
And there’s still the revamp of NAFTA to consider. The U.S. and Canada have been in talks to bring Canada into a new agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, but there have been on announcements to far.
Talks are expected to continue through Monday.
2. Apple Announces New iPhones
Apple got the type of promotional attention some companies can only dream of when the eyes of tech lovers and investors alike were glued to its keynote event for details on its new products, especially phones.
Apple announced Wednesday its new iPhone product line includes: the iPhone XR starting at $749, iPhone Xs starting at $999 and iPhone Xs Max starting at $1,099. Apple's price points for both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs matched Wall Street's estimates. The cheaper iPhone XR was priced lower than the $849 analysts had expected.
Shares of Apple rose the day before the event in anticipation of the kind of surprise announcement for which former CEO Steve Jobs was famous.
The stock sold off as details about the new iPhones arrived and shares ended the day lower. But shares bounced back on Thursday, leading the overall tech sector higher, despite negative analyst commentary about the price of the iPhone XR.
The event also had ancillary effects on other tech stocks, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which jumped as Apple failed to announce a further foray into video streaming or content development.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended the week slightly higher.
3. Inflation Comes in Tame for August
Bucking the recent trend that’s made investors nervous about price pressure, the latest data showed inflation cooling.
First, figures showed wholesale prices fell unexpectedly.
Producer price index decreased 0.1% last month. In the 12 months through August, the PPI rose 2.8%. Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.2% last month and increasing 3.2% from a year ago.
The core PPI decreased by 0.1% from a month earlier and rose 2.3% in the 12 months through August. Analysts had predicted core PPI to increase 0.2% month on month and 2.7% on an annualized basis.
Next, retail inflation rose less than anticipated.
The consumer price index advanced 0.2%, missing expectations for a gain of 0.3%. In the 12 months through July, the CPI increased 2.7%, below forecasts for a reading of 2.8% and down from 2.9% in July.
The core CPI increased by 0.1% from a month earlier, below forecasts for a gain of 0.2%. The annual increase in the so-called core CPI was 2.2%. Economists were looking for it to hold steady at July’s 2.4% advance.
But despite these softer inflation numbers, traders ended the week still predicting a more-than-80% chance of the Federal Reserve hiking rates at its December meeting on top of the expected boost this month.
4. Retail Revisions Boost GDP Confidence
Bond yields rose sharply this week, owing to confidence that the Federal Reserve will lift rates for a total four times this year.
The rise was particularly strong Friday, when the United States 10-Year yield topped 3% briefly.
A big reason for that was Friday’s retail sales numbers.
The August retail sales numbers were disappointing at first blush, rising 0.1%, compared with expectations for 0.4%. But July’s gain was revised up to 0.7% from 0.5%.
That revision gave market watchers some more confidence that the U.S. could see GDP growth of 4% in the third quarter, which would all but guarantee another rise in rates in December.
5. Cannabis Stock Momentum Continues, but With Wild Swings
Cannabis stocks were very active again, reacting not just to the tremendous momentum in the shares, but some market-moving news.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was the recent darling until Friday. The stock finally sold off sharply on the last day of the week following a rally that has seen its shares up more than 300% since its July IPO.
Money rotated out of Tilray on a report that Canadian investors in marijuana stocks could face a lifetime travel ban to the U.S.
 Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) saw some buying activity after falling out of favor.
But there is consternation in a sector that has seen such a big run-up as investors look at fundamentals.
“You might argue our valuations are a little bit ahead of our skis,” Paul Rosen, chief executive officer of Tidal Royalty, which finances weed companies, told Bloomberg Wednesday.
Concerns about a U.S. Food and Drug Administration crackdown on vaping has also raised questions about what it means for the sector."
1465,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Volvo Cars seeks U.S. tariff exemption for Chinese-made SUV,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volvo Cars has asked the Trump administration to exempt the company's Chinese-made mid-size XC60 SUV from new 25 percent tariffs, the latest automaker to seek relief from new levies on imports from China.
The automaker confirmed on Friday it has sought an exemption with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office (USTR) for the popular vehicle that accounted for nearly a third of its U.S. sales in August.
""The imposition of the additional 25 percent duty on mid-size SUVs would cause severe economic harm,"" Volvo said in an Aug. 16 letter to USTR that has not been previously reported. ""The burden of the 25 percent duty imposed on vehicles imported from China will also be borne by American consumers.""
Earlier this week, Volvo Cars and its Chinese owner Geely [GEELY.UL] postponed plans to float shares in the Swedish carmaker, blaming trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
The XC60 in August accounted for 31 percent of Volvo's U.S. sales.
Volvo said the XC60 was initially built only in Sweden and then it added production in China. From January to early March, Volvo was sourcing vehicles from both countries but since March U.S. XC60s have only come from China, the company said.
Volvo recently started commercial production at its new Charleston, South Carolina plant, where it is building S60 sedans, it told USTR, ""but over time given our global manufacturing footprint we could also anticipate production of the XC60 in the U.S. as well.""
A Volvo spokesman did not comment on whether new tariffs have affected vehicles now in U.S. showrooms or if the levies will prompt price increases. The Trump administration imposed new 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods in July, including on Chinese-made vehicles.
Volvo cited General Motors Co's (N:GM) July 30 request seeking an exemption for its Chinese-made Buick Envision SUV in its petition. GM's petition suggested a cap of 40,000 vehicles that could be exempted while Volvo suggested that the government not impose any cap.
USTR has not ruled on either petition but has said if it grants exclusions they will apply retroactively to the data the tariffs were imposed in July.
GM said in a separate response to Volvo's petition filed with USTR that it disagreed with Volvo's request, arguing Volvo should ""submit its own exemption request to be adjudicated on the merits.""
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, told USTR Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds ""to invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.""

Geely, which paid  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) $1.8 billion for Volvo in 2010, also has stakes in Mercedes-Benz parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), truckmaker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and Lotus.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 04:21PM ET</span>","Some Venezuelans receive new minimum wage, but companies struggle to pay","By Vivian Sequera and Angus Berwick
CARACAS (Reuters) - Some Venezuelans on Friday began to receive their first salary payment since the government introduced a 60-fold minimum wage increase, though companies warned it was unaffordable and would add to the devastation of business in the country.
Around a dozen firms and business associations Reuters spoke to in different parts of Venezuela said they could not pay salaries after the price hike, which formed part of a package of measures announced by President Nicolas Maduro in August to halt Venezuela's five-year recession.
To try to balance the books, companies are lifting prices and firing employees, the firms and associations said. That could impel more Venezuelans to flee the crisis-stricken country, adding to a mass exodus that has already seen over 2 million Venezuelans leave.
For those that did get their wages on Friday the price of goods had already surged in tandem, leaving them no better off, according to around a dozen people Reuters spoke to as they waited in line to get paid.
Annual inflation hit 200,000 percent in August, according to the opposition-controlled Congress, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts it will hit 1 million percent this year. 
In Puerto Ordaz, an industrial town known for metal-working in southern Bolivar state, the local chamber of commerce said a quarter of companies had shuttered this year and more were closing each day, unable to weather the hyperinflation and strict currency controls that strangle imports.
The minimum wage rise would only accelerate this, the chamber's head said.
""We're alarmed because what we hear is companies don't have the funds to pay wages,"" said Ramon Espino, a union leader for local manufacturer Carbonorca, which produces carbon anodes used to smelt aluminum.
In Carabobo state, once the country's industry hub and now full of abandoned factories, the head of the business group Fedecamaras said 80 percent of companies had frozen activity this year.
In Carabobo's capital Valencia, 36-year-old builder Jose Pereira stood in a queue outside a bank. He said his construction firm had told employees in late August after the wage increase that it could no longer afford to pay them. As severance, the company agreed to give them the new minimum wage until mid-September, he said.
""This has turned into a disgrace. There's no power, water, and now there's no work,"" he said, waiting to receive half the new monthly wage of 1,800 bolivars, or roughly $17.
Maduro had said the government would cover three months of the wage increase for small and medium-sized companies to soften the blow. But he has not provided details and it remains unclear how his cash-starved government would afford such a hefty payout or manage the logistics.
As part of the plan, which Maduro has said is intended to counter a U.S.-led ""economic war"" against his socialist administration, the president ordered a 96 percent currency devaluation. He also pegged the bolivar currency to the state's petro cryptocurrency and increased taxes.
Some firms said they had not sent their pay sheets to the government, as required to claim the compensation, convinced they would never receive it. The companies Reuters spoke to said they had not yet received any funds from the government. 
Maria Uzcategui, president of retailers' guild Consecomercio in Caracas, said companies the organization had spoken to had lost at least 40 percent of their clients in the past month.

""It's a process of devastation,"" she said in a phone interview. ""Companies that have been around forever have vanished during the past two or three weeks.""

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 04:18PM ET</span>",How JPMorgan's CFO became the top prospect to succeed Dimon,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a single mother with a British accent who loves numbers, Marianne Lake bears little resemblance to Jamie Dimon, the longtime chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), known for his bravado, quips and occasional profanity-laced outbursts.
Yet Lake has emerged as a front-runner to replace Dimon when he eventually retires, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former executives show.
Over her nearly six years as JPMorgan's chief financial officer Lake, 49, has taken on more and more responsibilities effectively becoming Dimon's understudy. She helps develop strategies for each of the bank's business units and oversees matters ranging from its annual stress test to employee cafeterias.
Largely unknown outside JPMorgan when named CFO in 2012, Lake has worked in both the wholesale and retail businesses during 19 years there. ""She has been all over,"" Dimon, 62, said in an interview, describing Lake as an ""extraordinarily talented executive.""
“She has all of the qualities of a great leader,” he said. Those include being demanding, drawing information out of people and recognizing talent within the 15,000 people she oversees. Dimon said she also challenges him when she believes he is wrong.
Lake, who also spoke to Reuters, said she wanted to broaden her skillset in her next job and has made her ambitions clear to the board chaired by Dimon. She declined to predict whether she will be the next CEO.
""I want to be at this company 10 years from now and I will be quite open-minded about what the next step could look like,"" she said. ""I have told the board that I want to be here for the long-term.""
Dimon has been CEO for nearly 13 years, the longest tenure among major U.S. banks. He is a larger-than-life figure who steered JPMorgan through the financial crisis and regularly stands up to regulators and politicians. The question of who could succeed him has captivated Wall Street for years. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NbTiZo)
Lake's standing has risen as other CEO candidates have left JPMorgan after growing impatient or getting on Dimon's wrong side, executives said. ""I would put my money on her above anybody else,"" said one longtime JPMorgan executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
""She knows the bank extremely well, with her role spanning all of our businesses and functions,"" said Gordon Smith, co-president of the company and chief executive of JPMorgan’s consumer bank. 
Dimon, who has said he will step down in about five years, would not discuss Lake's chances. It is the board's choice, and there are other people who could also run the company, he said. And, Dimon cautioned, ""Things change...Everybody changes.”
JPMorgan has said it has a succession plan and that it strives to give executives experience in its different businesses, but it does not publicly disclose the details.
Two people analysts often mention as possible successors if Dimon were to suddenly leave are Smith, 60, and the other co-president Daniel Pinto, 55, who runs the investment bank. Mary Erdoes, 51, chief of asset and wealth management, and Doug Petno, 53, chief of the commercial bank, have also been cited over the years.
CRUCIAL ADVICE
When former CFO Douglas Braunstein stepped down in 2012 in the wake of the ""London whale"" scandal in which a JPMorgan trader lost more than $6 billion, Lake was one of several executives interviewing for the CFO job. In the interview, Lake credited a colleague for a piece of advice she says helped her win the promotion: Tell Dimon how much you want the job and tell him how hard you will work for him.
""If you don't tell people you really want a job, then you have no shot,” said Lake.
Born in Maryland and raised by working-class parents in southern England, Lake joined JPMorgan’s London office as chief financial officer for credit trading at age 30, after working on the JPMorgan account for PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. She moved to the United States in 2004 as JPMorgan was merging with Bank One, which Dimon ran before becoming CEO of the combined organization.
She worked on an expensive, multi-year drive to combine JPMorgan's data and accounting systems and the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley accounting controls. She was controller of the investment bank during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and ran finances for the retail bank as the mortgage business went through drastic changes afterward.
Dimon named her to the current post in November 2012 and colleagues were stunned by her intensity in preparing for her first quarterly results presentation in January.
""She always wants to understand the why behind the things she would say,"" recalled Sarah Youngwood, then head of investor relations. ""It is still happening to this day.""
Lake talks too fast for some people to keep up. ""That is because she thinks so fast, but she has slowed it down,"" said Youngwood, who now has Lake's old job of CFO for the consumer bank.
Lake said she sometimes counts to herself to reduce the pace.
Bank analysts say they welcome all of the information Lake packs into her presentations and they like that she is quick to thoroughly address questions on investor minds.
For example, after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Richard Ramsden published a report in January 2015 asking whether JPMorgan should break itself up because of new regulations, Lake made a case that the bank would thrive because of its size.
""She is probably one of the most gifted CFOs around,"" Ramsden said. “She is really at the top of every dynamic at JPMorgan.""
Lake’s speed, demands for information, and visual memory of numbers can intimidate new hires, people who work with her said. Dimon said he and Lake sometimes challenge one another to remember numbers down to one decimal point. “We have a lot of fun with each other,” he said.
Lake had her three children through a surrogate starting at the age 42 after she decided that, even without a partner, she wanted to be a parent. She said she realized after she became CFO that her story could inspire other career-driven women at the bank and she tells it frequently. One junior colleague described Lake’s parenting decision as “fearless.”
“It's too easy to say it's not convenient right now” to have a child, said Lake. “On big life-changing decisions like that, you just have to go for it.”
In a nod to her expanding role, JPMorgan put Lake at center stage at its four-hour investor conference this year. Typically, all the business heads would give their own presentations, but this time, Lake spoke for an hour and a half, explaining strategies for each of JPMorgan’s four segments and giving an overview of how the bank is using technology to cut costs and generate more revenue. 
Lake says she is ready to take on a different role at JPMorgan and that the next CEO’s main challenge will be making sure JPMorgan remains the country’s most profitable big bank.

""When you are a successful company,"" she said, ""you have to fight really hard to make sure you avoid complacency, arrogance, bureaucracy.""

1472,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 04:17PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Bags Weekly Win Despite Report Trump Ready to Launch Tariffs,"Investing.com - The S&P 500 notched a weekly win Friday, shaking off fears of ramp-up in U.S.-trade tensions amid reports President Donald Trump was ready to hit China with a hefty round of tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.03%. The S&P 500 rose 0.03%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.05%.
For the week, the S&P ended up about 1.2%.
Trump instructed aides on Thursday to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion more in Chinese products, but the announcement has been delayed as the administration considers revisions based on concerns raised in public comments, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
This comes just days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reached out to Chinese officials with an invitation to resumed trade talks.
Trump's willingness to press ahead with tariffs drummed up renewed fears of a full-blown trade war and raised questions about how committed the administration was to ending the trade dispute with China.
The rise in trade tensions wiped out early-session gains, which followed a surge in financials, mostly banks.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) closed higher, buoyed by a rise in U.S. bond yields on signs of underlying economic strength.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yields flirted with the important psychological 3% yield as traders cheered an upward revision to July's retail sales data, ignoring weaker retail sales for August.
Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Wall Street's positive week was fraught with violent swings in tech. A wave of selling emerged across semiconductors, while Apple's product launch triggered a broad-based rally.
A rally in Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) also added steel to the tech performance after the software maker posted above-forecast fiscal third-quarter earnings and guidance.
Energy, meanwhile, played its part to firm the broader market, as oil prices sidestepped data pointing to a rise in domestic crude output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for October delivery rose 0.58% to settle at $68.99 a barrel.
On the political front, traders assessed the potential damage to Trump after his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 03:23PM ET</span>",MSCI is monitoring Argentina 'daily and very carefully': CEO,"By Julien Ponthus and Daniel Bases
NEW YORK (Reuters) - MSCI (N:MSCI), the global stock index provider, is closely monitoring how Argentina is navigating its financial turmoil, reiterating the decision to reclassify it as an emerging market could be reversed should it restrict market access, the company's chief executive told Reuters on Friday.
Henry Fernandez made clear he was currently satisfied with how President Mauricio Macri's administration was dealing with Argentina's financial crisis using ""free market tools"" but was nevertheless ready to act should the situation change. 
MSCI's benchmarks are widely used, with some $14 trillion in investors’ assets tracked against them. Its blessing, including its bestowal of an emerging market classification, can launch billions of dollars from index-tracking funds into markets around the world, especially developing economies.
The upgrade to ""emerging market"" status that Argentina received in June remains a rare positive development for the country, whose currency has so far this year has lost over 50 percent of its value against the dollar. 
Argentina was downgraded to a ""frontier market"" status in 2009 after former populist President Cristina Fernandez imposed capital controls, which international investors hate. 
""We are definitely monitoring the country daily and very carefully for any signals of conditions that would create lack of accessibility for international investors into their equity markets,"" MSCI's Fernandez said. 
""We will be watching that and can definitely reverse our decision before it gets implemented"" in May 2019, he added. 
Investor concerns about Argentina's debt burden and current account deficit have prompted a run on the peso and the government has sought financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
Last month, the country's central bank hoisted its key interest rate to an unnerving 60 percent to try to stabilize the peso and calm inflation.
One key difference from the last wave of emerging market financial crises two decades ago lies in the fact that the governments of Argentina and Turkey have not resorted to such tools as capital controls.
""If you go back 10, maybe 20 years, countries like this, their first reaction would have been to start slapping all sort of tariffs or controls"" but they are now focusing on long-term fixes rather than a ""short-term band-aid,"" Fernandez said. 
MSCI's Fernandez argued that Argentina's woes mainly resulted from its own economy, not from the stress caused by such issues as rising interest rates in the United States. 
""I would not blame the conditions in Argentina on external factors"", the MSCI head said, arguing that it had failed to implement structural reform for decades and that the healing process would take several years.
He also added that the financial situation in emerging markets ""could get worse before it gets better"" given the challenges these countries face with investor capital moving to benefit from U.S. monetary tightening, trade tensions or rising oil prices.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",U.S. investors take initiative on Refinitiv,"By Natalie Harrison and Jonathan Schwarzberg
NEW YORK (IFR) - The US$13.5bn buyout financing for Refinitiv, the financial data and technology division of Thomson Reuters, has had a strong response from the US loan and bond markets, resulting in an oversubscription and potentially lower pricing.
The debt package is divided into US$8bn of loans and US$5.5bn of high-yield bonds. The loans are oversubscribed and are expected to price at the tight end of guidance, with the deadline for commitments accelerated to Friday rather than the following Monday.
Books on the US dollar high-yield bonds are also oversubscribed and expected to price at lower yields than first anticipated. The bonds are scheduled to price on Tuesday, but the expectation is that pricing will be pulled forward.
“We’re thrilled with how it’s going. It really sets the tone for the remainder of the year,” a senior banker said.
The seven-year Term Loan B, split between a US$5.5bn facility and a US$2.5bn-equivalent euro-denominated facility, is expected to price at around 400bp over Libor on the dollars - the tight end of guidance of 400bp-425bp. The euro loan was guided at 425bp over Euribor.
""There had been a bit of a pile-up of LBOs, and in the summer there was some nervousness about how they would go. But the market has come out to play. There has been some pushback on covenants as investors want better protections, but pricing is coming tighter,"" the senior banker said.
The loan is scheduled to price on Friday.
The US$5.5bn-equivalent high-yield bond financing includes two US dollar tranches: a US$2bn 7.5-year non-call three senior secured first-lien bond, and a US$1.8bn eight-year non-call three senior unsecured bond.
Initial price thoughts were low 7% area on the secured and low 9% area on the unsecured bond respectively.
But two sellside sources said those levels have been lowered to high 6% area and 8.5% area, respectively. One buyside source with a line into bankers on the deal said the secured bond was being talked at the mid-to-high 6% area.
The bond deal also includes two euro-denominated tranches with the same maturities and seniority. They were announced at US$1bn-equivalent for the 7.5NC3, and US$700m-equivalent for the 8NC3. Initial price thoughts on the euro tranches were announced at 5% area and 7% area respectively, and they are now being guided at low 5% and low 7%, the sellside sources said.
""It's possible that the bond could price Monday. My educated guess is that they will close the loan books and then talk to the company and decide on the size of different tranches across loans and bonds and different currencies,"" the buyside source said.
""Books are heard to be between three to five times covered depending on the tranche. I could see the secured coming with a six handle.""
US DEMAND
Demand for the junior capital has been deeper in the US than in Europe.
“I wouldn’t focus on euros versus dollars and the split. You try to access all the markets for a deal of this size and then you shift the sizes and mix of loans and bonds on the fly if you need to. They’ve given themselves maximum flexibility,” a private equity source from a rival firm said.
“The deal is oversubscribed. Now it’s about how they price it, and how they optimize the balance of having more flexibility and paying slightly more, or changing some covenants and paying slightly less.”
Bond roadshow meetings in London took place on Thursday and Friday, but meetings in Amsterdam and Paris were canceled.
Investors with cash to deploy and who need to buy indexed deals are buying in bulk, but smaller investors who are more focused on yield are less interested.
“There are so many little jewels within the firm,” the senior banker said. ""Even if one part of the firm falters it’s not correlated necessarily with another part of the firm. It’s a really good credit story.""
COVENANT CONCERNS
Investors are comfortable with Refinitiv’s ability to generate cashflow and the stability of the business, but voiced concerns about the loan and bond covenant package. 
Most of the focus has homed in on asset sale provisions, restricted payment baskets and additional indebtedness in addition to aggressive Ebitda adjustments.
“It’s not about price. Investors just want a better covenant package,” a second senior banker said. “What you’re seeing is just a more balanced market where investors do have the ability to influence some of the terms.”
Some investors told IFR that covenants on the bond - deemed aggressive by some analysts - would be changed. But the buyside source saw this as unlikely.
    ""I can't see that on demand of this magnitude, but it is possible. Maybe other accounts have more sway than us.""
Credit research firm Covenant Review said in a report on September 7 that the bond had some of the weakest investor protections seen since the financial crisis and gave Blackstone (NYSE:BX) unprecedented flexibility to move assets around.
""The notes are being marketed with extremely defective sponsor-style covenants riddled with flaws and loopholes that reflect the worst excesses of covenant erosion over the last two years,"" Covenant Review said.
Another key consideration for investors has been US$650m in cost savings on US$2.5bn of pro-forma Ebitda over three years, which is about 35% of adjustments.
""That’s a big number. We never write that amount of adjustments on a deal. It’s a very big percentage, but the way the market has received the deal tells me they are believable and identifiable,” the private equity source said.
Those US$650m of cost savings put leverage at 4.25 times secured and 5.25 times unsecured. Leverage is closer to six to seven times based on reported earnings of US$1.9bn, some investors calculate.
But Lale Topcuoglu, head of credit at fund manager JOHCM, said that Blackstone's reputation has helped investors get comfortable with the financing.
""The story was really good. The challenge for us is the covenants and the leverage. There really is no incentive to delever over time,"" Topcuoglu said.
JP Morgan is leading the high-yield bond, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) is leading the loan financing.
The financing backs private equity firm Blackstone's purchase of a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' financial data and technology division (which includes IFR), which will be renamed Refinitiv when the acquisition closes.
The deal - the largest buyout financing since the crisis - is expected to close on October 1.

1476,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Marijuana Shorts Are Defying the Explosive Rally in Equities,"(Bloomberg) -- Cannabis stocks are proving one investor’s rally may be another’s short opportunity.
The marijuana sector has been in the midst of parabolic explosions to the upside, with stocks like Tilray Inc. surging more than 500 percent since it began trading in July. Yet, short sellers aren’t balking, instead selectively adding to their positions in cannabis stocks, according to financial analytics firm IHS Markit.
Short sellers have increased positions in 17 marijuana stocks since August 1, pushing short balances in the North American weed sector to an all-time high, according to Markit. Short sellers have maintained their positions in Tilray, creating a scarcity of shares to borrow for new short stakes, the data firm said. It’s also gotten expensive, with the cost of financing a short position for Tilray shooting up to 370 percent, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC as of September 12.Aurora Cannabis Inc. saw a 76 percent spike in short interest since August 2, while Cronos Group Inc.’s shorts rose 30 percent, according to Markit. Among weed stocks with declining short interest, Canopy Growth Corp. saw positions fall by 39 percent while Aphria Inc. short interest was cut by 18 percent. Short interest in Tilray fell by 9 percent since August 2, Markit said.
The increased volatility is getting the attention of options traders as well. On Thursday, an options buyer placed a sizable hedge against the U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking the marijuana industry in a bet that pot stocks won’t continue to soar.

1477,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Yes, the Tax Cuts Have Cost the U.S. Treasury Money","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Wow, do we really have to go through this again? Here’s Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Advisors LP in Wheaton, Illinois, and a long-time fan of tax cuts:
January - June 2018 total federal tax receipts are up 0.2% from January -June 2017 tax receipts. The tax cuts have not cost the US Treasury money, because the tax cuts boosted growth. Yes, the deficit is up, but that’s because spending is up.
— Brian Wesbury (@wesbury) September 13, 2018
Just in case the bottom of that tweet was cut off in your browser, let me repeat Wesbury’s words: “The tax cuts have not cost the U.S. Treasury money, because the tax cuts boosted growth. Yes, the deficit is up, but that’s because spending is up.”
He’s right that spending is up! It was 3.5 percent higher year over year in the January-June period he references, and it’s up 7.4 percent from January-August 2017 to January-August of this year, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. But that raises an interesting question: Since we now have data available through August, why is Wesbury citing January-June numbers? Well, maybe because, measured January to August, federal tax revenue is actually down 0.4 percent so far this year.
That’s strike one for the assertion that “the tax cuts have not cost the U.S. Treasury money.” Actually, it’s strikes one, two and three, because even by Wesbury’s standard, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that President Donald Trump signed into law in December has so far cost the Treasury money. But it’s important also to point out — again and again, because people in Congress and elsewhere keep embracing the fallacy that tax cuts reliably increase revenue — that his standard is ridiculous.
It’s ridiculous first of all because it ignores inflation, which, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, averaged 2.1 percent over the first half of this year, turning that 0.2 percent January-June gain into a 1.8 decline in real tax revenue. Substitute the deflator used in calculating real gross domestic product, and it’s a 1.9 percent decline.
Even if tax revenue had increased in real terms, though, this still wouldn’t demonstrate that the tax cuts hadn’t cost the Treasury money. That’s because real tax revenue usually goes up when the economy is growing. So when the Congressional Budget Office or Joint Committee on Taxation makes an estimate of the revenue losses from a tax cut, they aren’t saying that tax revenue will go down by that amount in absolute terms; they’re saying that it will be that much lower than they think it would have been in the absence of the tax cut.
That can be a little hard to get one’s head around, I realize, but a graphic representation may help. Here’s the change in January-August tax receipts for every year of the current recovery, both in nominal terms and adjusted for inflation:
This year so far stands out as especially bad for tax revenue, then. So, to a lesser extent, does 2016. The explanation then was a price bust that hammered the oil and gas industry and a strong dollar that hammered exporters, with real GDP growth slowing to a 1.9 percent annualized pace over the first three quarters of the year. In 2018, on the other hand, real GDP has grown at a 3.2 percent annualized pace over the first two quarters, and even if you argue (as I have) that at least part of this year’s acceleration in economic growth is due to the stimulative effect of the tax cuts, those tax cuts have still clearly cost the Treasury a lot of money.
Then again, they wouldn’t really be tax cuts if they didn’t cost the Treasury money, at least initially. There is a theory, expounded with the most detail and enthusiasm by the Tax Foundation, that the corporate tax changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will eventually generate so much additional investment and economic activity in the U.S. that they will more than pay for themselves. But this would take a while; so far this fiscal year (which started in October 2017), corporate income tax revenue is down 30 percent in nominal terms, according to the Treasury Department.
Individual income tax revenue is up 7 percent, but most of the revenue impact of the individual tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act isn’t expected to be felt until the next fiscal year as people file their first tax returns under the new law and the limited partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations that are taxed as individuals puzzle through the 184 pages of new pass-through taxation rules that the Internal Revenue Service released just last month. There’s also less expectation that the individual tax cuts could conceivably pay for themselves. According to the Tax Foundation, congressional Republicans’ new proposal to make all the currently temporary individual provisions in the tax law permanent would boost GDP by 2.2 percent over the long run but cost $112 billion a year in tax revenue even with that added growth factored in. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, it would reduce GDP by 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent by 2040 and cut tax revenue by $188 billion a year.
Those are projections, based on complex macroeconomic models that may or may not be right. What we can say with certainty right now, though, is that the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been followed by a decrease in federal tax receipts."
1478,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 01:35PM ET</span>",The home of Fiat says 'ciao' to Sergio Marchionne,"By Agnieszka Flak 
TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - The home of Fiat bid farewell on Friday to Sergio Marchionne, one of the auto industry's most exacting and determined leaders, who rescued the Italian car giant and U.S. Chrysler.
The Italian-Canadian chief executive died in July, aged 66, after succumbing to complications from surgery, ending a 14-year career at the wheel of Fiat and the later combined Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) which he built. 
On Friday, more than 2,000 people -- including townsfolk, FCA workers, politicians, and corporate executives -- gathered in a packed Turin cathedral for a memorial service to honor the man who masterminded two long-shot corporate turnarounds. 
Fiat's founding Agnelli family were there in numbers, including FCA chairman John Elkann. Pirelli boss Marco Tronchetti Provera and former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also attended the funeral.
Marchionne achieved what many thought impossible, most notably his huge gamble just over a decade ago when he set in motion the marriage between the then-ailing Fiat with bankrupt U.S. rival Chrysler. It is now the world's seventh-largest carmaker and is debt-free.
""You’ve taught all of us to think differently, to have courage to change and to do. And not to be afraid. Dear Friend, Rest In Peace,"" Elkann said in an address that was unusually emotional for the Agnelli scion. 
In the clubbish world of Italian business, where change often happens slowly and chief executives bend to the prevailing political wind, Marchionne stood out as an exception, taking on trade unions and rowing publicly with politicians.
He pulled Fiat out of Confindustria, Italy's top business group, determined to negotiate directly with unions rather than pursue national wage bargaining.
The trained accountant and lawyer was lauded even by competitors for his shrewd dealmaking which kept investors on board.
Fiat's value grew more than tenfold, helped by the spin-offs of trucks and tractor maker CNH Industrial and supercar maker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE). 
Though FCA no longer has the presence in Turin it had two decades ago, many will remember Marchionne as the man who revived the carmaker's fortunes, even if many workers are still on lay-off schemes and plants in the city run below capacity.
He streamlined the group, took a knife to costs, slashed the number of car platforms and formed joint ventures to share development and manufacturing. 
""Without him there would have been no future for this company,"" said Giuseppe Tavano, an FCA transmission worker. 
FCA named Jeep head Mike Manley as its new CEO. The Briton has since pledged he will carry through a strategy Marchionne outlined in June to keep the carmaker ""strong and independent"". 
""We hope the new manager will continue his legacy and the company does not abandon Italy. That would be a real shame,"" said Liliana Ferrero, a 67-year-old Turin citizen.

A second memorial will be held on Sept. 27 at FCA's U.S. base in Auburn Hills.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell back on Friday after President Trump instructed aides to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese products, despite Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's attempts to restart talks with Beijing.
A source familiar with the situation confirmed stories initially carried by both Bloomberg and Fox News on the moves by the White House. [nL2N1W0158]
Wall Street, which had been trading marginally in positive territory on the back of a rise in U.S. Treasury yields above 3 percent, reversed. 
""If Trump is willing to go ahead with the tariffs then that is significant enough to sour markets,"" said Bryan Reilly managing director at CIBC Private Wealth Management in Boston, Massachusetts.
""Should this trade uncertainty prevail, then sentiment only has one way to go from here and that is down.""

The bank will pay a penalty of $6.5 million and disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $5.4 million, while its affiliate, Citi Order Routing and Execution (CORE), will pay a penalty of $1 million, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a statement
Dark pools allow institutional investors to anonymously trade large blocks of shares without the market moving against them.
The SEC found Citigroup Global Markets Inc misled users with assurances that high-frequency traders were not allowed to trade on Citi Match, a premium-priced dark pool platform operated by CORE, when two of its most active users reasonably qualified as such traders and had executed more than $9 billion of orders through the pool.
The regulator also found that Citigroup Global did not disclose that over a period of more than two years, nearly half of its dark-pool orders were routed to and executed on other trading venues that did not offer the same premium features as Citi's.
Citigroup Global also sent trade confirmation messages to certain users that indicated their orders had been executed on Citi's own platform when in fact those orders were executed on an outside venue, the SEC said.

A Citigroup spokesman said the matter has been resolved.

1499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","Trump Wants $200 Billion in China Tariffs Despite Talks, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump instructed aides on Thursday to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion more in Chinese products despite his Treasury secretary’s attempt to restart talks with Beijing to resolve the trade war, according to four people familiar with the matter.
But announcement of the new round of tariffs has been delayed as the administration considers revisions based on concerns raised in public comments, the people said.
Trump met with his top trade advisers on Thursday to discuss the China tariffs, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the people said. Mnuchin has led a recent overture to the Chinese to re-start trade talks.
The public comment period for a list of tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese goods closed last week, and Trump said the duties would be imposed “soon.” The new round would be in addition to $50 billion in Chinese goods that already face a 25 percent duty. U.S. stocks erased gains on the news.
The Chinese have retaliated with tariffs on an equivalent amount of U.S. exports, and have promised to match future rounds of U.S. duties.
Before his meeting on Thursday, Trump boasted on Twitter that he has the upper hand in the trade feud with Beijing and feels “no pressure” to resolve the dispute.
His comment tempered cautious optimism among investors over the U.S. government’s proposal for another round of talks with Beijing. Disclosure on Wednesday that the U.S. sought to renew the talks rallied U.S. stocks and emerging-market assets.
Trump threatened a third tranche of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese imports last week, which would mean levying duties on nearly everything China exports to the U.S. Trump said at the time those tariffs were “ready to go on short notice,” but the administration hasn’t yet published a list for public comment.
Efforts to end the dispute have fizzled so far. Officials from both countries have met four times for formal talks, most recently in August, when Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs, David Malpass, led discussions in Washington with Chinese Vice Minister Wang Shouwen.
The White House has sought to pressure Beijing to reduce its trade surplus with America and protect intellectual property rights of U.S. companies, which it says are abused in China.

Cannabis stocks were also active, with money suddenly diverting out of recent favorite Tilray.
Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock jumped about 7% at 11:55 AM ET (15:55 GMT). The company hit all the right notes for investors in its earnings report before the bell.
Profit handily topped expectations, while sales beat estimates. A 2.4% drop in same-stores sales was smaller than the 2.6% fall Wall Street forecast.
The company raises its full-year sales guidance to $1.23 billion to $1.255 billion (vs. $1.2 billion to $1.24 billion previously), and boosted same-stores sales guidance to a decrease of low-single digits from a decrease of low-to-mid-single digits.
In the red-hot cannabis sector, recent darling Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) lost about 5% on a report that Canadian investors in marijuana stocks could face a lifetime travel ban to the U.S.
But  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC), which was lately out of favor after a strong run, jumped about 4.5%.
Meanwhile, bond yields climbed following a retail sales report where a very strong revision to July’s gain overshadowed a smaller-than-expected August rise. The boost in retail sales to start the quarter raised expectations that the economy could again see 4% quarterly growth, pushing yields on bonds up.



Dividend-heavy sectors like utilities, telecom and real estate, which struggle when rates rise, were the worst-performing sectors in the market.
The S&P Real Estate Sector index was the biggest drag on the market, falling about 1.2%.
On the flip side, the S&P Financial Sector index, where banks rise with higher rates, gained about 0.5%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Plc (N:AGN) said revenue from its medical aesthetics business could double by 2025, even as it faces increasing competition for its blockbuster wrinkle treatment, Botox.
The drugmaker announced earlier on Friday the acquisition of Bonti Inc, which makes a shorter-acting neurotoxin than Botox.
Allergan is also doubling its investment in direct-to-consumer ad spending and beefing up its sales force as companies like Revance Therapeutics Inc (O:RVNC) and  Evolus Inc  (O:EOLS) vie to wrest market share with rival treatments to Botox. The company made the announcements at its Medical Aesthetics Day in New York.
Chief Commercial Officer Bill Meury said Allergan expects revenue at its medical aesthetics unit to grow to $7 billion to $8 billion. That compares with revenue of $3.8 billion from the business in 2017. 
Beyond Botox, the unit includes dermal filler Juvederm, the CoolSculpting fat-freezing systems, and other treatments.
He said the forecast implied an 8 to 10 percent compound annual growth rate.
Meury said the Bonti acquisition would allow the company to market a new ""starter toxin."" Patients could test drive the treatment, which lasts for two to four weeks, to help them decide if they want to use longer-term Botox.

Shares of Allergan fell 2 cents to $90.06, while shares of Revance and Evolus each fell around 2.5 percent in Friday morning trading.

1511,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Canada’s Legal Weed Creates Risk for Investors at U.S. Border,"(Bloomberg) -- Canadians about to enjoy legal marijuana, or even investors in the sector, could be in for a new headache at the U.S. border.
Border guards have broad powers to question Canadians on their current and past drug use and could declare users inadmissible, perhaps for life, immigration experts say. U.S. officials also warn any form of participation in the sector could also see someone turned away, signaling potential headaches for investors.
Canada is due to legalize recreational use of the drug on Oct. 17, but it is still illegal under U.S. federal law, despite major states like Colorado and California loosening restrictions. Justin Trudeau’s government and travel agents are warning Canadians to make sure they have no trace of the drug in their cars or luggage.
“Working or having involvement in the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual’s admissibility to the U.S.,” Mike Niezgoda, a spokesman at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in Buffalo, said in an email.
Similar comments made by a border official to Politico sent U.S.-traded shares of Canadian marijuana companies tumbling Thursday. Cannabis stocks have been soaring since mid-August, when Canopy Growth Corp. announced a C$5 billion ($3.8 billion) investment from Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ)., the biggest deal in the sector to date.
‘Stay Off the Radar’
“A lot of people don’t understand that they are still going to have problems after legalization,” said Henry Chang, a partner at Blaney McMurtry LLP in Toronto who handles immigration law on both sides of the border. “You need to stay off the radar -- if there’s something that prompts them to think that you are a marijuana user, the first question will be: ‘Do you smoke marijuana?’”
Those at risk include people in border towns who frequently cross over to buy gas or milk, tourists and transport workers who haul billions of dollars a month of goods into the U.S. Even executives at weed companies could be accused of bringing the trade where it’s not welcome.
The rub is that it’s illegal to have smoked the drug in Canada before Oct. 17, and it’s illegal to lie to any border agent who asks about it. Some 4.6 million Canadians use weed, about 16 percent of the adult population.
“Although medical and recreational marijuana may be legal in some U.S. States and Canada, the sale, possession, production and distribution of marijuana remain illegal under U.S. federal law,” Niezgoda said.
Another official said those participating in the marijuana business may be turned away at the border. “Facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual’s admissibility to the U.S.,” Todd Owen, executive assistant commissioner for the Office of Field Operations at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, told Politico in comments published Thursday.
While Owen didn’t specify any minimum level of investment, he signaled the focus was more on those bringing the sector to the U.S., which could have implications for the burgeoning sector. Until his comments, the BI Canada Cannabis Competitive Peers index had gained nearly 50 percent since the Canopy-Constellation deal was announced. Individual stocks have posted more outsized gains, with Tilray Inc. up more than 600 percent since its July IPO.
Seeking Clarity
Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has often said he’s working with U.S. law enforcement to clarify the changes and make sure the border remains smooth. The advice of Goodale and Trudeau is to be honest at the border-- and make sure you’re not carrying.
“Despite one-in-eight Canadians using cannabis today, 400,000 people move between our two countries every day almost entirely without incident,” Goodale spokesman Scott Bardsley said by email. “Officials from the United States have said that they do not plan on changing their questions at primary inspection after cannabis is legalized in Canada.”
The government is also ramping up advertising reminding Canadians of their obligations to obey the laws of both countries. That message hasn’t “fully sunk in” yet especially with more casual tourists, said Continental Travel Group President Daryl Silver.
Too much zeal by border agents could encourage even more Canadians to stay home, at a time when President Donald Trump is targeting the country in trade negotiations. “We already notice somewhat of a trend of some people not going to the U.S..” said Silver. “This could add to that.”
Canadians spent $19.8 billion on tourism south of the border in 2016, according to the International Trade Administration. The figure was $27.2 billion in 2014 when the country’s currency was close to par with the greenback.
‘Caught by Accident’
“People are careless and I think people will be caught by accident and this will create problems,” said Lorne Waldman, an immigration lawyer. “No lawyer could counsel anyone to lie to a border agent, but if an agent asks the question, I suppose they could decline to answer.”
That may be tricky for people who work in the marijuana industry, given border agents often ask for a visitor’s occupation.
While you may not be barred entry just for having a job that’s legal in Canada, marijuana executives who work with U.S. companies may be seen as being engaged in criminal activity, Chang said. “That you are going to start seeing some problems with -- especially if they buy operations or start doing business with a U.S. company,” he said."

ANDOVER, Mass. (Reuters) - Some 8,000 people were driven from their homes in the Boston suburbs by a series of gas explosions, and it was unclear on Friday when they could go back.
The blasts killed at least one person, injured 12 more and destroyed dozens of homes and other buildings in Andover, North Andover and Lawrence on Thursday.
Residents who were evacuated ""should expect that the restoration process will take several days or longer,"" Andrew Maylor, the town manager of North Andover, said on Twitter. 
Firefighters raced for hours from one blaze to another and utility crews rushed to shut off gas and electricity to prevent further explosions. Fire and utility crews were going door to door to conduct safety checks, officials said.
Some 70 fires, explosions or investigations of gas odor had been reported, Massachusetts State Police said.
""This has been obviously an incredibly difficult day,"" Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a news conference early on Friday.
An 18-year-old Lawrence man, Leonel Rondon, died when one explosion knocked over a chimney that fell on his car, a spokeswoman at Massachusetts General Hospital said. Lawrence General Hospital said it had treated 13 people for injuries ranging from smoke inhalation to blast trauma.
Guilia Holland, a 35-year-old mechanic in a wheelchair, said she had just gotten off a bus returning home when she saw ""a big flash of light"" at the house where she had been renting a room for a month.
""Good thing I wasn’t home or I wouldn’t be talking about it,"" she said outside an elementary school in Lawrence that the Red Cross had converted into a shelter for about 170 people. 
South Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera urged residents to stay away from their homes. 
""There could be still a gas leak in your home,"" Rivera said. ""You can't see it and in some cases you won't be able to smell it, and God forbid you go to sleep and don't wake up.""
Fire investigators suspected ""over-pressurization of a gas main"" belonging to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, a unit of the utility NiSource Inc (N:NI), caused the explosions, Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield told a news conference. 
Baker said that he told the utility company that it must bring in additional resources and develop a comprehensive safety plan for each of the communities. 
""At this time, the focus remains on ensuring the public safety,"" Baker said. ""Once that's complete, we will work with federal government and others to investigate how this occurred and hold the appropriate parties accountable for their actions.""
NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen said Columbia Gas was investigating. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said it was sending a team to support the state's emergency response efforts.
The former head of the agency, Brigham McCown, called the series of gas explosions ""unprecedented, at least in recent memory.""
The National Transportation Safety Board have a team of investigators headed to the area, officials said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also was sending investigators, the Boston Globe reported.

The magazine said the board was due to decide whether Stadler, who has been in police custody since mid-June as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at Audi, should give up his position.
Citing sources close to the company, Spiegel said it was probable that Stadler would be asked to relinquish the role, seeing as he was unable to perform the duties of an executive.
Both VW and Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.
A source told Reuters the reason for the supervisory board meeting was to discuss further steps towards a possible listing of VW's truck and bus subsidiary and not Stadler.
However, sources close to the company expect that the board will also talk about Stadler although no decisions are expected.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the report.
In July, Volkswagen recruited BMW engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it shake off the emissions scandal.

Stadler was forced to step down temporarily after he was taken into custody on suspicion of interfering with an emissions investigation. Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement.

Hedge funds’ net leverage, a measure of the industry’s risk appetite, has fallen to the lowest level this year after a brief bounce in late August, client data compiled by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) showed. At 49 percent, the ratio is down from a peak of more than 60 percent in March.
Hedge funds’ reluctance to increase equity exposure underscores a growing skepticism about the durability of the S&P 500 Index’s outperformance against equity markets in the rest of the world. Wall Street strategists this month have been sounding warnings about U.S. stocks, with Morgan Stanley lowering its recommendation and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) flagging the danger of a potential bear market should a full-blown trade war erupt.
Their lack of conviction in U.S. stocks was one reason hedge fund managers had to watch in pain while the market rallied in July and August. During that stretch, those with a focus on equities saw their underperformance versus the S&P 500 widen by 5 percentage points, according to Hedge Fund Research data compiled by Bloomberg. The lackluster returns prompted Nomura to predict that the industry will have to increase leverage.
The S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.6 percent Thursday and was on track toward a fourth straight day of gains. Up more than 8 percent in 2018, the benchmark is a standout winner as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is down 3.3 percent, poised for its worst year since 2011, while stocks in developing nations have plunged into a bear market.

1523,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Talking Won’t End Trump’s Growing China Trade War Any Time Soon,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s trade war with China is following an increasingly predictable pattern and that should cause a rethink for anybody hoping for a rapid resolution.
The day after financial markets around the world cheered the apparent good news that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was inviting his Chinese counterparts to sit down for further high-level negotiations, President Donald Trump undermined that very idea.
“We are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us,” Trump said on Twitter on Thursday. “Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet?”
The move marked just the latest instance of Trump undercutting one of his senior China deal-makers in public and illustrates why Beijing has become increasingly frustrated with its interactions with the U.S. administration. It also comes as Trump has repeatedly signaled his desire to continue raising pressure on Beijing and is considering the details of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports or even more.
After last year’s Mar-a-Lago summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was given the task of negotiating a 100-day deal with China intended to be the first building block in a bigger deal.
Ross and his team, however, were quickly criticized for being too obsequious to the Chinese, especially after he hailed a reheated series of commitments by Beijing as a ""Herculean"" victory for the president. Since then, the commitments Ross has brought home to Trump have repeatedly been rejected by the president.
Likewise, just days after hosting Liu He, Xi’s top economic emissary, in the Oval Office in May, Trump made a very public U-turn by declaring that he would be proceeding with tariffs despite Mnuchin’s declaration that the trade war was “on hold.”
The result has left Mnuchin discredited with Beijing as an interlocutor, according to people who have met with senior Chinese officials in recent weeks.
No Giveaways
“They are certainly open to overtures because they would like to bring this trade dispute to some kind of resolution. But I don’t think they are going to give anything to Mnuchin,” said Eswar Prasad, a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at Cornell University and is close to policymakers in Beijing.
“They don’t know if any deal they make with Mnuchin can stick,” Prasad said. “Mnuchin is being seen as one voice of reason but a voice of reason without any clout.”
Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, is blunter: “The Chinese have been very explicit that they don’t think Mnuchin can deliver a deal,” he said.
Some analysts do see a grand strategy at work.
Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, likened the emerging pattern on China to the Nafta negotiations with Mexico and Canada, which are nearing an end after a year of intense negotiations that have been accompanied by repeated threats from Trump. Likewise, every carrot to Beijing is accompanied by a tweeted stick.
“I think we are finally moving into the serious stage in which there is going to be the serious negotiation that we haven’t had yet,” Alden said.
Like most analysts, however, Alden doesn’t expect a resolution any time soon.
The pressure is clearly building on Trump to cut a deal, according to David Dollar, who was the U.S. Treasury’s man in Beijing during the Obama administration and is now at the Brookings Institution.
Companies and investors are increasingly concerned about the potential impact of an escalating trade war with China on profits and the economy, which ought to be putting pressure on Trump to strike an agreement.
“This is the big cloud on the horizon right now” for the U.S. economy and financial markets, Dollar said.
The administration also faces the likelihood that its plans for tariffs on $200 billion in additional Chinese imports and others to follow will begin to hit consumers more directly, something that unnerves Republicans looking warily at the mid-term elections and polls showing a Democratic wave building.
Yet Trump’s latest China tweet also highlights how “each side is sensing a vulnerability in the other and they are both wrong,” Dollar said.
Chinese Economy
While Trump believes the Chinese economy is suffering, Dollar said the reality is that exports to the U.S. only account for 3 percent of China’s gross domestic product, with multinational companies with supply chains dependent on China as likely to suffer as Beijing.
Likewise, officials in Beijing have been reading the opposition from business and Republican concerns about the mid-terms as a potential Trump weakness. But that ignores the strength of the U.S. economy and what has been the resilience of financial markets so far in the face of any trade fears.
The Chinese may look at the Mnuchin invitation and think Trump “is starting to blink. But I don’t think that is true,” said Dollar.
Increasingly, for those reasons and others the expectation in Washington is that the U.S.-China trade war will extend well into 2019. And even that it may never see a clean resolution.
Cold War
In China, officials have begun to contemplate the possibility of a new Cold War with the U.S., Dollar said. Which is how hawks in the Trump administration such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and trade adviser Peter Navarro see it as well, arguing for tariffs as just one tool to engineer a long-term decoupling of the world’s two largest economies.
With those dynamics in mind Chinese policymakers have begun to realize that any solution to their growing trade problems with the U.S. may in the end depend on them negotiating a peace directly with Trump’s hawks, said Prasad.
“That is exactly their read,” he said. “It is only by negotiating with the hardliners that they will make progress.”
But with Trump’s hawks convinced they are in an existential battle with China and likely to demand deep and long-term changes from Beijing that it is likely to resist, such a negotiation will be difficult, Prasad said. It may also never yield the end to the trade war so many are hoping for.

That could be bad news for Deutsche, which was founded in 1870 to help companies with overseas trade. In April, it said it would refocus on German customers as part of a push to restore the edge it has lost in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis.
The new strategy is getting a cool reception at home. Voith and other German companies such as auto parts maker Bosch have turned to rivals and Deutsche's share of its home market has diminished. 
""German banks have lost ground compared to their international competitors,"" said Voith group treasurer Michael Hannig. ""We had to differentiate and allocate our business also across some international banks.""
Reuters spoke to 10 executives of German companies that are current and former clients of Deutsche who said they did not feel valued by the bank. 
Interviews with more than 35 politicians, investors and public officials found that many of them are worried about the bank, which has a $1-trillion-plus balance sheet. 
The bank says clients are happy with its work and it has cut risky investments, simplified its structures and settled most large court cases. 
""We are getting very good feedback from our clients,"" said Karl von Rohr, Deutsche's co-deputy chief executive officer.
""What is clear: you cannot be successful if you are not successful in your home market.""
Nevertheless, it captured just under 10 percent of the market share of investment banking fees for mergers and takeovers involving German companies so far this year and in 2017, according to Dealogic. 
That is up from a 4 percent share among global competitors in 2016 but far below a 30 percent share in 2008, when the crisis unfolded.
Deutsche posted a loss that year but Josef Ackermann, chief executive at the time, boasted of the bank's strength as rivals turned to their governments for rescue packages.
The bank's trading in global stocks and bonds, the forte of its investment banking arm, rebounded and helped it to return to profit in 2009.
But problems were accumulating. The European debt crisis followed the financial crisis and Deutsche was facing lawsuits for wrongdoing in several operations including interest-rate benchmark setting and mortgage-backed securities, a market that has been blamed for triggering the 2008 crisis. 
It has reported losses since 2015 and a $7.2 billion U.S. fine last year for its role in the mortgage market was a major blow that spooked clients. From a market value of 47.4 billion euros at the start of 2008, Deutsche is now worth just 20 billion euros. 
MODEST EARNER
Christian Sewing was promoted to chief executive in April as the bank embraced its new strategy. With a background in risk management and retail banking, he is the first German to run the bank as sole CEO since 2002.
He wrote to staff in a May memo outlining job cuts abroad that Deutsche's roots in Germany were ""deep and enduring"", a message he underscored when he visited German chancellor Angela Merkel after his appointment. 
Competition for ordinary savers is stiff because state-backed community savings banks are dominant.
It is even considering a new structure to distance volatile investment banking from steadier, if more modest, retail business, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
In Germany's corporate world, the rivals are foreign banks. Deutsche says its foreign operations are still important.
""For Germany our global presence is of vital importance. So we need both: a dominant role in the home market and a strong international network,"" said von Rohr. 
Mann+Hummel makes filters for autos and industry. Christian Aue, group treasurer, said he dropped Deutsche from its lineup when it arranged 400 million euros of finance last year. He instead chose ING,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Bank of China.
Deutsche lost out after the pitching process to Macquarie when auto supplier Bosch asked the Australian bank to explore options for its packaging machinery unit, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank officials declined to comment on specific deals. 
In the years running up to 2007, Deutsche was also the biggest buyer of newly issued German government debt, according to the German Finance Agency. It is now in eighth place with France's BNP Paribas in the top spot followed by German rival Commerzbank.
Deutsche's chief financial officer James von Moltke said the bank is ""on a good path to rebuilding credibility"". 
""We are once again the full-service provider for our corporate clients in our German home market,"" he said. 
WORRIED OFFICIALS
Deutsche's public image has suffered at home. A series on state broadcaster ZDF, ""Bad Banks"", about a fictional lender 'Deutsche Global Invest' has not helped.
The relationship with politicians has also cooled. 
Ackermann helped direct Merkel's response to the 2008 crisis and she rewarded him by hosting the Swiss CEO's birthday party.
Sewing's first meeting with Merkel just weeks into his tenure was humble, according to three people briefed. His message to her was that the bank is cutting costs and ""rightsizing"" its global investment bank. 
German officials have been worried about Deutsche since 2016. They knew a big fine for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis was coming. At the time, Deutsche and the government publicly played down speculation that it could need state support. Behind the scenes, however, tensions were running high. 
""We looked into the abyss at that time,"" said a German official. ""To bail out an institution like Deutsche Bank would not just concern one government. It would concern a number."" 
Officials no longer talk of a rescue but politicians across the spectrum are reluctant to even speak about Deutsche.
""It isn't positive for a politician,"" said Bettina Stark-Watzinger, head of the Bundestag's finance committee and a pro-business Free Democrat. Her constituency includes an affluent suburb of Germany's financial center Frankfurt.
MERGER POTENTIAL
Deutsche Bank's shareholders, which include money manager Blackrock (N:BLK), buyout firm Cerberus and Qatar's royal family, are pinning their hopes on Sewing.
He was born in 1970 in Buende, a town in the industrial heartland of northwestern Germany known for its cigars. 
Buende's economy has been booming the past couple of years, the city's mayor Wolfgang Koch said. He was surprised when Deutsche closed its local branch last year to save costs. 
Arnold Andre, one of the city's last remaining cigar manufacturers, uses Commerzbank for its global operations, president Rainer Goehner said. 
There has been wide speculation in Germany about a tie-up with Commerzbank, which is partly owned by the state. Executives at both banks privately reject this idea. They have declined to comment publicly. 
Deutsche's managers are nonetheless considering an overhaul to loosen the bond between its retail and investment banks that could make it easier to merge some or all of the group with rivals. 
The German official said any merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) was ""unlikely soon"" although not impossible in the future.
He said it would take up to 18 months of restoring profitability and restructuring for the bank to reach ""safe ground"": ""Deutsche is certainly not where I would say I can relax.""

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 04:58AM ET</span>","Trade talks, autos and tech help European shares to best week since July","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Led by technology, autos and mining stocks, European benchmarks rose on Friday after Asian markets climbed overnight on hopes of new trade talks between the United States and China.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent by 0830 GMT, set to seal its strongest weekly gains in seven weeks. It had pared its gains somewhat after rising as much as 0.5 percent in early trading.
Analysts and traders saw new trade talks as a positive for the market, with some expecting U.S. President Trump to seek to seal a trade deal before mid-term elections in November, but they pointed to lingering nerves in the market.
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) managed a 0.2 percent rise, in line with the leading euro zone stocks index (STOXX50E).
Topping the STOXX was bank and asset manager  Investec  (L:INVP) which jumped 12 percent after saying it would demerge and separately list its asset management arm.
Mining stocks (SXPP) climbed 0.6 percent as copper held near a two-week peak, helped by hopes of an easing of trade war tensions.
Tech stocks (SX8P) were also among top gainers, up 0.2 percent after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed further on Wall Street following Europe's close, fuelling a rebound in the tech sector. 
Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) were up 2.4 to 6.3 percent. STMicro (MI:STM) got an additional boost when Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts upgraded the stock to ""neutral"".
""We think the shares are pricing in a significant amount of negative sentiment with regards to near term demand,"" they wrote, also reiterating ""buy"" recommendations on Infineon and ASML.
Autos (SXAP) rose 0.7 percent, building on the previous session's rise as China and the United States planned a new round of trade talks to defuse a dispute that has disrupted markets.
UK housebuilders  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and Barratt Development (L:BDEV) were the worst-performing FTSE 100 stocks. They fell 0.8 to 0.9 percent after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned ministers that a no-deal Brexit could cause house prices to fall by 35 percent over three years, according to the Times.
Investors have been shunning European stocks in favour of U.S. stocks this year, lured by significantly stronger earnings growth there. 
Overall the market is currently short European equities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

Some $57 billion has flowed out of Eropean equity funds over the past six months, strategists at the U.S. bank said, citing EPFR data.

Carige, Italy's last remaining large problem bank, holds a shareholder meeting on Sept. 20 to elect a new board and try to solve a governance crisis that has irked European Central Bank supervisors.
Carige's top shareholder, local businessman Vittorio Malacalza, is seeking to oust CEO Paolo Fiorentino after pushing out his two predecessors over the past four years.
A regulatory filing on Thursday showed Malacalza, who has become the single largest investor in Carige after backing three successive cash calls since 2014, had further raised his stake to 27.56 percent.
Malacalza has submitted a list of board nominees proposing to replace Fiorentino with UBS banker Fabio Innocenzi.
Pitted against Malacalza are three prominent shareholders in Carige led by Italian financier Raffaele Mincione.
They together hold 15.2 percent of Carige and have agreed to jointly back a separate list of board candidates aiming to keep Fiorentino in his job.
Carige said in a statement on Thursday night it had received a letter from the Bank of Italy saying the regulator had informed the three shareholders they lacked the authorization needed for a banking stake larger than 10 percent.

The three investors now have 15 days to obtain the necessary clearance or they won't be able to exercise their voting rights for the part exceeding the 10 percent threshold, it said.

1533,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 01:40AM ET</span>",Surging Chinese Tech Stocks Bring A-Shares Flavor to U.S. Shores,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. investors looking to get into the volatile Chinese stock market without the cross-border hassle can find a slice of the action in their own backyards.
A slew of Chinese technology companies listed in the U.S. via American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, have taken shareholders on a roller-coaster ride in the past few days. They include Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed NIO Inc., which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as well as Pinduoduo Inc., HUYA Inc., and 58.com Inc.
NIO, the electric car-maker that’s accrued $1.6 billion in losses since the start of 2016, jumped 85 percent in two days after its $1 billion initial public offering. NIO Chief Financial Officer Louis Hsieh on Wednesday blamed the low initial price on bad timing, with recent losses in Asian markets making domestic investors “too jittery” to buy.
Just a day after the interview, NIO’s shares surged 76 percent -- leading gains across other U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies. Pinduoduo, the e-commerce platform operator, jumped as much as 32 percent Thursday. The stock is up 58 percent since its July debut. ADRs from iQIYI Inc. jumped 6 percent on Thursday while 58.com closed up 9.3 percent.
The list might grow longer as Qutoutiao Inc. -- the Chinese news and video aggregation app that’s also backed by Tencent -- is scheduled to begin trading after an expected IPO pricing this week in the $7 to $9 range.
“Shares are gaining likely because overnight gains in NIO shares rekindled investors’ interest in new energy vehicles and the broad auto sector,” said Tian Yang, Hong Kong-based analyst with China Securities International. “That has helped sentiment and we don’t see any change in sector fundamentals.”
The biggest China tech ADR of them all, however, has made little headway this year.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. is down 4 percent in 2018, with Jack Ma detailing his plans this week to hand over his executive chairman role to CEO Daniel Zhang next year."

“China’s economy is on a gradual deceleration trend, but at this moment it’s still fine. The government won’t change the direction of deleveraging. They will only change the pace of it, because the economy is still fine at this stage,” said Macquarie Securities Ltd Economist Larry Hu.

Amidst the trade war with the U.S., China’s State Councilor Wang Yi said last Thursday that the world trade system needs reform, after meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.
“China supports necessary reforms and perfection of the current system, including to the WTO, to make it fairer, more effective and more rations,” said Wang.
“The aim of the reform should be to allow countries to enjoy the fruit of globalization more fairly, not to further widen the differences between the south and the north.”
His remarks came after the possible renewed trade talks in Washington to avoid the trade war jitters to escalate, and U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that the White House “was under no pressure to make a deal with China.”

Based on the last cycle that ended in July 2012, shares are set to recover on the back of improving earnings, followed by a sharp correction, analysts Praveen K Choudhary and Jeremy An wrote in a note Thursday. A Bloomberg Intelligence index for Macau casinos has tumbled more than 30 percent since this year’s peak in May as gaming revenue growth slowed and analysts turned cautious on the sector.
That echoes the previous cycle, when VIP revenue growth started to decelerate and dragged down shares by 30 percent, the note said. Stocks then bottomed and began a steep rebound. The Macau gaming measure jumped 3.7 percent as of 10:41 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, headed for a two-day rally of 8.3 percent. MGM China Holdings Ltd. climbed 4.4 percent, while Sands China Ltd. and Wynn Macau Ltd. rose more than 3.4 percent.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for Macau casino companies may grow 19 percent on year this quarter, according to the note.
If the current cycle were to follow the pattern seven years ago, though -- shares may correct 30 percent following the rebound. When stocks surged from January to April 2012 amid solid mass market revenue growth, a 30 percent correction followed as earnings estimate revisions remained negative and EBITDA growth began to decelerate.
Earlier this week,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) cut its ratings on casino operators, noting the current downcycle is similar to the late-2011 to mid-2012 slowdown when gaming revenue growth sharply decelerated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said on Thursday the company would announce a decision on where it will build a second headquarters before the end of the year, and also said that President Donald Trump is wrong to ""attack the media.""
Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, which has been among the media that have been the frequent target of broadsides from Trump.
Amazon has announced 20 finalists in North America for its planned investment of $5 billion and 50,000 jobs. At a speech before the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday, Bezos did not offer any favorites for the project.
Asked about Trump's repeated criticism of both the Washington Post and Amazon, Bezos called it a ""mistake"" for any elected official to ""attack media and journalists.""
What Trump ""should say (of criticism) is, 'This is right, this is good. I am glad I am being scrutinized,' and that would be so secure and confident,"" Bezos said. ""But it is really dangerous to demonize the media. It is dangerous to call the media lowlifes, it is dangerous to say that they are the enemy of the people.""
""The media,"" Bezos added, ""is going to be fine. We're going to push through this.""
Trump has described the Washington Post as Amazon’s “chief lobbyist.” The Washington Post’s top editor has said that Bezos has no involvement in its news coverage.
Bezos said he has had discussions with Trump but declined to elaborate. The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Trump in the spring repeatedly said without evidence that package deliveries by the U.S. Postal Service for Amazon were costing the service money. He ordered a task force to study the Postal Service, but sources last month said that the White House decided to not yet release the report, forcing a planned Senate hearing on postal reform to be delayed.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 10:38PM ET</span>",Sources say former Trump aide Manafort close to plea deal with Mueller,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is nearing a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors to avoid a second criminal trial, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
It remains unclear if the deal will include Manafort cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
A move by Manafort to cooperate could be a blow to Trump, while an outright guilty plea with no cooperation would resolve a cloud over the president ahead of congressional elections in less than two months.
""It's close but not there yet,"" one of the sources said about negotiations over a deal.
Jury selection is scheduled to begin in Washington, D.C., on Monday in Manafort's second trial in federal court on charges including conspiring to launder money and defraud the United States, and failing to register as a foreign agent for the tens of millions of dollars he earned lobbying for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.
Manafort was convicted in Virginia on eight counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts in the first trial that ended last month. Prosecutors said he evaded taxes on $16 million laundered through shell companies overseas.
The talks over a deal come ahead of a planned hearing in Washington on Friday where the judge, among other things, is scheduled to rule on evidence to be allowed at trial. Manafort could plead guilty at the hearing, one of the sources said.
Three members of Manafort's defense team - Kevin Downing, Thomas Zehnle and Richard Westling - declined to comment as they entered their office on Thursday evening. Mueller's spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the possible deal, which was first reported by ABC News.
Manafort's wife Kathleen also did not answer questions when she stopped by the lawyers' office to drop off a navy men's suit.
'BLOODIED UP'
Joshua Dressler, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it made sense that Manafort, 69, was considering cutting his losses and avoiding the time and money needed to defend himself against a second trial.
Manafort is already facing 8 to 10 years in prison from the eight guilty counts in Virginia, terms that may not change significantly no matter the outcome of the second trial.
""With eight convictions already in place, and more possible convictions awaiting him, it seems that he has been bloodied up enough to see the light,"" Dressler said. 
Manafort worked for five months on Trump's 2016 campaign, including three as chairman. He resigned in August 2016 following a news report linking him to covert payments from a pro-Kremlin political party in Ukraine.
Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is representing Trump in the Russia probe, previously told the Politico news outlet that taking a plea deal to avoid a second trial would not crush Manafort's chances of receiving an eventual presidential pardon. Trump has not said whether he would pardon Manafort but he has not publicly ruled it out.
Manafort was at a controversial meeting at Trump Tower in 2016 where Russians were offering ""dirt"" on election opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump's critics have pointed to the meeting as evidence of the collusion with Russia that Trump denies.
""I don't think he has any information that would hurt the president,"" Giuliani told Reuters.
Trump praised Manafort last month for not entering into a plea agreement, as the president's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen had. ""Unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' - make up stories in order to get a 'deal. Such respect for a brave man!"", Trump wrote on Twitter on Aug. 22.
Rick Gates, Manafort's former business partner and the campaign's deputy chairman, pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for his cooperation, later testifying against Manafort in Virginia.
Gates could be called as a prosecution witness in his Washington trial as well, as could veteran political operative Samuel Patten, who pleaded guilty to unregistered lobbying for Ukrainian politicians two weeks ago.
A second trial could delve deeper into Manafort's Russian connections including to Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian-Russian political consultant who was indicted along with Manafort and who Mueller's team has linked to Russian intelligence.

Prosecutors have said Manafort and Kilimnik conspired to tamper with witnesses, which prompted U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to revoke his bail and order him jailed pending trial.

1538,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>","China's Investment Slowdown Worsens as Industry, Retail Hold Up","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic momentum weakened a notch in August, with a continued slowdown in investment overshadowing solid retail sales and industrial production data.
Today’s data indicate that while industrial output and consumption are improving slightly, the policies the government has announced in recent months to spur investment have yet to take root. Credit data in August were stronger than expected overall, although the growth in bank lending is still slowing due to the effects of the campaign to cut leverage.
""China’s economy is on a gradual deceleration trend, but at this moment it’s still fine,"" Larry Hu, a Hong Kong-based economist at Macquarie Securities Ltd, said on Bloomberg TV. ""The government won’t change the direction of deleveraging. They will only change the pace of it, because the economy is still fine at this stage.""
Infrastructure investment slowed to 4.2 percent in the first eight months, the slowest since the data series started in 2014. That means policies to expedite such spending haven’t fed through to construction yet.
""Despite the credit easing measures, the demand side has failed to catch up,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. ""It takes time. On the bright side, we see that both corporate and local governments have increased bond issuance. Activity will likely pick up later this year.""
Output of computer and communication gadgets surged 17.1 percent from a year earlier, hinting at front-loading by exporters assuming that more tariffs from the U.S. will hit.
However, there are some signs that one risk to the economy may be receding, with China and the U.S. talking about resuming talks over their trade dispute. Although the differences between the two sides are still vast and trust is limited after the collapse of earlier talks in May, if successful, the negotiations would remove one threat for the economy and the government."

The company cut its full-year earnings forecast in August, blaming falling demand for its PINK line of lingerie amid competition from brands such as American Eagle Outfitter's (N:AEO) Aerie.
The company expects Henri Bendel, which sells women's handbags, jewelry and luxury fashion accessories, to bring in revenue of about $85 million for 2018. It did not provide any details on costs related to the closing of the business.

Overnight, the S&P 500 closed up 0.53% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite also rose 0.75%. U.S. equities extended gains even after U.S. President Donald Trump threw cold water Thursday on the idea of trade talks with China.
Trump tweeted on Thursday, “The Wall Street Journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make deal with us. Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet?”
Reports on Wednesday suggested that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had invited Beijing officials in for talks in Washington to de-escalate jitters of a trade war. China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said on Thursday that Beijing has received the invitation and is working on the details with the U.S.
Trade tensions between the two snowballed after Trump threatened last Friday to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese exports. Beijing vowed to retaliate, rattling markets.
China’s Shanghai Composite extended on Friday morning gains from Thursday and opened up 0.04% and the SZSE Component also rose 0.65% at 9:30PM ET (01:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.48%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.79% and South Korea’s KOSPI also advanced 1.13%. Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.43%.
Markets also took in a decision on Thursday by Turkey’s central bank to raise interest rates to 24% as the country undergoes a currency crisis. The move goes against the wishes of President Recep Erdogan, who was keen to keep rates low. The Turkish lira is down about 60% against the U.S. dollar year-to-date, but after the central bank’s announcement, it gained about 4% on the day.
“The rate hike is a welcome signal for international financial markets. The sharp depreciation of the [Turkish currency] means that previously high external imbalances are quickly narrowing, which should have a positive impact on the lira,” said Agathe Demarais, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
In Europe, the Bank of England decided to hold rates at 0.75% due to “greater uncertainty about future developments in the EU withdrawal process”, while the European Central Bank also kept its benchmark interest rates unchanged."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments' bet on a privately held maker of e-cigarettes faces new risks after U.S. health regulators on Wednesday said they are considering a ban on flavored versions of the popular ""vaping"" products.
Closely held e-cigarette maker Juul Labs and other Silicon Valley start-ups lately have turned up as side bets in portfolios from Fidelity and rivals like T. Rowe Price, as the asset managers look for big paydays once the small companies go public, as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) did in 2012.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the five top-selling e-cigarette brands 60 days to provide plans for keeping their products from being used my minors. Juul, which owns about a 72 percent market share, was targeted by the agency for selling flavors that appear to particularly appeal to minors.
At Boston-based Fidelity, Juul is held in funds including Blue Chip Growth Fund and Fidelity Advisor Series Growth Opportunities Fund. At the latter, a stake in Juul was the largest single holding as of July 31, with a valuation of $45.8 million, or 6.4 percent of net assets, according to a current disclosure on the fund firm's website.
Fidelity spokeswoman Meghan French declined to comment or make portfolio managers available to comment. But even managers who are fans of Juul have made clear that uncertainty remains. 
""The company (Juul) and the industry face a number of social and public policy concerns,"" wrote Sonu Kalra, manager of Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, in a quarterly document for investors dated June 30.
However, he and others were mostly bullish on Juul. ""A small private investment in Juul Labs also paid off. We saw the value of our non-benchmark position in this leading e-cigarette maker rise along with the growing popularity of tobacco-free smoking,"" wrote Growth Opportunities manager Kyle Weaver in the fund's annual report dated Nov. 30, 2017.
Other non-public companies in the Blue Chip Growth portfolio include ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc and Blue Bottle Coffee Inc.
Uber's chief executive said earlier this month that the company is on track to go public next year. But the company also shows the risks of investing in start-ups not yet tested by public markets, as it faces regulatory scrutiny over several issues, including alleged violations of bribery laws and gender discrimination. 
Uber has said it is cooperating with a U.S. Justice Department investigation into possible violations of bribery law. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in remarks to employees a year ago promised to change its culture after his predecessor Travis Kalanick resigned.
John Bonnanzio, editor of the Fidelity Monitor & Insight newsletter for investors, said that whatever the upside, owning Juul represent business risks, underscored by the FDA action and the difficulty of measuring the impact on a company whose shares are not publicly traded. 

Pressure from fund investors could lead Fidelity managers to pull back and decide ""this thing isn't worth the trouble,"" he said.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>","In shift, Pakistani giant Engro to bet big on rising middle class","By Drazen Jorgic
KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's chemicals-to-energy conglomerate Engro Corp has seen its fortunes rise on the back of massive Chinese investment, but plans to shape its future growth around the country's vast population and expanding middle class, its chief executive said. 
Engro Corp (SI:ENGR), best known for its fertilizer and petrochemicals factories, as well as engineering projects, is Pakistan's largest listed conglomerate, and after recovering from a brush with bankruptcy in the early part of this decade is now sitting on a $500 million cash pile. 
It has been a major beneficiary from Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative splurge, working with Chinese firms on coal and power projects worth billions of dollars. 
Engro's rising fortunes since 2012, when its factories were crippled by gas shortages, mirror the improvements in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation where economic growth has accelerated due to vast Chinese investment and a sharp drop in militancy and power outages. 
In the near term, Engro's outlook is linked to a mile-long $1.5 billion coal mine in the Thar desert near the border with India, part of Beijing's pledge to invest about $60 billion in Pakistan.
But with Pakistan's new government hinting it may review Belt and Road contracts due to concerns they were too expensive, some analysts see risks on the horizon for Engro and say planned power plants around the mine may struggle to obtain financing.
Ghias Khan, Engro's chief executive, told Reuters this week he was ""pretty confident"" the government would not re-open deals with sovereign guarantees. 
""If they do, that will have a very negative impact,"" Khan said.
This year Pakistan's economy has also been shaken by a shortage of dollars, and speculation Islamabad may turn to the International Monetary Fund to ease current account pressures.
CONSUMER GROWTH
Undeterred by Chinese investment jitters and the recently wobbly economy, Khan said Engro was weighing acquisitions and starting new businesses in agriculture, healthcare, real estate, communications and other consumer-linked sectors to profit from rising incomes in the Muslim majority country of 208 million people, 60 percent of whom are aged under 30. 
""We've come to a realization what has gotten Engro where it is today is not good enough for our next phase of growth,"" Khan said in an interview at Engro's ocean-front headquarters in Karachi, an Arabian Sea metropolis. 
""What we are proud of is our ability to execute large-scale projects and put up large industrial complexes. But we are mindful we have to get into businesses which are more related to the population growth, and take us closer to the consumers."" 
In Karachi, mushrooming shopping malls and ever-rising number of cars on the road point to a multi-year consumer boom as people's disposable incomes have doubled this decade, analysts say. 
Khan compared Pakistan's current economic level, population growth and per capita income, which stands at about $1,600, to where China, South Korea and India were at earlier points in their development. 
""If you look at sectors that did well when they were where Pakistan is today ... like real estate, automobiles, healthcare, logistics - everything is somehow related or linked to population growth or the middle class,"" Khan said. 
COAL BONANZA? 
The company, born out of an employees' buyout of Exxon's Pakistan operations in the 1990s, was also looking to go deeper into the petrochemicals sector, and was exploring projects to set up naphtha, ethane crackers or polypropylene facilities in the ports of Karachi or Gwadar, Khan added. 
What Engro will do with its cash pile of about 60 billion rupees ($490 million) has been a hot topic in Pakistan's equity market. 
""One thing is very clear: how we invest these 60 billion rupees ... will determine how this organization looks 10-15 years from now,"" said Khan, adding a decision would be made ""hopefully soon"". 
In the meantime, the company is busily expanding its coal projects in Thar, located in the remote deserts of Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital.
Helped by Beijing's cash and Chinese expertise, Engro began digging the Thar mine in 2016 with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). 
The coal will feed into a 660MW power plant Engro is building, part of about 4,000MW of generation planned by various Pakistani consortiums by 2021.
Pakistan says it has the world's 7th largest coal reserves, but it is of the low-grade lignite variety and for decades successive attempts at large-scale mining have failed. 
Analysts say Engro has locked in returns on equity of about 30 percent per annum, in dollar terms and with a sovereign guarantee, on the power projects. 

Engro declined to reveal equity returns on power projects, but with Pakistan looking to control its ballooning current account deficit to avoid another IMF bailout, Khan said the new government was likely to want power plants that do not rely on imported fuel.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.4 percent in early trade, following gains on Wall Street overnight. 
Australian shares were up 0.5 percent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index gained 0.9 percent.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57 percent on Thursday, the S&P 500 gained 0.53 percent and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.75 percent. 
Shares around the world have been buoyed by news of a possible new round of talks between Washington and Beijing, even as the trade war between the world's two largest economies looks set to escalate.
Chinese officials welcomed an invitation from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for new talks. But U.S. President Donald Trump tempered market expectations, tweeting on Thursday that the U.S. is ""under no pressure to make a deal with China."" 
The Trump administration is readying a final list of $200 billion in Chinese imports on which it plans to levy tariffs in the coming days, a move that many fear would mark a severe escalation in the trade war and put a significant dent in global growth.
""The news on Wednesday that US officials had invited China to restart trade talks suggests that the announcement of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports may be delayed. But we think the chance that fresh talks will defuse trade tensions is low,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.
The analysts noted that Mnuchin had brokered a deal with China in May that was scuppered days later by Trump. 
""As a result, he has little credibility with Chinese policymakers,"" they said.
The uncertainty around the trade tensions was highlighted by the European Central Bank, which on Thursday kept policy unchanged as expected and warned that risks from protectionism were gaining prominence.
Turkey's central bank helped to support sentiment in emerging markets, striking out in a rare show of independence to hike its benchmark interest rate by 625 basis points, to 24 percent.
Currency crises both in Turkey and Argentina have stoked fears of contagion over the past several weeks, hammering emerging market assets from Indonesia to India to South Africa. 
After rising as high as 6.01 to the dollar, the lira weakened slightly to 6.1340 in early Asian trade.
""While the move is encouraging, the CBT faces a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by rising inflation amid a sharp deceleration in economic activity,"" Citi analysts said in a note. ""We continue to believe that the external adjustment that lies ahead is likely to be more challenging than the previous episodes.""
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes continued to flirt with the 3 percent level, rising to 2.9700 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.964 percent on Thursday. 
The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.7524 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.756 percent. 
The two-year yield fell Thursday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, suggesting the Federal Reserve's pace of rate hikes could slow.
Markets will also be focused on a raft of data from China due later this morning as investors look to any signs of economic stress from the heated trade dispute with the United States.
The euro was flat at $1.1688 after rising on Thursday on comments from ECB President Mario Draghi that focused on healthy domestic fundamentals, including rapid growth in employment and a rise in wages. 
The pound traded at $1.3114. On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold and highlighted greater financial market concerns about Brexit, a month after raising borrowing costs for only the second time in more than a decade.
The dollar rose 0.08 percent against the yen to 112.01. 
U.S. crude was 0.4 percent higher at $68.88 a barrel as Hurricane Florence approached the U.S. east coast. Brent crude also up 0.4 percent, to $78.48 per barrel.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 08:15PM ET</span>",Sears' same-store sales losses narrow but warns it may go out of business,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) reported a smaller decline in quarterly same-store sales on Thursday, but warned again that there is doubt about the company's continued operation as it awaits approval to sell some of its businesses to its chief executive's hedge fund.
""It is imperative that the Company reduce debt, adjust its debt maturity profile and eliminate the associated cash interest obligations,"" Chief Executive Edward Lampert said in a blog post on the company's website.
""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value.""
Sears is working to transform its business by selling brands like tool line Craftsman and building a stronger online presence. Its market share has been hurt by discount chains including Walmart (N:WMT), and the surge in popularity of online shopping has added to its woes. 
It was the second time in two years that Sears has expressed doubt about its business continuing as its losses mount. 
""This year’s statement regarding its ability to remain a going concern is more dire,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc. ""It has liquidated its best assets and the cupboard is bare. These losses are unsustainable.""
Sears declined to comment.
Sales at Sears' established stores, including Kmart discount shops, fell 3.9 percent in its second quarter, compared with a drop of 11.9 percent in the first quarter, a positive sign sending the 125-year-old retailer's shares up 28 percent in extended trading. 
""Sears has closed hundreds of underperforming stores so its same-store sales should be much better than they have been as only their 'stronger' performing stores are in the mix,"" said Perkins.
Sears said 149 stores will close in the second half of this year.
The company's net loss widened to $508 million in the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 4, from $250 million a year before. 
To shore up its finances, the company is considering selling its storied Kenmore appliance brand and home improvement business to Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, for as much as $480 million. 
Last month, Lampert said he could close on a deal for the businesses with an unnamed partner by late August.
Sears' special committee and a majority of disinterested shareholders must approve the sale to ESL. The company has tried to sell these assets before without success.
The company said that some of its efforts to raise cash, including the sale of Kenmore and its home improvement business to Lampert, were at too early a stage to be counted for its quarterly earnings released on Thursday. However, it said if it finalizes its plans to bolster liquidity, and completes discussions with lenders, it will be able to remain in business. 
Sears' stock, which traded at about $100 a share more than a decade ago, closed down 9 percent at $1.21 while investors awaited the results, which had been expected to be released earlier on Thursday. 

The company's quarterly sales fell 25.6 percent to $3.18 billion as it shut more stores due to declining foot traffic.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Friday accused Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Chief Executive Ross McEwan of withholding information when he gave evidence to their committee in January, a charge the CEO disputes.
Nicky Morgan, chair of Parliament's Treasury Committee, said McEwan failed to disclose, when asked whether there had been any criminal activity at the state-controlled bank, that one of its former employees was under investigation by police, despite RBS (L:RBS) having been aware of this since 2017. 
McEwan said in a statement he did not disclose the information because he did not consider it related to the subject under discussion with lawmakers. 
The CEO was called before the Treasury Committee to discuss allegations of malpractice at RBS's restructuring unit in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority investigated the unit for the period from 2008 to 2013 and concluded that many aspects of its culture, governance and practices were ""deficient,"" although there had not been criminal activity.
As the police investigation into the employee related to a later period, McEwan did not consider it relevant to the committee's inquiry. ""I replied to the committee's questions in good faith,"" he said in a statement.
However, Morgan said his explanation in a letter to the committee was unconvincing. 
""If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him,"" she said in a statement. 
The Treasury Committee is an influential group of lawmakers. In June, the committee said it had ""lost confidence"" in TSB bank boss Paul Pester after an IT crisis. Under widespread pressure, Pester stepped down this month.
Morgan said RBS had displayed a ""pattern of defensiveness"" and ""failure to acknowledge mistakes"" throughout its handling of the problems at the restructuring group. 
""McEwan's letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS's culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.""

(Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Thursday it would stop producing its Beetle compact car in 2019, ending a model that looked backward to the 1960s counterculture as the automaker prepares for a leap toward a future of mass-market electric cars.
The original VW Beetle, developed in the 1930s, made a journey from a product identified with Adolf Hitler to a symbol of Germany's rebirth as a democratic, industrial powerhouse after World War Two. In the 1960s, the Beetle was a small-is-beautiful icon of the postwar baby boom generation. Volkswagen discontinued U.S. sales of the ""bug"" in 1979, but continued production for Mexico and Latin America. 
In the mid-1990s, at a time when Volkswagen was struggling to rekindle sales in the United States, then-Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech pushed to revive and modernize the distinctive Beetle design pioneered by his grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche. The result was a crescent-shaped car called the ""New Beetle,"" launched in 1998, which offered playful touches such as a built-in flower vase. 
The New Beetle was a hit during its early years, with sales of more than 80,000 in the United States in 1999, but recently the car's U.S. sales have suffered along with most other small cars. Overall, VW has sold about 500,000 Beetles globally since 1998, the company said. 
Volkswagen sold a total of 11,151 Beetles in the United States through the first eight months of 2018, down 2.2 percent from the same period a year earlier. U.S. consumers looking for a small Volkswagen vehicle overwhelmingly prefer the Jetta sedan, or a Tiguan compact sport utility vehicle. The Jetta, Tiguan and Beetle are built for North America and other markets at a factory in Mexico. 
The end of the Beetle comes at a turning point for Volkswagen. The German automaker's last three years have been rocked by the fallout from a scandal caused by its admitted cheating on diesel emissions tests. Now, Volkswagen is gearing up to launch a wave of electric vehicles to appeal to a new generation of environmentally conscious consumers - children and grandchildren of the 1960s Beetle enthusiasts.
In a statement announcing the end of the Beetle, Hinrich Woebcken, head of Volkswagen of America, said that as the company ramps up its electrification strategy, there are no plans to replace the Beetle. However, his statement did not rule that out someday. He noted the company’s I.D. Buzz, a prototype for a 21st Century reincarnation of the microbus. The automaker has said it intends to put a vehicle similar to the I.D. Buzz into production as an electric vehicle.

The company said two special Beetle models will join the final lineup - Final Edition SE and Final Edition SEL - in the United States and would offer driver-assistance technology.

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico bond restructuring approved in initial vote tally,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Creditors overwhelmingly approved a plan to restructure bonds issued by Puerto Rico's insolvent Government Development Bank (GDB), according to preliminary voting results announced on Thursday.
The U.S. Commonwealth's Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority said final results are expected on or around Sept. 19. The deal would mark the first consensual debt restructuring under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act, which aimed to rescue the island overwhelmed by $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities.
Puerto Rico has been trying to restructure its debt since May 2017 through a form of bankruptcy in U.S. court and has other tentative deals with creditors that combined with the GDB agreement cover about 40 percent of its bonded debt.
The next step would be final approval by Puerto Rico's federally appointed financial oversight board and by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who the government expects will issue an order around Nov. 6. 
Under the deal, the GDB, which has about $4 billion of debt, would transfer to a GDB Debt Recovery Authority portions of its loan portfolios, mostly made to municipalities and public agencies, as well as its real estate assets and unencumbered cash. The authority would issue new bonds backed by a statutory lien on those assets in an amount equal to 55 percent of outstanding debt.
There is pushback from a group of unsecured creditors participating in Puerto Rico's Title III bankruptcy case over the GDB debt restructuring deal.
The unsecured creditor committee, or UCC, seeks to halt the agreement, arguing it violates the commonwealth’s court-ordered bankruptcy stay and PROMESA. The group also raised a flag over the deal’s release of potential claims against current and former GDB directors, officers and other representatives. 
The Puerto Rico government and the oversight board have rejected the committee’s arguments and intend to move forward with the GDB deal.
Swain, who presides over Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases, took the arguments made by the UCC under advisement during a court hearing on Thursday. 
At the hearing, the UCC reminded the court of its concerns over a tentative deal to restructure Puerto Rico’s roughly $16 billion of sales tax-backed or COFINA bonds. 
The creditor committee, which represented the commonwealth in negotiating the COFINA settlement framework, would back out of the deal if Puerto Rico’s fiscal plan fails to update its cash flow projections in order to accommodate the terms of the deal, warned Luc Despins of Paul Hastings, the UCC's lead counsel.
The oversight board is expected to approve a revised version of the commonwealth’s fiscal plan later this month.
Puerto Rico also has a preliminary debt-restructuring deal with a group of bondholders of its power utility known as PREPA, which has some $9 billion in debt. Counsel for the commonwealth’s oversight board said on Thursday it continues to hash out details with these creditors and that PREPA is pushing forward its privatization and concession plans for its generation, distribution and transmission assets.

If completed, the COFINA, PREPA and the GDB deals will enable Puerto Rico to restructure 40 percent of its bonded debt, said Martin Bienenstock from Proskauer, the board’s lead counsel.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",SEC rescinds guidance that bolstered proxy advisers,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission handed public companies a procedural victory on Thursday in their efforts to reduce the influence of proxy advisory firms, rescinding a pair of staff letters that critics said encouraged mutual funds to rely on their recommendations.
The move by the SEC to scrap the 14-year-old staff letters could be an indication the agency is considering a broader overhaul of corporate governance rules.
The SEC, which is expected to hold a staff roundtable on the proxy process in November, said it was rescinding the 2004 no-action letters to facilitate the discussion at the event.
The role of proxy advisers is part of a broader debate over how to improve governance at U.S. companies, which since the financial crisis have faced growing pressure from investors to consider issues like climate change and employee diversity.
Proxy advisers often support shareholder proposals in those areas or can go against corporate leaders in other ways.
The letters provided assurances to institutional investors they could resolve any potential conflicts of interest with public companies by relying on proxy firm recommendations. Critics have argued the letters led shareholders to overly rely on those recommendations.
The decision was hailed by the business lobby. Groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have long complained that two proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co, dominate the industry with insufficient oversight.
""For far too long, proxy advisory firms have exerted undue influence over manufacturing companies, trying to force business decisions without any regard to investors’ best interests,"" said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""Manufacturers support increased SEC oversight over proxy advisory firms to restore fairness to the system.”
In separate statements, ISS and Glass Lewis said the SEC's move does not alter existing law, their business operations or relationships with institutional investors.
""Corporate lobbyists have created a mythology surrounding these letters in an attempt to undermine the important work we do for our sophisticated institutional investor clients,"" said ISS General Counsel Steven Friedman.

""Glass Lewis is committed to ensuring, that in its role as a proxy advisor, institutional investors can comply with the fiduciary duties they owe to their respective clients, and companies are entitled to a fair, reasonable and independent assessment,"" Glass Lewis CEO Katherine Rabin said in a statement.

1552,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 04:44PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Consumer and Retail Lead Economic Calendar
Shopping takes the spotlight in economic indicators with numbers on retail sales and consumer sentiment arriving.
The Commerce Department issues its retail sales data at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with a solid rise expected for August, although a slightly lower one from the month before.
Economists expect that retail sales rose 0.4% last month and that core retail sales, which exclude auto sales, rose 0.5%.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), the University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of consumer sentiment for September.
The consumer sentiment index is expected to have risen to 96.7 from 96.2 in August. There will also be numbers on current consumer conditions and inflation expectations.
In addition, investors will get data on business inventories for July and August industrial production.
And for Fed watchers, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans will speak at 9:00 AM ET (13:00 GMT) at the Northeast Indiana Regional Economic Forum.
2. Dave & Buster’s Weighs In
Along with economic numbers, the earnings calendar’s one entry before the bell tomorrow will also give insight on how dollars are being spent by the consumer at the mall.
Restaurant and video game parlor chain Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) reports its latest quarterly figures.
Analysts, on average, expect that the company earned 67 cents per share on revenue of about $311 million. Comparable sales will be in focus. The company reported a 4.9% drop in its last quarter, which beat estimates. Analysts expect a drop of about 2.6% in the most recent quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.
3. Rig Count Caps a Busy Week for Oil
Oil traders will be busy tomorrow as crude’s price swings look set to continue after conflicting data points and conflicting signals on trade.
The Baker Hughes rig count data will be watched tomorrow for ongoing signs of tightening U.S. output, which fell to 10.9 million barrels a day last week.
Crude futures for October delivery settled down 2.5% today.
Crude oil output in OPEC climbed in August by 420,000 barrels a day, to average 32.63 million barrels a day, the International Energy Agency said today.
On the demand side, the agency warned that oil-demand growth could come under pressure as a stronger greenback could raise the cost of importing energy. The international energy watchdog also cited an ""escalation of trade disputes"" as another headwind to demand growth."
1553,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 04:34PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Closes Higher Amid Apple-Inspired Rally,"Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed higher as an Apple-inspired rally stoked investor appetite for risker assets, offsetting mixed signals on trade.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.57%. The S&P 500 rose 0.53%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.75%.
Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) slump from a day earlier lured bargain-seeking investors into the technology giant's shares, which closed 2% higher despite analysts cutting estimates on future profit growth.
Goldman Sachs cut its fiscal 2019 forecast on Apple's earnings per share to $13.77 from $14.53, on concerns the lower-than-expected pricing for the iPhone Xr would hurt average selling prices, stifling growth.
Apple on Wednesday revealed its new iPhone XR and priced the LCD-version of the phone at $749, below the $849 Goldman had previously estimated.
Apple's return to winning ways lifted the broader averages, even as President Donald Trump's remarks appeared to cast some doubt on a positive outcome for potential U.S.-China trade talks.
""We are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us,"" Trump tweeted. He wrote that the U.S. ""will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home.""
This comes after Beijing, on Thursday, reportedly said it would welcome the opportunity to renew trade talks with the U.S.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), both of which have huge exposure to China, took Trump's remarks in stride, suggesting that investors remained focused on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's efforts to get the ball rolling on a fresh round of trade talks.
Mnuchin sent a letter to Chinese officials on Wednesday proposing talks in the next few weeks.
Energy, meanwhile, did little to lift the broader averages, ending the day roughly unchanged following a decline in oil prices amid a jump in OPEC output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 2.5% to settle at $68.62 a barrel.
On the corporate news front, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares rallied 4% after the wireless chipmaker confirmed it had entered into a $16 billion accelerated share buyback program.
Shares of Kroger (NYSE:KR), meanwhile, fell 10% as the retailer's earnings topped estimates, but sales fell short.
The upbeat day on Wall Street was also helped by a slowdown in inflation, which eased investor fears that rising consumer prices would force the Federal Reserve to adopt a faster pace of monetary policy tightening.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index rose 0.2% last month, below economists' expectations for a 0.3% increase. The slower pace of rising consumer prices in August pushed the year-on-year increase in the CPI down to 2.7% from 2.9% in July.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) named its second new sales chief in less than a year on Thursday after chief commercial officer Eric Schulz abruptly resigned nine months after being poached from Rolls-Royce (L:RR) to lead the battle for jet sales against Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The European planemaker said Christian Scherer, head of turboprop maker ATR and an Airbus veteran who had been beaten to the job by Schulz in November last year, would take over the position immediately, reporting to Chief Executive Tom Enders.
Reuters earlier exclusively reported that Schulz was expected to resign. Airbus said his decision had been taken for personal reasons.
The surprise exit comes as Airbus faces delays and industry-wide reliability problems with engines that soured relations with several customers and left the Frenchman increasingly frustrated, people familiar with the matter said.
The company now has a battle on its hands to recapture lost ground after its share of orders against Boeing this year slumped to barely a quarter in the wake of a looser than usual set of commitments at the Farnborough Airshow.
Sources said Scherer's aggressive commercial streak could challenge Boeing's lead in the airplane market, where the two sides are embroiled in a bruising battle for wide-body sales. 
But several note he is not a preacher of 'market share' for its own sake, especially where jet market stability is at risk.
TENSIONS 
Schulz was picked for the high-profile Airbus post last year after the company bungled efforts to name an internal successor to John Leahy, the U.S.-born sales kingpin who retired in February.
His appointment reflected a desire by the board to bring in outside blood as Airbus endured turmoil over the impact of ongoing UK and French corruption investigations, which severely demoralized the Airbus marketing machine.
But Schulz's previous position as head of Rolls-Royce civil engines did not always guarantee him a sympathetic hearing from airlines currently suffering problems with Rolls engines on Boeing and Airbus jets, according to multiple aircraft market sources.
He was also widely said to have struggled to get a grip on the complex and sometimes faction-ridden Airbus universe.
Nonetheless, his decision came as a complete surprise to top management who were informed this week, insiders said.
Schulz could not be reached for comment.
Sources had also reported a tense relationship between Schulz and Guillaume Faury, head of the planemaking division, who is the leading internal contender to replace Enders in coming months. 
""I think (Schulz) understood which way the wind was blowing,"" a person familiar with the company said.
Another person close to the company denied such tensions had triggered Schulz's decision to leave.
A320NEO ARCHITECT
Before joining turboprop affiliate ATR in 2016, Scherer forged the successful A320neo jet program and Airbus's jet manufacturing entry to the U.S. with a plant in Alabama. 
The A320neo - an upgrade of Airbus's most-sold jet with fuel-saving engines - generated thousands of orders and powered Airbus shares to record highs, but has been hit by delays in deliveries of engines mainly from Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).
In his two years at the helm of ATR, Scherer scored key sales to India and the U.S. but was forced to curb deliveries to Iran after Washington exited an international deal to ease sanctions.

His transfer back to parent Airbus is the second unexpected exit of a French chief at ATR in as many years and could renew pressure for an Italian to occupy the rotating presidency of the firm, co-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF).

1567,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",VW Is Halting Production of Its Iconic Beetle,"(Bloomberg) -- Herbie is going on hiatus.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG is halting Mexico production of its iconic Beetle, the car once so popular in North America that it prompted the German automaker to build its first factory on the continent in the 1960s. Output from the company’s factory in the state of Puebla will end in July 2019.
VW has been pulling the Beetle from select markets as part of a broader effort by the German giant to rein in its bloated product range, which spans more than 300 different vehicles and variants, including heavy trucks, motorbikes and passenger cars. Cutting back on product complexity is one of the key means by which the company is trimming costs and getting leaner in the wake of its diesel emissions scandal.
Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess has been a driving force behind this slimming down since he started leading the main VW car brand in 2015. Demand for the Beetle and other VW hatchbacks like the Golf also has come under pressure as customer appetite has shifted toward sport utility vehicles across the globe. U.S. deliveries slumped to just 15,166 units last year, less than one-seventh the sales of the Jetta sedan.
The Beetle played the starring role of Herbie in the 1968 Disney film, “The Love Bug.” The sentient race car sporting red, white and blue racing stripes from the front to the back bumper headlined several follow-up films and a television series.
VW’s Diess has pondered reviving the Beetle as a fully electric car to tap the model’s cachet in popular culture. The company has touted the upcoming I.D. Neo hatchback to be rolled out in 2020 as the new Beetle for the electric vehicle age.
“The loss of the Beetle after three generations, over nearly seven decades, will evoke a host of emotions from the Beetle’s many devoted fans,” Hinrich Woebcken, CEO of Volkswagen’s U.S. sales unit, said in a statement. While there are no immediate plans to replace it, he pointed to the I.D. Buzz -- a modern interpretation of the legendary VW Bus -- to hint that the Beetle could make a comeback.
“Never say never,” Woebcken said."
1568,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 02:52PM ET</span>",Trump's antitrust enforcer considers shifting up a gear,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which stops mergers it believes will push up prices, signaled Thursday he was willing to consider tougher enforcement, a move that could affect high profile big tech companies but also energy producers, drug makers and a big swath of the U.S. economy.
Joseph Simons, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to head the FTC in October 2017 and began work in May, noted in a brief speech that during two previous stints at the FTC, most recently as head of the Bureau of Competition, there had been a tendency to take a relatively hands off approach to antitrust enforcement.
""But now at the beginning of my third stint at the commission, things have shifted. The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community in a relatively stable form for about 25 years is being challenged,"" he said at a conference organized by the FTC. 
""First, some recent economic literature concludes that the U.S. economy has grown more concentrated and less competitive over the last 20 to 30 years, which happens to correlate with the timing of a change to a less enforcement-minded antitrust policy, beginning in the 1980s,"" he said. ""These concerns merit serious attention.""
Simons also noted calls for antitrust to address issues of income inequality and lagging wages, and said that this would also be discussed.
""We do this with the goal of understanding if our current enforcement policies are on the right track or on the wrong track, and if they are on the wrong track, what shall we do to improve them?"" he said, noting that he was keeping ""a very open mind.""
Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat on the five-member commission, noted in a tweet a Roosevelt Institute study showing relatively few big companies dominate markets ranging from airlines to pharmaceuticals, saying ""@FTC is listening.""
Trump has pushed for tough enforcement of antitrust law but muddied the waters by singling out AT&T's (N:T) purchase of Time Warner, owner of CNN, which Trump has frequently criticized. The Justice Department sued in court to stop that deal but lost. It has appealed.
Big tech companies such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and others have faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats for everything from widespread collection of users' information to being used by Russia to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election to being unfair in how they use their dominance to compete with smaller rivals.
The FTC conducted an investigation of Google that ended in 2013 with a slap on the wrist for the search and advertising company.  Yelp  Inc (N:YELP) has pushed for the agency to re-open that probe.
In a congressional hearing in June, Simons noted the clout of the few, powerful big tech companies but also said he would not support attacking companies ""because they're big and successful.""
The FTC does much more than review big tech mergers. It also reviews mergers in the energy sector, such as a deal to combine industrial gases companies  Praxair Inc  (N:PX) and Linde (DE:LIN1), as well as mergers across health care, from hospitals deals to pharmaceutical mergers.

The FTC, which is currently made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, shares the work of enforcing antitrust law with the Justice Department.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former partners of the hedge fund Deerfield Management were sentenced to three years in prison on Thursday after being convicted of taking part in what prosecutors have described as an insider trading scheme based on leaks from within a federal healthcare agency.
Rob Olan and Ted Huber were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, along with two other people convicted of taking part in the scheme.
Christopher Worrall, who worked for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was sentenced to 20 months, while David Blaszczak, founder of political consulting firm Precipio Health Strategies, was sentenced to one year and a day.
""It's a case that really calls out, in my judgment, for a significant punishment, for the purpose of deterring others,"" Kaplan said before imposing the sentence. Nonetheless, the judge said he was imposing a relatively lenient sentence on Blaszczak because the jail term would be a hardship for his wife, who is losing her vision, and that the other sentences were proportionately shorter as a result.
Kaplan ruled that the defendants could remain free while they appeal.
A spokesman for Deerfield also declined to comment. 
Barry Berke, a lawyer for Huber, declined to comment, as did John Nathanson, a lawyer for Worrall. Lawyers for Olan and Blaszczak could not immediately be reached.
The four men were charged in May 2017 with fraud, conspiracy and misappropriating government property.
Prosecutors said that Worrall tipped Blaszczak about upcoming decisions from CMS, which determines how much government insurance programs will reimburse healthcare companies. They said Blaszczak passed the information on to Huber and Olan, who used it to make about $7 million for Deerfield.
Blaszczak had also worked at CMS and kept in touch with Worrall after he left, according to prosecutors. Worrall's illegal tips to Blaszczak included advance notice about rules cutting reimbursement rates for radiation cancer treatment and dialysis, allowing Deerfield to profit by trading in companies affected by the rules, prosecutors said.
Deerfield last year agreed to pay $4.6 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle related civil claims, but did not admit or deny wrongdoing.

The companies whose stock was involved included radiation oncology companies Accuray Inc (O:ARAY) and  Varian Medical  Systems (N:VAR), and dialysis companies  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA),  NxStage Medical  Inc (O:NXTM), according to prosecutors.

(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) founder and the world's richest person, on Thursday said he will commit $2 billion to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities.
The announcement marks a deeper foray into philanthropy for Bezos, whose fortune has soared to more than $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon, according to Forbes. Dominance in e-commerce and the nascent field of cloud computing has made Amazon the world's second-most valuable public company.
Bezos solicited ideas on Twitter last year for ways to donate some of his wealth. While he has financially supported cancer research and scholarships for immigrants, among other causes, Bezos has primarily devoted his fortune to his Blue Origin rocket company, which he described Thursday as an ""investment in the future of our planet through the development of foundational space infrastructure.""
His private ownership of The Washington Post, which has published articles critical of the White House, has also put him at odds with President Donald Trump.
The new philanthropic effort is called the Bezos Day One Fund, a nod to the executive's management philosophy that organizations must view every day with the fervor of a new start, or face stagnation and decline.
Within this, the ""Day 1 Families Fund"" will support existing non-profits that offer shelter and food to young homeless families.
The ""Day 1 Academies Fund"" will start an organization to operate a new network of full-scholarship pre-schools for low-income communities. Citing the Amazon mantra of customer obsession, Bezos said in a tweet https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1040253796293795842, ""The child will be the customer.""
Bezos has yet to join ""The Giving Pledge"" created by fellow billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, whose more than 180 signatories have promised to give more than half of their fortunes to philanthropy.
The Amazon chief's wealth has become problematic for some.

Earlier this month, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, proposed a bill in Congress called the ""Stop BEZOS"" Act, which would make large corporations pay workers more or pay for public assistance programs like Medicaid. Amazon has said the senator's statements about the company are ""inaccurate and misleading.""

Discussions about shifting some production to VW's Emden plant have started again within the parent company's management, the unions said in a statement.
""The (unions') committee categorically rejected the possibility of moving Superb car production to another location outside the Czech Republic,"" they said in the statement, published in their weekly newsletter on their website.
A Skoda spokesman said the carmaker was looking at ways to expand production.
""Currently we see several options, like the already announced expansion of the KAROQ model assembly to Osnabrueck (in northwest Germany). Besides this, there are no other changes planned for the Skoda brand at the moment,"" Tomas Kotera said in a response to an emailed question.
Volkswagen spokeswoman Leslie Bothge said the company would not comment on ""speculation"".
The German car group has been looking at ways to boost production at its Czech carmaker to keep up with robust demand.
Once the butt of jokes, Skoda has flourished under nearly 30 years of VW ownership to become one of its profit drivers, even beating luxury brand Audi's (DE:NSUG) and BMW's (DE:BMWG) operating margins last year.
A VW labor official told Reuters in June that further steps would be needed to boost output at Skoda, even though some production is already being shifted to Germany to relieve its stretched Czech factories.
In Thursday's statement, Skoda union leader Jaroslav Povsik said the Superb is a flagship model and ""part of our DNA"".

""We have to find a solution to fight for Superb, which is important for all of us,"" Povsik said. ""It creates profit that we would miss.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. agency that enforces federal labor laws took the first steps on Thursday towards loosening an Obama-era standard that made it easier to hold companies liable for illegal labor practices by their contractors and franchisees.
The five-member National Labor Relations Board, whose majority was appointed by President Donald Trump, proposed a rule that would restore an earlier standard. Under it, companies are considered to be so-called joint employers with their contractors or franchisees only when they exercised direct control over labor issues such as hiring or firing workers and setting wages.
In a 2015 decision involving California sanitation company Browning-Ferris Industries Inc, the NLRB had said a company could be a joint employer when it has indirect influence over the working conditions of a contractor's employees. Joint employers can be held liable for labor law violations and be required to bargain with unions representing contract workers. 
In that case, the board said Browning-Ferris was the joint employer of workers at a recycling plant who had been provided by a staffing agency and were seeking to join a union. 
Overturning the Browning-Ferris standard has been a top priority of business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business lobby, which say the Obama-era ruling could upend supply chains and the franchise model. 
Unions, worker advocates and many Democrats have said the standard the board created in 2015 was necessary because of a steady increase in the outsourcing of labor in many industries over the last few decades. 
Thursday's announcement was hailed by business groups and some Republicans in Congress. Robert Cresanti, president of the International Franchise Association, said the Obama-era decision had created confusion and uncertainty for franchise operators and the proposed rule would create ""clear lines"" for companies to follow.
The board said its proposal would be formally published on Friday, kicking off a 60-day public comment period. 
The NLRB had overturned the Obama-era joint employment standard in a December ruling. But it wiped out that decision two months later because a board member appointed by Trump had a conflict of interest.

In June, NLRB Chairman John Ring, a Trump appointee, said that adopting a rule would provide a higher level of certainty to employers and unions than issuing a new decision.

LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche (S:ROG), the world's biggest producer of cancer drugs, is stepping up cost cuts in an efficiency drive made unavoidable by competition from cut-price copies of three mega-brands from its famed U.S. Genentech biotech stable. 
Even though the Swiss company has some of the pharmaceutical industry's most admired research and development labs, it is now battling to increase medicine sales as its biotech portfolio ages and rivalry intensifies.
Chief Executive Severin Schwan told Reuters he was confident he could fill the sales gap but expects only ""moderate growth"" into 2019 - helped by newer drugs such as Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis (MS) - before a ""re-acceleration"" around 2021-22. ""If you have such a sharp portfolio shift as we have now, then of course you have to reallocate resources in a more dramatic way,"" Schwan said. ""That's what we are doing.""
The company will have to run fast to stand still. Roche estimates it could have a $10 billion sales gap to fill by 2022 from rival incursions into cancer treatment, territory the Swiss drugmaker has long dominated. Roche's three best-selling drugs – all for cancer – had combined sales of $21 billion last year, accounting for 40 percent of overall sales.
But the drugs - Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin - now face a steep decline https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ROCHE-CEO/0H0014BTS243/index.html due to cheap near-copies, known as biosimilars, made by rivals including Switzerland's  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and South Korea's Celltrion (KS:068270).
Adding to the pain, a key technology patent will expire next year, lopping another $600 million or so from cash flow.
In Europe, where biosimilars are already making deep inroads, Roche's cost-cutting is more advanced, with some commercial operations being trimmed back.
Now, the United States is on the block with Roche cutting 223 positions at Genentech's South San Francisco campus. The company is also streamlining global business units as part of a separate, wide-reaching move that could impact scores of jobs.
It is a prescription that investors are likely to appreciate. ""There is room to improve efficiency in the business,"" said Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell.
BOLT-ON ACQUISITIONS 
Still, Roche intends to ring-fence research and development (R&D) and is sticking by a long-standing strategy of using only small to mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions to shore up its drugs pipeline, rather than buying in a big new medicine business.
To some extent that is pragmatic. ""Typically, we cannot make the economics work,"" Schwan said.
The shifting sands mean Roche may look rather different when it finally emerges from the shadow of biosimilars, with non-cancer drugs playing an increasingly important role - a trend already being set by Ocrevus in MS and Hemlibra for haemophilia.
In particular, while other companies including  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) have pulled back in neuroscience, Roche hopes to restock its medicine cabinet with drugs against autism, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.
These are high-risk, high-reward diseases but Roche believes its understanding of the latest science means it could become as well known for treatments of brain and nervous system disorders as for cancer.
""The jury is still out,"" Schwan said. ""There is actually now a reasonable chance that we diversify into other areas in a meaningful way.""
Meanwhile, its cancer R&D effort continues.
Schwan acknowledged Roche's Tecentriq immunotherapy had lost ground to Merck & Co's (N:MRK) Keytruda in first-line lung cancer treatment but he still sees important new opportunities, notably in certain hard-to-treat forms of breast cancer.
Among Roche's biggest potentials is a bispecific antibody, a dual-action drug that brings tumor cells and immune cells closer together to fight blood cancers.
One patient who failed previous treatments, including CAR-T cell therapy in which the body's immune cells are reprogrammed, achieved full remission for a year after getting Roche's experimental bispecific therapy, it reported on Thursday. 

""If you see such a response for very, very sick patients like that, that of course is extremely promising,"" Schwan said. ""That is one of our molecules we put a lot of hope into.""

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:59PM ET</span>",Apple leads Wall St higher as trade worries ease,"By Shreyashi Sanyal
(Reuters) - A rise in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led a rebound in technology shares and boosted all three major stock indexes on Thursday, while trade worries eased after China said it was open to fresh talks with the United States.
The bluechip Dow Jones Industrial Average touched its highest since Feb.1 and is just about 2 percent short of all-time high hit on Jan.26. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had already moved past their January peaks to record highs in prior weeks.
The technology sector climbed 1.38 percent on the day, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, boosted by Apple's 2.9 percent jump.
Apple, which has said tariffs could hit a ""wide range"" of its products, fell 1.2 percent on Wednesday when it unveiled its largest-ever iPhone, but made only small, widely expected changes to its line-up.
""It is a risk-on environment today and if risk is truly going to be on, then technology is definitely going to lead,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
Trade worries softened after the Trump administration invited Beijing for a new round of talks, even as Washington prepared to slap tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
The timing of the talks remains unclear and President Donald Trump said in a tweet there is no pressure to make a deal.
""The fact that China is willing to talk is good. Hopefully there is a bit of normalcy returning to the markets because seems as though Trump's tweet at this point is largely just noise,"" said Rick Platte, chief investment officer of Schwartz Investment Counsel. 
Trade-sensitive industrial sector rose 0.53 percent.  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) was up 0.9 percent and Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 1.0 percent.
At 12:34 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 139.59 points, or 0.54 percent, at 26,138.51, the S&P 500 was up 15.19 points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,904.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 72.78 points, or 0.92 percent, at 8,027.01.
On the economic front, U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed.
""Tame inflation data is a net positive for markets and this shouldn't change the Federal Reserve's decision for two further rate hikes this year,"" Antonelli added. 
Two S&P sectors were trading lower, with the defensive consumer staples dropping 0.5 percent as shares of Kroger (NYSE:KR) weighed the most on the sector. 
Kroger slid 10.2 percent and was the biggest decliner on the S&P after the supermarket chain's same-store sales missed estimates as customers were put off by changes in how it stocked merchandise.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rose 4.0 percent after the chipmaker said it would buy back about $16 billion of its stock.
Chipmakers bounced back from a slide on Wednesday, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index up 2.21 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.32-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 56 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 107 new highs and 40 new lows.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:25PM ET</span>","'Buyer beware' on Canadian cheese concessions, say European exporters","By Allison Martell and Philip Blenkinsop
TORONTO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A trade deal meant to give European cheesemakers more access to the Canadian market is falling short of its promise in its first full year, government data show, frustrating the European industry, which blames a year-old Ottawa quota system.
Under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union, Canada agreed to more than double tariff-free imports of cheese over five years, starting in September 2017. The new imports will eventually represent about 4 percent of the Canadian cheese market.
Small quotas for 2017 were filled, but more than eight months into 2018, only 36 percent of the high-quality cheese quota has been used. European imports under quotas that predate CETA are on track for the year, suggesting something about the new quotas, which are allocated differently, is limiting imports. Many of the old quotas are held by specialist importers, which are largely shut out of the new system.
Frustration with the system could be a warning sign to the United States, which is demanding greater access to Canada's sheltered dairy industry in a revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Canada is willing to make concessions, Reuters reported on Tuesday, although it is unclear what proposals are on the table. 
""We were hoping and expecting to significantly increase our Canadian sales,"" said Attilio Zanetti, whose Italy-based company Zanetti exports to Canada. ""I would not recommend Canada's CETA cheese tariff rate quota scheme to the Americans. My advice would be 'Buyer Beware'.""
The European Commission said it is monitoring the issue, although it is too early to determine what is behind the trend. It requested that a Sept. 19 meeting with Canadian officials include a discussion of the management of the quotas.
In a statement, Global Affairs Canada said it expects usage to rise in the months ahead, especially between Thanksgiving and New Year: ""The time required to establish business links can impact the timing of import and utilization.""
QUOTAS VS TARIFFS
Even so, lawyer James McIlroy, who represents importers through the International Cheese Council of Canada, expects that U.S. NAFTA negotiators will push for an end to Canadian tariffs, not import quotas.
""The Americans will not settle for that,"" he said. ""They've seen what happened to the Europeans.""
Under the CETA deal, which was a major concession from a country where dairy processing is worth C$15.2 billion ($11.7 billion) annually, Canada set aside half of the new quota for Canadian cheesemakers, an indirect support as they face new competition. The rest went to Canadian retailers and distributors based on their market share, including sales of Canadian cheese.
From the start, the European dairy industry argued that Canadian cheesemakers would use their quota to limit competition by importing selectively or not at all. But refusing to import could backfire for Canadian companies, as they could lose the right to import in future under the terms of the CETA quota system. 
Major Canadian dairy companies, including Saputo Inc and Agropur hold quotas. But in a break from the past, Canada also divided quotas between many companies, allocating 60 percent to small firms. That fragmentation has made it difficult to import profitably, especially this year, according to quota holders, as allocations start small and rise each year.
Alberta-based retailer and pork producer Sunterra Group, a new quota holder, will use all its quota to import nearly four tonnes of parmesan from Italy this year, Sunterra President Ray Price said. But it was a challenge to ship so little, since cheese is transported in 18 tonne containers. Price would rather buy four times more.
""If you're a small organization, I can see where people would say, 'I'll do it next time,'"" he said. 
Two small import quota holders, a retailer and a cheesemaker, said they had been struggling to use their quota profitably. Both were preparing to transfer it to a distributor.
In a statement, the Dairy Processors Association of Canada, which represents large and small cheesemakers but not the smallest artisanal producers, said its members have had no issues filling quotas. 
The association's President Mathieu Frigon said any future quotas should go to ""those who will suffer losses from trade agreements.""

""If the Europeans feel short-changed in terms of market access, it is because of who the government gave the CETA TRQs (tariff rate quotas) to and how they manage their business,"" he said.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:19PM ET</span>",Ryanair faces one-day strike in five countries over contracts,"By Robin Emmott and Padraic Halpin
BRUSSELS/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair faces a one-day walkout by cabin crew across five countries on Sept. 28 as unions step up pressure on Europe's biggest budget airline to accept local contracts.
The threatened strike in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain is aimed at pressuring shareholders set to meet on Sept. 20 to address Ryanair's labor agreements, union officials said on Thursday.
They said unions would strike once a month until their demands are met.
""It is time the company accepted to employ us with local contracts under local conditions in accordance with local law,"" Didier Lebbe, a spokesman for the CNE union in Belgium, told a news conference in Brussels.
""We need shareholders to change Ryanair's employment model,"" he said, and called for European political mediation. 
Ryanair employs staff across Europe under Irish contracts, but some unions want the ability to negotiate terms under the employment laws of their own country.
Belgian unions forecast most flights out of Ryanair's two airports in Belgium will be canceled, challenging the company's pledge to minimize disruptions.
Some pilots in Italy will also join the industrial action on the day, the Uiltrasporti union said.
A spokesman for Ryanair said ""there will be no pilot strike in Italy"", adding that Ryanair had already signed a collective labor agreement with the ANPAC union and does not recognize the ""small"" Uiltrasporti union.
Unions representing three of the airline's Italy-based cabin crews said in a statement on Thursday they had agreed in principle to a three-year collective labor agreement.
Fit Cisl, Anpac and Anpav unions signed Thursday's agreement, but Uiltrasporti was not mentioned.
Ryanair has struggled to curb an industrial relations revolt in recent months and was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 German flights on Wednesday after a walkout by pilots and crew.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in response that the airline, which flies some 2,500 flights a day, was willing to accept strikes if that was the cost of defending its low-cost business model.
Amid management's clashes with unions, shares in Ryanair have fallen 13 percent this year.
Unions across the five countries set to walk out on Sep. 28 told a news conference on Thursday that the strike could be averted if shareholders were able to force change to labor contracts at their annual meeting on Sept. 20.
""Shareholders need to take responsibility and change the management, at least in human resources,"" CNE's Lebbe said.
Ryanair said that even if there is a strike, it expects a significant majority of its cabin crew in Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal to work normally, as they have during previous strikes.
""As we demonstrated in Germany yesterday, Ryanair will pre-advise customers of a small number of flight cancellations,"" Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement. 
Ryanair suffered its worst ever strikes this summer after slow progress in negotiating collective labor agreements with pilots and cabin crew. 

In August it reached a deal with striking Irish pilots, but unions representing pilots and cabin crew in Germany have threatened further walkouts if Ryanair does not improve offers on terms and pay.

Meanwhile, Turkish American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) surged after a surprisingly high interest-rate boost from the country’s central bank.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) rose about 12% at 11:55 AM ET (15:55 GMT).
The stock is still in favor despite a run that’s seen shares climb more than 300% since its July IPO and recent negative comments from short-seller Citron.
But there is consternation in a sector that has seen such a big run-up as investors look at fundamentals.
“You might argue our valuations are a little bit ahead of our skis,” Paul Rosen, chief executive officer of Tidal Royalty, which finances weed companies, told Bloomberg Wednesday.
Concerns about a U.S. Food and Drug Administration crackdown on vaping has also raised questions about what that means for the sector.
 Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) fell about 3%, while  Cronos  Group (NASDAQ:CRON) dropped about 4% and Aurora Cannabis (OTC:ACBFF) was off about 3%.
Elsewhere, Turkish stocks traded in the U.S. climbed sharply after the country's central bank boosted the one-week repo rate by 625 basis points to 24%, sending the lira, USD/TRY, higher.
That naturally helped bank stocks like Turkiye Garanti Bankasi (OTC:TKGBY), which gained about 8%, and Akbank (OTC:AKBTY), up about 7%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has filed suit against Future Income Payments, a Nevada company that offers cash advances in exchange for future pension benefits, which the regulator said are actually exceptionally high-interest loans.
In the lawsuit, the CFPB alleged that the company and related entities, all led by Scott Kohn, aggressively marketed services to consumers in need of cash, promising an upfront payment at a discount in exchange for upcoming pension payments.
The company told consumers it was a cheaper option to obtain cash than advances through credit card companies, and carried no interest rate. But in reality, the companies were signing consumers up for loans with interest rates of up to 183 percent, the CFPB said.
The regulator said the company ""lures in vulnerable consumers, including senior citizens, disabled military veterans, and their spouses, who are in need of immediate cash.""
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, claimed the company and related entities misled consumers and failed to disclose certain terms. The regulator is seeking injunctive relief, monetary relief and civil penalties.
Kohn could not immediately be reached for comment. The customer service number listed on Future Income's website was disconnected when called on Thursday.

Future Income has already come under scrutiny from 14 different states, according to the CFPB's lawsuit, with several states filing their own lawsuits against the company. The company is also being sued by investors who claim to have lost more than $100 million, the Wall Street Journal reported in July.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 177.48 points, or 0.68 percent, to 26,176.4, the S&P 500 gained 16.18 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,905.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.69 points, or 0.86 percent, to 8,022.92.
""There have been a lot of obvious headwinds to risk appetite over the summer,"" said State Street Global Markets' head of global macro strategy, Michael Metcalfe. 
""I just get the sense this week we are beginning to see some light through the clouds.""
Washington's invitation for trade talks received a thumbs-up from Beijing. Trump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on practically all imports from China unless the country offered concessions.
The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade disputes, fell 0.31 percent against a basket of other major currencies.
U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August as increases in gasoline and rents were offset by declines in healthcare and apparel costs, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, data showed on Thursday.
A slackening of inflation could slow the Federal Reserve's pace of rate hikes, and U.S. bond yields fell to session lows after the release of the consumer price report, before rebounding. Benchmark 10-year notes dropped 1/32 in price to yield 2.9645 percent, compared with 2.963 percent late on Wednesday.
The euro rose 0.54 percent to $1.1687. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the strength of the European economy continues to support confidence but added that inflation is likely to hover at current levels. The ECB kept its rates deep in negative territory as expected.
The day's big move in currency markets occurred in Turkey's lira. It fell 3 percent after Erdogan called for rate cuts and then surged to be up 3 percent on the day when those calls were ignored.
The lira's rally comes after a more than 40 percent slump against the dollar this year, caused in part by a diplomatic disagreement between Ankara and Washington.
Inflation in Turkey is now almost 20 percent and the crisis there has spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals, such as sizable current account deficits.
""Hiking today does get Turkey on the slow road to recovering some monetary policy credibility, and that is critical,"" said Aberdeen Standard Investments head of emerging market debt Brett Diment.
""If they hadn't hiked today then the real risk was that the lira would sell off sharply again and the country would swiftly head towards a balance of payments and even a banking crisis.""
The lira traded at 6.16 per dollar, well off its record low of 7.24 reached a month ago.
Among commodities, oil prices fell on doubts about growth of demand for fuel, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session.
U.S. crude dropped 1.02 percent to $69.65 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.19, down 0.69 percent on the day. [O/R]

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Peugeot's DS brand adds mini-SUV to bolster rebounding sales,"PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group unveiled an SUV version of its DS3 upscale mini as it builds on a sales rebound underway at the eight-year-old premium DS brand.
The DS3 Crossback brings a long-overdue update to the top-selling DS model, with which the Peugeot maker launched the lineup in 2010, initially under the Citroen badge.
By adapting its flagship mini to the hot-selling SUV category, the DS division led by former McKinsey consultant Yves Bonnefont hopes to accelerate a sales recovery now taking root in the wake of a protracted slump. 
Named after the hallowed 1955 Citroen limousine, the DS lineup had suffered from under-investment during a 2013-14 cash crisis that almost bankrupted PSA.
After a further 39 percent decline last year, however, DS sales rose 14 percent in the first half of 2018 - helped by the recently launched DS7 Crossback SUV model in which French President Emmanuel Macron rode to his inauguration.
Besides its higher-riding position, the DS3 Crossback brings a digital cockpit, retracting door handles and other luxury-car hallmarks to the entry-level DS segment.

Pricing is yet to be disclosed for the new vehicle, which makes its public debut at next month's Paris car show, with first deliveries due in early 2019.

Atlanta-based UPS is in the early stages of its $20 billion capital spending project to automate and expand facilities.

The company will increase its sorting capacity in the United States by 350,000 to 400,000 pieces per hour, each year between 2018 and 2020, or about seven times the additional sorting capacity added in 2017, UPS said.

UPS is under pressure to increase margins squeezed by its embrace of expensive last-mile home deliveries of online purchases as it competes with FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). FedEx makes fewer pricey deliveries, and has more efficient automated package handling and a lower-cost nonunion workforce.

Target, which employs about 350,000 people in 1,839 stores across the United States, said it would also offer extra hours to existing workers.
Retailers' holiday hiring plans often reflect their sales expectations for the most competitive shopping season of the year, which begins a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January. For many stores, holiday shopping accounts for nearly a third of annual sales.
Macy's Inc said on Wednesday it would hire 80,000 temporary workers for the holiday season, in line with last year's initial hiring, and assign more hands to cater to online orders.
Minneapolis-based Target, which began raising hourly wages to $12 from $11 earlier this year, said all workers hired after Sept. 16 would receive a minimum of $12 an hour. 
Last year, the company vowed to pay $15 an hour by the end of 2020, the so-called ""living wage"" for which labor advocates across the United States are campaigning.
Target also said it was investing more than $2 million in an employee rewards program during the holiday season.

The Singapore-based company, which conducts maintenance and repair operations for airlines, said the deal would allow it to move upstream into the manufacturing and spare parts business for engine nacelles, the casing that houses an aircraft engine.
U.S.-based MRA is the sole supplier of nacelles for Airbus SE A320neos using LEAP-1A engines manufactured by CFM International, a GE and  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA joint venture. 
The deal comes at a time when industrial conglomerate GE is slimming down its business to focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.
ST Engineering has been branching out into new business lines such as seat manufacturing and aircraft leasing as it faces increased competition from jet and engine manufacturers in offering maintenance packages to airlines.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) is parting ways with three senior Asia-focused bankers and possibly with some mid- and junior-level bankers, as the British lender moves ahead on a plan to cut costs and revamp its industry coverage, two sources said.
The senior bankers include Hong Kong-based Toby Groser, who is the co-head of general industries group in Asia focusing on retail and consumer sectors, and Dominic Richards, head of Asia media and telecoms coverage, the people said.
Singapore-based Nikhil Nath, the other co-head of StanChart Asia general industries group, is also leaving the bank, said the people, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media on the subject.
The exits come as Bill Winters, CEO of StanChart, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, steps up a broader strategic overhaul at the bank to rein in costs and deliver better returns in the medium term.
The bank's costs grew 7 percent in the first half of this year versus a year ago, and the higher expenses from investments aimed at improving performance have been a concern for its shareholders.
The three coverage bankers, with expertise in a specific sector, were responsible for offering the clients corporate and investment banking services. Groser and Nath joined StanChart in 2016, while Richards came on board late last year. 
The move is part of StanChart's drive to trim coverage focus in areas that are more heavily dominated by its U.S. and some European rivals, and build on its strong client base in sectors including oil and gas as well as metals and mining, they said.
A Singapore-based spokeswoman for StanChart declined to comment on individual moves, but said the Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank was not shutting down coverage of any industrial sector.
""We have done a strategic review of our GIG (global industrial group) business and we retain dedicated sector banker coverage at a global scale for industries where we have the greatest impact for clients,"" she said in a statement.
The bank said in the statement relevant country and regional teams would continue to work closely with its clients in the retail and consumer, telecom and media, and industrial and auto sectors. 
The three bankers did not immediately respond to Reuters' emailed requests for comment.
One of the people said a few mid- and junior-level Hong Kong and Singapore-based bankers from the consumer, and telecoms and media coverage teams would also be leaving over the next couple of months.
Reuters reported in February that StanChart was looking to drive returns by boosting lending to key industrial sectors and top clients, in a move that could cut about a dozen investment banking jobs.
Simon Cooper, StanChart's CEO of corporate and institutional banking, and global head of banking Paul Skelton have been driving those changes to accelerate its revenue growth. Both are former HSBC Plc bankers and joined StanChart in 2016.
StanChart announced separately on Thursday the departure of Singapore-based Ananth Venkat, global head of global industries group, who the bank said was leaving to pursue interests in the technology start-up sector.
Steven Cranwell will assume Venkat's role in addition to his responsibilities as global head of commercial real estate.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's trade-sensitive autos and mining shares gained on news of fresh talks between the U.S. and China on Thursday, helping the market gain while investors traded hesitantly ahead of European Central Bank and Bank of England decisions.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.2 percent by 0722 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and the index of biggest euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) climbed 0.5 percent. 
Autos shares (SXAP) rose 1.5 percent and mining shares (SXPP) climbed 0.7 percent after U.S. officials invited China to new trade talks, which the Chinese foreign ministry welcomed.
The two sectors have been the biggest victims of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners. 
""You have to be concerned about the impact [of trade tensions on autos] because the evidence is that companies are seeing pressures as a consequence,"" said Steven Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management.
""But the share prices appear to be discounting a negative scenario already,"" added Magill, who holds Peugeot in his European portfolio. 
Tech (SX8P) was also a top boost, up 0.9 percent as chipmakers and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers ams (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI), and STMicro (MI:STM) climbed 2.3 to 3.5 percent after Apple launched bigger and pricier iPhones.
Dealmaking and results led to some strong stock moves.
French bank  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) gained 4.2 percent after it decided to sell several specialized finance businesses to its parent, BPCE, and use part of the 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in proceeds for acquisitions. 
""No major acquisition expected, nothing imminent at the moment, but things could always develop by the time of the special dividend,"" wrote KBW analyst Jean Pierre Lambert.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) shares topped the DAX, rising 2.6 percent after UBS analysts upgraded the stock to a ""buy"". 
News  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is considering an overhaul to loosen the bond between its retail and investment banks, making it easier to merge some or all of the group with rival lenders, could also be supporting the stock. 
Recent reports have suggested mergers between the two German lenders, as well as possible deals involving Italian and French banks, but banks remain the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date.
""Despite all the recent rumours around UniCredit and other European banks, cross-border banking M&A will be limited, if any, in the foreseeable future,"" said Jauke de Jong, equity analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam.
Oil storage and distribution firm  Rubis  (PA:RUBF) fell as much as 14 percent, recovering to trade down 6.4 percent by mid-morning, after issues with its Iran and Turkey operations bruised first-half profit.
U.S. sanctions against Iran forced Rubis to find a buyer for a recent acquisition in Iran, leading to a 15 million euro writeoff, while the firm's oil storage facility in Ceyhan, Turkey, also underperformed due to political tensions there, Berenberg analysts said. 
German meal delivery firm Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) also suffered a 5.8 percent drop after its first-half results. [nL5N1VZ0PV]
French tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) rose 3.1 percent after it confirmed its 2018 financial outlook, saying signs of growth in Europe and North America would offset a slowdown in China.
 Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) shares fell 9.8 percent after the company placed 2.46 billion shares.
Investors were awaiting decisions from the ECB and the BoE, as well as a Central Bank of Turkey meeting, later in the session.

Neither the ECB nor the BoE was expected to hike interest rates, but the market would hone in on any comments on the pace of the ECB's planned halving of its asset purchase programme, and from BoE policymakers on the Brexit process.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>","China, HK stocks climb on hopes of fresh U.S. trade talks","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Stock markets rallied in China and Hong Kong on Thursday and the Chinese yuan firmed after the Trump administration invited Beijing to restart trade talks, offering some hope the two sides could pull back from the brink of a full-blown trade war.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) ended 1.1 percent higher at 2,686.58 points after closing at its lowest level since January 2016 on Wednesday.
The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) also ended 1.1 percent higher, with a sub-index tracking securities firms gaining 1.4 percent, real estate rising 0.8 percent and industrials ending up 1 percent.
""The trade war has been a hot topic in the market all year long. The lack of clarity has been a major influence on the A-share market and to have a good signal at this low point certainly has an effect,"" said Li Zheming, an analyst at Datong Securities in Dalian.
The CSI300 healthcare sub-index <.CSI300HC>, which had earlier fallen as much as 5 percent and weighed on the broader index, trimmed losses to end 1.8 percent lower. 
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index (HSI) posted its strongest daily gain since May 25, 2016, leaping 2.5 percent to 27,014.49.
The China Enterprises Index (HSCE) rose 2.6 percent to 10,503.01, its best daily performance since Mar. 6. Gains in Hong Kong were led by Geely Automobile Holdings (HK:0175) which rose 8.4 percent. 
The top gainers among H-shares were  China Resources Land  Ltd (HK:1109), which ended 7.16 percent higher, followed by  ZhongAn Online  P & C Insurance Co Ltd (HK:6060), gaining 6.93 percent and Haitong Securities Co Ltd (HK:6837), up by 5.69 percent.
Hong Kong's market also got a boost from strong gains in index heavyweight Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), which ended 5 percent higher after Tencent-backed Chinese online food delivery-to-ticketing services firm  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) raised $4.2 billion in the world's biggest internet-focused IPO in four years, according to people close to the deal.
But most market attention was focused on trade after the White House's top economic adviser said on Wednesday that the Trump administration had invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks, even as Washington prepares to escalate the U.S.-China trade war with tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
China said it welcomed the U.S. invitation but it was unclear when the discussions would be held.
STRONGER YUAN
News of the potential talks supported the yuan  and pressured the dollar, though few market watchers were optimistic of a breakthrough after several earlier meetings made little headway. The White House had quickly backed away after an apparent framework deal was agreed in May. [FRX/] 
""While we agree this should provide short term relief, the road ahead can still be tricky,"" Tai Hui, chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management, said in a morning note. 
""China did provide concessions earlier in the year to buy more U.S. products and reduce the bilateral deficit as well as opening up markets to foreign companies. If this did not satisfy the US six months ago, China may not be able to offer much more than that, especially if this involves adjusting its Made in China 2025 policy."" 
But a trader at a Chinese bank said market sentiment had improved following the latest developments, particularly as the proposed meeting was set to be between higher-level officials, giving the market hope that the talks could yield a breakthrough.
Prior to the market opening on Thursday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint of the currency's daily trading band  at 6.8488 per dollar.
That was 58 pips firmer than the previous fix of 6.8546, and largely in line with market forecasts following a fall in the dollar overnight, traders said.
Supported by the stronger fixing, the onshore yuan  opened at 6.8327 per dollar, its strongest level since Sept. 7. At the close of the onshore trading session at 0830 GMT, it was changing hands at 6.8487 per dollar. 
""Admittedly, the RMB market will likely remain highly uncertain in the rest of this year, depending on how the China-U.S. trade war unfolds,"" Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong said in a note. 
He said the yuan would be unlikely to fall below 7 per dollar ""given (the) PBOC's clear stance to defend the RMB.""
The offshore yuan , which is more freely traded, booked its best day in 2-1/2 weeks on Wednesday, with strong gains in the U.S. session after the trade talks news emerged. 

On Thursday, it was trading at 6.8470 at 0830 GMT, firmer than its onshore counterpart.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Australian insurer hired a private eye to surveil mentally ill woman,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian life insurer paid a private investigator who covertly filmed a mentally-ill woman eating breakfast, holding hands with her partner and undressing at a swimming pool in a bid to find evidence to avoid paying her claim, an inquiry into finance sector misconduct heard on Thursday.
TAL Services Ltd, owned by Japan's Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc (T:8750), said it also made the woman keep a daily diary of her activities so it could find reasons to minimize its payments to her, a requirement that ultimately drove her to self-harm.
The account of surveillance made for a day of explosive evidence at the inquiry which has turned its sights to the insurance sector after rocking the consumer credit, rural lending, small business banking and pension sectors with allegations of misconduct.
TAL general manager Loraine van Eeden told the inquiry the company paid the investigator A$20,000 ($14,360) to surveil the woman for two and a half weeks, morning to night, including visiting her house and watching her hike, swim, hold hands with her partner, give a talk at a library and eat at her local pizza shop.
Inquiry lawyer Rowena Orr quoted the investigator's report as saying the woman ""displayed a happy, confident, carefree demeanor ... showing no outward signs of her alleged psychological condition"".
Orr added: ""There is content about the insured having to remove her clothing to swim at the pool. The insured had no idea that the private investigator was following her around town, taking videos.""
Van Eeden said the company had hired the investigator to avoid paying the woman, who had anxiety and whose name was not made public at the inquiry, about A$2,000 a month, and that ""it's not how to treat any claimant"".
It was only after the woman provided a doctor's certificate declaring that the daily diary required by the company was driving her to self-harm that TAL told the woman about the surveillance. It ended her policy and demanded that she return 
A$69,000 in payments for claims, the inquiry heard.
REGULATOR
The inquiry heard earlier that Australia's corporate regulator allowed the life insurance arm of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) to make a A$300,000 community donation when it could have faced a fine of A$8 million for misleading advertising.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) also let CBA's CommInsure suggest edits to a media announcement about the potentially misleading ads to remove any admission that the company had misled customers, the inquiry heard.
CommInsure's executive general manager, Helen Troup, told the inquiry the regulator had asked in a series of 2017 emails if a A$300,000 ""community benefit payment"" would resolve its concern that the insurer had failed to disclose the limits of its heart attack coverage in advertising pamphlets.
""We would have taken the approach of continuing to defend our position, so this was alternative,"" Troup said.
Kenneth Hayne, the retired judge running the Royal Commission, asked if Troup considered the payment a sufficient punishment.
She replied: ""I think we felt that the A$300,000 community benefit payment was a form of punishment.""
Troup said she did not remember how the A$300,000 figure was arrived at. When Hayne asked if the amount seemed small, Troup replied: ""That's probably for other people to judge.""
ASIC had wanted its media release to say that CommInsure agreed with ASIC's concerns that it had engaged in misleading or deceptive advertising, Troup said.
But CommInsure gave alternative wording to remove any suggestion that it accepted the complaint, she said.
""As we acknowledged ASIC's concerns, we didn't entirely agree with them,"" Troup told the inquiry.
""We were still defending our position ... but sitting here today ... I can see how ASIC's concerns were legitimate,"" she said.

CBA sold its life insurance unit to Hong Kong-based AIA Group (HK:1299) for $3.1 billion last year, but the sale is still to be completed.

1651,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Here's What Wall Street Is Saying About Apple's IPhone Revamp,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s introduction of its latest iPhones on Wednesday was largely in line with analyst expectations. The new product lineup, which offers higher average selling prices and dual-sim card support, may fuel stronger sales and profitability next year, they said. Shares of Apple were little changed in post-market trading Wednesday.
Some of Apple’s Asian suppliers fell following the event. Japan’s Alps Electric Co. closed 4.8 percent lower, TDK Corp. slipped 3.9 percent and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. dropped 1.3 percent.
READ: Apple Celebrates New iPhone Models as Asia Suppliers Suffer
Here’s what analysts are saying about the product launch:
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Katy Huberty
“IPhone ASPs and larger storage SKUs across the portfolio surprised to the upside, as did the inclusion of dual-SIM capabilities,” she said.
The availability date for the iPhone Xr, set for Oct. 26, was a bit later than expected, but it won’t impact unit demand, “particularly given most early adopters will skew to the Xs Max.”
Huberty recommends buying shares on “any post-event weakness.” She raised Apple’s target price by $2 to $247.
SMBC Nikko, Hiroharu Watanabe
The newest iPhones will result in no major change in sales volumes in the mature smartphone market, SMBC Nikko analysts wrote in a report following Apple’s presentation.
While high-end smartphone sales growth is unlikely, the lower-priced iPhone Xr may become “the big seller of the three,” despite the later release date.
Nomura Instinet, Jeffrey Kvaal
“Apple is once again redefining the high end of the smartphone market,” Nomura Instinet analysts wrote in a report, noting that the iPhone Xs and Max may help boost 2019’s average selling price to $800 to $830, way above the consensus of $757. However, the Xr ASP of $750 is a “modest offset.”
New launches are “consistent with flat or even down units in FY19,” the analysts said. The firm expects the replacement cycle to be delayed following Apple’s recent efforts to extend the life of old devices.
Piper Jaffray, Michael Olson
The new iPhone lineup offers more choices that should fuel higher unit sales and ASP, resulting in increased revenue and EPS for Apple in fiscal 2019 and 2020.
Previous survey results showed that many iPhone owners who didn’t upgrade to the iPhone X chose not to because it was too expensive or too small. Now these users have options, with the iPhone Xs Max having a larger screen and the iPhone Xr costing less. 
“More choices will drive more users who are on an aging installed base of iPhones to move to the next gen form factor” in fiscal 2019 and 2020.
RBC, Amit Daryanani
Apple’s focus “appears to be shifting away from product replacement cycles and more towards profitability and Services narrative, which is a positive in a mature smartphone market.”
The company “is positioned to sustain mid-single digit sales and low- to mid-teens EPS growth in a flattish iPhone volume growth environment.”
“We are positive on Apple Watch Series 4 and its positioning as a life-saving health-care product vs a fitness tracker, and could see 20-25% ASP increases.”
Loup Ventures, Gene Munster
“While the Apple event went largely as expected, the new iPhone lineup should provide upside to both iPhone units and ASPs over the next year.”
“Apple, once again, has shown their mastery of pricing tiers, which will extract more revenue per customer.” The iPhone lineup now ranges from $449 to $1,449 for an unweighted average of $765. That compares with last year’s range of $349 to $1,099 with an unweighted average of $636."

The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invited its counterpart in China for a trade talk in Washington, amidst burgeoning trade tensions between the two countries.

Japan saw an 11% rise in core machinery orders for July, a rebound from a decline in June. Economists had reservations about the growth.
“This is a pretty good number, but I think it still doesn’t ease out worries about the export outlook for Japan,” Izumi Devalier, head of Japan economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), told CNBC.
“It looks like there could be some delays in import demand from China.”
Down under, Australia’s stock market remained in the red, taking a 0.75% dip, despite a better-than-expected employment data.
For the month of August, the number of jobs in Australia exceeded expectations of Reuters’ forecast of 15,000 to 44,000.
“The strong [labor] market is clearly a source of strength for household incomes and if sustained points to stronger wages growth…we remain the view that the [Reserve Bank of Australia] will leave interest rates on hold out to 2020 at least,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital.

1656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Europe’s Bankers Are the Big Post-Lehman Losers,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bloomberg Opinion marks the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s bankruptcy with a collection of columns from around the world. Read more.To see how Europe’s banking system has failed to bounce back from the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., one metric will suffice. The market value of a single U.S. company — Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). — is getting close to that of Europe’s 48 biggest banks combined.
On almost any measure, Europe’s lenders have been the loser from the financial crisis. They are less profitable and less valuable than they were in 2008. They’ve lost market share to Wall Street rivals, whose share prices have recovered handsomely. The market capitalization of the Standard & Poor’s Financial Sector Index has climbed to $3.4 trillion today.
What explains this divergence? Europe’s political leaders wasted the crisis: They cauterized the wound, but missed the chance to clean up, consolidate and overhaul a fragmented financial system. The region’s banking chiefs dragged their feet, resisting calls for more regulation and not bolstering their balance sheets quickly enough.
By contrast, the U.S. was decisive, providing a $700 billion bailout that recapitalized the biggest lenders and let them offload their worst loans in to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. There was no such initiative in Europe, and banks there have proved less willing than U.S. peers to offload assets at a heavy discount.
The sovereign debt crisis that by 2012 had engulfed Europe underscored the previous failures and slowed the industry’s recovery. Even now, policymakers haven’t fixed the so-called “doom loop” — where a troubled bank’s big holding of government bonds can threaten a nation’s creditworthiness, and vice versa.
So the financial scars could take a decade more to heal — if they ever do. Bank shares haven’t returned to their pre-crisis level, with the likes of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc trading at a steep discount to the book value of their assets. This is not the sign of a healthy financial system.
Clients have taken their business to Wall Street. Europe has tumbled down the banking league tables. Barclays, the top underwriter of international bonds in 2008, now ranks fifth, according to Bloomberg data. Deutsche Bank, second in 2008, doesn’t even make the top five.
Europe remains unprofitable. Too many firms are chasing too few customers. The Lehman crisis never triggered the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch-sized mergers that we saw in the U.S. — another sign of the political shackles on meaningful European consolidation. We’re still waiting for the combination of Deutsche Bank and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) or UniCredit SpA and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. In the meantime, Deutsche has dropped out of the Euro Stoxx 50 Index for the first time since its inception — a humiliation for Germany.
Amid the gloom, there are some brighter spots, of course. Not every firm is as dismal as Deutsche Bank, and some countries, like Spain, did attempt to tackle their broken lenders with merger programs. But Italy remains an open sore. Banks there are still struggling with bad loans, and consolidation is glacially slow. 
As lenders prepare to wean themselves off the European Central Bank’s emergency programs, the cost of funding will rise, which may dent revenue for some, according to Jonathan Tyce, Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior banks analyst. “You can guarantee, if there are any wobbles, it will be the southern European banks that suffer most,” he says.
Europe urgently needs to speed the healing process to keep up its slow economic recovery. That won’t be easy. The EU still lacks a truly unified capital market or a proper banking union. Germany still hates the idea of bailing out the profligate south. Confronting Italy’s banks might simply strengthen that country’s Brussels-baiting populists.
If the crisis exposed one thing, it’s that the relationship between the banking system and national governments is a central failing of the European project. Until that’s fixed, Europe’s bankers will remain stuck in the recovery ward."

(Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc (O:ADBE), the maker of image-editing software Photoshop, is in negotiations to buy Marketo Inc, a privately held cloud-based marketing software company, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal would boost Adobe's cloud-based software offerings as it takes on larger peers  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL). Marketo offers business-to-business marketing applications that would compliment Adobe's marketing business.
Private equity firm Vista Equity Partners Management LLC took Marketo private two years ago for $1.8 billion. Adobe is expected to pay significantly more than that should a deal be reached, the sources said, though the exact amount being considered could not be established.
There is, however, no certainty the talks between Adobe and Vista Equity will lead to a deal, the sources cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
Adobe and Vista Equity declined to comment, while Marketo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Adobe, which has a market capitalization of $130 billion, has topped analysts' profit and revenue estimates for the past eight quarters, driven by strength in its digital media business, which houses its flagship product Creative Cloud. 
The San Jose, California-based company has been actively exploring possible acquisitions. In May, it agreed to buy e-commerce services provider Magento Commerce from private equity firm Permira for $1.68 billion, in a move to bolster its Experience Cloud business.

Marketo was started in 2006 as an email marketing service and is based in San Mateo, California. Last year, it generated revenue of approximately $321 million, according to credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc.

1660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 01:40AM ET</span>",Trump's Trade War Hurting U.S. and European Companies in China,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade dispute between the U.S. and China is hurting U.S. and European companies operating in China, with firms planning to cut investment as manufacturing costs increase and demand for products drop.
American companies warned that an escalation could cause even greater pain, according to an Aug. 29 to Sept. 5 survey of more than 430 American companies conducted by AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai. The polling found that more than 60 percent of the firms were hurt by the initial round of tariffs between the two governments, with 74 percent foreseeing harm from future U.S. tariffs and 68 percent from potential Chinese retaliatory duties.
The U.S. and China have engaged in a series of tit-for-tat tariffs since July, when President Donald Trump started slapping duties on $50 billion of Chinese imports. Trump raised the stakes last week, announcing he’s willing to impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods, on top of a proposed $200 billion his administration is already considering. China has said it would be forced to retaliate to all of the U.S. measures.
With the new round of trade barriers, “the U.S. administration runs the risk of a downward spiral of attack and counter attack, benefiting no one,” said William Zarit, chairman of AmCham China.
Short-Term Pain
Trump administration officials counter that the short-term pain of its trade dispute will become worth it when China agrees to buy more American-made products and better shield U.S. companies from intellectual-property theft. They say previous strategies of prolonged negotiations with Beijing failed to protect American companies and workers.
But the AmCham survey underscores the damage that trade barriers could impose on economies in both countries by denting production, boosting prices and slowing investment. The U.S. Federal Reserve in a monthly survey published Wednesday also said American companies are growing increasingly concerned about the fallout from a trade war.
Respondents of the AmCham survey were primarily in manufacturing, with automotive, machinery and chemical producers expected to take the biggest hit from future tariffs. Profit losses, higher manufacturing costs and decreased product demand were some of the biggest downsides of the tariffs, according to the report. Nearly one-third of respondents are considering delaying or canceling investments, especially those in the agribusiness industry.
“This survey affirms our concerns: tariffs are already negatively impacting U.S. companies and the imposition of a proposed $200 billion tranche will bring a lot more pain,” said Eric Zheng, chairman of AmCham Shanghai.
Seventeen percent of respondents to a separate survey of European companies reported they were delaying investment and expansion, while 5 percent were moving production out of the U.S. and almost 7 percent were shifting output from China.
""While only a small percentage of European firms in China have taken drastic measures, like relocating or changing suppliers, these represent worrisome trends to what is currently only a portion of the possible additional tariffs being considered by the U.S. and the subsequent potential responses from the Chinese,"" according to the report.
Almost 54 percent of the 193 companies surveyed in the report saw the U.S. tariffs as negative for business, while almost 43 percent said the Chinese retaliation was. The survey was conducted by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China through Sept. 3."
1661,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 01:21AM ET</span>",Canada's maturing Big Weed hits up Europe hoping for expansion cash,"By Nichola Saminather and Simon Jessop
TORONTO/LONDON (Reuters) - A favorite of DIY stock pickers, Canadian cannabis firms are trying to bolster their institutional investor base by ramping up efforts to woo European funds as countries across the region approve marijuana for medical use.
For some time companies including Canopy Growth (TO:WEED), Aurora Cannabis  (TO:ACB) and  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) have been signing export deals with European governments, buying local companies, even opening production facilities in the region.
This year, they have also stepped up pitching their businesses to European funds at conferences and road shows, betting their size and first-mover advantage will help replace fickle retail investors with more stable institutions.
Canada was one of the first countries to approve medical marijuana in 2001, and legal recreational sales will begin inOctober.
Until now, though, Canadian firms have had little success in drawing institutional investors because of high valuations and lingering concerns about the future and legitimacy of the industry - particularly in the United States.
Executives say institutions are moving cautiously and acknowledge it will take time before their efforts translate into substantial investments, but cite some early results.
For example, while Tilray's Nasdaq initial public offering in July primarily went to North American investors, 12 percent of the $153-million offer was taken up by funds from London, Frankfurt, Sydney and Hong Kong.
Brendan Kennedy, chief executive of Seattle-based private equity firm Privateer Holdings, which remains Tilray's majority owner, said he met with more than 200 institutions, many inEurope, ahead of the listing.
""Some of the investors who participated in the IPO, they would've been unimaginable eight years ago, of course, but a year ago as well,"" Kennedy told Reuters.
One of those to take part, albeit with a symbolic stake, was global investment house Fidelity International, which bought around 0.15 percent of Tilray shares across several funds.
Canopy's latest financing deal, a C$500 million ($384.44million) convertible debt offering in June, was only pitched to institutions and drew about 60, mostly new investors, with a third coming from Europe, Chief Executive Bruce Linton told Reuters.
A significant shift toward a more institutional and diverse investor base, however, has yet to happen.
A Reuters analysis of publicly available shareholder data shows Canopy has just four Europe-based active investors that use a common long-term investing strategy, in contrast to 102for  Goldcorp  (TO:G), a similarly valued Toronto-listed stock. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PuJuX0)
Still, investors, organizers and executives say this year's events mark a step up both in turnout and a shift to institutions compared with recent years when European conferences would primarily draw retail investors.
Michael Barnes, professor of neurological rehabilitation at the University of Newcastle and chief medical officer at Scythian Biosciences (CD:SCYB), said plans to relax rules later this year in Britain, home to many of Europe's top investors, could unlock institutional demand. ""I think we're close to a tipping point.""
In February, Canadian financial services firm CanaccordGenuity hosted Britain's first medical cannabis conference in London aimed solely at investors and attended by more than 100 fund managers, family office representatives and wealthy individuals. Three months later, another conference organized by advisory firm Prohibition Partners with Canaccord as one of the lead sponsors drew 450 participants, according to the organizer.
""A couple of months in cannabis is like two years in most industries,"" said Tristan Gervais, who leads Canaccord Genuity’s cannabis investment banking and corporate broking in Britain and Europe.
DIFFERENT KIND OF CASH
On the face of it, Canadian cannabis firms do not need cash. In anticipation of a surge in sales after October and more medical marijuana approvals worldwide, the valuations of the five biggest Canadian companies have soared to about C$43billion, even though most have yet to turn a profit. Yet most shares are held by retail investors, which brings price volatility that complicates planning and expansion. 
""It's smart strategy to... bring in institutions who will be with us as we expand,"" said Cam Battley, Aurora's chief commercial officer. 
Aurora last year bought Pedanios, which supplies marijuana to German pharmacies, and also operates in Denmark and Italy. Canopy has operations and partnerships in Germany, Spain and Denmark. 
For now, North American investors remain the main source of institutional capital. 
Despite a federal ban, the United States is also by far the biggest legal market, accounting for almost 90 percent of the$9.5 billion in global sales in 2017, according to research firms Arcview Group and BDS Analytics. 
But Europe, projected to become the world's largest medical cannabis market by 2028, could become a key source of funding. 
Over 20 European countries allow medical marijuana, providing incentives to invest in Canadian firms, which account for the majority of operating licenses in Europe and about 70percent of its imports, according to Prohibition Partners. 
The group predicts annual sales in Europe will reach 116billion euros ($131.9 billion) by 2028, with growth of 40percent a year. 
Prohibition Partners' founder Stephen Murphy said the Cannabis Europa conference attracted alongside fund managers also executives from sectors such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare and insurance. 
Constellation Brands (N:STZ), a U.S. producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits, set a high bar when it raised its stake in Canopy by $4 billion in August. 
Among European investors to take their first step this year is Felix Wintle, fund manager of the London-based15-million-pound ($19.54 million) VT Tyndall North AmericanFund. 
Wintle said the fund had about 3 percent of its portfolio invested in Canopy Growth and Tilray, though lofty valuations made it tough to justify buying more. 

""It's a fascinating time for the sector because ... you're coming off prohibition, basically,"" he said. ""You don't often get opportunities like this.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment firm iM Global Partner bought a stake in Dynamic Beta investments, a U.S. firm that tries to duplicate large hedge funds' strategies but for far lower fees.
Paris-based iM Global Partner, which provides distribution and regulatory support to boutique investment firms, now owns 45 percent of New York-based Dynamic Beta, which recently changed its name from Beachhead Capital, the two companies said on Thursday.
For iM Global the acquisition marks a deeper push into the U.S. market while it offers Dynamic Beta access to potential investors as appetite for alternative assets is growing.
Worried that traditional stock and bond portfolios will not be able to secure returns needed for retirement, all types of investors are clamoring for alternatives that promise to earn them more but charge less than hedge funds. 
Hedge funds often require a minimum investment of $1 million, collect fees that equal 20 percent of the profits, and have delivered lackluster returns in the last five years, largely lagging the stock market's strong gains. 
Over the years, demand for portfolios that try to imitate hedge funds has picked up, prompting investment firms from Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to create a range of products from liquid alternatives, which allow investors to withdraw their money daily, to replication funds.
Dynamic Beta has offered its portfolios for 11 years, allowing investors with as little as $10,000 to invest, and says it has outperformed hedge funds by one third over that time.
""Since 2007, we have demonstrated that we can deliver the diversification benefits of hedge funds without high fees, gating/suspension risk, and single manager risk,"" said Andrew Beer, Dynamic Beta's managing director.
Dynamic Beta's 11 year track record appealed to iM Global's taste for firms that have long performance histories. In July, iM Global bought a piece of Boston-based hedge fund firm Sirios Capital and previously it invested in Polen Capital, based in Boca Raton, Florida, and Dolan McEniry Capital Management, a Chicago-based corporate bond manager.
A number of investment firms, including Affiliated Managers, specialize in buying stakes in investment management firms to help them broaden their appeal to investors.

WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Hurricane Florence, growing in size despite its weakening winds on Wednesday, crept closer to the U.S. East Coast as disaster mobilizations expanded south from the Carolinas into Georgia to counter the deadly threat of high seas and floods.
The center of Florence, no longer classified as a major hurricane but still posing a grave threat to life and property, is expected to strike North Carolina's southern coast on Friday, then drift southwest along the shoreline before moving inland on Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.
(GRAPHIC: Hurricane Florence heads toward Carolinas - https://tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5m1v)
The storm's maximum sustained winds were clocked late on Wednesday at 110 miles per hour (175 kph), down from a peak of 140 mph a day earlier, before it was downgraded to a Category 3, then a Category 2, on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of wind strength.
""While Florence has weakened below major hurricane intensity, the wind field of the hurricane continues to grow in size,"" the NHC said in its latest bulletin.
A long stretch of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard remained vulnerable to hurricane and tropical storm conditions, from Georgia north through the Carolinas into Virginia. And Florence remained capable of unleashing rain-fueled catastrophic flooding of rivers and low-lying areas across a wide region.
""The time to prepare is almost over,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a morning news conference. ""Disaster is at the doorstep and it's coming in.""
Besides inundating the coast with wind-driven storm surges of seawater as high as 13 feet (4 meters) along the Carolina coast, Florence could dump 20 to 30 inches (51-76 cm) of rain, with up to 40 inches in parts of North Carolina, the NHC said.
Downpours and flooding would be especially severe, lasting for days, if the storm stalls over land. Heavy rains were forecast to extend into the Appalachians, affecting parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia.
Tens of thousands of homes and businesses could be flooded in North Carolina alone, Governor Cooper warned.
Georgia Governor Nathan Deal issued an emergency declaration for all 159 counties in his state. Similar declarations were made earlier in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia.
More than 1 million people have been ordered to evacuate the coastlines of the Carolinas and Virginia. By late Wednesday, authorities in North Carolina reported nearly 7,000 evacuees staying in 71 emergency shelters throughout the state.
MILLIONS IN HARM'S WAY
An estimated 10 million people live in areas expected to be placed under a hurricane or storm advisory, according to the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.
Emergency preparations included activating more than 2,700 National Guard troops, stockpiling food, setting up shelters, switching traffic patterns so major roads led away from shore, and securing 16 nuclear power reactors in the Carolinas and Virginia.
The U.S. Coast Guard said it closed the ports of Wilmington and Moorehead City in North Carolina and restricted port operations in Charleston, South Carolina. All seven of North Carolina's ferry routes were shut down. 
Utility officials have warned that widespread power outages are likely and that it could take weeks to restore electricity.
Wilmington, just north of where Florence appeared headed for shore, grew empty and quiet on Wednesday.
""I'm not approaching Florence from fear or panic,"" said Brad Corpening, 35, who planned to ride out the storm in his boarded-up delicatessen in Wilmington. ""It's going to happen. We just need to figure out how to make it through.""
Officials in New Hanover County, which includes Wilmington, have stockpiled enough food and water for 60,000 people for four days, along with more than 28,000 tarps. Shelters in the city were filling and some people were being bused inland to Raleigh, even though some residents there were told they might have to evacuate because of flooding.

""It's going to be bad,"" said Woody White, a county commissioner. ""But no matter how bad it's going to be, it will pass and our job will be to rebuild this community together.""

1665,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>","Asia Tech Stocks Diverge From U.S., With Biggest Gap Since 1998","(Bloomberg) -- Asia tech stocks may have halted their slump, but this year is proving to be a pretty bad one for them.
While the sector has had a tendency to move in tandem with its U.S. counterpart, 2018 is shaping up very differently: the MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology Index has slumped 11 percent, while its S&P 500 Index version has rallied 17 percent. That’s the biggest performance gap since 1998.
The culprits: internet behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd., the biggest company on the Asian gauge, has lost more than $100 billion in value since January amid concerns over the sustainability of earnings from its lucrative games business. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., the second-largest stock, saw almost $40 billion vanish because of weakening memory-chip demand.
Even U.S.-listed  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings Ltd. -- not included in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index -- has dropped more than 6 percent this year.
While Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s growth plans still play a role in the performance of suppliers in Asia, company-specific news and the impact of industry demand have clearly become front and center for the region’s tech giants.
What’s more, the future of U.S.-China trade is going to be key.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts led by Shawn Kim recommended in July investors lower their exposure to tech shares in the near term amid trade-related risks and a lack of earnings upside.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology Index is trading at about 13.5 times estimated earnings for the next year, the least since March 2016 and more than 35 percent lower than its S&P 500 counterpart. In the past two decades, the Asian and U.S. gauges have moved in tandem every year except for 2015 and 2011.

1667,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 10:42PM ET</span>",Asian Stock Markets Mixed as US Seeks to De-escalate Trade Tensions ,"Investing.com – Asian equity markets opened mixed on Thursday morning as Washington proposed a new round of trade talks with Beijing that could help to de-escalate a trade war between the two.
U.S. officials, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently invited counterparts in China to Washington.
On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said the country is taking a tough stance on China. Last Friday, Trump threatened to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese goods.
“It’s[the trade talk] a positive thing. We are in communication right now and you could say that communication has picked up a notch,” said Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council.
The Trump administration has sought to pressure China to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. and protect intellectual property rights of American companies. Washington has imposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese exports since July, which triggered retaliation from Beijing.
Overnight, the potential trade talks helped support the U.S. stock market, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.04% and Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.11%. Tech stocks remained troubled. Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced new iPhones, tech stocks closed 1% lower.
Chipmakers dropped as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Stifel downgraded a few companies amidst industry concerns, offsetting the gains from the cheerful mood, leaving Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.23%.
China’s stock market opened higher, with the Shanghai Composite rising 0.23% at 10:44PM ET (02:44 GMT) but the technology-heavy SZSE Component climbed 0.11%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, which has been gripped by a bearish trend, jumped 1.33%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.79% and South Korea’s KOSPI also rose 0.13%. Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.52%.
Australia is due to release its employment data on Thursday, while the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will reach policy decisions on Thursday afternoon."
1668,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Australia's Employment Surges as Signal of Faster Wages Emerges,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian employment jumped by more than twice economists’ estimates in August as a key indicator of potential faster wage growth dropped to a five-year low.
Underutilization -- a sum of unemployment and underemployment which provides a better insight into the labor market’s overall health -- fell to 13.4 percent, the lowest level since June 2013, the statistics bureau said in Sydney. The central bank has kept interest rates at a record low to drive investment and hiring to such a point that employers are forced to offer higher wages.
“August was an outstanding month for the Australian labor market,” said economist Callam Pickering of global jobs site Indeed, who previously worked at the Reserve Bank. “The underutilization measure is more highly correlated to wage growth than the traditional unemployment rate. So this development is a welcome one for future wage growth. Although we still have a long way to go.”
The RBA is struggling for inflation drivers as the government tries to push down power prices ahead of an election and tobacco excise rises come to an end; that leaves wages as the best option to fuel consumer-price growth and set the stage for the first interest-rate increase since 2010.
Australia’s jobless rate -- a key metric for the Reserve Bank -- has ground lower this year, even as hiring eased from the red-hot pace of 2017. Economic growth jumped to a six-year high in the second quarter and policy makers hope record-low interest rates will keep driving that rapid expansion to tighten the labor market and help rekindle inflation. That would potentially clear the path for the first rate hike since 2010, though traders see little prospect of a move in the next 12 months.
“From a Reserve Bank perspective, they will view this as an extremely positive jobs report,” Pickering said. “It probably doesn’t change the near-term likelihood of a rate hike but it certainly points to an economy that is heading in the right direction.”

The deal is expected ""to be accretive"" to Hershey's financial targets as the company delves into the more than $2.5 billion cheese puffs market, Hershey said in a statement.
Hershey has been diversifying its business by adding more snacks to its portfolio as more American consumers opt for healthier snacks over sugary candies and chocolates.
Last year, the Kisses chocolate maker bought Amplify Snack Brands for $921 million, helping it expand its range of offerings, adding products such as SkinnyPop popcorn and Paqui tortilla chips to its portfolio. Hershey also bought beef jerky maker Krave in 2015.
Pirate Brands, which B&G Foods bought in 2013, will operate within Hershey's snack unit Amplify.
B&G Foods said it would use the net proceeds from the sale for repaying its long-term debt and funding possible acquisitions.
Hershey intends to finance the transaction with cash reserves as well as short-term borrowings and expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2018.

After the deal was announced, B&G Foods rose nearly 1 percent to $32.15 and Hershey shares were inactive in after-hours trading.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Brazil candidate Gomes would reduce banking concentration,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Center-left populist presidential candidate Ciro Gomes vowed on Wednesday to reduce concentration in Brazil's banking sector if elected in October, warning that he would open the sector up to more foreign competition if necessary.
Gomes said 85 percent the country's bank transactions were in the hands of five banks: Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF.UL), Santander (SA:SANB11), Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4) and Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4). 
By contrast, he said, the United States has ""thousands"" of banks competing by offering lower fees and interest rates to win more customers.
""The concentration here is criminal ... I want to do this to protect Brazil's financial system. If they don't understand, I will have to open the door to international banks and I don't want to do that,"" he said before a panel of journalists.
Gomes, who has moved up to second place this week in polls of voter intentions, explained his plan to help the 63 million people listed as delinquent debtors by Brazil's SPC Credit Reporting Agency.
If the banks offered discounted credit to individuals, the government would ask the central bank to reduce their reserve requirement, he said.
""Not a cent of public money will be spent and people will have the protection of the government to refinance their debt on civilized terms, he said.
The relief plan has been music to the ears of heavily-indebted Brazilians and contributed to his improved polling, though he trails far behind front-runner, the far right candidate Jair Bolsonaro.
The polls, however, show Bolsonaro losing against most of his main adversaries in a second-round run-off.
With popular former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva banned from running due to a corruption conviction, Gomes could well make the run-off and beat Bolsonaro, analysts say.
Gomes, who has touted his record for fiscal discipline as two-time governor Ceará, vowed to protect Brazilian industry, and pointed out that U.S. President Donald Trump was doing just that slapping import tariffs on steel and aluminum and other imports from China.

The candidate was interviewed by reporters from O Globo and Valor Economico newspapers and Epoca news magazine.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",U.S. regulator votes to end stricter oversight of Zions Bancorp,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. regulatory panel gave final approval on Wednesday to ease oversight of  Zions Bancorp  (O:ZION) after the Utah bank simplified its operations, deciding that the bank no longer should be classified as potentially posing a threat to the financial system.
The Financial Stability Oversight Council decided to no longer designate the bank as a ""systemically important financial institution"" (SIFI), freeing it from stricter scrutiny by the Federal Reserve.
The move to remove the designation, which followed preliminary approval by the FSOC in July, could mark the beginning of a concerted effort by regulators to ease oversight of all but the nation's largest banks.
The regulatory panel, which is chaired by the Treasury secretary and charged with monitoring broad threats to the financial system, has the ability to identify firms as systemically significant, subjecting them to stricter oversight, including stronger capital rules.
That power was given to regulators as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in the wake of the financial crisis, which automatically labeled banks with over $50 billion in assets as SIFIs. A new law approved by Congress in May raised that threshold to $250 billion.
Banks under $100 billion were immediately relieved of systemic status. The Federal Reserve has until November 2019 to reduce oversight of banks under $250 billion, which carves out all but roughly a dozen of the nation's biggest banks. Zions had asked regulators for relief before Congress increased the SIFI threshold.
The Fed reserves the ability to more closely scrutinize smaller banks under the new law.
Zions has roughly $65 billion in assets. It solicited less stringent regulatory treatment after announcing plans to shed its bank holding company and simplify its structure.
Wednesday's vote finalizes the FSOC's preliminary approval, pending the completion of Zions' merger with its holding company.

1. CPI Numbers on Tap
Retail inflation data leads tomorrow’s economic calendar after a government report showed today a surprise drop in wholesale prices for last month.
The Labor Department will release the consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the CPI rose 0.3% in August from the month before, with year-on-year growth of 2.8%.
The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% for the month and 2.4% year on year.
In addition, central bank watchers will also get decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.
The BoE is widely expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision at 7:00 AM ET (11:00 GMT). The ECB is also expected to hold. Its decision comes out at 7:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT).
2. Kroger, Adobe Set to Report
There will be some numbers for investors to assess the food retail sector as supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) reports earnings before the bell.
Analysts are forecasting a profit of 37 cents per share on sales of about $28 billion.
The numbers will have to be strong to impress Wall Street, with the stock up solidly over the last three months and close to a 52-week high.
After the close, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) weighs in with its latest results.
Analysts predict a profit of $1.68 per share, on revenue of $2.25 billion.
Adobe shares are close to its all-time high.
3. Hurricane Florence Approaches East Coast
Energy and stock investors will be watching for updates as Hurricane Florence heads towards landfall.
The hurricane is expected to deliver tropical storm winds to the Carolinas starting 12:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT) tomorrow and hurricane-force winds by late that evening, according to CNN.
President Donald Trump has warned those in the path of the hurricane to evacuate.
The storm’s path is not taking it toward the oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. But it is expected to deliver one of the strongest blows to the East Coast in years.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.11%. The S&P 500 rose 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.23%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its product line of shiny new products, including a trio of new iPhones, to much fanfare. But that did little to prevent the tech giant's shares closing 1% lower.
Apple’s new iPhone product line includes: the iPhone XR starting at $749, iPhone Xs starting at $999 and iPhone Xs Max starting at $1,099. The cheaper iPhone XR was priced lower than the $849 analysts had expected.
The iPhone XR will be shipped later than the traditional two weeks after the event, leading some to question whether the delay was a consequence of production issues or a deliberate decision to help support sales of its pricier iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.
While Apple's mammoth grip over tech ensured the sector closed in the red, Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) 4% surge limited downside momentum. Apple's failure to announce a streaming or original content service eased investor worries that the iPhone maker was set to encroach on Netflix's turf.
The broader averages were also helped by renewed hopes for an end to the U.S.-China trade war on a report the countries would restart trade negotiations.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sent a letter to Chinese officials to propose trade talks in the next few weeks, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The talks would take place before the Trump administration implements additional tariffs on Chinese imports, according to the report.
Progress on the U.S.-China trade front represents a remarkable turn of events as both countries have recently vowed to slap additional tariffs on each other.
China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) Tuesday it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States. President Donald Trump said last week he was ready to impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion of Chinese imports.
Industrial heavyweights such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), both of which have huge exposure to China, closed higher for the day.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, released Wednesday, showed that uncertainty over trade continued to spook domestic businesses as they cooled plans to ramp up capital spending.
""Businesses generally remained optimistic about the near-term outlook, though most Districts noted concern and uncertainty about trade tensions -- particularly though not only among manufacturers. A number of Districts noted that such concerns had prompted some businesses to scale back or postpone capital investment,"" according to the book.
Energy, meanwhile, also pushed the broader averages higher as oil prices rose, following a large draw in U.S. crude supplies and a drop in output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose 1.6% to settle at $70.37 a barrel.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 04:09PM ET</span>","Volvo shows off self-driving, electric truck with no cab","By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - Sweden's Volvo, the world's second-biggest truck maker, presented a new self-driving electric truck on Wednesday, which it said should help respond to the boom in ecommerce and a shortage of freight drivers.
Volvo said the truck, which does not have a driver's cab, was still under development and declined to say when it would be available commercially. It expects the vehicle to be deployed first in places like ports and large logistics centers. 
""We believe there will be a driver behind the steering wheel for the foreseeable future, but we will pretty soon see self-drive commercial vehicles in confined areas,"" Lars Stenqvist, Volvo chief technology officer, told a conference in Berlin.
Trucking is viewed by transport experts as a natural application for self-driving technology because of the relative predictability of highways compared with busy city streets.
The cabless truck - which Volvo calls Vera and can pull loads weighing up to 32 tonnes - can be attached to any standard trailer, Michael Karlsson, head of autonomous solutions at Volvo Trucks, said after the vehicle was unveiled.
""Vera means faith and we have faith in the future,"" Karlsson said, adding the vehicle has a lower operating speed than a normal truck for safety reasons.
Guests at the presentation were made to stand behind a barrier as the truck drove out unaided from a tent and were only allowed to approach when it came to a stop.
The 1.4-million member International Brotherhood of Teamsters union is campaigning against new U.S. rules to speed the deployment of self-driving trucks, warning they could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and hit road safety.
However, trucking firms in many countries are finding it harder to attract and retain drivers amid tight labor markets.
Karlsson said the truck would allow places like ports that are currently dependent on daytime working hours to run round-the-clock, optimizing the flows of goods and potentially cutting down on stockpiles and increasing productivity.
He expects autonomous technology to increase the need for skilled drivers, while cutting down on the need for people to perform repetitive tasks.
New technologies which have been disrupting the traditional auto industry are also affecting the truck and heavy equipment industry, as electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is expanding into electric trucks, announcing last year it planned to start producing a heavy-duty model by 2019.
However, ride hailing firm Uber [UBER.UL] said in July it would stop developing self-driving trucks, seeking to focus its autonomous-vehicle technology solely on cars.

Volvo, whose largest shareholder is China's Geely Holding [GEELY.UL], and truck industry rivals such as Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have been benefiting from robust demand in all major commercial vehicles markets.

The two-paragraph internal memo from CBS News president David Rhodes, which was seen by Reuters, said that Fager's departure ""is not directly related to the allegations surfaced in press reports, which continue to be investigated independently.""
CBS Corp (N:CBS) Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves resigned on Sunday amid a new wave of allegations against him of sexual assault and harassment uncovered in two New Yorker stories in the past two months. 
In the New Yorker report, Fager is accused of inappropriate touching and of tolerating an abusive culture.
CBS said on Monday that it would pay $120 million to former Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves if an internal investigation into allegations of harassment fails to provide grounds for his dismissal.
Rhodes said Fager violated company policy but did not specify the policy. 
In a statement to CBS News, Fager said his contract was terminated ""for a harsh text I sent to a CBS employee.""

Fager did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 03:54PM ET</span>",Tesla investor says SEC asked it about 'funding secured' tweet,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) biggest institutional investor said on Wednesday it was questioned by U.S. securities regulators about Elon Musk's now-abandoned plans to take the electric carmaker private and that the chief executive needed help running the company.
""He needs help, and I mean that psychologically as much as practically,"" said asset manager Baillie Gifford's James Anderson, the fund manager of Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which owns Tesla shares. 
Anderson told Reuters he has talked with Musk about the idea of bringing in another executive. Analysts have been calling for Tesla to add a chief operating officer or other new blood to top management.
Tesla, whose shares were up 3.1 percent in afternoon trading after earlier being up 4.5 percent, could not immediately be reached to comment. SEC officials also could not immediately be reached. 
The last few months have been tumultuous and chaotic for Tesla and its eclectic CEO. While Tesla was wrestling to ramp up production of its mass-market electric Model 3 sedan, on Aug. 7 Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private at $420 per share and that funding was ""secured."" 
On the evening of Aug. 24, a Friday, Musk, by then facing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny into the factual accuracy of his financing tweet, blogged that Tesla would remain public, citing investor resistance.
Musk was ""getting there"" on the idea of accepting more help in running the company, Anderson said. 
Anderson said that he had suggested to Musk his tweets are ""not a great thing"" and added that the firm had been talking to the SEC about Musk's proposal and financing claims. 
""I don’t know what they’ll do with him, but there’s no implication that we’ve done anything wrong,"" Anderson said in an interview at the firm's London office. ""I think quite naturally they wanted to know whether major shareholders had any lead indication or knowledge of the tweet about ‘funding secured.’""
The next two largest Tesla institutional shareholders, T. Rowe Price Group (O:TROW) and Fidelity Investments, both declined to comment on whether they have spoken with the SEC about Tesla.
Anderson said he had spoken with Musk twice and was arranging to speak with the company's board. 
Anderson added that the media coverage around the going-private comments has not shaken his belief in Tesla or its ""extraordinary"" CEO.
""We think there is a decent chance that they can prove to be an extremely profitable, competitively advantaged company which will produce high returns,"" Anderson said.
Musk has said that Tesla should become profitable in the second half of the year.

Tesla may need to raise more capital and would have a better idea of its needs in the next few months, Anderson said, adding he would support such a move.

Apple’s new iPhone product line includes: the iPhone XR starting at $749, iPhone Xs starting at $999 and iPhone Xs Max starting at $1,099. Apple's price points for both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs matched Wall Street's estimates. The cheaper iPhone XR was priced lower than the $849 analysts had expected.
Heading into the event, analysts cited the price of the Apple's iPhone XR would be one of the highlights as a lower-priced iPhone could underpin consumer demand and boost unit sales.
The iPhone Xs and Xs Max will be available for pre-order on Friday. They will ship on Sept. 21. The iPhone XR will be available for pre-order on Oct. 19 and ship a week later.
Apple's stock rose as the tech giant introduced its Apple Watch 4, with new features focusing on health, including an ECG app. But shares turned lower during the iPhone presentations, which some traders attributed to algorithmic selling on the news right as iPhone details began to be released.
The “iPhone Xs Max delivers a more immersive experience with over 3 million pixels for videos, movies and games, offering the largest display ever in an iPhone in a footprint similar to iPhone 8 Plus,” the company said.
Shares were down most of the day ahead of the presentation, but had climbed more than 2% in the previous session."
1699,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",COLUMN: U.S. government seeks to help small-business workers save for retirement,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Carrot or stick?
Both approaches have advocates when it comes to a critical retirement security goal: getting more workers at small businesses to save for retirement.
The carrot strategy calls for making it easier for small employers to offer 401(k) accounts to workers by reducing cost and administrative burden. The stick is a possible requirement that small employers who do not offer their own plans allow workers to contribute to government-sponsored Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
A growing number of states have been tackling the small-business coverage problem by creating these auto-IRA plans - and the stick is rather small. In most cases, employers above a certain size are required to set up automatic payroll deduction for workers. Employers are not required to make matching contributions or to administer the plans. (https://reut.rs/2yJl975)
But President Donald Trump announced his support recently for the carrot - a concept known as open multiple-employer plans, or MEPs. Trump signed an executive order late last month directing the government to consider ways to liberalize rules governing these retirement plans, which already enjoy bipartisan backing in Congress and strong support from the financial services industry.
The executive order also directs the U.S. Department of Treasury to review the formulas to determine how much retirees must withdraw from tax-deferred accounts annually, with an eye toward letting them keep more of their savings longer. 
What exactly constitutes a ""small business"" varies depending on industry and other factors, with some definitions capping the number of employees at 1,500 and others at just 10.
So what is an open MEP, and why might we need them? 
Data shows that workers at small businesses are far less likely to be offered a 401(k) plan than their counterparts at larger companies. Just 28 percent of U.S. firms with fewer than 10 employees offered workers a plan in 2012, according to research by the Social Security Administration. The coverage numbers were higher for companies with 25 to 49 workers (63 percent) and those with 50-99 workers (73 percent). By comparison, 87 percent of firms with 100 or more workers offered their workers a 401(k) plan.
At present, MEPs can be offered only to companies in the same industry or profession; the executive order directs the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Treasury to issue new rules making it easier for small businesses from diverse industries to join open MEPs.
The open-MEP idea has been gaining bipartisan support in Congress - it is a key component of the proposed Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act (RESA). (https://reut.rs/2wY7Y3h)
""Basically, we will be trying to find policy ideas that will help make joining a 401(k) plan a more attractive proposition for small employers, to the ultimate benefit to their employees,” Preston Rutledge, assistant secretary of labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration, told reporters on a recent conference call.
Major business organizations representing the financial services industry have been pushing open MEPs aggressively, in part as the alternative approach to the state-sponsored plans, which they view as inferior to the 401(k) plans they operate for employers. And the Trump administration backed them up. Last year, it successfully promoted legislation that reversed an earlier Labor Department rule that established guidelines for state and local governments to set up the plans. 
Carrot and stick both have their place in boosting the availability of retirement plans at small firms, argues John Scott, director of retirement savings at the Pew Charitable Trusts. “These are complementary ideas,” he said in an interview. He views the state auto IRA plans as good starter accounts for workers. Oregon was the first out the gate with a plan and eight other states - including California and Illinois - are getting ready to launch.
The plans enroll workers by default unless they opt out. Initial contribution levels range from 3 to 5 percent, with contributions invested in low-cost target date funds. But they lack some of the most attractive features offered by large employers' plans, such as matching contributions and higher annual contribution limits. This year, you can contribute $5,500 to an IRA ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), but the contribution limit for employees to 401(k) accounts is $18,500.
TWEAKING REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS
The executive order also calls for a review of the formulas used to determine the amount of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred retirement accounts. When you reach age 70-1/2, a certain amount of your tax-deferred savings in IRAs and most 401(k) accounts must be drawn down every year under the RMD rules. And younger people need may need to take RMDs on inherited IRAs.
Missing an RMD leaves you on the hook for an onerous 50 percent tax penalty, plus interest, on the amounts you failed to draw on time. Income taxes must be paid on the withdrawn funds, and RMDs also can trigger additional taxes on Social Security income and even high income Medicare premium surcharges (https://reut.rs/2O56D1X).
The order directs the U.S. Treasury to consider whether the tables should be revised in light of rising longevity (the life expectancy tables were last revised in 2002). Meanwhile, average life expectancy for men aged 70 and above has risen 2.1 years since 2000, and 1.6 years for women, according to the Society of Actuaries. That means any revisions likely would have a very small impact on the amounts retirees must withdraw - no more than a few hundred dollars annually in most cases.
“The RMDs aren’t that big to start with,” said Ed Slott, an author and retirement expert. ""Unless you’re talking about a mega-IRA, adjusting the tables for higher longevity won’t shave off even a percentage point in the amount you must take.”
Some proposals for reform of RMDs would go further than reviewing the longevity assumptions. This week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives called for elimination of RMDs from accounts with $50,000 or less as part of a broader set of tax cuts billed as “Tax Reform 2.0” (https://reut.rs/2OdMSW7).
