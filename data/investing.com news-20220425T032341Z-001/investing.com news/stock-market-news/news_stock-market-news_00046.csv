The S&P 500 fell 17 points, or 0.64%, as of 9:31 AM ET (14:31 GMT), while the Dow lost 171 points, or 0.68%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite decreased 66 points, or 0.90%.
The European Commission lowered its growth forecast for the three biggest economies in the eurozone this year, highlighting a slowdown in China and spillovers from that country's trade conflict with the U.S.
The forecasts contrasted sharply to a drop in weekly jobless claims in the U.S., suggesting that economy is stable.
Technology stocks slumped after Twitter forecast first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv, and reported a drop in users for the fourth quarter. Twitter was down 10%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dipped 1.7% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) declined 1.8%, while Snap (NYSE:SNAP) tumbled 4%.
Elsewhere, SunTrust (NYSE:STI) jumped 11% after news that it was merging with BB&T (NYSE:BBT) in an all-stock merger worth $66 billion. The deal would make it the sixth-largest bank in the U.S. by assets.
And videogame stocks recovered, with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) up 1.7% and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) gaining 3%.
In commodities, gold futures fell 0.06% to $1,313.55 a troy ounce, while crude oil decreased 1.3% to $53.31 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.08% to 96.232."

Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto discussed diversification of Hungary's natural gas imports with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Wednesday, the ministry said on Thursday.
He asked Perry to do what he could to facilitate the start of production from Domino-1 which is controlled by Exxon and Romania's Petrom, a subsidiary of Austrian firm OMV.
Discovered off Romania in 2012 with estimated gas reserves of 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet, the companies have since sought greater clarity from Romanian authorities before developing the field.
Exxon said in January it was continuing to evaluate the project, pinning its final investment decision on factors including ""competitive and stable fiscal terms for existing offshore concessions for the duration of the agreements.""
OMV Chief Executive Rainer Seele said on Wednesday that the company was in dialogue with the Romanian government over the project, which is expected to cost a billion euros.
Szijjarto said it was in Hungary's strategic interest that the consortium make the investment required to produce the gas and that Hungary has access to this new source of energy.
Hungary could import the gas via a pipeline Romania is building from the Black Sea through an interconnector between the two countries, which will be capable of handling reverse flows, Szijjarto was quoted by the ministry as saying.
In November, Perry called on Hungary and its neighbors to reject Russian gas pipelines which Washington says are being used to cement Moscow's grip on central and eastern Europe.
Import-reliant Hungary gets most of its gas from Russia and Russian firm Rosatom is involved in a 12.5-billion-euro expansion of Hungary's Paks nuclear power plant, the country's main domestic source of electricity.

Last year Hungary agreed to buy 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia in 2020.

The FT said a report by a top law firm had revealed a pattern of suspected book-padding in Asia.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 09:11AM ET</span>","Coach owner Tapestry cuts forecast, shares drop 11 percent","(Reuters) - Tapestry Inc blamed falling tourist spending and a slowing global economy for a cut in its full-year forecast on Thursday, as it reported disappointing holiday numbers and lower sales of Kate Spade handbags.
Shares of the New York-based fashion house fell 11 percent after the company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings in a range of $2.55-$2.60 per share, down from its previous forecast of $2.75-$2.80.
Sales at Coach, whose handbags and accessories account for about 70 percent of the company's business, rose about 2 percent in the quarter to $1.25 billion. However, sales at Kate Spade, which it bought in 2017, fell 1.6 percent to $428 million.
""(Kate Spade's) comparable store sales were below our expectations, impacted by the lack of distinctive newness in the final collections from the prior design team,"" Tapestry Chief Executive Officer Victor Luis said.
""In light of our second quarter results and the uncertain global environment, we are updating our outlook,"" he added.
Spade, who built a fashion empire selling accessories that offered affordable luxury to younger working women, committed suicide in her New York apartment last June at the age of 55.
The resulting publicity helped drive a surge in sales in the months that followed. Sales at the brand jumped 21 percent in the company's first quarter that ended in September.
""Much of the momentum Kate Spade built up in the prior quarter simply fizzled out,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. ""(Kate Spade's) holiday assortment did not feel particularly compelling.""
Luis said initial signs of customer interest in new Kate Spade creative director Nicola Glass's first Spring collection were strong and that he was confident of returning to comparable sales growth.
Tapestry has been cutting down on promotions to boost brand value and sell more items at full prices, but the handbag maker resorted to discounting during the holiday season to draw customers amidst a busy and competitive shopping period.
The cuts in outlook contrasted with domestic rival Capri Holdings Ltd, formerly Michael Kors, which forecast strong growth in coming years on Wednesday.
Excluding items, Tapestry earned $1.07 per share in the second quarter ended Dec. 29, missing the average estimate of $1.11 per share.
Global comparable sales at established Coach stores rose just 1 percent, short of analysts' expectations of 1.7 percent.

Tapestry also said it expects full-year revenue to rise at a low-to-mid-single-digit rate compared with an earlier prediction of mid-single-digits.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>","With mood at rock bottom, wary investors put up with weak European earnings","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - A rebound in European stocks has been fueled by low expectations and valuations and belies the underlying health of corporate Europe.
After a terrible December, markets have had a buoyant start to the year. European stocks on Wednesday were up 11 percent from late December having lost 13 percent in 2018 - their worst year in a decade.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculated that shares of companies that beat estimates outperformed by 3 percent on average while those that missed underperformed by 1.8 percent - a clear positive skew.
Already braced for the worst, investors have been forgiving towards companies failing to deliver fourth-quarter results on target.
Chipmaker Infineon, for example, only fell 0.6 percent despite cutting its forecast for full-year revenue growth to the lower end of its 9-13 percent range.
""Markets are well aware that Q1 and Q2 will be difficult. But they also expect that H2 should be the better half of the year, showing some recovery,"" said Britta Weidenbach, head of European equities at DWS. 
""If markets are right, then we could be near the bottom.""
Valuations fell as markets tanked in December, limiting the downside for stocks.
European equities' price-to-earnings ratios were as low as 12.1 in January, the lowest since July 2013. They are now around 12.9, still historically very low and much lower than U.S. stocks trading on a multiple of 15.8.
""(Investors) are pricing in quite a bit of bad news. So I think the market is quite reasonably balanced now,"" said Graham Secker, head of European equity strategy at Morgan Stanley.
(Graphic: Valuations lowest in 5 1/2 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UGflGO)
HEALTH CHECK
Scratch the surface though and the latest earnings results show wide divergences within sectors - an indication investors are being picky rather than being encouraged by any macroeconomic factors.
The overall share of companies beating earnings expectations is the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2015, and the last time European companies mentioned a slowdown as much in their results was during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, according to Alphasense, a data analysis company. 
The positive share price reactions were most obvious in luxury and industrials, two sectors where angst about a slowdown in China had significantly dented expectations and valuations. 
French luxury conglomerate LVMH for example surged 6.9 percent after reporting sales growth of 9 percent, in line with forecasts.
Highly-valued shares in sectors like technology and consumer staples were punished for weak numbers.
Chipmaker AMS lost 12 percent after fourth-quarter profits sank, only to swing back 10 percent the following day, thanks to the forgiving mood of the market.
Consumer goods giant  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) tumbled 2 percent after reporting a disappointing sales performance, but quickly regained ground as stocks generally rallied.
Bank stocks were notable for being held back, Morgan Stanley's Secker said, as investors remain wary of the sector which tanked 30 percent in 2018.
""We're concerned in this cycle that banks are the value trap - it might be you're waiting for a leg up in bank stocks that never occurs,"" said James Bateman, chief investment officer of multi-asset at Fidelity
(Graphic: Earnings Chart Feb 6 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UKSiup)
COULD THE BEST BE OVER?
The recent rally has not stopped outflows from European equities: $9 billion has left the region so far this year after investors pulled more than $72 billion from European equity funds in 2018, more than any other region, EPFR fund flow data shows.
And there remains a big gap between bottom-up consensus earnings growth expectations - of 7.4 percent in 2019 - and top-down estimates by strategists based on macroeconomic models of roughly 1 percent, pointing to potential further earnings growth downgrades ahead.
""Your fundamental reasons to buy because of earnings or an increase in liquidity - those two elements are missing,"" said Manish Kabra, head of European equity and quant strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Company margins also make for uncomfortable reading.
For the third quarter in a row, margins are under pressure from higher labor and commodity costs. 
So far 56 percent of companies have beaten revenue estimates, while just 47 percent have beaten earnings estimates, Refinitiv data shows.
""Most companies are mentioning prices they struggle to pass on to customers,"" said Fabrice Theveneau, head of global equities at Lyxor Asset Management.
(Graphic: Margin Pressure Chart Feb 6 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UNGUOz)
With confusion over Brexit and European parliamentary elections in three months' time, the market continues to be dogged by political uncertainty and stocks may have a harder time climbing if earnings downgrades continue.
Indeed, those investors that sat this rally out may have missed all the gains they were likely to make this year in European equities, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
Morgan Stanley's Secker echoed this view: ""We've come up a reasonable amount now... it's a little bit like the easy money has been made and it's a bit of a tougher ask going forward.""

6,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:55AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Should Jeff Bezos’ Divorce Worry Amazon Investors?,"Investing.com - It's been an eventful start to the year for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.
The e-commerce giant reported fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 31 that beat analyst estimates, but it provided first-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations.
Amazon reported adjusted earnings of $6.04 per share on revenue of $72.38 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected adjusted earnings of $5.65 per share and revenue of $71.88 billion.
For the first quarter, Amazon said it expects revenue to be in the range of $56 billion to $60 billion, below analyst estimates of $61 billion.
The Amazon Echo Dot, voiced by the digital assistant called Alexa, was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally during the fourth quarter.
""The number of research scientists working on Alexa has more than doubled in the past year, and the results of the team's hard work are clear,"" Bezos said. ""In 2018, we improved Alexa's ability to understand requests and answer questions by more than 20% through advances in machine learning.""
Meanwhile, Jeff and his wife, MacKenzie, have announced plans to divorce after 25 years of marriage, according to a joint statement put out last month on the Amazon CEO's Twitter account.



The couple met and got married while working at D.E. Shaw, a New York-based hedge fund, in the early 90s. Shortly after, they packed up and moved across the country to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon.
In Amazon lore, part of the company's business plan was written while the couple drove across the country from New York to Seattle.
For Amazon investors, the divorce could be concerning.
Media reports have said that the couple did not sign a prenuptial agreement, which means the world's biggest individual fortune may be split in half and Mr. Bezos may lose direct control of half his Amazon stake.
Additionally, the split is expected to result in one of the most valuable settlements in history, since Mr. Bezos is the world's richest person with a net worth of about $137 billion.
Nearly all of Mr. Bezos' wealth comes from his 16% ownership in Amazon. The couple's properties include two homes in Beverly Hills; two homes in Medina, Washington; the largest home in Washington, DC; and a Texas ranch, according to The Wall Street Journal.

7,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Tyson Sales Miss Estimates as It Looks to BRF Deal to Expand,"(Bloomberg) --  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN)., the biggest U.S. meat processor, reported sales that missed analyst estimates on the same day the company said it would expand its global footprint by buying poultry plants in Asia and Europe.
The company’s pork sales volumes and prices decreased in the first quarter, according to a statement Thursday on earnings. While chicken volumes rose after acquisitions, sales prices still fell. Shares dropped in pre-market trading.
The meat giant has been battling lackluster market conditions for some time as a boom in American meat production has dragged prices lower. Tariffs from key trading partners, including China, further added to the glut amid pressure on U.S. exports. To combat the volatility, the company has pushed to expand its global presence while also focusing on offering more value-added products, like chicken nuggets. Earlier Thursday, Tyson said it is purchasing six facilities from Brazil’s BRF SA for $340 million, including operations in Asia and the U.K.
Commodity companies have struggled to boost profits as changing tastes and a fast-paced lifestyle mean consumers prefer specialty items and easy-to-cook meals. That’s pushed Tyson and its rivals to focus on products such as pre-cut meat. In 2017 and 2018, Tyson spent more than $7 billion on takeovers, including a $2.5 billion deal to buy chicken-nugget maker Keystone Foods.
Earlier this week, CNBC reported Tyson held talks to buy closely held meat company Foster Farms for about $2 billion. Foster Farms sells poultry products like seasoned chicken cuts, ground turkey and frozen chicken nuggets and strips, according to its website. It also produces deli meats and frozen corn dogs.
While Tyson’s sales missed estimates, earnings per share were $1.58, compared with $1.56 forecast by analysts. The company affirmed its guidance for the full fiscal year.
“Global protein demand remains strong, and we are well positioned to meet the demand,” Tyson Chief Executive Officer Noel White said in the earnings statement.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:38AM ET</span>",France key as Germany fights EU rules that threaten Nord Stream 2,"PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is pressuring other European capitals to block an EU proposal to regulate Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline ahead of a key meeting on Friday, diplomatic sources said, but may fail to convince France, threatening the project's construction. 
The European Union executive wants to extend its internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines to have a say over the new gas link under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. In its current form, the project, fully owned by Russian state energy firm Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), would not be compliant. 
National capitals have so far failed to agree on the plan, with big member states such as France, Italy and Spain unwilling to go against Berlin's opposition to the draft rules. 
France, however, may have shifted its position, according to one source close to the talks, opening the way for Germany to lose its blocking minority on the EU proposal.
""France's vote would be decisive,"" another EU source said, adding that Spain and Italy have not taken firm sides. ""It's very unpredictable what will happen tomorrow.""
French officials refused to comment on their position ahead of Friday's meeting in Brussels, with an Elysee source saying negotiations were still ongoing. 
The bloc is split, with eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries viewing the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline as holding the EU hostage to Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritize the economic benefits.
Opponents of the pipeline, including the United States, worry it will undermine support for Ukraine by depriving Kiev of gas transit fees along the traditional route for Russian supplies, which fill over a third of the EU's gas needs.
The German government has said gas transits through Ukraine must continue as a condition for the project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline.
However, EU-mediated talks between Russia and Ukraine to agree the terms of such transits have so far failed. 
If the European Commission's gas regulation proposal musters enough support from the bloc's 28 member states, negotiations on final draft rules could begin as early as next week as the European Parliament has already backed the plan. 
How fast the legislation passes is critical to whether the pipeline proceeds. It foresees tougher rules for new infrastructure projects, but Nord Stream 2 construction is already underway. 

Any delay to building the pipeline would weaken Moscow's hand in talks with Ukraine for a new gas transit deal after 2019 and create uncertainty for Gazprom's partners: Germany's Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo-Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV and France's Engie.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",World's largest wealth fund to press firms for climate data at AGMs,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund will push the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose more data on greenhouse gases they emit and how they adapt to climate change during the coming annual general meeting season, a top fund official said.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund invests the revenues of Norway's oil and gas production and has stakes in some 9,000 companies across 72 countries.
It was an early mover among international investors in trying to assess climate change risk, wanting to avoid investments in one sector negatively impacting another - so-called ""externalities"" - and hurting its overall portfolio.
This year, it will make a fresh push on firms to explain how their business will be affected, and how they are adapting, to a world where temperatures may rise by 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F).
""What we would like to see more of is scenarios, including a two-degree scenario, and we want better disclosure of the assumptions for these scenarios,"" Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief corporate governance officer, told Reuters.
""We want clear targets for CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, including methane. And we want to see reporting of progress against the targets,"" she added.
""We would like to see it more disaggregated, meaning not for the whole company, but more broken down, for instance regional or even on an asset level.""
DIVESTMENTS
As part of its green push, the fund has been developing an in-house software, called Angle, that can take non-financial data, such as CO2 emissions, combine it with trading data and earnings data, and see how it will affect a company years ahead.
That tool has informed divestments in some 30 companies in 2018, fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters, helping show that these companies did not have a sustainable business model over the long-term. He did not name them.
Presentation material showed two of the 30 divested companies were involved in palm oil; one in rubber; ten in coal-based power; and one in ""CO2 intensity"". 
The next step in the software's development, first disclosed by Reuters in October, is to develop the platform to see how much of the carbon cost can be passed on to customers and how much companies must pay themselves.
""It is still in the works,"" Slyngstad said.
Smith Ihenacho said companies were generally better at reporting climate-related data, citing for instance banks and oil and gas companies as ""quite good"" examples. 
But others, like power producers, were lagging.
""There is still far to go for many companies to report at the level we would like to see,"" she said.
The fund itself ""emitted"" 107 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018 via its ownership stakes -- roughly twice the amount emitted by Norway in 2017 -- according to its annual responsible investment report released on Thursday.
In 2018, the fund voted against one or more resolutions put forward at 27.5 percent of AGMs it attended last year, roughly the same level as in 2017.
The fund said it voted against the CEO also holding the position of board chairman at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Total, Procter & Gamble and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), among others.
It also voted against executive pay proposals at  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, among others.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Cannabis craze weeds out junior mining field,"By Joe Bavier and Barbara Lewis
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - A boom in cannabis investment is siphoning capital away from mining and hitting junior miners hardest, forcing them to up their game and potentially improving the quality of projects in a sector long rife with cowboy speculators.
Canada's relaxation of cannabis laws culminated in legalization for recreational use in October. Other jurisdictions are following suit or liberalizing their laws on medical or health use, creating an industry that has lured a breed of high-risk, high-return investors.
The world's top three listed cannabis companies - Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aurora Cannabis - have a combined market value of around $30 billion. And consumers are expected to spend over $7 billion on cannabis products in Canada alone this year, according to Deloitte. 
In Africa, where miners met this week for Cape Town's African Mining Indaba conference, cannabis companies are setting up projects in Lesotho, while other countries, including Zimbabwe and South Africa, plan to issue license. 
""Raising money is extremely difficult,"" said Patrick Downey, head of Canadian junior gold exploration company Orezone Gold, who compared the cannabis boom to the headwinds juniors faced during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. 
""It's a cyclical business, and it will come back,"" Downey said. ""But you have to have a good project."" 
The rise of cannabis comes at a time when investors were already turning away from mining. 
""The biggest problem in mining is that it destroys shareholder value,"" said Philip Hopwood, Deloitte's global mining and metals leader. 
Miners operating in Africa - already viewed by many investors as a particularly risky bet - have been doubly hit. 
""It's like the straw that broke the camel's back,"" said one explorer at the Indaba.
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
As early IPOs, once a right of passage for exploration juniors, have slowed to a trickle with cannabis stocks delivering better short-term returns, miners are increasingly turning to private equity. 
And as active investors replace passive stockholders, companies are having to sell the merits of their projects to more discerning potential backers. 
Sebastien de Montessus - chief executive of Endeavour Mining, one of the most successful mid-tier gold players - considers it a process of natural selection. 
""It's a good thing ... You're going to have to be stronger and better,"" he told Reuters in an interview at the Indaba.
The CEO of Barrick Gold, one of the world's biggest gold companies, said mining's struggles to fend off the challenge from cannabis reflected the poor state of the industry in the eyes of prospective investors. 
""We should be embarrassed that somebody is prepared to make a choice between those two options,"" Mark Bristow told Reuters. ""(Mining) is just so fundamentally material to our everyday lives, whereas I can't say the same of cannabis.""
Majors such as Barrick and companies with projects already in production can better weather the storm. 
The newest juniors in the riskiest areas are racing to adapt. And some are getting creative. 
Prospect Resources' executive director Harry Greaves on Wednesday won an award at the Indaba for his lithium project in Zimbabwe.
He said Australian and Chinese investment had helped. And he was also considering growing cannabis at his lithium site on the outskirts of Zimbabwe's capital Harare.

""We don't yet have a marijuana license, but we have the land available,"" he said.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",Germany's aviation lobby fears further flight chaos this summer,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Airline passengers are likely to face further flight delays and cancellations over the European summer because of shortages of air traffic controllers, the head of the German Aviation Association BDL warned on Thursday.
Europe's airports are struggling to cope with greater demand for travel and a lack of capacity on the ground. Airlines have blamed air traffic control as the reason for flight delays last summer, citing strikes in France and staff shortages.
On Monday, Ryanair's chief executive said he expects a ""torrid time"" in the four months to June due to shortages of air traffic controllers.
German airline Lufthansa spent 500 million euros ($570 million) last year on compensating passengers for delays and cancellations, an executive said last week.
BDL President Klaus-Dieter Scheurle said he expects further disruption this year, despite the German aviation sector agreeing on measures last October to try to avoid backlogs.
""We must expect that summer 2019 will also be difficult, but we will have to wait and see by how much,"" Scheurle said in an online briefing.
Germany's air traffic control (DFS) has increased the number of training places to 120 and is trying to recruit trained air traffic controllers from abroad to ease the bottlenecks.
In July 2018, 8 percent of all European flights were delayed by more than one hour, up from 5.5. percent in 2017, BDL said citing data from the Central Office for Delay Analysis.
This was not only down to problems in air traffic control, but also strikes in southern Europe, an unusually high number of storms, as well as backlogs at airport security, BDL said. 
Overall the number of passengers at German airports rose by 4.1 percent last year to 244 million. That underperformed Europe as a whole which had growth of almost 6 percent.
BDL's Scheuerle said competition in the industry remained intense. German airlines lost market share to low-cost rivals Easyjet and Ryanair in the wake of the collapse of Air Berlin, BDL data showed.
The market share of German airlines as measured by the number of seats fell to 57 percent between Jan-Oct 2018 compared to 62 percent a year earlier.
Scheuerle said he expects a further fall in market share following the insolvency of holiday airline Germania earlier this week, which had a market share of 1.6 percent.

""If we do something it will be very small,"" Stefan Bollinger said, noting any move had to fit Goldman Sachs's pan-European strategy and pointing out that Switzerland was a competitive market whose business cycle was at an advanced stage.
Bollinger said the bank had no plans to launch its Marcus online bank in Switzerland. Goldman Sachs started Marcus in the United States in 2016 and it has seen brisk growth.
Marcus has since expanded to Britain and is considering launches in other markets.
In Switzerland's property market, vacancy rates have hit their highest levels in more than two decades. But Swiss banks have upped mortgage lending as more investors seek to take advantage of low interest rates.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mounting global growth worries thrust share markets into reverse on Thursday, while the dollar scored its longest winning run since a hot streak in early October that helped trigger a wave of worldwide 'bear' markets.
Wall Street looked set to suffer back-to-back losses later after Europe had set the tone. 
Some poor earnings and weak data out of Germany ensured most of the main bourses were lower and kept MSCI's main index of world stocks in the red for a second day too. 
The extent of the current slowdown in the global economy was highlighted as India unexpectedly cut its interest rates and the euro got hit to $1.1346 by Germany's fourth consecutive drop in industrial output.
That only compounded the 1.3 percent the euro has lost over the last week and the tailwind behind the dollar, which has risen every day since Friday's strong U.S. jobs data. It has also recovered almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes last month.
""Another day, another piece of terrible German data. EUR/USD risks a move to $1.1300,"" said ING's chief EMEA FX and interest rate strategist, Petr Krpata.
Elsewhere the pound was struggling near $1.29 again after the Bank of England kept rates on hold, while gloomy jobs data saw New Zealand's dollar suffer a similar flop as its Australian counterpart had seen the previous day. 
The kiwi slid to $0.6744, losing nearly 2 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors wagered on the risk of a cut in interest rates there. New Zealand's central bank holds its first meeting of the year next week. 
Asian trading was still light overall though with China on holiday and no major economic data on the diary.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1 percent as it rose to its highest since early October. 
The index has risen steadily since early January as the U.S. Federal Reserve changed its tune and emerging markets have surged more broadly after a torrid 2018.
Australia's benchmark stock index jumped 1.2 percent amid expectations of easy monetary policy after the central bank chief shifted away from his previous tightening bias. 
Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent though and the caution quickly spread to Europe. 
London's FTSE was the only major bourse clinging to positive territory, helped by a weak pound, whereas the rest were down at least 0.6 percent as were E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 and Dow.
WE'RE ALL DOVES NOW
One of the day's big surprises came from India where its central bank unexpectedly lowered interest rates to 6.25 percent to boost a slowing economy after a sharp slide in the inflation rate.
Italian bonds were back under pressure with the European Commission slashing its 2019 growth forecast.
Italy agreed a deficit target of 2.04 percent in December, averting a major fall-out with the EU, though this was based on a growth assumption of 1.0 percent. Slowing growth in Italy could make it harder for the country to remain within EU rules.
However, Benjamin Schroeder, rates strategist at ING, said he did not expect the EU to demand more fiscal tightening from Italy, should its forecasts be reduced.
""The EU has another thing to deal with -- Brexit -- and the other thing is do you want to infuse the campaign ahead of the parliamentary elections with this topic."" 
The next major trigger for markets will more likely be any breakthrough in the U.S.-Sino tariff talks when the two sides meet in Beijing next week.
U.S. President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he and other U.S. officials will aim to clinch a deal next week to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 
Probably more pressing though for the U.S. markets is the threat of another government shutdown, Nick Twidale, an analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia said.
""With both sides of the house standing firm on the contentious border wall issue at present and the deadline approaching swiftly on Feb 15 we could be back where we were just a few weeks ago."" 
The broad dollar gains put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,303.96 per ounce, slipping further from last week's top of $1,326.30.
Oil prices eased too after U.S. crude inventories rose and as production levels in the country held at record levels. 

Brent crude futures slipped 23 cents to $62.46. U.S. crude eased 19 cents to $53.82 a barrel.

The European Commission lowered its growth for all of the three biggest economies in the euro zone this year, highlighting a slowdown in China and spillovers from that country's trade conflict with the U.S.
The lower forecasts could also revive last year's dispute between the EU and Italy over budget deficits. Italy only escaped disciplinary measures with a budget draft that assumed much more than the 0.2% growth the Commission now forecasts for it.
The news contrasted sharply with comments late Wednesday from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy in a speech in Washington.
“We’ve had some big events, some surprises like Brexit...and the system has been strong,” he said, adding that the U.S. is in 'a good place' with low unemployment and solid growth.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Bankers suggest Russian firms delist as sanctions uncertainty bites,"By Olga Popova, Anastasia Teterevleva and Maria Kolomychenko
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Uncertainty caused by the expansion of U.S. sanctions on Russia last year has pushed companies' share prices lower, prompting investment bankers to suggest their clients should delist from local and international exchanges. 
Once a booming market for equity listings, there were no initial public offerings in Russia last year for the first time in at least a decade. 
Share listings allow companies to raise cash for business expansion or other purposes but a fall in their share price can trigger early debt repayments or a need to increase collateral held against loans. Public status also requires a regular disclosure of information, some of which may be sensitive. 
Delisting solves these issues.
Russian food retailer Dixy was one of those that decided to delist from the Moscow Exchange last year, while Megafon, Russia's No.2 phone operator, canceled its London-listed shares and said it would consider doing the same for its Moscow listing. 
At the same time, around $4 billion worth of IPOs were delayed in 2018 and while the banking community still expects some of those to eventually come to market, they are suggesting other companies delist. 
""Business in Russia is just dying because of the sanctions,"" an investment banker from a top-five Russian bank said. ""Bankers are actively working on the buyback programs and delistings from international bourses."" 
SPECIAL APPROACH 
One of the companies approached by bankers last year was Sistema which is listed in Moscow and London, two banking sources and a source close to the company said. 
One of the banking sources said that apart from Sistema, another two or three companies were looking at the delisting option. 
Sistema, the holding company for a number of assets from agriculture to toys and telecoms, has a market capitalization of $1.46 billion in Moscow, while its MTS unit, Russia's top mobile phone operator, has a market capitalization of $8 billion. 
The banking source said Sistema had decided against delisting its shares due to the high cost of a buyback when its net debt was already 585 billion rubles ($8.85 billion).
A source close to Sistema confirmed that bankers approached the company last year about a delisting, adding that the company was working to reduce its debt.
Sistema, controlled by the Russian businessman Vladimir Yevtushenkov, would have to spend 31 billion rubles to buy the 32.4 percent of its shares which are free floating in order to delist, according to Reuters calculations based on Sistema's current market capitalization. 
Yevtushenkov also confirmed to Reuters that bankers had pitched a delisting to his company but declined to comment further. 
A spokesman for Sistema said that the company's management did not study and are not currently studying a delisting. 
""At the same time, Sistema is regularly analyzing the situation on capital markets and looking at the opportunities arising,"" the spokesman said.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>",Medicare Part D no match for runaway specialty drug costs: study,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When Medicare prescription drug insurance was created in 2003, the idea that beneficiaries with very high drug costs should pick up 5 percent of the tab seemed reasonable - but that was well before specialty drugs were invented that carry price tags in the tens of thousands of dollars.
Today, the 5 percent coinsurance charge shouldered by Medicare Part D beneficiaries with serious illnesses does not look so reasonable. Instead, sky-high prices of specialty drugs threaten to bankrupt some enrollees - mainly because Part D does not cap the total amounts that enrollees must pay out of pocket each year. 
A new report finds that Part D enrollees are exposed to thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for drugs that treat cancer and other serious illnesses. Researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) studied expected annual out-of-pocket costs this year for 30 specialty drugs used to treat four conditions: cancer, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Median out-of-pocket costs ranged from $2,622 for Zepatier (for hepatitis C) to $16,551 for Idhifa (for leukemia).
But not all specialty tier drugs are covered by all Part D plans. For 14 specialty drugs examined in the study that were not covered by some or all plans this year, the median total annual costs ranged from $26,209 for Zepatier to an eye-popping $145,769 for Gleevec, a brand name drug that has revolutionized treatment of  chronic myeloid leukemia and other complex disorders.
A “relatively small share of enrollees” in Part D grapple with these costs, the study notes - but that is small comfort if you are among them. The out-of-pocket costs reviewed by KFF were highest for cancer drugs, followed by hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
Expensive patented brand-name drugs are a key part of the problem, but not the entire story. For example, there is a generic version of Gleevec - Imatinib mesylate - but KFF reports that it costs $91,844, compared with $145,787 for the brand-name version. “The generic drug may be less, but it’s still really expensive,” said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF and a coauthor of the report.
Part D covers most outpatient prescription drugs. In 2019, the standard benefit can have a deductible as high as $415, and 25 percent coinsurance up to an initial coverage limit of $3,820 in your total out-of-pocket spending.
The next level of coverage is the so-called coverage gap, or doughnut hole. The gap was closed gradually as part of the Affordable Care Act, and it is entirely closed for brand-name drugs in 2019 - but it still features a different cost-sharing arrangement. Here, brand-name drug manufacturers must provide a 70 percent discount on drug prices, and enrollees bear 25 percent of cost out of pocket (for generic drugs, the enrollee share is 37 percent). That coverage continues until the “catastrophic” level, which begins at $5,100 in out-of-pocket spending.
Closing the coverage gap is a bit of good news, but patients using expensive specialty drugs do not really see the benefits. “They go right through the gap into the catastrophic level of coverage - maybe with the very first prescription they fill,” Cubanski said.
And the fact that Part D has no overall cap on enrollee out-of-pocket costs leaves it “out of step” with most other private coverage, she notes. For example, KFF reports that 81 percent of large employer health insurance plans had maximum dollar limits on coinsurance last year. 
PROPOSED REFORMS
Part D catastrophic costs are part of the bigger debate in Washington on soaring prescription drug costs. President Donald Trump signaled in his State of the Union message this week that reform efforts targeting drug costs are a high priority, and his administration has proposed reforms that it argues would alleviate the problems in Part D. The plan calls for sharing rebates with enrollees, changing definitions of what counts toward out-of-pocket spending and capping out-of-pocket costs. That could reduce the cost of specialty drugs above the catastrophic level, but it could also mean higher costs for others with lower spending in the form of higher premiums and other out-of-pocket costs.
Democrats have urged allowing Medicare to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. (https://reut.rs/2IzEY6E). And some Medicare for All proposals also address the issue, by covering all out-of-pocket costs, or by charging only nominal amounts for prescriptions and imposing very low annual out-of-pocket limits. “It seems that under most Medicare For All plans, the problem of high out-of-pocket drug costs would be less of an issue than it is today,” Cubanski said.
PROTECTING AGAINST RISKS
Unfortunately, there is not much that Part D enrollees can do to protect against these high out-of-pocket risks. Part D plans all charge similar amounts for specialty tier drugs, ranging from 25 to 33 percent coinsurance, so picking one plan over the other will not help much with the costs patients are required to pay. What does matter is whether the drug you need is covered by your plan.
But predicting the need for a specialty drug is impossible. “You might need one next year, but not this year,” Cubanski notes.
Low-income enrollees who qualify for Medicare’s Extra Help program, which helps pay out-of-pocket Part D costs, do get relief from high out-of-pocket costs. The program is available to enrollees with very low levels of income and assets. (https:// Extra Help offers varying levels of support, but with full help, enrollees usually pay nothing when they reach the catastrophic level of coverage. 
Enrollees with somewhat higher income may qualify for assistance with specialty drug costs direct from patient assistance programs funded by pharmaceutical companies, or direct from the companies. Cubanski recommends contacting drug manufacturers directly to inquire about this, or asking your pharmacist. (Reporting and writing by Mark Miller in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

23,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>","Help available for first-time buyers, if you can find it","By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters - It took 52-year-old social worker Nancy Peterson a combination of five different grants and low interest loans to accumulate $80,000 for the downpayment she needed to become a first-time home buyer in Seattle last summer. 
Peterson’s modest income was far too low for Seattle’s soaring housing market, where the median home price is now over $700,000. Without the assistance, Peterson would have only qualified for a $100,000 purchase with a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
Many middle income people give up on purchasing a home when they cannot come up with a 20 percent downpayment, but Peterson was lucky enough to have real estate agent Lindsey Sargent help spot local assistance programs. They were able to cobble together a 40 percent downpayment to get a $232,000 two bedroom condo 25 miles north of the city.
""The programs are not well understood, and there aren’t nearly enough to serve all the need,"" Sargent said.  
The prospect of getting outside help, or a lower downpayment than the traditional 20 percent, does not occur to many. In a 2015 Fannie Mae survey, 76 percent did not know they did not have to have 20 percent for a downpayment. 
With home prices rising more than wages, home buyers instead have been turning increasingly to parents and family members for help. Among people with FHA loans geared to first-time buyers, 26 percent got help from their family – a significant increase over the 22 percent about seven years ago.
Yet, as a general rule of thumb, if you have solid income and a good credit score over 700, you can get some conventional loans with just 3 to 5 percent down, said Peter Boomer, head of mortgage distribution for PNC Bank. And you can get an FHA loan geared toward first-time purchasers for just 3.5 percent down with a credit score as low as 640, he said. There are even loans from the Veterans Administration with no down payment, for those who qualify.
In addition, there are over 2,500 different programs that provide grants and low-interest loans for down payments and closing costs, said Rob Chrane, chief executive of Down Payment Resource which tracks them (https://downpaymentresource.com/).
These are open to a wide range of incomes and make home purchases available to many first-time home buyers who think a house is out of the question, said Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center. For example, in Minneapolis, income can be as high as $104,000 and $328,000 homes qualify, according to the Urban Institute. The average assistance is $9,672.
In Seattle, incomes up to $145,000 qualify, but with the median home at over $700,000 the cutoff price of $495,000 home is too low, Sargent said. 
FINDING HELP
About 11.4 percent of home buyers were able to get downpayment assistance in the form of loans and grants from government entities in 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
But navigating the programs can be overwhelming because they vary by state, county and city, with no centralized coordination at the national level. Much of the funding is local, and often tracked only by local housing agencies. Even more frustrating is that funding can run out unexpectedly and not be renewed, said Chrane.
Because of the complexity, many mortgage lenders and real estate agents do not bother searching for special programs to help first-time home buyers. Consumers should ask at the outset for them to examples of programs cobbled together for previous home buyers.
Diligence is crucial. Consider Peterson’s quest in Seattle: when she was still looking for a home, one grant program had run out of money. But as she was on the verge of making a purchase last July, another grant recipient could not close on a home purchase. So suddenly $25,000 was available and Peterson received it.

BRF said it will take longer than expected to lower its debt to EBITDA ratio to 3 times, previously predicted for December 2019. Now it forecast it will meet this target by June 2020.
BRF, which will report earnings on Feb. 28, said it will present a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5 in the fourth quarter and 3.65 by the end of this year. Cash position should come in at 7 billion reais ($1.9 billion) in the fourth quarter.
The company also said it should raise 4.1 billion reais ($1.1 billion) with non-core asset sales, working capital and the securitization of receivables, less than a 5 billion reais target previously estimated.
The announcement underscores how the full turnaround in the world's largest poultry exporter may take longer than expected. Poor results and a federal investigation into practices to evade safety checks led to a complete overhaul at BRF's management.
As part of the turnaround, BRF had announced in June a large restructuring plan, which includes asset sales to reduce debt and adjustment in 22 of its 35 plants. 
On Tuesday, BRF appointed former Petrobras Chief Executive Ivan Monteiro as its new chief financial officer, driving shares up.

29,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>","MarketPulse Europe: Automotive, Travel Woes in Focus as EU Cuts Forecasts","Investing.com -- It’s another cheerless day in Europe’s stock markets as more evidence of the damage from the U.S.-China trade war comes to light and the EU slashes its growth forecasts.
The mood has been grim in the automotive sector for some months and wasn't helped by  Daimler  's (DE:DAIGn) profit fall and dividend cut Wednesday. Another drop in German industrial output, out Thursday, is consistent with that, but it’s  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which announced a big recall of Dodge Ram trucks Wednesday (and which reports fourth-quarter earnings later today), that’s the biggest loser.
At 05:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT) the Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 23 points, or 0.7%, at 3189.65.
Those lower down the auto food chain are also suffering. Osram Licht AG (DE:OSRn) – the Siemens lighting spin-off that is a big supplier to the auto industry – said it swung to a loss in the three months to December thanks to the slowdown in China, and in automotive in particular. That's weighing on other suppliers such as Continental (DE:CONG) and Covestro (DE:1COV) in Germany, and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France.
Travel companies are again making negative headlines: Tui AG NA (DE:TUIGn) fell over 16% after missing its 2018 profit target and saying that 2019 margins look weaker. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook (LON:TCG), which lost over 75% last year, rose after saying it’s looking at selling its airline business, and Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) confirmed a $257 million loss last year after a 71% rise in its fuel costs.
The good news is coming, again, from the energy and the food and drink sectors.  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP), maker of Jameson’s whiskey and Martell cognac, followed  Diageo  (LON:DGE) in reporting strong fourth-quarter numbers and predicting a robust 2019. And French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) reported a record year for output and beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit, but its shares edged down slightly.
Italy’s bombed-out banks are also having a strong morning after Unicredit (MI:CRDI) posted its highest annual profit in a decade – despite the headwinds from its operations in Turkey and its home market. Rivals  Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA (MI:ISP) also reported stronger-than-expected numbers Wednesday."

The firm, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, will team up with Redefine Properties, one of South Africa's biggest real estate companies, in opening its first location in the upmarket Johannesburg suburb of Rosebank in the third quarter of the year.
""Expanding here is an obvious choice for us: it's our first location in Africa and, with its global outlook, South Africa is the gateway to the rest of the continent, so we're excited to welcome new members and grow our community here,"" Managing Director Eugen Miropolski said.
WeWork leases office spaces and sublets them out to individuals and start-ups - a model that creates a mismatch between its erratic income stream from clients who can rent for as little as month and the fixed rent it has promised to landlords.
However, in South Africa, WeWork will sign a revenue-sharing lease with Redefine, which broadly means the rent would depend on the revenue it generates from subletting the space, a source familiar with the matter said.
The model is being rolled out to landlords, and is expected to become increasingly common for the company, the source said.
Miropolski also said WeWork had no immediate plans to expand elsewhere on the continent.
""We're looking to expand our footprint across Africa, and we're very excited about the potential here, But right now, we're fully focused on launching in Johannesburg and building our local community,"" he said.
In its first release of financial results in August, the privately held firm reported a net loss of $723 million for the first half of 2018 versus $154 million a year earlier.

Europe's STOXX 600 was down 0.3 percent in early deals. 
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX was down 0.7 percent amid jitters about talks between China and the United States next week over their protracted trade spat. Washington will impose a new batch of tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2.
Bank stocks were some of the few gainers in early deals as Italy's biggest bank UniCredit reported consensus-busting fourth-quarter results, bringing some much-needed cheer to the battered euro-zone sector. 
UniCredit rose 2.7 percent, while Banco BPM was also up 1.8 percent after its results.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) eked out gains even after it slashed its profitability targets hit by the market downturn last year.
Some of the bad news was priced in after its results warning in January, and investors also drew comfort from the French bank's earnings presentation, which allayed worries about the need for a capital injection, traders said.
Elsewhere earnings news was largely downbeat.
Publicis dropped 14 percent as the world's No. 3 advertising company's results failed to win over investors and analysts who honed in on weaker-than-expected revenues. It dragged WPP (LON:WPP) down with it.
Tour operator TUI poured more cold water on the travel sector, the latest to blame last summer's hot weather and the weaker pound for weaker-than-expected profits. The London-listed shares sank 15 percent to the bottom of the FTSE 100, hitting their lowest since April 2017. 
Small-cap UK rival Thomas Cook rallied more than 9 percent after announcing a strategic review, including a possible sale of its airline business, as the world's oldest travel company seeks to cut debt and restore investor confidence after two profit warnings late last year.

GEA Group sank 14 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after the German food processing machinery maker scrapped its mid-term targets and flagged a profit decline this year.

David Lufkin, 51, a British national and previously global head of sales for Petrofac International Limited, entered his pleas at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
The SFO said the charges related to the making of corrupt offers to influence the award of contracts to Petrofac worth in excess of 730 million dollars in Iraq and in excess of 3.5 billion dollars in Saudi Arabia.
The SFO said its investigation into Petrofac's use of agents in multiple jurisdictions, including Iraq and Saudi Arabia, is ongoing. Lufkin will be sentenced at a later date, prosecutors added. 
The SFO first said it had begun an investigation into Petrofac in 2017 as part of a wider probe into Monaco-based oil and gas consultancy Unaoil.
Petrofac said last February that it expected its top management to be interviewed as part of the SFO investigation.
Petrofac did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - The boss of  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) said on Thursday that the priority of the French spirits group, which is under pressure from activist investor Elliott, was to create long-term value and added he had no plans to sell its champagne assets.
The owner of the Mumm and Perrier-Jouet champagnes and Martell cognac also said he was ""confident"" on China even though it was premature to discuss demand during the Chinese New Year festivities that stated on Feb. 5.
Ricard added that the family-backed group, which recently named Patricia Barbizet as Lead Independent Director, could make further changes to its governance but would do so ""under its own timetable"".
""My priority is to deliver. Our performance is accelerating. My priority is to create durable value and I hope this will please all our shareholders,"" Alexandre Ricard told Reuters.
Asked if he could sell his Champagne assets, as suggested by some analysts, Ricard said: ""No"".
He was speaking after Pernod Ricard released forecast-beating first-half profits, driven by demand in China, and raised its full year profit guidance while it also provided new targets under a three year strategy plan.
U.S. activist fund Elliott said in December it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) to build a stake of just over 2.5 percent in the world's second-biggest spirits maker.

Elliott has called on Pernod Ricard to raise profit margins to bring them more in line with larger rival  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and improve governance, suggesting suggested 500 million euros in cost cuts and options such as merging with another spirits company.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 03:00AM ET</span>",Thomas Cook puts airline business up for sale to raise cash,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Travel group Thomas Cook said on Thursday it was willing to sell its airline business to raise cash and fund its fight back from a torrid 2018 and signs of a tough 2019 ahead.
The oldest travel company in the world was brought to its knees in 2018 when a heatwave in northern Europe deterred holiday makers from booking lucrative last minute deals, leading to two major profit warnings and talk of a need to raise funds. 
The British group said rather than launch a rights issue, it would consider all options for the most successful part of the business to enable it to invest in its own hotels, improve its digital sales offering and drive further cost savings. 
""We are at an early stage in this review process which will consider all options to enhance value to shareholders and intensify our strategic focus,"" Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said in a statement. 
The Group Airline consists of Germany's Condor, and UK, Scandinavian and Spanish divisions. In all, it operates 103 aircraft and posted a 37 percent rise in operating profit last year to 129 million pounds.
Thomas Cook said it had made progress in managing its cost base but that bookings for this summer reflected consumer uncertainty, especially in Britain. 
Last year's winter trading was also affected by the long hot summer, with fewer customers willing to book holidays, meaning that average selling prices were down 10 percent. For this summer, tour operator bookings are down 12 percent although pricing was slightly higher. 
Its underlying loss from operations in the three months to the end of December expanded to 60 million pounds.
Net debt stood at 1.6 billion pounds and it said it had met its bank covenant tests. The group had a market valuation of 478 million pounds at the close on Wednesday. 
It reiterated its full-year outlook. 
The airline business fared much better than the tour operator segment last year, and grew its profit by 35 million pounds. The tour operator business profit fell 88 million pounds.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 01:59AM ET</span>","Fed, elections, oil align to revive demand for Philippine, Indonesian stocks","By Fransiska Nangoy and Neil Jerome Morales
JAKARTA/MANILA (Reuters) - Bruised by global political and economic turbulence last year, foreign investors are now returning to Southeast Asian markets, encouraged by easing trade frictions, a more benign interest rate outlook and prospects of increased infrastructure spending.
So far this year, foreign investors have been net buyers of stocks in markets such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, while currencies in the region have clawed back some of their 2018 losses.
A key moment for investors was the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise dovish tilt on policy last month, a source of relief for emerging markets that were hit by a rising U.S. dollar and capital outflows in 2018.
The Fed, however, is just one of the bullish factors driving Southeast Asia.
For Sarah Shaw, portfolio manager at Australian boutique fund 4D Infrastructure, one of the top investment picks for 2019 is Indonesian state-owned toll-road operator PT Jasa Marga. 
""We really like the infrastructure story in Indonesia,"" Shaw said. ""Jasa Marga is definitely capitalizing on the infrastructure investment that is ongoing in Indonesia.""
Companies such as Jasa Marga, whose shares are up by a quarter since November and mobile gadgets retailer Global Teleshop are leading a rally in Indonesian stock markets that investors believe will be driven by upcoming elections, a pause in Fed tightening and lower oil prices.
Foreigners have bought $1 billion worth of Indonesian equities so far this year, having been net sellers for the last two years. In the Philippines, foreigners have invested more than a third of their net $1.1 billion selling in 2018.
The Philippine stock market has risen 8.5 percent, while the Jakarta and Bangkok indexes are up about 6 percent each. The baht is at the fore of Asia's rising currencies and up 4 percent this year. 
""The re-pricing of the Fed is undoubtedly supportive for emerging market bonds and FX,"" said Stuart Ritson, a portfolio manager for emerging market debt at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors in Singapore. 
At about 12 percent of Ritson's $2 billion portfolio, Indonesian bonds are one of the larger overweights. Ritson sees value in holding these bonds against the backdrop of high real yields in Indonesia, a weakening dollar and stable U.S. yields.
Another big factor that helped turn sentiment on these smaller Asian markets was the hope of a thaw in Sino-U.S. trade tensions after the two superpowers agreed to talks early this year. The rupiah, traditionally known to be volatile, had been trading at its lowest levels since the Asian financial crisis before that.
Offshore investors, who hold a third of Indonesia's high-yielding government bonds, have also been gradually returning to that market since June last year.
The rising tide hasn't lifted all boats with uncertainty over the political and reform prospects in Malaysia crimping that market. Stocks there haven't budged in 2019.
However, investors are taking a more positive view on elections in other markets, with Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines due to head to the polls.
Stocks such as Jasa Marga, for example, have been lifted by hopes that Indonesia's general election in April will keep President Joko Widodo, who has promised massive spending on infrastructure, in power.
""Historically, Indonesian financial markets rally in election year on expectations of policies,"" Ezra Nazula, chief investment officer, Manulife Asset Management, Indonesia.
Nazula, whose fund has about $4.7 billion under management, expects Indonesian 10-year bond yields, now slightly below 8 percent, to drop by 50 to 100 basis points by the year end and for the Jakarta stock index to possibly rise by another 6 to 8 percent to record highs.
In the Philippines, investors are betting that consumption, which drives two-thirds of the economy, will pick up as politicians spend lavishly ahead of the May mid-term elections, and households are encouraged by falling prices. 
Stocks of fast food leader Jollibee, shopping mall owner SM Prime, and snacks maker Universal Robina are among those that have registered double-digit gains and outperformed the main index this year.
In Thailand, the first election in seven years and King Maha Vajiralongkorn's coronation have become reasons for the baht's outsized rally and foreigners rushing to the stock market.
CLSA's head of Thai equity strategy, Suchart Techaposai, expects the benchmark equity index to hit 1,850 this year, more than 11 percent above current levels.
Thai real estate firms such as Noble Development and AQ Estate jumped about 50 percent last month, more than 10 times the increase in the main index, as investors bet on booming consumer demand.

""We (Novartis) pay almost 50 percent of our gross revenues in the United States into rebates,"" Narasimhan said. ""If you return those rebates to patients, so patients pay less out of pocket, I think that is something that makes a lot of sense and will correct a distortion in the marketplace."" 
In his State of the Union speech this week, U.S. President Donald Trump complained again that Americans pay more for drugs than people elsewhere. Narasimhan, who has labeled as ""destructive"" efforts to link U.S. prices to those in other countries, countered that this is only partially true.
""There are situations where prices in the U.S. are certainly higher than the prices in Europe, but there are many situations, as well, where they are very comparable,"" he said. ""It's difficult to make blanket statements, like this is always happening."" 
Some analyses, including one commissioned by Reuters in 2015, showed that U.S. prices for the top-20 selling medicines were three times higher than in Britain. [https://reut.rs/2TyAN08]
Narasimhan acknowledged the industry and company reputational challenges stemming from anger over high prices, kickback scandals and last year's revelation that Novartis paid Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, $1.2 million.
He said drugmakers, in some instances, boosted prices excessively or fell short on providing access and now had work ahead to regain the standing they once had, as the industry brought scientific advances like vaccines that saved billions of lives.
""I would say, over the last 20 years, because of behaviors that the industry had - I would call them outlier events, (but) it's hard to call them outlier events, when there's enough of the outlier events - damaged the industry's reputation,"" Narasimhan said. 
""At least at Novartis, I think of it as the great journey of my time as CEO to try to get back to a different place from a reputation standpoint."" 
Last month, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced a plan that would end rebates now paid to PBMs and others and instead pass along savings to consumers covered by U.S. government health plans. Trump, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, again called for lower U.S. prescription drug prices.
PBMs, which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans, argue that they are passing sufficient savings to patients and contend that rebates help keep down insurance premiums. 
Narasimhan, echoing arguments of many large drugmakers, said the existing system obscures the true price of drugs and leaves patients on the hook, in the form of higher co-pays, or co-insurance payments.
'ZERO TRANSPARENCY'
He noted that changes in the decades-old rebate system could eventually affect insurance plans offered by U.S. employers, potentially leading to premium hikes.
""We have zero transparency into the billions we pay in rebates,"" the Novartis CEO said. ""You could see some adjustment in premiums. But I think that's another area where we should get transparency.""
Novartis, which had 2018 global sales of $51.9 billion and net profit of $12.6 billion, gets more than a third of its revenue in the United States. But despite all the talk about rising list prices, Narasimhan said since 2016 net prices for its prescription drugs fell about 1 percent. 
""At Novartis, we no longer see net price growth as a meaningful contributor,"" he said.
Instead, the company is counting on recent and upcoming launches of new drugs to fuel 2019 growth of 4 percent to 6 percent, a forecast Narasimhan reiterated on Wednesday. 
Since his elevation to CEO last year, Narasimhan sold off over-the-counter and generic drugs units and plans to spin off the Alcon eyecare business before July as he focuses on new, often very pricey transformative treatments.
These include a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a one-time treatment Novartis has said could be cost-effective at up to $5 million per patient, and Kymriah, a CAR-T cell cancer immunotherapy with a list price of $475,000.
Narasimhan said the extensive reliance on direct-to-consumer television advertising for medicines in the United States, a practice in which Novartis engages, may also be hurting the industry's image. TV ads for prescription drugs are not allowed in most countries.
""Our use of the television and television media has eroded some of the trust in the fact that we're a science-based industry,"" Narasimhan said.
Some image problems, however, are specific to Novartis. 
Since 2015, it has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements and fines following kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China. It also faces an upcoming trial in the United States over alleged doctor bribery.
Last year, Narasimhan disavowed the 2017 consulting deal with Trump's ex-attorney struck by his predecessor, Joe Jimenez, amid accusations that Novartis had inappropriately sought favor with the new administration. Novartis acknowledged mistakes but said it did nothing illegal. 
But the CEO believes negative feelings toward his company and the industry can be reversed.

""It's a long journey back, but hopefully through consistent action over a decade, we can get there.""

(Reuters) - In a world with fewer branches, banks will need to rely more heavily on advertising to win market share, according to a study released on Thursday by McKinsey.
""The correlation between adding capacity and gaining share has started to break down,"" senior partner at the management consulting firm Pradip Patiath said. 
The percentage of customers who prefer to transact in branches declined to 26 percent from 38 percent in 2016, the study found. 
Branches are still among the factors McKinsey uses to determine opportunities to gain market share, but marketing, digital tools and customer satisfaction are becoming more influential.
Banks are rushing to develop digital tools to keep customers engaged, but effective marketing of those apps can determine who wins more consumer dollars. 
Brand recall is strongly correlated with deposit share, McKinsey found, which explains why some of the largest banks are ramping up marketing investments or experimenting with new advertisements. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's marketing expenditure jumped 13 percent in 2018 to $3.3 billion as the largest U.S. bank by assets sought to gain even more market share. 
The second-largest U.S. lender, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), unveiled a new ad campaign starring its usually quiet CEO over the holidays. 
Marketing spend is not the best indicator of who will win share, Patiath said. ""Banks need to get more savvy about marketing."" 

""Instead of putting an ad in the Wall Street Journal or in the Super Bowl, can I find a way to get the same reach for a fraction of the cost?"" he added.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 11:15PM ET</span>","SoftBank Group adds $14 billion to market value as shares soar on buyback, third-quarter profit","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp shares jumped 17 percent on Thursday, adding $14 billion to the Japanese tech investment giant's market value, after it unveiled a record share buyback and a surge in quarterly operating profit.
Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has often complained about SoftBank's lingering conglomerate discount and is using part of the windfall from the blockbuster IPO of its domestic telco to try and reduce the valuation gap. 
The buyback ""puts a floor under SoftBank stock"", Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. 
SoftBank shares soared to as much as 9,955 yen, notching up their biggest intra-day gain in a decade. 
They are up 36 percent so far this year but still about 14 percent below the 11,500 yen high hit in September before tumbling on concerns about SoftBank's financial ties to Saudi Arabia following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
SoftBank said after the market closed on Wednesday it would repurchase up to 600 billion yen ($5.46 billion) of its stock, funded by the proceeds of the December IPO of SoftBank Corp.
""There was no consensus over how to value SoftBank,"" said Ace Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. 
Following the IPO, the group ""is more like an investment trust and is becoming easier to understand,"" Yasuda said. 
SoftBank Group Corp also announced a 60 percent jump in third-quarter operating profit, lifted by rising valuations of its growing technology investments.
The company said it offloaded in January its stake in chipmaker Nvidia, which has been hit by weak demand for gaming chips in China, offsetting most of the recent fall in that company's stock price through derivatives contracts. 
At an earnings briefing on Wednesday Son made a 90-minute presentation outlining SoftBank's investment strategy and what he sees as the chronic undervaluation of its shares. 
Markets tend to discount conglomerates and reward moves that shift a company towards a more narrow focus, with investors generally viewing smaller companies as more transparent and easier to value. 
SoftBank's market value is currently around 11 trillion yen ($100.10 billion). But when its stakes in SoftBank Corp, the Saudi-backed Vision Fund, chip designer Arm Holdings and others are taken into account, the company's holdings, net of debt, are worth 21 trillion yen, Son said.
Analysts say SoftBank would likely struggle to offload its large stake in companies like Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan without pushing down the stock price and a sale of its stake in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) is likely to entail a hefty tax bill.
And with many of its investments in unlisted, loss-making startups, investors remain dependent on SoftBank for disclosure of valuations.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.7 percent in early afternoon trading.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday outlined an incentive plan for the head of its self-driving car unit that points the way toward a possible initial public offering for the business.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker disclosed a long-term compensation plan that incentivizes Dan Ammann, chief executive of the Cruise unit, to develop the technology and commercial plans that could lead to the stock offering within 10 years, according GM's annual 10K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Ammann, who stepped down as GM's president and assumed the Cruise position at the start of the year, was awarded 16,914 restricted stock units for common shares of Cruise and stock options for 101,485 common shares of Cruise by the unit's board on Monday.
The incentives are based on meeting certain targets, including ""a change of control or initial public offering"" that occurs prior to the 10-year anniversary of the stock grant, according to the SEC filing.
Ammann stands to make at least about $25 million based on the stock units, which have a value of $1,515 a share, according to the filing. However, his compensation could be much more lucrative if an eventual IPO drives the value of the stock options far above their strike price of $1,515 a share.
""Mr. Ammann's compensation plan is consistent with CEO benchmarks from tech companies with similar market cap to Cruise and is heavily weighted toward the attainment of specific technology and commercial targets,"" GM spokesman Tom Henderson said in a telephone interview.
Analysts have speculated that GM eventually will sell shares in Cruise or spin it off. Cruise, with more than 1,100 employees, is aiming to launch a robo-taxi service by the end of 2019. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings that the Detroit automaker was making ""rapid progress"" with the technology, and the company's self-driving vehicle plans were ""not squishy at all."" 
""I think it's in a strong position from funding,"" she said. ""I think it's in a strong position as we continue to do the development."" 
Cruise has a value of about $14.6 billion despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch. Japanese technology investment fund SoftBank Group Corp and Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co invested a total of $5 billion for separate minority stakes in Cruise.
GM spent $700 million on Cruise last year and expects to spend another $1 billion on the unit this year, GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said on the earnings call.

Ammann joined GM in 2010 from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), where he was an adviser to GM's government-led bankruptcy restructuring in 2009. He became GM's president in 2014.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler, Bosch agree to pay $66 million in diesel legal fees: filing","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Robert Bosch have agreed to pay lawyers representing owners of U.S. diesel vehicles $66 million in fees and costs, according to court filing on Wednesday and people briefed on the matter.
In a court filing late on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, lawyer Elizabeth Cabraser said after negotiations overseen by court-appointed settlement master Ken Feinberg, the companies agreed not to oppose an award of $59 million in attorneys’ fees and $7 million in costs.
The lawyers had originally sought up to $106.5 million in fees and costs.
Under a settlement announced last month, Fiat Chrysler and Bosch, which provided emissions control software for the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, will give 104,000 diesel owners up to $307.5 million or about $2,800 per vehicle for diesel software updates.
The legal fees are on top of those costs. Fiat Chrysler and Bosch did not immediately comment late Wednesday.
Fiat Chrysler is paying up to $280 million, or 90 percent of the settlement costs, and Bosch is paying $27.5 million, or 10 percent. The companies are expected to divide the attorney costs under the same formula, meaning Fiat Chrysler will pay $60 million and Bosch $6 million, the people briefed on the settlement said.
U.S. District Judge Edward Chen must still approve the legal fees. He has set a May 3 hearing on a motion to grant final approval.
The Italian-American automaker on Jan. 10 announced it settled with the U.S. Justice Department, California and diesel owners over civil claims that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests.
Fiat Chrysler previously estimated the value of the settlements at about $800 million.
Fiat Chrysler is also paying $311 million in total civil penalties and issuing extended warranties worth $105 million, among other costs.
The settlement covers 104,000 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels from the model years 2014 to 2016.
In addition, Fiat Chrysler will pay $72.5 million for state civil penalties and $33.5 million to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims.
The hefty penalty was the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules. 

The Justice Department has a pending criminal investigation against Fiat Chrysler.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 10:09PM ET</span>",U.S. banks weigh whether to embrace or avoid progressive firebrand Ocasio-Cortez,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Court, avoid or sideline? 
Barely a month into the new Congress, financial lobbyists in Washington are already strategizing how to handle the star power of rookie Democrat lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The Democratic Socialist and Wall Street critic joined the 60-member House Financial Services Committee in mid-January and more than a dozen lobbyists interviewed by Reuters say the 29-year-old activist and former bartender is too high-profile to ignore.
Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, said he had not encountered a lawmaker like Ocasio-Cortez in more than 20 years in Washington. ""She has the ability to influence unlike a lot of other freshmen."" 
The youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez has become a social media phenomenon with her posts and live-streams on everything from climate change to skin care tips attracting millions of followers across Twitter and Instagram.
The New York native has proved adept at using humor to explain complex concepts or rebuke opponents, often while preparing dinner or hanging out in her pajamas. A video of the lawmaker dancing outside her Congressional office last month has been viewed 21 million times.
An economics major and self-confessed ""science nerd,"" Ocasio-Cortez campaigned on issues that put her at odds with the financial industry, including separating commercial and investment banking, breaking up large banks, and forgiving student debt. 
Central to her campaign has been the rejection of corporate campaign dollars, closing off a traditional avenue for industry access and influence on Capitol Hill.
Now lobbyists fear that her enlarged platform will help the first-term junior lawmaker push her ideas into the mainstream and are trying to figure out how best to respond.
Lobbyists representing big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which have embraced progressive causes such as diversity, inclusion, gun control or above-minimum wages, want to push these credentials. They also want to highlight how they employ thousands of people in Ocasio-Cortez's district in Queens and the Bronx, they said. 
Smaller and mid-size firms, meanwhile, want to distance themselves from Wall Street titans and emphasize their critical role as community lenders.
Several financial lobbyists, noting she lacks a financial services background, said they were keen to meet with Ocasio-Cortez to explain their business models and issues. 
Paul Merski, executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers of America, said the group had contacted the lawmaker's office and was hoping to schedule a meeting. He added his focus would be to draw the distinction between larger financial firms and ICBA's members, which as small community lenders have built-up ""tremendous goodwill"" across the aisle.
Spokespeople for JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a Capitol Hill event on Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez said the appointment of progressives like her to the panel ""sends a very powerful message"" to the financial industry. 
She said she wanted to pursue aggressive oversight and expose financial corporations' role in broader areas of concern, such as the detention of children in privately-funded facilities on the Mexico border.
""We can leap back in and say, what does a responsible financial sector look like?""
""LIKE TALKING TO THE FBI""
Other lobbyists worry, however, engaging her could backfire, especially if Ocasio-Cortez uses social media to publicize the meeting. For example, she went on Twitter to name and shame corporate lobbyists at a Congressional freshman orientation event in December. 
""The fear is, it's like going in to talk to the FBI, anything you do or say can be used against you,"" said one lobbyist for a major bank.
Lobbyists note how Ocasio-Cortez has already ignited a public debate on climate change and inequality by calling for a Green New Deal and proposing a 70 percent tax on income exceeding $10 million, an idea Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman has endorsed.
Waleed Shahid, a former campaign aide and a spokesman for Justice Democrats, the progressive group that recruited Ocasio-Cortez, said her ability to raise public awareness about complex issues had caught the establishment's attention. 
""She can really explain what is happening with Wall Street in a way the public can understand it, and that's why Wall Street is terrified.""
Speaking to Reuters, Ocasio-Cortez did not rule out listening to industry concerns to arrive at responsible regulation, but said ""they have more than enough sympathetic ears"" on the committee.
""We also saw in 2008 just a lot of advocacy for policies that were at its core totally irresponsible. But they were dressed up as conservative fair-minded measures,"" she added. 
Saikat Chakrabarti, her chief of staff, tweeted in response to this story that the Congresswoman was ""here to hold Wall Street accountable."" Her policy advisor Dan Riffle later tweeted: ""Proposal: let's take bank lobbyist meetings, but only if they agree to having it live-streamed.""
The financial industry faced a similar challenge in 2012 when newly elected progressive firebrand Elizabeth Warren joined the Senate Banking Committee and her grilling of bank executives and regulators won her a national following. 
But while Warren was well-known as a consumer advocate before joining Congress, she did not have the same social media platform as Ocasio-Cortez. Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based boutique investment bank Compass Point Research & Trading, said that whichever bank slips up next will get ""taken to the woodshed in a way that we haven't seen before."" 
Often caught flatfooted by Warren, the industry hopes to rebuild bipartisan support it enjoyed in Congress before the 2007-09 financial crisis. And with many incumbent centrist Democrats smarting after Ocasio-Cortez called them out for doing big business's bidding, some see an opportunity to divide and conquer.
Several lobbyists told Reuters they believed they could isolate Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives on the financial services committee by building coalitions with moderate Democrats, such as fellow New York Representative Gregory Meeks, and centrist Republicans.
They said they would also lean on Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat and a liberal who has pledged to work across the aisle, to rein in the progressive wing.
A spokeswoman for Waters declined to comment.

In a statement, Meeks said his priority this Congress would be to promote policies that ""support our financial system, but ensure everyone benefits from its successes.""

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present.
In a report to state regulators https:// PG&E said it would also remove 375,000 trees near electricity lines, trim vegetation over 2,500 square miles (6,475 square km) and conduct thousands of inspections to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.
PG&E is under intense scrutiny for its role in sparking more than a dozen wildfires over the past two years. It filed bankruptcy last month, citing anticipated liabilities, including the possibility its equipment set off November's deadly Camp Fire, which destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people. 
The San Francisco-based utility, which serves 16 million customers, said it would increase nearly tenfold its efforts to turn off the power to communities threatened by wildfire, increasing the number of households and businesses potentially affected by fire-prevention blackouts in 2019 to 5.4 million.
Such shutoffs were also used last year to keep live electricity in the lines from setting off a fire when high winds and heat hit extreme levels and nearby brush or trees could be ignited. 
Mark Toney, who directs the utility consumer advocacy group the Utility Reform Network (TURN), said shutting off power would harm vulnerable people, including those who rely on electricity to power life-saving medical equipment.
""The fact that there is such a dramatic expansion of power shutoffs as a strategy to stop wildfires is a sign of PG&E’s failure and mismanagement when it comes to trimming the trees and taking care of the grid,"" he said.
PG&E spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said the company would only turn off the power to a community as a last resort to keep people safe.
""We understand and appreciate that turning off the power affects the operation of critical facilities, communications systems and much more,"" she said.
The company is also on probation in relation to a criminal conviction in the deadly 2010 explosion of one of its natural gas lines in the city of San Bruno near San Francisco.
The judge in that case said he would consider the company's wildfire plan in deciding whether PG&E should do more to prevent wildfire. 

California law requires all investor-owned utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans annually.

The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee focused on a bipartisan bill called the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which would require background checks for all firearm sales and most firearm transfers. It has 230 House co-sponsors, including five Republicans.
""Despite the obvious need to address the source of gun violence, Congress, for too long, has done virtually nothing. But now, we begin a new chapter,"" said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat. 
Democrats won control of the House in the November elections after eight years of Republican rule, partly because of public frustration over the inability of Congress to address a growing number of mass shootings at schools and other public venues.
Wednesday's hearing took place a week ahead of the first anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which claimed the lives of 17 students and staff and launched a national youth movement that has reignited the long-running U.S. debate over gun rights.
But there was no sign that any gun legislation approved by the Democratic House majority would gain traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Witnesses at the hearing also called for legislation to address gun trafficking between states, a ban against assault rifles, the repeal of a federal law that protects the gun industry from lawsuits, and increased funding for federal officials charged with policing the flow of firearms across the country.
The U.S. Constitution protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The measure is fiercely defended by Republicans, who on Wednesday warned that new legislation could lead to a national gun registry and claimed that expanded background checks would not protect people from gun crime.
""The greatest cruelty in the world is to tell people you will help in their situation with legislation and then try to pass off legislation that would do nothing,"" said Representative Doug Collins, the Judiciary Committee's top Republican. ""In legal terms, that's called fraud.""
Witnesses said the legislation would close loopholes exploited by online gun dealers and those who purchase guns for others unwilling or unable to buy their own.
""This bill will definitely save lives,"" Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told lawmakers.

Of the close to 40,000 deaths from gun violence in 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in December that 60 percent were self-inflicted.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 07:25PM ET</span>",Weak U.S. profit picture may not be so bad: Credit Suisse,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As some market watchers brace for a potential U.S. earnings recession this year, one prominent equity strategist says the picture is not as bad as feared.
Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York, said the sharp decline in 2019 estimates actually stems from poor forecasts from a small group of heavily-weighted companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and energy names hit by weakness in oil prices.
Excluding the impact of the receding benefits from the Trump administration's corporate tax cuts that began a year ago, projected growth for the median S&P 500 company looks more like 6 percent in the first quarter from the same period last year, Credit Suisse estimates. 
That is well above aggregate forecasts for the S&P 500, with first-quarter 2019 profit growth now estimated at just 0.3 percent, based on IBES data from Refinitiv. 
First-quarter estimates from FactSet are even weaker, with S&P 500 companies now projected to report a year-over-year decline in earnings.
The collapse in 2019 estimates has triggered talk of an earnings recession - defined as at least two consecutive quarters of profit declines - which would be the first for the S&P 500 since one that ran from July 2015 through June of 2016. 
""A lot of folks are hitting the panic button, and it's not really the right way to think about this. You have to look at what's really going on,"" Golub said.
The growth rates for 2019 are much slower than for 2018 largely because the tax cuts fueled a sharp pickup in growth starting in the first quarter of last year. 
The lower tax rates added about 7 to 8 percentage points to earnings growth in 2018, but will likely have a negative impact of 1 percentage point on the first quarter, based on Credit Suisse data.
""When you look at the taxes, we all made the assumption that the taxes were going to jump down (and) you were going to be left with a flat tax rate going forward. That's mostly true, but it's not entirely true. In fact, you have about a 1 percent drag on earnings coming from taxes,"" in the first quarter, Golub said.
That is likely the result of the loss of one-time favorable items including accelerated depreciation of capital expenditures, which jumped in the first part of 2018, he and other Credit Suisse strategists said. 
Moreover, oil prices went from being a support to an obstacle, while some top tech names are expected to contribute much less to the overall S&P 500 growth rate, Golub said.
Apple last week said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street had expected as it faces weak demand for the iPhone.
""It's a small handful of things that are coincidentally happening at the same time,"" he said.

Year-over-year profits grew 26.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018, according to Refinitiv.

""I believe their image rehabilitation is close to complete,"" said Doug Ciocca, the CEO of Kavar Capital Partners, which does not currently own shares in Chipotle but has positions in other restaurant companies.
Brian Niccol, who was installed as Chipotle's CEO a year ago after a successful stint at Taco Bell, has focused on improving the company's food delivery through promotions, while also transforming the restaurant experience with new technology.
For example, Chipotle offered free delivery during the College Bowl season in December, and gave away its much loved guacamole for free for those ordering through its app on ""National Avocado Day"" last year.
Such promotions, besides tie-ups with food-delivery services Doordash and Postmates, helped ""digital sales"" rise nearly 66 percent in the December quarter, compared with about 48 percent in the previous quarter.
""We're going all in on providing more convenient user access to our customers and the response so far has been great,"" Chief Financial Officer John Hartung said in an interview. ""You'll see more of that during the year.""
The company reported that sales at outlets open for at least 13 months jumped 6.1 percent in the three months ended December, much better than Wall Street analysts' average forecast of a 4.49 percent increase, according to IBES Refinitiv data.

The burrito chain projected that these sales would rise in the mid-single percentage digits through 2019, and that they were improving mainly due to stronger traffic at restaurants and a higher average check boosted by menu price increases.
Its newer menus have included salad bowls and other items to draw more health-minded customers, such as those on the popular Paleo diet. It is also working to add innovative options like bacon, quesadillas and a Mexican chocolate milkshake.
Excluding one-time charges, the company reported earnings of $1.72 per share, topping analysts' estimates of $1.37.
Revenue overall rose 10.4 percent to $1.23 billion.

Chipotle also announced that it would spend $100 million to buy back shares.

(Reuters) - GoPro Inc reported its first profit in five quarters on Wednesday and topped Wall Street estimates for revenue, as it cut costs and saw strong demand for the latest action cameras from its flagship HERO line.
GoPro, whose mounted cameras are used by everyone from action junkies to Instagram travel bloggers, has launched cheaper cameras to drive demand, exited a failing drone business and become leaner through job cuts, helping it revive profit margins. Still, its action cameras face stiff competition from ever-improving cameras on smartphones.
GoPro shares rose 2 percent in after-hours trading, paring gains from an initial 10 percent jump.
In the fourth quarter ended December, GoPro gained market share in Asian markets including Japan, China, Korea and Thailand, while in the United States it had an 87 percent share of the action camera market by units, the San Mateo, California-based company said.
""It appears that GoPro accurately planned its Q4 inventory,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese. ""HERO7 Black sold very well in Q4, driving ASPs 20 percent higher,"" she said, referring to average selling prices.
GoPro's HERO 7 Black camera, which carries a $400 price tag, was its top-selling product in the December quarter without discounting, Chief Financial Officer Brian McGee said on a conference call with analysts.
The company also projected revenue of between $510 million and $550 million for the first half of 2019.
""With this momentum and a continued focus on expense management, we're planning for growth and profitability in 2019,"" GoPro Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Woodman said in a statement.
The company reported a net income of $32 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a net loss of $55.9 million a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 30 cents per share, above analysts' estimate of 26 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue surged 13 percent to $377 million, exceeding analysts' average estimate of $374.2 million.

(Reuters) -  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH) beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit on Wednesday as its popular dating app, Tinder, attracted more subscribers, sending its shares up as much as 12 percent in extended trading.
Match has been investing heavily in Tinder and its other dating services as it looks to grab a bigger slice of the online dating market, which is estimated to touch $12 billion in 2020 by Nomura analysts.
Tinder — which has made ""swipe left"" and ""swipe right"" a point of pop culture conversations - added 233,000 average subscribers in the quarter, bringing its total average subscriber count to 4.3 million, or 1.2 million more than a year earlier.
Overall subscribers at Match rose to 8.2 million.
Match said it earned 58 cents per user on average, 3 cents more than last year as more users shifted to its premium services such as Tinder Gold.
Tinder Gold and Tinder Plus offer features such as unlimited likes, the ability to take back an accidental swipe and better profile visibility for a fee.
Marketing push leads to Tinder Growth png - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TyQXGN 
The company, however, forecast first-quarter revenue of $455 million to $465 million, below analysts' estimates of $469.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said a strong dollar weighed on its forecast.
Match said it also expects first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $150 million to $155 million. Analysts were expecting $155.28 million.
Operating expenses rose about 22 percent in the fourth quarter as Match boosted marketing spend on its money-spinner Tinder in emerging markets, including India and Latin America, while ramping up other services such as PlentyOfFish and Hinge.
The company faces stiff competition from a host of rivals including Bumble, which recently launched its app in India, a market with huge potential for dating-related services.
Total revenue rose 20.7 percent to $457.34 million, beating estimates of about $448.5 million.
Net earnings attributable to Match Group shareholders was $115.5 million, or 39 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $9 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Match earned 43 cents per share, beating estimates of 38 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's shares were up 10.3 percent at $58.54. They have risen nearly 73 percent in the last 12 months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co and Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA said on Wednesday that their chief executives plan to testify at a Senate hearing on rising prescription drug prices later this month.
They join Merck & Co CEO Ken Frazier, who said on Tuesday that he would testify at the Feb. 26 hearing.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Wednesday that Jennifer Taubert, its head of global pharmaceuticals, would represent the healthcare conglomerate at the hearing. 
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, ranking member of the committee on Monday invited executives from seven pharmaceutical companies to testify at the hearing. 
The other companies invited to send executives are  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) and AstraZeneca Plc . 
Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt currently serves as chairman of drug industry lobby group PhRMA. Bristol-Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio is the group's chairman-elect. Albert Bourla, who became Pfizer CEO last month, will represent the largest U.S. drugmaker at the hearing. 
The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.
Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.
Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign.
Drugmakers have slowed and limited U.S. price increases as scrutiny on their practices has intensified over the past few years. 

They nonetheless increased prices on hundreds of drugs in January, including a 6.2 percent increase on the world's top-selling drug - AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira - and hikes on insulin prices by Sanofi and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb).

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) won back its crown as the most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Wednesday, ending the session with a market capitalization above recent leaders Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Apple edged up 0.03 percent, putting its market value at $821.5 billion. Microsoft's market capitalization ended at $813.4 billion after its stock dipped 1.11 percent, while Amazon's stock market value finished the day at $805.7 billion, in third place, after its shares slid 1.12 percent.
Apple's stock has risen about 13 percent since its quarterly earnings report on Jan. 29, with investors betting it was oversold following months of concern about a slowdown in iPhone demand and the company's rare revenue warning on Jan. 2 related to soft demand in China.
But slowing iPhone sales have led to lower expectations for Apple's stock. The average analyst price target for Apple has fallen from $240 three months ago to $175, less than a dollar more than its current stock price of $174.24. 
Apple's rising valuation - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UMQGR0
After touching a record $1.1 trillion last October, Apple's market capitalization fell gradually, and it was overtaken in December by Amazon and Microsoft, which have taken turns in the top position since then. 
Apple's stock market value hit a low of $675 billion on Jan. 3 after its revenue warning, but then steadily recovered, helped in part by a quarterly report that was better than feared by investors.
While Apple has gained in recent sessions, Microsoft and Amazon's shares fell after their quarterly reports. Amazon has declined almost 5 percent since Thursday, when it forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates and said it would step up investments in 2019.
""That has raised some eyebrows, it's a perception that Amazon may be settling into a more mature phase in terms of growth,"" said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta. 
Morgan owns shares in Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, but he said that if forced to choose, he would favor Amazon because of its lead in cloud-computing market share.

Microsoft's stock is about flat from last Wednesday, when the software maker met targets for its quarterly results and forecast.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Wednesday as videogame makers gave disappointing revenue forecasts and investors awaited developments on U.S.-China trade relations.
The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were weighed by declines in shares of  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA), which tumbled 13.3 percent after the videogame publisher forecast full-year revenue below Wall Street estimates. The sharp drop pulled down shares of rival videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI), which fell 10.1 percent.
Shares of industry peer Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc also dropped sharply, 13.8 percent, after the company's similarly underwhelming forecast.
The slump in videogame stocks contributed to a 1.5 percent decline in the S&P 500 communication services sector, the largest drop among the S&P's major sectors.
Despite the fall, Wall Street's indexes remained near two-month highs. A 7.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 would put the index above its record closing September high.
""The market is feeling a little exhausted after we've had a nice run in January and early February,"" said Nathan Thooft, global head of asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
Investors cited a void of catalysts for market gains.
""Trade talks are probably the thing that's really intriguing to the market, but that's in March,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, referring to the deadline for the United States and China to reach a trade agreement before additional tariffs go into effect.

Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions Inc jumped 11.5 percent after the company announced $2 billion in stock buybacks, while shares of Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) rose 7.3 percent after the company suggested the chipmaker industry was close to recovery from its recent downturn.
Shares of Capri Holdings Ltd, formerly Michael Kors, climbed 11.3 percent after the fashion company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its revenue forecast.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) shares slid 7.4 percent after the oil and gas producer's fourth-quarter profit missed analyst estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 17 new lows.

On average, economists expect that claims for first-time initial jobless benefits to fall to 221,000, according to Investing.com.
Claims are expected to ease following the sharpest spike in a year last week following the Federal government shutdown. Nonfarm payrolls for January posted a better-than-expected gain, by contrast."
65,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 03:39PM ET</span>","Take-Two, EA forecasts spark concerns as 'Fortnite', 'PUBG' win over gamers","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Videogame publisher Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc joined rival Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) in forecasting full-year revenue below Wall Street estimates, adding to fears that competition from free-to-play battle royale games ""Fortnite"" and ""PUBG"" was eating into sales.
Shares of Take-Two fell about 10 percent, while those of Electronic Arts dropped 15 percent. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which is set to report results next week, declined 9 percent. 
The battle royale format, which allows dozens of players to battle each other to the death until the last survivor, became wildly popular in 2018 thanks to the two games that have also helped attract newer audiences to gaming.
EA cut its annual revenue outlook as its newest ""Battlefield"" title sold about a million fewer units than expected, partly blaming competition from games such as ""Fortnite"" and ""Red Dead Redemption 2"".
""I think that there is certainly an element of the market and the competitive nature of the market that amplified or magnified some of the challenges we've had,"" the company's Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wilson said on a post earnings call on Tuesday.
The Redwood City, California-based company cut its adjusted revenue projections for the year ending March to about $4.75 billion from $5.20 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $4.88 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, Take-Two Chief Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick said the company's sales have been unaffected despite ""Fortnite's"" massive popularity.
""We continue to have stellar results despite the fact that there are competitive titles in the market, including Fortnite,"" Zelnick said on a post-earnings call.
Take-Two said its western adventure blockbuster ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" had sold 23 million units since its launch on Oct. 26.

The company raised its full-year adjusted revenue forecast range to between $2.89 billion and $2.94 billion, but that was still below analysts' average estimate of $2.98 billion.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer watchdog revisits scaling back payday lending rules,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog on Wednesday proposed reviewing a rule cracking down on payday lenders, a move consumer advocates and some lawmakers blasted as a further sign the Trump administration is going easy on predatory lenders.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is revisiting the payday lending rule, drawn up under the Obama administration, after payday lenders complained its ""ability-to-repay"" requirement would hurt the industry and consumers. 
The proposal to repeal the ability-to-repay provision, which was due to go into effect in August, is the first big move by director Kathy Kraninger, a former Office of Management and Budget official who took over as CFPB director in December.
""The Bureau will evaluate the comments, weigh the evidence, and then make its decision,"" said Kraninger, who added that she anticipates working with state and federal regulators to enforce the law against bad actors.
Payday loans are small and short term, typically due with a borrower's next paycheck. Lenders argue they provide borrowers with critical stopgap funding, and warned the rule would effectively eliminate a product that can be a financial lifeline for many who lack access to more traditional banking products.
But consumer advocates have long criticized the loans for saddling borrowers with annualized interest rates that often reach several hundred percent.
""Eliminating these common sense protections will result in millions of hardworking families trapped in a cycle of debt and poverty,"" said U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democratic member on the Senate Banking panel.
""Stripping the key protections of this rule is a disservice to the public. With little accountability for their actions, payday lenders have long preyed upon communities of color and drained them of their hard-earned savings,"" said Hilary O. Shelton, a senior vice president with the NAACP Washington Bureau.
The provision, conceived by Obama-era CFPB director Richard Cordray, requires payday lenders to determine that the consumer has the means to repay the loan as well as meet other living expenses, when it comes due typically within 30 days.
The bureau first said it planned to revisit the rule in October 2018 under then-interim director and White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney. He had said the rule would hurt the industry and deprive consumers of critical stop-gap funding. 
The CFPB was created in the wake of the 2007-09 global financial crisis to crack down on predatory lenders. Mulvaney and his fellow Republicans have long criticized the agency, saying it drastically overstepped its mandate under Cordray. 
""Implementing this ability-to-repay provision was not a mandate by Congress, but an exercise of the agency's discretionary jurisdiction. We are revisiting it to be certain that the legal basis is robust enough to continue to support the rule,"" an agency official told reporters on Wednesday.
The CFPB, which worked on the rule for five years, estimated it would lower the industry's revenue by two-thirds.
In a separate proposal, the agency said it was seeking industry comment to delay the implementation of the ability-to-repay provision by three months to Nov. 19, 2019.
This proposal, if adopted after 30 days, would allow the agency more time to re-consider the underwriting provision before mandating payday lending firms to comply with it.
It does not hinder its ability to enforce other components of the payday lending rule, CFPB officials told reporters.
""We are pleased that the CFPB is going to delay the payday rule for further consideration,"" said Dan Berger, who leads the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions.

""We support the removal of problematic ability to repay portions of the rule, but we also want to ensure, that going forward, the egregious practices of certain payday lenders are addressed.""

STOCKHOLM/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - EQT, the largest private equity firm in the Nordic region, is planning a Stockholm listing that could take place in the third quarter with the aim of raising about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A stake of about 25 percent could be sold in an initial public offering (IPO), potentially valuing EQT at about 4 billion euros (41.7 billion Swedish crowns), the sources told Reuters, declining to be named because the plans were private.
The company has previously said it was considering options to strengthen its balance sheet but it had not indicated whether this would involve an IPO and has not indicated a specific timing, the stake to be offered or any potential valuation.
Marcus Brennecke, partner and co-head of EQT's advisory team, said on Wednesday that EQT had hired JP Morgan and SEB to assist with a possible IPO or ""something else"" this year if the market environment was right.
He did not give further details. 
The first source told Reuters that a listing of EQT could be in the second quarter ""if all stars align"" but was more likely to be in the third quarter. He said no final decision had been taken on an IPO and all options were still open.
Despite investor concerns about a U.S.-Chinese trade row and Brexit, another source said EQT was still drawing interest because of its involvement in a range of industries and broad geographic presence, with offices in Europe, the United States and Asia.
The trade row and concerns about whether Britain will leave the European Union with a deal on its future relations with the bloc have hit other private equity firms in recent months, so an IPO by EQT will be watched closely.
Listed private equity funds are relatively rare in Europe, with the majority in the United States, where firms such as Blackstone (NYSE:BX), KKR and Carlyle have been able to diversify and style themselves as alternative asset managers.

MONTREAL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harsh winter weather and the partial U.S. government shutdown boosted demand for private jets in January, according to three business aviation companies that recently reported an uptick last month in deep-pocketed travelers seeking alternatives to commercial flying.
Business jets fly through regional airports which were less exposed than major hubs to weather-related delays and unpredictable security lines during a 35-day government shutdown that ended on Jan. 25. 
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said many employees, who went unpaid during the shutdown, did not report to work due to financial hardship. Congressional negotiators are working to avert another shutdown on Feb. 15.
""The combination of frigid temperatures and the TSA issues caused during the shutdown had a lot of people calling us in January,"" said Patrick Gallagher, executive vice president, sales and marketing of NetJets, the world's largest private jet company.
U.S.-based NetJets, owned by Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa), saw customer flight hours rise more than 9 percent for most of January on an annual basis.
James Elian, president and chief operating officer of Canada's AirSprint, said the private aviation company's daily U.S. flights avoid potential congestion at major hubs where the need to de-ice planes, for example, contributes to delays.
Together, the three largest U.S. airlines American Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines canceled roughly 11,500 flights in January due to weather or air traffic control issues, similar to combined cancellations in January, 2018.
Private aviation accounts for a tiny fraction of total air travel because the cost of flying private, while varying widely by plane size and company, is out of reach for most passengers.
For example, a one-way flight from Los Angeles to New York would cost around $1,500 in a commercial airline's first-class cabin, said Adam Twidell, chief executive of Private Fly, a digital booking platform for on-demand private jets. He said the same flight would cost around $3,500 to $4,000 per person on a fully-booked business jet with around 10 seats.
Passengers who can afford it will spend more to fly private if it means avoiding lengthy delays, Twidell said. Private Fly, for one, booked a private flight for corporate clients who had been stranded for 10 hours at Boston Logan airport in late January, he said. 

""Clients will wait a certain amount of time to try and solve their delays through scheduled airlines, but when they can't wait any longer, the extra cost of private aviation is something they are prepared to pay for.""

73,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","High-margin pickup trucks drive GM profit, shares rise","By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday reported a quarterly profit that exceeded Wall Street expectations, thanks to high-margin pickup trucks and small SUVs in the U.S. market and cost cutting.
All of the No. 1 U.S. automaker's profit came from North America, where those lucrative models helped overcome an overall drop in the number of vehicles it sold. The company's operations in China and South America combined added nothing to the company's bottom line in the quarter. Shares rose 1.4 percent.
The stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, driven by strong U.S. results, stood in contrast to the job cuts GM has begun to make in its salaried and hourly workforces. 
The Detroit automaker has received political blowback, including from U.S. President Donald Trump, after announcing in late November it would not allocate new product to five plants in North America that mostly produce less-popular sedan models, indicating they will likely close. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has made it clear that, despite the criticism, the cutbacks are necessary for the automaker's long-term financial stability and to pay for the development of electric and self-driving vehicles. 
""We can't run at a 70 percent utilization,"" Barra said Wednesday about the company's plant usage rate. ""We had to improve that ... It's a transition we have to go through."" An industry rule of thumb is that automakers' lose money when plants operate below 80 percent capacity.
Barra also cited the company's efforts to shift many of the affected hourly workers to other plants, lessening the impact of the cuts among blue-collar workers. 
GM said Monday it was starting to cut about 4,000 salaried workers in the latest round of restructuring announced in November.
It said then it would take pre-tax charges of $3 billion to $3.8 billion to pay for the cutbacks, but expected the actions to improve annual free cash flow by $6 billion by the end of 2020. GM has said commodity and trade costs would hurt 2019 results by $1 billion. 
GM said on Wednesday that China's $300 million in operating earnings in the fourth quarter was offset by other international markets. It sold fewer vehicles in China, its largest market by volume, and said weak currencies in South America had also impacted results. 
""Our outlook for China overall is for the auto industry to be flat year over year,"" Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters. ""If you take a look at some of these economic indicators coming out of China, there are early signs of stabilization.""
Buckingham Research analyst Joseph Amaturo said in a research note he remains concerned longer-term about vehicle pricing in China and North America, as well as demand in China. If China slumps, GM would be challenged to hit its financial targets, he said.
Late last month, rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co posted a lower fourth-quarter profit as losses in every region except North America weighed on results.
Earlier Wednesday, Toyota Motor Corp posted a slightly higher profit as demand for its bread-and-butter car models from cost-conscious Chinese buyers helped offset weak North American sales of its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and Camry.
U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to drop in 2019 due to rising interest rates and competition from a surfeit of cheaper, nearly-new used vehicles on the market.
On Wednesday, GM reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.1 billion, or $1.40 per share, versus a loss of $5.2 billion, or $3.65 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.43, above the $1.22 analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES had expected.
It reported a fourth-quarter loss in 2017 to adjust for an overhaul of the U.S. tax system. Excluding those charges, the automaker had reported net income of $2.4 billion.

The company maintained its full-year 2019 adjusted earnings forecast of between $6.50 and $7 per share.

(Reuters) - The New York Times Co beat forecasts for both profit and revenue in the last three months of 2018 as it added another 265,000 digital subscribers, the biggest quarterly jump since the months after the 2016 elections.
The New York Times, the beneficiary of a ""Trump bump"" from two years of attacks by President Donald Trump on the paper, said it was now targeting 10 million subscribers by 2025, compared to 4.3 million currently.
Shares of the 167-year old newspaper rose 8.9 percent in Wednesday morning trade after it published results for the fourth quarter, adding to a roughly 21 percent gain so far in 2019.
The company's digital advertising revenue rose 22.8 percent to $103.4 million in the quarter, while print advertising revenue fell another 10.2 percent.
Against the backdrop of digital media companies such as Vice Media LLC and BuzzFeed deciding to cut jobs to rein in costs, Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson said the Times would be investing more not less in reporting.
""How will we go about meeting this new goal? First, journalism,"" Thompson said on a conference call. 
Revenue from the Times' digital-only subscription products, which gives readers access to news as well as its sought-after daily crossword puzzles and cooking recipes, rose 9.3 percent to $105.3 million in the quarter. 
Net income attributable to shareholders was $55.2 million, or 33 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $56.8 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company booked one-time charges related to tax reform and pension settlements.
Total revenue rose to $502.7 million from $484.1 million a year earlier, which included an additional week. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 32 cents per share from continuing operations.

Analysts on average estimated a profit of 28 cents per share and revenue of $477.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS has received approval from a London court to move up to 32 billion euros ($36.44 billion) in assets from Britain to Germany as part of plans to keep business in the European Union after Brexit.
UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, received approval from Judge Alastair Norris on Tuesday to transfer operations from UBS Limited, its London-based subsidiary primarily handling investment banking activities, to Frankfurt-domiciled UBS Europe SE on March 1.
A UBS spokeswoman confirmed the court's decision.
The Swiss banking group is the latest financial institution to disclose a material transfer of its business away from London ahead of Britain's departure from the EU on March 29.
British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) was granted permission to transfer 190 billion euros in assets to its Dublin-based subsidiary so it could continue to serve its EU clients in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
UBS's plans could be deferred until July 24 at the latest if the bank ""receives sufficient comfort before then that suitable transition arrangements have been agreed by the U.K. and the EU,"" according to court filings cited by Bloomberg, which first reported the court's decision.
Last year, UBS had said in its annual report that it would merge its British entity with the German headquartered European bank in the absence of a transition deal between the EU and Britain prior to the March 29 departure date. 
The bank also said it would look to move fewer than 200 of its roughly 5,000 London-based staff from Britain as part of its Brexit preparations, to Frankfurt and other locations.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 10:17AM ET</span>","Spotify posts first ever operating profit, but cautious outlook for 2019","By Helena Soderpalm and Olof Swahnberg
(Reuters) - Spotify posted its first ever quarterly operating profit on Wednesday driven by a strong gross margin and slower-than-expected headcount growth, but it warned of a loss in 2019 and issued modest forecasts which disappointed investors.
The world's most popular paid music streaming service, which has said it prioritizes growth over profitability, posted fourth-quarter sales in line with expectations and said it had seen growth in most of its markets.
Despite surprising with its swing to profit, Spotify's shares fell 4 percent in early trade.
The company, which had a gross profit margin of 26.7 percent in the fourth quarter, said it expected this to deteriorate to 22.5-24.5 in the first quarter and to 22-25 percent in 2019, compared with analysts expectations of 26 percent for the year.
Its other guidance for 2019 was also cautious.
Spotify said it expected a loss of 200-360 million euros in 2019 and that sales would grow 21-29 percent.
Some analysts have highlighted Spotify's slowing rate of annual revenue growth after sales grew 29 percent in 2018, down from 39 percent in 2017 and 52 percent in 2016.
""Investors overall are worried about global growth and all companies which are growth-cases and give weak guidance tend to see falling share prices,"" said Tomas Otterbeck, an analyst at research firm Redeye
""[Forecast] Growth in users, revenue and loss were all on the weak side for 2019, which I think is behind the lower share price. I think investors are particularly worried about user growth,"" he added. 
Operating in nearly 80 countries, Spotify said its total number of users, including of its ad-supported service, grew to 207 million in 2018, up from 191 million at the end of September.
The service, which launched in Sweden in 2008, has reached 96 million paying subscribers. That compares with around 50 million paying subscribers for its closest rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's Apple Music, which launched in 2015. 
It forecast 117-127 million premium subscribers by the end of 2019, compared with analysts' average forecast of 121 million. 
""Growth in users is the main focus for Spotify at the moment, the potential market is in the billions,"" said Joakim Dal, fund manager and partner at GP Bullhound.
""I expect the company to continue to invest heavily to gain customers and to improve its product to attract new customers and keep current users,"" he said, adding it was reasonable for Spotify to forecast a full-year loss.
Spotify's fourth-quarter operating profit stood at 94 million euros ($107 million) compared with a mean forecast for a loss of 16 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts. In the same period last year it posted a loss of 87 million euros. Sales rose by 30 percent in the fourth-quarter, in line with the 31 percent seen by analysts.
Nicholas Hyett, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said Spotify's core business was looking ""increasingly comfortable"".
""While expansion into another 13 countries and development of advertising and artist tools is holding back the bottom line, it’s not a long term problem,"" he said in a note.
    Spotify is keen to develop new music services and additional content during 2019 with a ""two-sided marketplace"" that connects both artists and recording industry labels to consumers but in non-traditional ways.
Spotify said it would acquire podcast companies Gimlet Media Inc and Anchor for an undisclosed amount.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 09:45AM ET</span>","French, German farmers destroy crops after GMOs found in Bayer seeds","By Sybille de La Hamaide
PARIS (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) said on Wednesday that farmers in France and Germany were digging up thousands of hectares of rapeseed fields after traces of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) banned for cultivation were found in seeds sold by the company.
GMO crops are widely grown across the world, but they remain controversial in Europe, where very few varieties are authorized for growing and some countries like France have completely outlawed their cultivation, citing environmental risks.
Checks by the French authorities during the autumn showed minute quantities of GMO seeds, estimated at less than 0.005 percent of the volume, in three batches of rapeseed seeds sold under the Dekalb brand, Catherine Lamboley, Bayer's chief operating officer for France, said.
Dekalb was previously a  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) brand before the U.S. company was taken over by Bayer last year. 
The GMO found, which is a rapeseed variety grown in Canada, is not authorized for cultivation in Europe, although it is allowed in imports destined for food and animal feed, Lamboley said.
Bayer issued a product recall but some of the seed had already been sown, representing about 8,000 hectares in France and 2,500-3,000 hectares in Germany, which are in the process of being dug up, Bayer said.
It was not yet known what caused the contamination of the rapeseed seeds, produced in Argentina in a GMO-free area, Lamboley said.
""We decided to immediately stop all rapeseed seed production in Argentina,"" she told Reuters in a phone interview.
Bayer's Argentine rapeseed seeds were destined for the European market and represent 12 percent of its rapeseed supply for France, the company added.
Bayer declined to estimate the overall cost of the GMO contamination but said it will offer compensation of 2,000 euros ($2,277.80) per hectare to affected farmers, suggesting a payout of around 20 million euros in France and Germany.
The compensation reflected the loss of rapeseed fields this season and the fact farmers would not be able to grow the crop next either as a precaution to avoid re-emergence of the GMO strain, Lamboley added.
The order to destroy some crops is another blow for European rapeseed growers who had already cut sowings sharply due to dry weather.
However, the area is small compared to the total French winter rapeseed area, which the farm ministry in December forecast at 1.23 million hectares. The corresponding German crop area is seen at close to 1 million hectares.

LYON, France (Reuters) - A decade-old lawsuit in which a French farmer with neurological problems accuses  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) of not providing adequate safety warnings for a weedkiller returns to court on Wednesday, adding to health claims faced by the Bayer-owned firm.
Paul Francois, who says he fell ill after inhaling vapor from weedkiller Lasso in 2004, won rulings in 2012 and 2015 that found Monsanto liable for the intoxication, before France's top court overturned those decisions and ordered a new hearing.
An appeal court in the southeastern French city of Lyon will hear arguments on Wednesday before giving its verdict at a later date.
Francois, who says he has suffered memory loss, headaches and stammering, blames Monsanto for not giving sufficient warnings on the product label.
""Maybe we'll lose against Monsanto but the real victory for me is that I have converted my 200-hectare farm to organic production,"" 55-year-old Francois told reporters before the hearing.
""This affair made me open my eyes and move towards a different kind of agriculture.""
Lasso was banned in France in 2007 after the product had already been withdrawn in some other countries.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) said it did not wish to comment specifically on the case until the ruling in the latest proceedings.
But it added in an emailed statement that ""the use of phytosanitary products does not pose any risk for human health when they are used according to the terms defined as part of the product authorization.""
Monsanto, acquired by Bayer last year, is also facing lawsuits in the United States over alleged cancer links to glyphosate-based weedkillers. Lasso used a different active substance to glyphosate.
Last year, the company was found to be liable for the terminal cancer of a school groundskeeper who had used glyphosate-based products.
It is appealing that verdict but faces another U.S. trial next month relating to a couple suffering from cancer.
In France, a court last month banned a version of Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller range on safety concerns.
Controversy over glyphosate has been fueled by a 2015 conclusion from the World Health Organisation's cancer agency that the substance was probably carcinogenic.
Glyphosate was originally developed by Monsanto but it is off-patent and marketed worldwide by dozens of other crop chemical makers.

After a heated European Union debate in 2017 that led to a five-year renewal for glyphosate's license, President Emmanuel Macron said France would aim to phase out the weedkiller in three years.

103,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>","Chip, electronics veterans join hardware-focused U.S. venture firm","By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Silicon Valley venture capital firm said Wednesday that two chip and manufacturing veterans are joining it as partners as an additional funding round brings its total capital to more than $1 billion.
Palo Alto, California-based Eclipse Ventures said that it has added as partners Mike McNamara, the former chief of contract manufacturing firm Flex Ltd, and Sanjay Jha, who led chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries after a career at Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and leading phone maker Motorola (NYSE:MSI) Mobility.
The firm, two of whose other partners came from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's manufacturing operations, also said it had closed a new $500 million fund, bringing the total it has raised for investment into startups since its founding in 2015 to $1.1 billion.
Eclipse is unusual among venture capital firms because it invests in companies that make hardware technologies as well as software.
Despite Silicon Valley's name - which derives from the raw material for computer chips - many venture investors prefer to stick to software, advertising and commerce companies. Hardware companies can require huge amounts of capital and face intense competition from both larger rivals and cheaper imitators.
Shares of smart speaker maker Sonos Inc, for example, have declined 34 percent since its initial public offering last year, as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) all rolled out competing products.
But Eclipse has funded U.S.-made drones, custom chips to help cameras recognize objects quickly and a startup making robots and software for manufacturing electronics.
Lior Susan, the firm's founding partner, said today's tech giants build both hardware and software, so he's willing to invest in both in hopes of finding the next one. Even  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which many investors think of as an advertising firm, spends billions of dollars on sprawling data centers and is hiring chip designers.
""If it makes sense for [a startup] to open their own factories, we're not going to say no just because it sounds hard,"" Susan told Reuters in an interview.
McNamara in October retired from contract manufacture Flex, which competes against assemblers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd's Foxconn and has built devices for Fitbit among others. He said he is hoping to use his decades in the manufacturing business to help Eclipse-backed startups hit the market at the right time.
""Eventually, you have to know about when to expand production. Everything you do has to come out of the lab, out of the design center and hit scalability at some point,"" he told Reuters.

BRUSSELS/ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens and  Alstom 's plan to create a European rail champion collapsed on Wednesday after EU regulators blocked the deal, prompting Germany and France to call for an overhaul of EU competition policy to better meet global challenges.
The European Commission also rejected a bid by German copper company Wieland-Werke AG to buy a business unit from Aurubis, Europe's biggest copper smelter, similarly arguing the deal could have pushed up prices for consumers.
The two vetoes are likely to spur efforts by France and Germany to loosen EU competition rules so as to take a more global than solely European view of mergers and potentially to allow EU ministers to have a say.
Shortly after the Commission's announcements, German economy minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules to facilitate large cross-border mergers.
France's Alstom (PA:ALSO) said the veto was a clear set-back for industry in Europe, while Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Germany's Siemens, said Europe urgently needed to reform its industrial policy to help its companies compete.
""Protecting customer interests locally must not mean that Europe cannot be on a level playing field with leading nations like China, the United States and others,"" Kaeser said in a statement.
Proponents of the bloc's strict merger regime, however, argue such changes could lead to opaque and unpredictable rules. The Commission has approved over 3,000 mergers in the past 10 years and blocked only nine, including those on Wednesday.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Siemens and Alstom's argument about merging to compete with their bigger Chinese state-owned rival CRRC in the European market.
""We don't see the Chinese coming. The Chinese are nowhere, not at all in Europe,"" she told a news conference.
Shares in Siemens were little changed by the announcement, which was widely expected. However, Alstom stock gained more than 4 percent. Broker Berenberg said the market had been overly focused on the potential benefits of the rail merger, and ignoring that Alstom's earnings could double by 2025.
Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge told reporters the company was looking into new avenues for expansion, saying future growth would be ""more organic"".
(Graphic: Alstom and Siemens shares - https://tmsnrt.rs/2I3mEHg)
INSUFFICIENT CONCESSIONS
Siemens and Alstom had wanted to combine their rail operations to compete more effectively with CRRC globally, backed by the French and German governments, which favor creating industrial champions.
However, Vestager said she blocked the deal to protect competition in the European railway industry.
""Without sufficient remedies, this merger would have resulted in higher prices for the signaling systems that keep passengers safe and for the next generations of very high-speed trains,"" she said.
In the copper case, Vestager said rolled copper would become even more important in an age of electrical vehicles.
She said the companies in both deals were not willing adequately to address the regulator's competition concerns and their concessions fell short.
The rail deal also triggered criticism from national competition agencies in Germany, Britain, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Siemens makes the ICE (NYSE:ICE) trains for Deutsche Bahn and also builds units for Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. Alstom is the manufacturer of France's signature bullet train, locally known as the TGV. The rolling-stock maker also sells urban and suburban trains as well as signaling systems.
Canadian rival Bombardier welcomed the Commission's decision.
""It would have severely undermined the health and competitiveness of the whole European rail market, leaving European consumers, both as rail users and tax payers, to pay the price,"" said Daniel Desjardins, Bombardier general counsel and company secretary.

Bombardier, which sources say also held talks with Siemens in 2017, would have faced a rival with operations more than double its size in the European market, even though the merged group, in revenue terms, would only have been half the size of CRRC.

The company is building a 16-strong contingent in the city, leaving just a few dedicated staff at its main base in Fornebu, near Oslo, Matthew Wood, its senior vice president for commercial long-haul and new markets, said in an interview.
Norwegian picked London as the main office for the long-haul business to help tap a bigger pool of international expertise after establishing Gatwick airport, south of the capital, as its biggest hub for intercontinental flights. The operation serves 11 U.S destinations plus Buenos Aires, to be joined by Rio de Janeiro from March 31.
The airline has been working on the office changes for nine months, according to Wood, who previously split his time between London and the group’s Scandinavian headquarters. He still travels regularly to Oslo for meetings.
News that firms are prepared to increase headcount in the U.K. capital despite the uncertainties of Brexit comes as a boost to the city amid concern that the split will provoke an exodus of companies and professionals, though the numbers involved at Norwegian Air are small and the carrier’s home country itself sits outside the European Union.
Earnings Report
Norwegian is due to report earnings on Thursday, when investors and analysts will be looking to hear how the company plans to sustain its business after British Airways owner IAG SA (LON:ICAG said Jan. 24 it had abandoned takeover plans, sending the stock tumbling 26 percent.
The Nordic carrier responded by shoring up its finances with a move to raise 3 billion kroner ($352 million) in a rights issue backed by investors including shipping magnate John Fredriksen. It’s also seeking 2 billion kroner in cost cuts and working with an even higher figure internally, a spokesman said.
The airline deepened capacity curbs Wednesday with deferrals to narrow-body aircraft deliveries that will reduce short-term capital spending. Four Airbus SE 321LR aircraft due this year will now arrive in 2020, while 12 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 MAX jets due next year have been put back to 2023 and 2024.
The stock traded 1.4 percent higher as of 2:56 p.m. in Oslo, paring the decline this year to 27 percent.

The state carrier sent a request for proposals to banks last week for the financing, which is likely to be provided through bilateral loans or loans involving a small club of lenders, they said.
Etihad declined to comment.
It is common for airlines to approach banks to help finance aircraft deliveries.
Loans for 787s generally have a maturity of 12 years, the sources said, adding that the financing would likely be provided by Abu Dhabi banks.

Etihad operates a fleet of 26 787s and had a further 45 still to be delivered as of December 2018, according to Boeing's website.

The Detroit-based automaker earned $1.43 a share on revenue of $38.4 billion.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expected GM to bring in a profit of $1.24 a share. The revenue target was $36.0 billion.
Results were driven by strong pricing, surging crossover sales, disciplined cost control and the successful launch of the company's all-new full-size pickup trucks: the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.
The automaker said it sees a full-year profit in the range of $6.50 to $7.00 a share, above estimates for $6.27.
Following the release of the report, GM shares rallied around 4% in premarket trade to $40.85.
The results indicate that GM's ongoing efforts to reshape itself are starting to pay off. The automaker announced a sweeping restructuring plan in November that included layoffs, closing plants, and streamlining its vehicle lineup.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Huawei needs 3-5 years to resolve British security fears - letter,"By Jack Stubbs
LONDON (Reuters) - A $2 billion effort by China's Huawei to address security issues raised in a British government report last year will take between three and five years to produce results, according to a company letter to British lawmakers seen by Reuters.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the claims, but the allegations have led several Western countries to restrict Huawei's access to their markets.
Pressure has been growing on Huawei in Britain, one of its most important markets in Europe, since a government report in July last year found that technical and supply-chain issues with the company's equipment had exposed national telecom networks to new security risks.
Huawei has since committed to spending $2 billion in a drive to fix those problems, but in a letter to lawmakers last week, Ryan Ding, president of the company's carrier business group, said it would take up to five years to see results.
""Enhancing our software engineering capabilities is like replacing components on a high-speed train in motion,"" he said in a letter to the chairman of the British parliament's science and technology committee.
""It is a complicated and involved process, and will take at least three to five years to see tangible results. We hope the UK government can understand this.""
A Huawei spokesman said: ""We cannot add to what is outlined in the letter, where we have explained our position in full to the House of Commons Committee; and we are continuing to work closely with the authorities in the UK.""
A spokesman for the parliament science and technology committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Britain's National Cyber Security Council (NCSC), which issued the July report, said it was in ""regular dialogue with Huawei about the standards expected of their products."" 
""As was made clear in July's (report), the NCSC has concerns around a range of technical issues and has set out improvements the company must make,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. 
""DESTROY OUR BUSINESS""
Western security concerns surrounding Huawei, and fellow Chinese telecoms equipment firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763), center around China’s National Intelligence Law. Approved in 2017, the law states that Chinese ""organisations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work.""
This has sparked fears Huawei could be asked by the Chinese government to incorporate ""backdoors"" into their equipment that would allow Beijing access, for spying or sabotage purposes. Some experts also see a risk that Chinese intelligence may develop an ability to subvert Huawei's equipment.
Addressing a question from British lawmakers about whether Huawei could be compelled to assist China's government in spying on the UK, Ding said in the letter the company ""has never and will never"" use its equipment to assist espionage activities.
""Huawei is a closely watched company,"" he said. ""Were Huawei ever to engage in malicious behavior, it would not go unnoticed - and it would certainly destroy our business."" 
British authorities stress they have never found any evidence of Chinese state espionage in reviews of Huawei equipment at a special company laboratory overseen by intelligence and industry officials. 
July's report identified what it called technical problems which limited security researchers' ability to check internal product codes and concerns about the security of third-party components from a U.S. supplier. 

The next British report is expected to be released in coming weeks. People with knowledge of the matter said it will likely further criticize Huawei's slow response and detail tense relations with British officials.

The lawsuit relates to withdrawals nearly 30 years ago from an account established by former German Democratic Republic officials at Zurich-based Bank Cantrade, which Julius Baer bought from UBS in 2005. 
The agency is seeking around 100 million Swiss francs ($100 million) plus accrued interest since 1994.
In a ruling published on Wednesday, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court overturned a verdict from a Zurich appeal court last year dismissing the case and sent it back to be reheard. The federal court cited ""obvious shortcomings"" in the bank's handling of funds.
""We are analysing the decision and continue to defend our interests,"" Julius Baer said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP on Wednesday reported a 35 percent rise in distributable earnings for the final three months of 2018, supported by a rise in the fees it earns on the money it manages for investors. 
Pre-tax distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends - totaled $211 million for the fourth quarter, up from $156 million a year earlier. 
The amount Carlyle earned in performance fees from exiting investments fell 63.5 percent year-on-year to $43 million. This was more than made up for by fee-related earnings, what Carlyle earns from management fees, which surged to $175 million, from $27 million a year earlier. 
Carlyle's assets under management rose to $216.5 billion from $212.3 billion in the prior quarter and were 11 percent higher than 12 months earlier. 
""In 2018, Carlyle delivered a record level of fee-related earnings, raised over $33 billion in new capital, and produced attractive returns for our fund investors,"" Co-Chief Executives Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement.
Like its peers, Carlyle has said it will no longer focus on economic net income, a non-GAAP metric traditionally used by private equity firms to measure bottom-line performance. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Carlyle reported a loss to common unitholders of $16 million. This echoed the performance of peers Apollo Global Management, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP and KKR & Co, which last week all reported GAAP losses on the back of turbulent financial markets. 
The benchmark S&P 500 index had its biggest quarterly loss in more than seven years at the end of 2018, hitting private equity firms that use public peers to value their private investments.

Carlye said its corporate private equity funds depreciated in value by 2 percent in the quarter. This was better than peers, with KKR, Blackstone and Apollo reporting declines of 8.3 percent, 2.9 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>","SoftBank's Son unveils $5.5 billion buyback, laments share price","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp announced a $5.5 billion share buyback on Wednesday as it reported a 60 percent increase in quarterly operating profit buoyed by rising valuations for its technology investments.
Funded by proceeds from the bumper IPO of its domestic telco, founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said the buyback - its largest ever - was driven by what he sees as a chronic undervaluation of SoftBank's shares. 
The tech and telecoms conglomerate said from Thursday it would repurchase 112 million shares worth 600 billion yen in the next 11 months, or about 10.3 percent of its total outstanding shares, excluding treasury stock. 
The company raised 2.35 trillion yen in December by listing about a third of the shares in SoftBank Corp, which on Tuesday reported a 24 percent jump in quarterly operating profit.
Son said about one third of the IPO proceeds will be used for the buyback, one third to repay debt and the remainder on its investing activities.
SoftBank Group shares closed up 0.6 percent at 1,322 yen before the announcement.
""I think they're too cheap,"" Son told an earnings briefing. 
SoftBank Group's operating profit in the October-December quarter rose to 438.3 billion yen ($3.99 billion) from 274 billion yen a year earlier, which was reported under previous accounting standards.
The company's profits are increasingly affected by the valuations of its technology investments through its own activities and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund, which launched last year with over $90 billion in capital. 
Income from the Vision Fund and the smaller Delta Fund more than tripled from a year ago. But the funds' profit more than halved from the previous quarter, underscoring the volatility of Son's investment strategy. 
At the end of the October-December period, which saw weakness in technology stocks and fears of a China slowdown, the Vision Fund had invested $45.5 billion in 49 firms, up from $28 billion in 38 firms as of end-September.
Those investments - including ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, shared workspace provider WeWork Cos, and chip designer ARM - are valued at $55.3 billion, it said.
Among SoftBank's stakes in listed companies, weak demand for gaming chips in China helped to push down the share price of U.S. chipmaker Nvidia by 50 percent from its October peak. 
SoftBank Group said it had offset most of the fall in Nvidia's share price through derivatives contracts and sold its stake in January. 
VALUATIONS
Among the stakes taken by Vision Fund in the quarter included e-commerce firms like South Korea's Coupang and Indonesia's Tokopedia, and media and advertising companies such as Chinese startup Bytedance.
But China's slowing growth and its trade war with the United States are affecting valuations of unlisted technology firms that account for many of SoftBank's portfolio companies.
""The exact manner in which SoftBank determines the value of its investments remains murky,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane said in a note ahead of the earnings announcement. 
""Without a 'down round' we doubt any of the unlisted investment will be revalued,"" Lane said, referring to when a company's valuation is reduced in a subsequent financing round. 
Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, which is backed by SoftBank Group, has traded at prices implying a valuation of $40-44 billion. That compared to a valuation exceeding $65 billion after its 2018 funding round.
WeWork's higher valuation is based on a further investment by SoftBank, which has injected more than $10 billion into the loss-making office-sharing firm now valued at $47 billion.
As the valuations of the technology bets increase, investors are looking at SoftBank's exit strategy. 
A successful IPO by Uber, which is expected this year, will bolster Vision Fund's strategy and serve as a model for other portfolio companies, analysts say.
SoftBank's shares have risen 16 percent this year but are still 26 percent below their September peak, having tumbled on concerns about financial ties to Saudi Arabia following the murder of a Saudi journalist. 
SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Wednesday it was lowering the price of its Model 3 sedan for the second time this year, moves that come in the wake of Tesla losing a tax credit that made its cars more affordable for U.S. buyers.
The company is ramping up production of the Model 3 and trying to make it more accessible for mainstream car buyers. Tesla has also been cutting costs as it looks to turn in profits this year.
A U.S. federal tax credit began phasing out for Tesla in January, effectively raising the price of cars by $3,750. Tesla said on Tuesday it had cut the Model 3 price by $1,100, following a cut of as much as $2,000 in January.
That leaves the starting price of a Model 3 at $42,900, still substantially above the $35,000 price Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk originally promised.
Musk told a Twitter user that the company is ""doing everything we can"" to drop the Model 3 base price to $35,000, without credits. ""It's a super hard grind,"" he wrote.
The billionaire in the past few months has been pushing for cost-cutting initiatives, like cutting jobs and ending a customer referral program. Tesla said in a statement that ending the costly referral program allowed it to cut the Model 3 price.
The referral program that ended at the beginning of February gave new buyers six months of free charging and prizes for existing owners such as launching personal photos into deep space or invites to a Tesla event.
Tesla delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter.

The Palo Alto, California-based company's share were down 0.45 percent at $319.89 in premarket trading on Wednesday.

133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Inside the German Government’s Push to Fix Deutsche Bank ,"(Bloomberg) -- A week after Christian Sewing took charge at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in April, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s newly appointed finance minister, Olaf Scholz, buttonholed the chief executive officer of Germany’s largest lender at an event in Berlin.
The 15-minute exchange -- between canapes and ceremonial speeches in a Prussian palace at the German banking association’s annual reception -- marked the start of a rapprochement between Merkel’s government and the embattled financial giant. Since then, Sewing and other Deutsche Bank executives have had contact with Finance Ministry officials on average every two weeks, a noticeable change after years of chilly relations.
The thaw stems from growing concerns by Berlin’s power players that more than 30 billion euros ($34 billion) in bank bailouts in the financial crisis weren’t enough to ensure the lender can weather renewed strain if the economy cools down. Any trouble at the bank could spill over to the broader economy, given its links to German industry -- and stoke a political backlash.
The controversial fix increasingly being pushed by Scholz and Joerg Kukies, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker who serves as his deputy, is to make Deutsche Bank even bigger by merging it with domestic rival  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). The goal would be to create a national champion to serve the backbone of Germany’s export economy, a bank that will lend to the nation’s companies through the storm of an economic crisis. It would also avoid a government red line: additional taxpayer funds to shore up the banking industry.
The German Finance Ministry and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Scholz, a Social Democrat, was the labor minister when the debt crisis hit and dealt with the real-world disruption that the financial convulsion caused. He then became mayor of Hamburg, where he had searched for investors for troubled local lender HSH Nordbank.
Since becoming finance minister and vice chancellor last March, Scholz -- who risks taking the blame if the Deutsche Bank plan fails -- has made clear that stabilizing Germany’s largest lender at home is only a first step.
Industry proponents of a merger point to massive cost savings a combined entity would be able to achieve, especially at Commerzbank. A merged bank would have a much larger market share in the fragmented German banking market, putting it in a better position to prop up its margins.
But not everybody is on the same page. The tie-up would be a massive undertaking that would worsen the too-big-to-fail problem Deutsche Bank already has -- and still be insufficient to solve the lender’s struggle to deliver healthy profits. With a combined balance sheet of 1.9 trillion euros, risks are rife, economically and politically.
“I am very critical of a national merger,” said Danyal Bayaz, a finance expert and member of parliament with the Greens -- the second-strongest party after Merkel’s bloc in recent polls. “This would reinforce the too-big-to-fail problem, which could eventually fall back on the German taxpayer.”
Fraught Relationship
Merkel has stayed on the sidelines, while taking a keen look at Sewing’s back-to-basics restructuring, a person familiar with her thinking said. Her relationship with the bank has been fraught, particularly since the chancellor was burned by a schnitzel-and-asparagus dinner she hosted for former Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann.
The April 2008 event took place as the global financial crisis was brewing and gave the impression of being too cozy with an institution since sullied by a steady stream of lawsuits and investigations. The company has been hit with $17 billion in fines over the past decade.
The reputational risk tied to the storied lender only compounds a raft of geopolitical headaches for the German chancellor, already harried by Donald Trump’s threats, a fragmenting European Union and an emerging challenge from China.
While she has defended using government funds as necessary to keep the euro area together 10 years ago, this time the battlefield isn’t Athens, Dublin or Madrid, but Frankfurt. The new engagement dovetails with an increasingly hands-on government approach to industrial policy introduced this week to reinforce Germany’s export champions in competition with the U.S. and China.
Hands-on Approach
Presenting the National Industry Strategy 2030, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier -- a close Merkel ally -- said Germany would become more active to “maintain and expand the enormous prosperity this country has had for the past 70 years.”
Altmaier on Tuesday underscored that the German economy as a whole benefits from having a lender with the reach of Deutsche Bank.
“A country like Germany should have a role on the global financial markets,” he said.

Roche's donation will focus on patients who have developed resistance, or inhibitors, to current hemophilia A treatments as well as children, the Basel-based company said in a statement. 
Roche joins other companies including Sanofi's Bioverativ, Sobi, CSL Behring and Grifols that also have made contributions to the World Hemophilia Federation (WHF) Humanitarian Aid Program, which said it helped more than 16,000 patients in 60 countries in 2017.
With Roche's donation, ""significantly more people with haemophilia A will be able to receive prophylaxis,"" said WFH President Alain Weill. ""Importantly, the donation will also provide a treatment option for people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors who previously had very limited or no treatment."" 
Hemophilia A is a genetic disease that affects mostly males where they have a deficiency of so-called clotting factors, leading to increased bleeding that can damage joints and lead to life-threatening conditions. 

Treatments for the disease, depending on its severity, historically have required frequent infusions of clotting factors and can easily exceed $1 million annually, in severe cases. For a 63.4 kilo (140 pound) person, the list price for Hemlibra -- which can be given as a monthly shot -- is about $530,000 for the first year and $492,000 annually thereafter, Roche has said.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 04:52AM ET</span>","China sales buoy Toyota's profit, but U.S. weakness persists","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's quarterly profit edged up as demand for its bread-and-butter car models from cost-conscious Chinese buyers helped offset bleak North American sales, although the firm's shares slipped as it cut its annual net income outlook. 
Japan's biggest automaker attributed the smaller forecast to unrealised losses from equity investments, but, in an indication that business was still strong, it kept its full-year operating profit view unchanged at 2.4 trillion yen ($22 billion).
The automaker posted Asian sales of 464,000 units in the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, as strong demand in China for its cheap-and-cheerful Corolla and Levin sedans continued into the end of 2018. 
Popularity of its luxury Lexus brand also helped it buck a broader slowdown in the world's biggest auto market. 
Toyota's global sales rose 2.8 percent to 2.71 million units with Asia making up for the slack in North America, where its sales slid 7.5 percent to 680,000 units.
""When one region is underperforming, other regions can compensate for that weakness. Likewise, when some vehicle models are underperforming, other models can compensate,"" Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told reporters at a briefing.
""It's a work in process, but as we diversify our markets and our models, little by little we're starting to see this happen.""
Toyota shares dropped as much as 1.5 percent on Wednesday, but recovered slightly to end down 0.7 percent in a broader market that was mostly steady.
(For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit, vehicle sales, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ro1enH)
Toyota has been hit hard in the United States by slowing sales of its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry, as well as by its steep discounting to boost sales over the past two years as overall demand stagnates.
In contrast, the Corolla, Levin and Camry were Toyota's top three selling models in China in 2018, outselling larger ones like the RAV4 SUV crossover, as buyers reined in expenses amid an economic slowdown exacerbated by a Sino-U.S. trade war.

BUSINESS IN CHINA 
Toyota sold 1.47 million vehicles in China in 2018, up 14 percent, and aims to lift sales to 1.6 million this year, even as it and other automakers brace for another tough year there.
Auto sales in China last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s, hurt by the phasing out of purchase tax cuts on smaller cars and the trade war. The world's No.2 economy grew at its slowest in almost three decades in 2018, and the pace is expected to weaken further this year.
But Japanese automakers, such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, are expected to benefit from warming political ties between Tokyo and Beijing at a time when the Sino-U.S. trade war is weighing on rivals such as Ford.
However, niche players such as Japan's Mazda Motor have not been able to escape the broader China weakness.
Mazda's China sales sank 36 percent to 62,000 units in the third quarter, due partly to bleak sales of its Axela sedan that is priced slightly above than sold by many of its competitors. 
Mazda's global sales fell 7 percent, but the lower-volume automaker still raised its annual earnings view as its quarterly operating profit dropped less than expected.

Toyota cut its full-year net profit forecast by about 19 percent to 1.87 trillion yen. It did not say which investments hit its net profit, but it is a major shareholder in Subaru, whose shares tumbled more than 30 percent in 2018, and Akebono Brake Industry, whose shares tanked 40 percent.
Toyota booked an operating profit of 676.1 billion yen for the third quarter, slightly below the market's average estimate of 680.8 billion, according to Refinitiv, but up 0.4 percent from a year earlier.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) expects a higher tax rate for 2018 than previously forecast, it said on Wednesday, citing U.S. tax changes aimed at preventing companies from shifting profits abroad.
Switzerland's second biggest lender said it expects an effective tax rate of roughly 40 percent on 2018 results, up from the 36.8 percent rate for the first nine months and higher than its previous full-year guidance of 37 percent.
The bank said the estimate included an ""adverse impact"" of about 2 percent, based on its assessment of new U.S. regulations. 
The Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), introduced by the U.S. Treasury Department in December, aims to prevent companies from reducing earnings of their U.S. operations by loading their businesses with costs and deductions, and then using intercompany transfers to shift profit to lower-tax locations abroad.
The rule applies to corporate taxpayers with gross receipts of more than $500 million that make deductible payments to foreign entities. While the BEAT rules are still subject to final clarification, Credit Suisse said ""it is more likely than not that the group will be subject to this tax for 2018"".
The bank estimates the BEAT regulations would raise its tax burden by about 2 percent next year, to an estimated 30 percent. 
Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, reduced his earnings per share and net profit forecasts as a result.
He cut his 2018 net profit forecast to 1.9 billion francs from 2 billion francs, and his 2019 forecast to 3.3 billion francs from 3.4 billion francs.
""The volatility in tax rate guide is surprising, however it is clear that taxes are a highly complex topic, probably one of the most complex for any company's finance department,"" he said.
Credit Suisse shares were down 0.6 percent in early trading in Zurich.

The bank, due to report full-year results on Feb. 14, said it awaited final publication of the rules before it could say for certain if it was liable for the tax in 2018 and 2019, as well as the size of the liability.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish brewer Carlsberg's sales rose last year for the first time in three years, helped by strength in China and the long, hot summer in Northern Europe and Russia, but it warned it expects slower growth in 2019.
Growth in craft, speciality and alcohol-free beer also helped drive 2018's return to revenue growth, which sparked an almost 4 percent gain in its shares on Wednesday, to their highest level since early September.
The world's third-largest brewer behind Anheuser Busch InBev and Heineken, has been through a major cost-cutting program since Chief Executive Cees 't Hart took over in 2015, intended to help redress a decade of weakness in its key market Russia. 
""It's difficult to predict what the summer will be like, but in 2019 the top line will probably be a bit more modest after such a strong year,"" Hart said at a conference call.
The brewer expects operating profit to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2019, well below last year's 11 percent.
Overall, sales rose 3 percent in 2018. Fourth-quarter sales stood at 13.95 billion Danish crowns ($2.13 billion), above the 13.51 billion crowns expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
Carlsberg (CO:CARLa) took control of Russian brand Baltika in 2008, shortly before the Russian market was hit by a weak economy, advertising restrictions and tax hikes to curb drinking.
Russia, which accounts for around a fifth of sales, remains challenging. While the Russian beer market grew last year for the first time since 2007 driven by warm weather and the soccer World Cup, Carlsberg said it lost market share in the final quarter as it increased prices. 
Hart said he expects flat growth in Russia's beer market this year.
The company said its price mix, which indicates if the company sold more of its expensive beers, was positive in most markets, most notably in China where it sold more of its premium beer brands. 
The Chinese market is driven by international premium beer brands, which sell at two to three times the price of mainstream brands. Hart said he saw no signs of a slowdown in consumers' buying power in China.
The company said it would initiate a 12-month share buy-back program of 4.5 billion crowns. Carlsberg's board will propose a dividend of 18 crowns per share, slightly below the 18.30 crowns expected by analysts in the poll.

Around 20 fire engines and 200 firefighters were called to the highly automated site in Andover, southern England, at 0244 GMT on Tuesday to tackle a blaze that raged for over 24 hours.
""Whilst we are informed by the Fire Brigade that it is now under control, during the night part of the roof collapsed and there has been substantial damage to the majority of the building and its contents,"" Ocado (LON:OCDO) said.
The Andover site was providing about 10 percent of Ocado's capacity.
""As a result of this incident there will be a constraint on our ability to meet our growing customer demand and there will be a reduction in sales growth until we can increase capacity elsewhere,"" it said.
Ocado said it had insurance cover for the property, stock and equipment on site, and for business interruption losses.
The Andover plant, which can process 65,000 orders a week, is Ocado's third automated warehouse and has been instrumental in the firm winning four major deals to sell its technology to international retailers such as U.S. group Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and France's Casino.
While Ocado's first two centers required humans to load thousands of crates traveling on miles of conveyor belts, Andover has hundreds of robots speeding along at four meters per second on giant grids.
Ocado said on Tuesday the fire had broken out on one of the grids of robots, forcing it to suspend operations.
The group was founded by three Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bankers 18 years ago. After struggling for years to post a profit it has flourished in the last year and nearly doubled its stock market value after striking the technology deals.
Its shares were down 8 percent at 0922 GMT.
The group's 7 billion pound market valuation is linked to its future as a technology provider to international retailers needing to roll out online delivery services to compete with tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
In Britain it has a 1 percent share of the grocery market.
The company on Tuesday reported full-year earnings and cautioned that investment in partnership deals would hit short-term profits.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Australian dollar nosedived after its central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut in a remarkable shift from its long-standing tightening bias, a further indication of global economic slowdown.
The policy shift caught some investors off-guard as only just the previous day the RBA had steered clear of an easing signal when holding its official cash rate at a record low 1.50 percent for the 30th straight month.
The Australian dollar plunged 1.5 percent overnight and was set for its biggest daily drop in a year. 
Elias Haddad, rates and FX strategist, at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said that while there was a risk the Aussie dollar could test $0.70, a more pronounced downward move was unlikely.
""As a bank we have pushed out our call for a 25 basis point rate hike by one year to November 2020 from November 2019,"" he said. 
Australia’s central bank is the latest to signal policy easing in the face of global economic headwinds. 
Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, citing slowing global growth as a risk to the world's top economy. The European Central Bank has also sounded less certain that it will start tightening later this year.
Donald Trump's combative State of the Union address added to the gloom on markets as the U.S. president unveiled no new infrastructure initiatives and instead raised the prospect of another shutdown should financing not be forthcoming for the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border he wants to build.
As such the dollar settled near a two-week high.
In the annual speech outlining his priorities for the coming year, Trump said illegal immigration was a national crisis and reiterated his vow to build the border wall.
Futures trading indicated a weaker open to the U.S. stock markets with the S&P down 0.16 percent, and Nasqad down 0.07 percent. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was last down 0.07 percent at around 0900 GMT. 
European stocks markets opened slightly in negative territory as a fresh new batch of earnings failed to lift spirits after Trump's address touched on trade and budget issues but provided investors with few insights. 
Banks were the biggest drag on the STOXX 600, with shares  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) down 1.6 percent after France's largest-listed lender lowered its profit and revenue growth targets for 2020 after a tough fourth quarter.
Germany's DAX opened 0.2 percent lower, France's CAC 40 was down 0.4 percent and Spain's IBEX fell 0.1 percent. The euro zone blue chip index fell 0.3 percent. 
EUROPE DRAGS
Further weak data from Europe prompted demand for core euro zone bond yields as investors pushed back expectations that the European Central Bank will hold back from rate hikes. 
German industrial orders fell unexpectedly on weak foreign demand in December, data showed on Wednesday, a further sign that companies in Europe's largest economy are struggling with a slowing world economy and trade disputes.
Investors will also be looking to the European Commission's winter macroeconomic forecasts, due to be published on Wednesday or Thursday. Large downward revisions to growth and inflation are likely, according to analysts at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). 
""The EC forecast will give a pretty good guideline of how much the ECB will revise their own economic forecasts,"" said CBA's Haddad. 
German 10-year government bond yields, the benchmark for the region opened one basis point lower on Wednesday at 0.16 percent, well off the 0.21 percent highs hit on Tuesday. 
Italian debt was in focus with the Treasury planning to sell a 30-year bond via a syndicate of banks. Italian 30-year government bond yields jumped to three-week highs at 3.678 percent as investors sold bonds to make way for the new issue.
Sterling meanwhile was a shade lower at $1.2930 after losing nearly 0.7 percent on Tuesday on weak Purchasing Managers Index data for Britain and uncertainty about Brexit talks.

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to tell EU leaders they must accept legally binding changes to the Irish border arrangements of Britain's divorce deal or face a disorderly no-deal Brexit.

Daimler said the return on sales at Mercedes-Benz cars fell to 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter from 9.5 percent in the year-earlier period. 
This, combined with a cut in the dividend from 3.65 euros a share to 3.25 euros, disappointed analysts and sent shares 2 percent lower to 52.02 euros, underperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX index which was trading 0.22 percent lower.
""Daimler urgently needs efficiency measures,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said on Wednesday. ""At the moment the profitability of both Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and trucks lags behind peers."" 
Daimler said it was working on ""countermeasures"" to increase profits but could not mention details about possible cost cuts because these were still being worked out. 
For 2019 Mercedes-Benz Cars expects to achieve a return on sales of between 6 percent and 8 percent and a return on sales of between 5 percent and 7 percent for Mercedes Vans, Daimler said. 
""With our guidance for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans we are below our long-term target margins. We cannot be satisfied with this. Our goal is to return to our target margin corridor of 8 percent to 10 percent by 2021,"" Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said in a statement.
For 2019 Daimler said it expects a slight growth in unit sales, revenue and EBIT.
Daimler's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped to 2.67 billion euros ($3.04 billion) in the fourth quarter, below analysts' expectations of 2.92 billion euros.
Mercedes-Benz passenger car sales rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter but increased tariffs on vehicles exported from the United States to China and delivery stoppages for individual diesel models hit demand and resulted in weaker prices. 
Mercedes-Benz exported around 30,000 GLE and GLS sports utility vehicles from the United States to China last year. Daimler has no current plans to manufacture these models in China as a way to mitigate the impact of tariffs, Zetsche said.
Research and development spending rose 4.5 percent to 9.1 billion euros last year as the carmaker prepares to launch its first fully electric sports utility vehicle this year.
Mercedes-Benz emerged as the biggest selling luxury brand last year with 2.31 million new vehicle registrations, followed by BMW brand's 2.12 million and Audi which posted registrations of 1.81 million last year.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 04:11AM ET</span>",Bet everything on electric: Inside Volkswagen's radical strategy shift,"By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - If Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) realizes its ambition of becoming the global leader in electric cars, it will be thanks to a radical and risky bet born out of the biggest calamity in its history.
The German giant has staked its future, to the tune of 80 billion euros ($91 billion), on being able to profitably mass-produce electric vehicles - a feat no carmaker has come close to achieving.
So far mainstream automakers' electric plans have had one main goal: to protect profits gleaned from high-margin conventional cars by adding enough zero-emission vehicles to their fleet to meet clean-air rules.
Customers have meanwhile largely shunned electric vehicles because they are too expensive, can be inconvenient to charge and lack range. 
The biggest strategy shift in Volkswagen's 80 years has its roots in a weekend crisis meeting at the Rothehof guesthouse in Wolfsburg on October 10, 2015, senior executives told Reuters. 
At the meeting hosted by then VW brand chief Herbert Diess, nine top managers gathered on a cloudy Saturday afternoon to discuss the way forward after regulators blew the whistle on the company's emissions cheating, a scandal that cost it more than 27 billion euros in fines and tainted its name. 
""It was an intense discussion, so was the realization that this could be an opportunity, if we jump far enough,"" said Juergen Stackmann, VW brand's board member for sales.
""It was an initial planning session to do more than just play with the idea of electric cars,"" he told Reuters. ""We asked ourselves: what is our vision for the future of the brand? Everything that you see today is connected to this.""
Just three days after the Rothehof meeting of the VW brand's management board, Volkswagen announced plans to develop an electric vehicle platform, codenamed MEB, paving the way for mass production of an affordable electric car. 
For months after the Volkswagen scandal blew up in 2015, rival carmakers treated diesel-cheating as a ""VW issue"", according to industry experts. But regulators have since uncovered excessive emissions across the sector and unleashed a clampdown that undermines the business case for combustion engines, forcing a sector-wide rethink. 
Now the ""villain"" of dieselgate is likely to become the largest producer of electric cars in the world in coming years, analysts say, putting it in pole position to flood the market - should the demand materialize. 
""Decisions to convert the Emden factory (in Lower Saxony) to build electric cars, would never have happened without this Saturday meeting,"" said Stackmann, one of five senior VW executives who spoke to Reuters.
However the full scale of VW's ambitions were only revealed two months ago when it took the industry by surprise by pledging to spend 80 billion euros to develop electric vehicles and buy batteries, dwarfing the investment of rivals. 
It plans to raise annual production of electric cars to 3 million by 2025, from 40,000 in 2018. 
STRATEGIC PERILS 
It's a risky bet. 
With regulators and lawmakers, rather than customers, dictating what kind of vehicles can hit the road, analysts at Deloitte say the industry could produce 14 million electric cars for which there is no consumer demand. 
It's also an all-or-nothing bet in the long run.
VW, whose ID electric car will hit showrooms in 2020, has set a deadline for ending mass production of combustion engines. The final generation of gasoline and diesel engines will be developed by 2026.
Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Evercore ISI, said betting on electric vehicles (EVs) could be risky because customers did not want to own cars dependent on street-charging facilities. 
""What if people are still not ready to own EVs? Will adoption be the same in the U.S., Europe and China?"" he said.
But he added that EU and Chinese emissions regulations made electric vehicle adoption inevitable and that being an early industry mover in that direction offered a ""positive risk-reward"". 
Another by-product of dieselgate that quickened VW's electric drive, according to the senior executives, was a purge of the company's old guard, who became the focus of public and political anger.
This empowered Diess, a newcomer who had joined as VW brand boss shortly before U.S. regulators exposed the carmaker's emission test cheating. 
Diess, who joined from BMW where he helped pioneer a ground-breaking electric vehicle, has since been appointed CEO of Volkswagen Group, a multi-brand empire that includes Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Seat, Skoda, Lamborghini and Ducati. 
Carmakers have failed to mass-produce electric cars profitably largely because of the prohibitive cost of battery packs which make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle. 
A 500 km-range battery costs around $20,000, compared with a gasoline engine that costs around $5,000. Add to that another $2,000 for the electric motor and inverter, and the gap is even wider.
Even electric start-up Tesla's cheapest car, the Model 3, is on sale in Germany at 55,400 euros, priced just below a base model Porsche Macan, a compact SUV. In the United States, Model 3 prices start at $35,950.
VW believes its scale will give it an edge to build an electric vehicle costing no more than its current Golf model, about 20,000 euros, using its procurement clout as the world's largest car and truck maker to drive down the cost.
""We are Volkswagen, a brand for the people. For electric cars we need economies of scale. And VW, more than any other carmaker, can take advantage of this,"" a senior Volkswagen executive told Reuters, declining to be named. 
The carmaker's electric-vehicle budget outstrips that of its closest competitor, Germany's Daimler, which has committed $42 billion. General Motors (NYSE:GM), the No.1 U.S. automaker, has said it plans to spend a combined $8 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles.
Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi said in late 2017 they would spend 10 billion euros by 2022 on developing electric and autonomous cars.
""On a 2025 view, we expect Volkswagen to be the number one electric vehicles producer globally,"" UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said. ""Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is likely to remain a niche player.""
STRICTER TESTING
VW's test cheating using engine management software - ""defeat devices"" - resulted in the introduction of tougher pollution tests which revealed in 2016 and 2017 that emissions readings across the industry were up to 20 percent higher under real-world driving conditions compared with lab conditions.
This has raised the bar on the auto sector's efforts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, blamed for causing global warming. 
EU lawmakers in December agreed a cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars of 37.5 percent by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. This was after the European Union forced a 40 percent cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.
""This goal is no longer reachable using combustion engines alone,"" Volkmar Denner, chief executive of Bosch, the world's biggest auto supplier, said about the 2030 proposals. 
Every gram of excessive carbon dioxide pollution will be penalized with a 95 euros fine from this year onwards.
Strategy firm PA Consulting forecasts VW will face a 1.4-billion-euro penalty for overstepping average limits in Europe by 2021, while Ford and Fiat-Chrysler face fines of 430 million euros and 700 million euros respectively.
Daimler, BMW, PSA, Mazda and Hyundai will miss their 2021 average emissions targets, PA Consulting forecasts. Toyota, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Volvo, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover are on track to meet their goals. 
PA Consulting's forecasts were extrapolated using 2017 registration data for each powertrain type and consumer buying trends, but do not include more recent sales trends. 
Ford, VW and BMW said they would meet their targets because of a push to sell more hybrid and electric cars in 2018. Daimler said it aimed to meet the targets, PSA said it would respect the targets while Fiat-Chrysler declined to comment. Mazda had no immediate comment, while Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment.
Carmakers have struggled to lower their average fleet emissions because of a shift in customer taste toward heavier, bigger SUVs (sports utility vehicles), which make it harder to maintain the same levels of acceleration and comfort without increasing fuel consumption and pollution. 
SUVs are now the most popular vehicle category in Europe, commanding a market share of 34.6 percent, according to JATO Dynamics. Even Porsche, which makes lightweight sportscars, relies on sports utility vehicles for 61 percent of sales. 
As the industry-wide scale of excessive emissions prompted Brussels to push through tougher laws late last year, VW executives concluded that purely electric cars were the most efficient way to meet carbon dioxide goals across its fleet. 
This was the point of no return, according to executives, when the company made the final electric investment decisions and committed to staying the course it had plotted after dieselgate.
""After evaluating alternatives, we opted for electromobility,"" chief operating officer Ralf Brandstaetter told Reuters about VW's deliberations in November.

Europe's STOXX 600 fell 0.1 percent in early deals, with the index stalled near the more than two-month highs hit on Tuesday. Germany's trade-sensitive DAX was down 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 0.3 percent.
President U.S. Donald Trump's combative State of the Union added to gloom on markets as he unveiled no new infrastructure initiatives and instead raised the prospect of another shutdown should financing for the Wall not be forthcoming. 
Daimler fell to the bottom of the DAX, down 1.9 percent, after the German carmaker said fourth-quarter operating profit fell 22 percent, as trade wars and ballooning costs for developing electric and self-driving cars hit profits at Mercedes-Benz cars.
Auto makers and suppliers were down 0.6 percent.
Banks were the biggest drag on the STOXX 600, with shares BNP Paribas down 1.6 percent after France's largest-listed lender lowered its profit and revenue growth targets for 2020 after a tough fourth quarter.
The news reinforced concerns about the euro-zone banking sector's struggle with low interest rates and tough trading conditions. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was down 0.6 percent after the Swiss bank said it expected a higher tax rate for 2018 than previously forecast.
In contrasting fortunes, London-listed CYBG jumped 10 percent to the top of the STOXX 600 after reporting a slight rise in lending in the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year, facing down strong competition on Britain's housing mortgage market.
Dassault Systemes shot to four-month highs after the French software company's fourth quarter revenue topped guidance, while Finnish engineering firm Metso jumped more than 8 percent after its results. 

 CRH  (LON:CRH) rallied on news that activist investor Cevian Capital has built a stake to become the second largest shareholder in the heavy materials and building products group.

150,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Facing crackdown in Canada, drugmakers offered billions in price cuts","By Allison Martell and Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian pharmaceutical industry lobby groups, in an effort to head off a planned crackdown on prescription drug prices, offered to give up C$8.6 billion ($6.6 billion) in revenue over 10 years, freeze prices or reduce the cost of treating rare diseases, according to interviews and documents seen by Reuters.
Those industry offers did not impress federal officials, coming last year as Canada prepared to expand the powers of a little-known federal watchdog called the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.
The government proposals would change the countries Canada compares its prices to, dropping the United States where they are highest, and set a formula to assess cost-effectiveness of medicines.
Announced in 2017, the new rules were scheduled to come into effect last month but have been delayed as the government reviews feedback, which has some wondering if they will ever be implemented. 
The delay is a setback for supporters of the changes. But documents detailing counter offers from lobby groups Innovative Medicines Canada and BIOTECanada show an industry struggling to win over federal officials.
Unlike other countries with universal healthcare, Canada's government-funded healthcare system does not cover prescription drugs. Most Canadians rely on an expensive patchwork of public and private insurance plans for that. Among industrialized nations, only the United States and Switzerland spend more on prescriptions per capita.
Declan Hamill, a vice president at Innovative Medicines Canada, said the proposed regulations go too far and could hurt patient access to new drugs in Canada. But his group recognizes that the Canadian government wants to make drugs more affordable, he said. 
""We'd like to help the government out with that, and we've been trying to have discussions with them,"" Hamill said. 
Lower prices in Canada could eventually hit drugmakers in the most lucrative U.S. market, as Washington evaluates a proposal to base drug prices paid under the government's Medicare program on the cost of medicines in other developed nations, including Canada.
Global drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck & Co,  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and others, have argued against the Canadian proposal. They referred questions back to Innovative Medicines Canada.
'WOULD NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL'
With major drugmakers united in their condemnation of proposed regulations to rein in prices, Health Canada hired former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge and health economist Åke Blomqvist to assess the government proposal. Their review, completed in August 2018, broadly endorsed the government's plan, documents seen by Reuters showed.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's senior ministers will eventually decide how to proceed. PMPRB Executive Director Douglas Clark told Reuters the new regime could be running by early 2020.
""People have a tendency to presume that the sky is falling,"" Clark said. ""I think it's a little early for people to panic and lament the demise of this policy initiative."" 
Health Canada said the industry's offers do not address drug price problems created by outdated rules.
""The non-regulatory counter-proposals that Innovative Medicines Canada and BIOTECanada jointly submitted to the government would not achieve the goal of ensuring appropriate consumer protection in these circumstances,"" the ministry said in an emailed statement.
One offer was to ""secure a price reduction target of C$8.6 billion"" in net present value terms, according to a letter from officials seen by Reuters. 
Hamill said the C$8.6 billion figure was borrowed from a government estimate of how much the PMPRB reforms would reduce revenue and would have been spread over 10 years. He did not say exactly how it would have worked. Total patented medicine sales were C$16.8 billion ($12.8 billion) in 2017, according to the PMPRB.
Health Canada also rejected an offer to freeze prescription drug prices, saying it would not meet its objective of lowering prices.
Health Canada said the industry had also committed to improving access for patients with rare diseases, but that proposal would not help those who have drug plans.
Meanwhile, ahead of a fall election, Trudeau's government is preparing to announce a limited expansion of the nation's universal healthcare system to cover part of the cost of prescription medicines, as drug plans grapple with the extremely high cost of newer specialty drugs.
'WE DON'T WANT TO SHUT THAT DOOR'
The PMPRB caps prices of drugs still under patent protection. If new regulations are adopted, it would change the list of countries whose drug pricing it uses to decide whether costs are excessive, dropping the United States and adding countries with lower prices.
The regulator would also consider for the first time a type of value-based pricing, measuring how cost-effective drugs are in terms of quality-adjusted life years, and force drug companies to privately disclose some confidential discounts.
It is not entirely clear how the PMPRB would use its new powers. In documents posted online, the agency said it could apply new rules to drugs already on the market. But Health Canada said the regime would not apply to those.
Andrew Casey, president of BIOTECanada, would like ""a more rigorous sit-down"" with the government.
""I fear the consequences when you do something without really working with industry,"" he said. ""We don't want to shut that door.""

152,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>",United to add premium seats on regional and mainline jets,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Wednesday it was adding 1,600 premium seats to nearly 250 international and domestic aircraft, including the introduction of a first-class cabin on 50 Bombardier Inc regional jets.
The move is part of a push by large U.S. airlines to attract more lucrative premium travelers. Rivals Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc have also added premium seats, which can fetch at least twice the coach fare.
United's new regional jet, called the CRJ 550, will be the only 50-seater on the market to offer a first class cabin, the Chicago-based airline said, providing premium travel on connecting flights from small U.S. cities to the rest of the world. 
Under the plan, United will work with Bombardier to use the frame of its current CRJ 70-seat fleet for a new two-cabin, 50-seat configuration with a self-serve beverage and snack station for premium travelers and four storage closets for carry-on bags.
The CRJ 550s will eventually replace United's current 50-seat regional fleet with a model permitted under its pilots' contract, which became amenable in January.
While not generating new orders for cash-strapped Bombardier, United's plan would allow the Canadian plane and train maker to market the new model to other U.S. airlines looking to replace aging regional jets. Bombardier aims to take a decision on its money-losing CRJ regional jet program this year.
On United's mainline fleet, there will be 50 percent more premium seating on its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767-300ERs and Airbus A319s, and 33 percent more on its A320s. Following the changes, United will have a total of 167 seats on the 767-300ER, 126 seats on the A319 and 150 on the A320. 
Andrew Nocella, chief commercial officer for United, told reporters that ""in an era where many airlines are adding seats to the aircraft to crowd more passengers onto the plane,"" United is ""doing exactly the opposite."" 
United said it plans to complete the changes by the end of next year, with the first reconfigured 767 flying between Newark and London.
The new CRJ 550 will be operated by United's regional partner GoJet out of Chicago and Newark, pending a final agreement and government certification.
Nocella said United's overall coach footprint would continue to grow despite the new seating configurations thanks to the introduction of larger aircraft like the Boeing 787 to its fleet.

United Airlines is part of United Continental Holdings Inc.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 07:02PM ET</span>",ABC and parks boost Disney profit above forecasts,"By Lisa Richwine and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that handily topped Wall Street estimates thanks to a booming theme park business and growth at its ABC broadcast network as the company invests in a digital media future. 
Shares of Disney rose 1.8 percent to $114.70 in after-hours trading. 
Disney, whose media properties include ESPN and the Disney Channels along with ABC, is trying to transform into a digital entertainment company to compete with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other online video outlets that deliver programming directly to customers. The new streaming services include Disney+ and ESPN+.
By saving content for its own platforms, Disney estimates a decrease in year-over-year operating income of $150 million this fiscal year because it will forego licensing revenue from others, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.
For the fiscal first quarter that ended in December, Disney reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.84. Analysts on average had expected $1.55, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Disney has reorganized its divisions for its streaming future, and Tuesday's earnings report was the first to reflect the company's new structure.
Operating income at the media networks unit, Disney's largest, rose 7 percent from a year earlier to $1.3 billion. The ABC broadcast division saw profit jump 40 percent thanks to growth in affiliate fees, advertising revenue and program sales.
The theme parks and consumer products division reported profit of $2.2 billion, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Results were buoyed by increased guest spending and higher occupancy rates at Disney's U.S. theme parks.
""Disney’s earnings momentum shows that the company will be entering a highly competitive video-streaming market from a position of strength,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.
""If its existing media assets are churning out good cash and it's able to contain its costs, the video streaming push later this year should make investors excited and help the stock to get out of its current sluggish spell,” he said.
The ESPN+ streaming service has signed up 2 million paying subscribers, Disney's chief executive, Bob Iger, said on the conference call. That is double the number five months ago. Nearly 600,000 of those new customers joined ahead of the service's first UFC Fight Night mixed-martial arts contest, Iger said.
Overall, Disney's adjusted earnings-per-share declined 3 percent for the quarter from a year earlier as profit fell at the company's movie studio.
Profit at the movie studio plunged 63 percent to $309 million as films including ""Mary Poppins Returns"" could not match the strong lineup of a year earlier, which included ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" 
A new division, direct-to-consumer and international, reported a $136 million loss for the quarter. That included spending to set up Disney+, a streaming service for family entertainment that the company plans to debut later this year.
As part of that effort, Disney will withhold programming such as upcoming movie ""Captain Marvel"" from Netflix. 
Disney also is in the process of buying film and TV assets from 21st Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX) to expand its portfolio. That deal will give Disney a majority stake in Hulu, which the company aims to offer alongside Disney+ and ESPN+.
Iger said it is possible Disney may offer discounts to people who buy more than one of the three streaming services.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 07:02PM ET</span>","Snap user number beats Wall Street estimate, shares soar","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) said the number of people using its Snapchat app would remain at current levels this quarter, easing worries the company would continue to lose users to rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's Instagram and sending its shares up more than 20 percent.
The photo-messaging app, known for its disappearing messages and filters that turn people into dogs or even tacos, has struggled since going public in March 2017, as Instagram has replicated many of its novel features. A controversial redesign also alienated some of Snapchat's advertisers and users.
In the fourth quarter Snap topped Wall Street with 186 million daily active users, flat with the previous quarter and down 1 million from the same period a year ago. Analysts' average expectation was 184.91 million, according to Refinitiv data.
""We do not foresee a sequential decline in daily active users in Q1 2019,"" said Lara Sweet, Snap's interim chief financial officer, during a call with analysts after reporting results. She gave no specific outlook on user numbers.
Snap shares jumped 22 percent to $8.62 after hours. That is still less than half the $17 initial public offering price.
The company avoided a third consecutive quarterly decline in users following its redesign, but some questioned the company's ability to grow.
""Snap's biggest issue continues to be that it lacks appeal beyond its core user base and has no visible direction on how to expand or pivot its app beyond that under-35 demographic,"" said Jessica Liu, a marketing analyst at Forrester.
NEW ANDROID APP
Snap has also begun rolling out its new Android app to a small percentage of Snapchat users, Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during the post-earnings call. Snap has said it rebuilt the Android app because it had more bugs and a worse user experience than its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS app.
The revamped app is key to gaining new users in developing markets, where devices running Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android system are much more popular than iPhones.
""There's roughly 2 billion people (internationally) who are on Android and do not have Snapchat,"" Spiegel said. ""If we can take even a small percentage of that, it would make a big difference.""
Snap's revenue, which it gets from selling advertising on the app, increased 36 percent to $389.8 million, beating Wall Street's average estimate of $377.52 million.
Revenue growth was helped in part by new ad formats like unskippable commercials on its original shows, which are housed on the Discover page, a panel on the app that contains publisher content along with influencer content.
Spiegel said during the call the company has improved the way it personalizes the Discover page for every user, which could attract more advertisers who were previously worried about their ads appearing next to unsuitable content.
Snap was now ""substantially closer"" to profitability, as it maintains a flat cost structure while increasing revenue, Spiegel said. In an internal memo that leaked in October, Spiegel set a goal of reaching profitability by the end of 2019.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates Snap will reach breakeven by the end of this year.
Average revenue per user was $2.09 during the fourth quarter, up from $1.53 in the year-ago quarter.
That measurement of revenue grew the most for users outside North America and Europe, hitting $1.24 during the quarter, up from 56 cents in the year-ago quarter.
The company's net loss narrowed to $191.67 million, or 14 cents per share, compared with $349.98 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.

For the first quarter, Snap said it expects revenue of $285 million to $310 million. That compares with the average analyst estimate for revenue of $307 million, according to data from IBES Refinitiv.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 06:17PM ET</span>","EA cuts revenue outlook after 'Battlefield' disappoints, shares dive","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Videogame maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) cut its yearly revenue outlook on Tuesday after its newest ""Battlefield"" title sold about a million fewer units than expected, amid rising competition in an industry being reshaped by upstarts like ""Fortnite"" and ""PUBG.""
Shares of EA sank 18 percent in after-hours trading following the news.
Game franchises like ""Battlefield"" and ""FIFA"" are among EA's most iconic, but the rapid rise of online, often free-to-play games with engaging formats are challenging the dominance of EA, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc.
""The video game industry continues to grow through a year of intense competition and transformational change,"" Chief Executive Andrew Wilson said in a statement.
""Q3 was a difficult quarter for Electronic Arts and we did not perform to our expectations,"" he added, referring to EA's results for the final three months of 2018.
""Battlefield V"" had poor sales in the quarter, EA executives said. The fifth installment in the franchise was launched in November, a month later than planned, because of delays in development.
""We think (postponing the Battlefield launch) was the right decision, but it put us in the middle of a very discounted holiday season,"" EA Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in an interview. ""We probably sold about a million units less than we thought we would.""
Data from research firm NPD showed that ""Battlefield V"" lagged Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4"" and Take-Two's ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" in dollar sales during December.
Launching ""Battlefield V"" in just a single-player mode rather than offering a battle royale version also likely hurt sales, Jorgensen said.
The battle royale format in multi-player gaming, which allows dozens of players to battle each other to the death until the last survivor, became wildly popular in 2018 thanks to ""PUBG"" and Epic Games' ""Fortnite,"" two games which are also credited with introducing newer audiences to gaming.
EA, meanwhile, announced its first free-to-play battle royale game, called Apex Legends, only on Monday.
For the third quarter that ended Dec. 31, EA reported adjusted revenue of $1.61 billion, well below Wall Street analysts' average estimate of $1.75 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Redwood City, California-based company cut its adjusted revenue projections for the year ending March to about $4.75 billion from $5.20 billion.

Jorgensen said sales from EA's mobile games also underwhelmed, with newly launched ""Command and Conquer"" performing below expectations.

157,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 05:24PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Wall Street to Digest State of the Union
The focus of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union Address will not be the economy, but there is likely to be some market impact. The speech is set to start at 9 PM ET Tuesday (02:00 GMT Wednesday).
First and foremost, statements by Trump on the progress of trade talks with China will be parsed by investors.
The U.S.-Sino trade war has weighed on stocks, and time is running out on the latest deadline of March 1, when the Trump Administration said it will increase its tariffs on Chinese goods.
In addition, the standoff between Trump and Democrats over funding for a wall on the Mexican border has had not just trade implications but could lead to another government shutdown. The 35-day shutdown just ended dented U.S. economic growth last month.
""The speech is going to be closely monitored, for an update on trade talks with China and border security, or more specifically the border wall,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London, wrote in a note.
""There have been plenty of reports that Trump is considering using emergency powers to deliver on his promise of border wall funding and this could be the platform for it.""
Meanwhile, the oil markets will be looking for any updates on the U.S. call for regime change in Venezuela, which has led to an embargo of crude from Caracas.
2.  Disney  Edges up and Snap Soars
The Dow may get a slight lift in early trading after Disney (NYSE:DIS) topped expectations on the top and bottom lines.
The Dow component reported earnings per share of $1.84 on revenue of $15.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $1.54 on revenue of $15.07 billion.
Shares rose 1.7% in after-hours trading.
Disney’s theme park and TV businesses helped it overcome tough year-ago comparisons when it released blockbuster movies ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi and ""Thor: Ragnorak.""
And in the social media space, Snapchat maker Snap (NYSE:SNAP) soared more than 17% postmarket following its bullish earnings report.
Snap topped forecasts for earnings and revenues, while key metric daily active users was also slightly higher than expected.
3. Crude Stockpile Build Forecast
Oil prices settled lower today as weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data made traders nervous about demand.
Tomorrow brings the Energy Information Administration's closely-watched U.S. oil inventories numbers at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
Analysts surveyed by Investing.com expect the EIA to report higher crude inventories of 2.18 million barrels versus the previous week's rise of 919,000.
Gasoline stockpiles are projected to have jumped by 1.6 million barrels against a previous slump of 2.235 million.
Stockpiles of distillates are expected to have fallen by about 1.81 million barrels versus the previous decline of 1.12 million."
158,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Logs Triple-Digit Gains Ahead of Trump Speech,"Investing.com - The Dow ended higher Tuesday as upbeat corporate earnings fueled a rally on Wall Street ahead of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68%, the S&P 500 added 0.47%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.74%. It was the Dow's third gain in a row and fifth straight gain for the S&P 500. The Nasdaq's gain was its second in a row.
Consumer discretionary stocks led the broader market higher thanks to a surge in high-end apparel maker and retailer Ralph Lauren.
Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) rose 8% after its fiscal third-quarter earnings topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
 Estee Lauder  's (NYSE:EL) better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results also fuelled investor optimism over earnings. The company also guided earnings for the fiscal third-quarter above expectations.
Shares of major Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) closed above $400 for the first time, underpinning the move higher in the broader market, after the company said it had teamed up with supersonic startup Aerion.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, closed roughly flat as U.S. oil prices fell 1.7%, despite expectations that U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and OPEC output cuts will help offset excess supplies, boosting prices.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) pared early losses to close higher for the day, propping up the tech sector, which ended the day up 1% higher. Among other FANG stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose more than 1%.
On the economic front, weaker-than-expected U.S. services data had a muted impact on stocks as analysts said the sector remained robust.
The services side of the U.S. economy is ""still performing well as the index is still entrenched in expansionary territory and is in line with the average level seen since mid-2017,"" CIBC said in a note.
In other corporate news, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) added to losses from a day earlier after hedge fund Appaloosa urged the company to split its chairman and CEO roles, a move that could improve investor sentiment, according to Citigroup.
A separation is unlikely to bridge the gap between Allergan's current valuation and its stock's fundaments, but an alternate corporate governance structure ""is likely to improve investor sentiment at the very least,"" the bank said.
The strong day of gains on Wall Street come as investor focus shifts to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address due 9PM ET, which may offer insight into key policies that could drive economic growth, buoying stocks.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 04:47PM ET</span>","Fed gives banks more stress test information, unveils 2019 scenarios","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve moved on Tuesday to make its stress testing of large banks more transparent, providing financial firms significantly more information about how their portfolios would perform under potential economic shocks.
During the 2019 round of stress tests and going forward, big banks will know ""significantly more"" information about the models the U.S. central bank uses to test banks' books, including how hypothetical loans perform under the tests and more detailed information about the Fed's models.
The 2019 tests will include factoring in a jump to 10 percent unemployment from the current 4 percent rate, as well as elevated stress in corporate loan and commercial real estate markets in the most severe scenario.
The transparency changes, first proposed by the Fed in December 2017 and finalized Tuesday, are aimed at long-running bank complaints that the current stress-testing process is cumbersome and opaque.
In addition, less complex banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, such as SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) will not have to face the 2019 tests, as the Fed is moving to a two-year cycle for testing those firms. 
The industry had been tracking the 2019 testing closely, as Fed officials have said they would like to make the tests more accommodating, amid bank gripes that prior rounds have been overly harsh and resource-intensive.
The steps the Fed is taking to make the testing more transparent should address some of those concerns, although proponents of stricter rules on Wall Street caution too much transparency could allow banks to mask underlying risks by gaming the exam.
The annual test of bank stability subjects the books of large banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) to hypothetical economic downturns to ensure they can withstand the blow without collapsing. The tests vary slightly every year, as the Fed probes for weak points in bank finances, and become more difficult as the economy improves.
""We are confident this scenario will effectively test the resiliency of the nation’s largest banks,"" said Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair for supervision.

The stress tests are a major yearly event for those firms, as they cannot distribute capital through dividends, share buybacks, or other investments without clearing that Fed hurdle. Thirty-four lenders passed the test last year, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) received conditional approvals that limited their capital distributions. The U.S. subsidiary for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had its capital plan rejected by the Fed.

In the year-ago quarter, Disney had released ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi and ""Thor: Ragnorak."" This year, the movies were ""Mary Poppins Returns,"" ""The Nutcracker,"" and ""The Four Realms.""

161,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>","Qatar Petroleum, Exxon invest in $10 billion Texas LNG project","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said on Tuesday they are investing in a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, as companies race to meet global demand for the fuel.
Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin early this year. The project will add production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024.
Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter. 
""Golden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said of the final investment decision.
Woods and Qatar Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi signed the deal at the Four Seasons hotel in Washington in the presence of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The deal is proof that two of the world's top energy producers can work together and ""support rather than subvert an open energy marketplace,"" Perry said.
The Trump administration has promoted gas drilling and LNG exports in part to offer European customers alternatives to piped natural gas from Russia, while slashing Obama-era environmental regulations on energy operations.
""To understand how critical this is, imagine how Europe feels when the winter winds begin to blow and Russia has its hand on the pipe valve,"" Perry said. Russia has in recent years slashed gas shipments to Europe through Ukraine during pricing disputes.
Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market.
Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds 70 percent. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. 
Exxon has signed an agreement to buy a 12.4 percent interest in the existing terminal and a pipeline from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals, both companies said. 
The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum's plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business. 
Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-24.
Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members' investments in the country.
Energy industry construction firm McDermott International Inc and its partners, Chiyoda International Corp and Zachry Group, have won a contract worth more than $1 billion to build the export project, McDermott said separately on Tuesday.

The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year.

The company's shares touched a record high of $407.48 following the announcement, after opening above $400 for the first time.
Boeing will provide engineering, manufacturing and flight testing services for Aerion's $120 million supersonic business jet, which is slated for its first flight in 2023.
The jet, the Aerion AS2, can fly at speeds of up to Mach 1.4, or about 1,000 miles (1,610 km) per hour, 70 percent faster than conventional business jets.
 Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), which announced a partnership in 2017 to develop the AS2, is no longer working with Aerion, representatives from both companies said. 
A spokeswoman for the maker of the F-35 and F-22 fighter jets told Reuters on Tuesday that ""Lockheed Martin’s contract with Aerion to vet the technical viability of the AS2 design expired Friday, February 1, and there are no plans to renew.""
Boeing and Reno, Nevada-based Aerion, founded by billionaire businessman Robert Bass, did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.
U.S. startups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are working to reintroduce supersonic passenger travel for the first time since the Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003. 
Supersonic designs have struggled to meet current subsonic noise standards due to engine constraints, but Aerion said in October it would be able to take off and land without regulatory changes in the United States, providing a potential boost to efforts to bring back faster air travel. 

 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's GE Aviation unit has said it completed initial designs for the new Affinity turbofan engine, which will be used in Aerion's AS2 jet, while Honeywell (NYSE:HON) Aerospace has said it would develop the cockpit for the AS2.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>","Small-cap stocks shrug off debt concerns, for the moment","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Small-cap stocks were among the biggest losers during the stock market's rout late last year as investors worried about high leverage, but they have outperformed in 2019's rebounding market, with shares of debt-laden companies leading the charge.
So far this year, the small-cap Russell 2000 index has advanced 12.9 percent, versus a 9-percent gain for the benchmark S&P 500 index. Another small-cap index, the S&P 600, has gained 12.1 percent.
An expected pause in the Federal Reserve's course of interest-rate hikes - and optimism that a recession is not imminent in the next 12 months - support a further run in small-caps, investors say. The caveat is that as economic growth and corporate earnings taper off, these companies will find it increasingly difficult to make payments on their borrowings. 
The rebound comes after the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600 both hit levels in December that were more than 20 percent below their August peaks, which many investors consider confirmation of a bear market. The S&P 500 bottomed 19.8 percent below its September peak, just missing the bear designation.
Small-cap stocks' performance typically tracks investor appetite for debt. Though the median debt-to-equity ratio for the S&P 500 is greater than that for the Russell 2000, small-caps are seen as more sensitive to debt concerns because such companies often secure financing through bank loans with adjustable rates rather than fixed-rate bonds.
Last year's rise in interest rates means more and more highly-indebted companies may have to scramble to make payments. The number of companies struggling with debt obligations is near record highs, according to the Institute of International Finance.
Moreover, of Russell 2000 companies, 38.3 percent have no net income, whereas only 1.4 percent of S&P 500 companies have no net income.
LEADING THE WAY UP
In December, credit spreads, the difference in yield between corporate securities and U.S. Treasuries, widened by the most in more than seven years for both high-yield and investment-grade corporate bonds, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofAML index data.
But as credit spreads have narrowed, a sign investors are less risk-averse, small-cap stocks have climbed. They got a further reprieve last Wednesday when Federal Reserve policymakers signaled a pause in its tightening cycle.
""With still-low interest rates and an environment of still-solid growth, the concerns about how many (companies) will default are just pushed off to the next slowdown in the cycle, which we don't see happening anytime soon,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.
Highly leveraged companies led the way down in late 2018 and have led the way higher this year. 
In the fourth quarter, the Russell 2000 companies whose shares were in the highest quartile of percentage declines had a median debt-to-equity ratio of 41.1 percent. By contrast, Russell 2000 companies whose shares were in the lowest quartile of percentage declines had a median debt-to-equity ratio of 32.3 percent, according to a Reuters analysis.
However, in January, the first group gained 16.6 percent on average, while the second group gained just 4.7 percent.
Highly leveraged small-caps on the upswing - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Tkhpnz
""They've dropped so much that they've become an area of interest to screen,"" said Scott Hood, chief executive at First Wilshire Securities Management in Pasadena, California, of highly-leveraged small caps.
DEBT CONCERNS LINGER
Yet concerns about leverage have not entirely abated as economists and market watchers anticipate the end of the current economic cycle in the next few years. 
At last week's news conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. central bank was monitoring corporate debt levels.
At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton pointed to corporate debt as an economic risk. 
""There's going to be a big focus this year by companies in general, but also small caps, to de-lever as much as they possibly can before the economy deteriorates,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
Even those sanguine on the prospects for small caps, such as Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, say they have focused more intensely on companies' balance sheets when picking stocks.
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York said the recent run-up in small caps is ""simply a dead-cat bounce."" 

""The levels of debt for not only small caps but also selective large caps remain an issue,"" he said.

181,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>","U.S. corporate enthusiasm for France cools, survey shows","By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - A dimming economic outlook and massive street protests against President Emmanuel Macron have made France less attractive for U.S. companies with investments in the country, a survey showed.
Firms from the United States are the single biggest source of foreign corporate investment in France and their confidence surged after Macron's 2017 election on a reform platform.
But the latest annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in France and consultants Bain & Company, released on Tuesday, showed that only 30 percent of executives at U.S. companies in France consider the country an attractive market in 2018, down from 72 percent the year before.
The drop was mainly due to the number with a neutral view, which rose to 50 percent from 19 percent, the survey said.
However, 42 percent of the executives at the 127 companies polled planned to hire more people in France, while 41 percent intended to keep headcount stable.
Even though the poll was conducted in December and January, when waves of violent street protests saw cars burnt and windows smashed in central Paris and other cities, 55 percent of those polled said France enjoyed either a good or excellent perception at headquarters in the United States, up from 48 percent.
With Britain facing Brexit, Italy doubts about its budget and German questions about its post-Merkel future, France is proving easier to grasp for U.S. firms, the survey found. 
""The situation in our neighboring countries is difficult to read,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) country head Mathieu Gelis told journalists.
""France as a bet on an industrial or financial project offers more certainty versus our partners in a volatile environment. But I agree that it remains fragile,"" he added.
Some 56 percent of those polled considered that the pace of Macron's reform drive was meeting their expectations, while seven percent indicated that it was surpassing theirs.
Macron launched an overhaul of France's strict labor laws and scrapped its wealth tax during his first year in office, but planned reforms of corporate law, unemployment insurance and pensions are falling behind schedule.

Following the recent unrest, the social climate was a concern for 84 percent of the executives polled in the survey, with 77 percent concerned about France's national debt, which is flirting with 100 percent of economic output.

""Guidance for fiscal third quarter 2019, though in line with consensus on revenue, is modestly softer for operating margins and earnings per share,"" JPMorgan said.
Hard-disk storage provider Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) posted a second-quarter earnings and revenue beat despite grappling with tough backdrop for the memory market.
But Wall Street overlooked the upbeat results as the company's dour third-quarter guidance fuelled worries. Its shares fell 2%.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc wrapped up FAANG earnings by posting better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit. However, worries about sharply higher spending, sent its shares down 0.8 percent.
Google parent's shares were the only FAANG stock in the red. A 1.4 percent rise in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) boosted the technology index, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's rise of 1.2 percent pushed the consumer discretionary sector higher.
""It's been a pretty good earnings season, whether it's top-line or bottom-line numbers — there's still growth. The bar has been lowered and companies are able to step over the hurdle,"" said Chad Oviatt, director of investment management for Huntington Private Bank in Columbus, Ohio.
""When you look at tech companies you see them forecasting growth and that can be seen from their capital spending plans which came out of the Google's earnings report.""
Also helping the market was Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 2 percent rise after the planemaker said it made a significant investment in supersonic business jet developer Aerion.
Following a turbulent end to 2018, U.S. stocks have had a stellar run this year with the benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Industrials up about 9 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 11 percent.
The rally has been helped by a recent dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, hopes of a trade deal between the United States and China and a largely positive fourth-quarter earnings season.
About 71 percent of the S&P 500 companies, that have reported earnings, have topped estimates. While expectations for fourth-quarter earnings growth are 15.8 percent, estimates for the first-quarter are much lower at 0.4 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Trump is set to challenge Democrats to approve funding for his long-sought border wall before the Congress at his State of the Union speech due at 09:00 p.m. ET (0200 GMT Wednesday).
The President has contemplated declaring a national emergency as the Congress wasn't moving toward a deal to fund building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but a source close to Trump said the President was not expected to take that step.
At 12:51 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 113.48 points, or 0.45 percent, at 25,352.85, the S&P 500 was up 4.58 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,729.45 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 29.79 points, or 0.41 percent, at 7,377.33.
Bank stocks fell and pulled the financials sector down 0.5 percent, weighing the most on the S&P 500 as yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds slipped. 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.35-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.21-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 12 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 10 new lows.

The Canadian Institute of Steel Construction (CISC) was responding to a petition filed by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) asking for anti-dumping and countervailing duties on some fabricated structural steel from Canada, Mexico and China, alleging that the imports were hurting U.S. steel producers.
The petition was filed on Monday to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). 
""AISC's allegations that these products from Canada are unfairly traded and cause injury to U.S. producers of fabricated steel products are baseless,"" Ed Whalen, chief executive officer of the CISC, said on Tuesday.
""The negative effects of the Section 232 steel tariffs are the more likely cause of injury for the U.S. downstream steel sector, not Canada."" 
The USITC's website on Tuesday showed that it was investigating these claims by AISC, listing the probe as ""active."" Investigations do not always lead to new duties. 

AISC could not be immediately reached for comment.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Canadian canola runs into Chinese delays after Huawei arrest,"By Rod Nickel, Dominique Patton and Hallie Gu
WINNIPEG, Manitoba/BEIJING (Reuters) - A political dispute between China and Canada over the arrest of a Huawei executive is slowing canola shipments through Chinese ports and causing some importers to hesitate to buy from their biggest supplier, according to interviews with a dozen traders.
Since Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December for extradition to the United States, China detained two Canadians and escalated a drug smuggling sentence against a third Canadian to death, moves Ottawa has described as deeply concerning. 
In the same period, cargoes of Canadian canola have taken longer to clear Chinese customs and GMO permits needed to import genetically modified crops, including canola, became more difficult to obtain, traders said. Back in Canada, canola stocks piled up to a record-high level at year-end, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday. 
China buys some C$2.5 billion ($1.90 billion) of Canadian canola per year, and a slower sales pace would be another hit to exporters, which include Richardson International, Viterraand Cargill Ltd in a year when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a tough race for re-election.
Spokespersons for Richardson and Viterra did not respond and Cargill declined to comment.
While several cargoes of Canadian canola have cleared customs since Meng's Dec. 1 arrest, many were unusually delayed, said traders. 
One Chinese crusher that had a cargo that arrived at the end of December said it took more than 20 days to clear customs, about twice the usual time, as authorities carried out more thorough inspections related to GMOs.
A second cargo that arrived in mid January had not been cleared by the end of the month.
China is likely carrying out the heightened checks to ""pressure Canada"" amid the current diplomatic tensions, the crusher said, adding that it would make him ""more cautious"" about purchases in the future.
A Canadian exporter said canola seed that requires crushing in China into vegetable oil and meal to feed pigs and fish has faced additional inspections and tests in Chinese ports.
""There's no doubt that they are retaliating specifically against canola seed itself,"" the exporter said.
China's General Administration of Customs, which oversees imports, did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the issue.   
The Canadian government is not aware of any decision by Beijing to stop Chinese companies from buying Canadian crops, said James Watson, a spokesman for the Canadian agriculture department.
COOLING INTEREST
Some Canadian canola shipments are due to arrive in China this month, but Canadian exporters said most of them are deliveries of sales made before Meng's detention in Vancouver. 
A dozen traders, some with direct knowledge of sales in Canada and China, and others in the United States who monitor sales, said the shipping pace has noticeably slowed since Meng's arrest. 
Factors besides the political dispute may also play a role in reduced interest from Chinese buyers, such as lower demand for pig feed and weak profit margins at Chinese processors. 
There is no evidence to suggest that Beijing has ordered buying to slow. But some importers say they are avoiding purchases as they pre-empt additional hurdles to trade. 
Total exports of Canada's most recent canola crop are down 7 percent year over year from August through Jan. 27, according to the Canadian Grain Commission. Chinese customs data showed that China received 347,949 tonnes of Canadian canola in December, higher than the same month a year earlier, reflecting earlier sales. 
A source at a Chinese company that imports Canadian canola said it stopped buying from Canadian sources shortly after Meng's arrest. 
""We are not buying now as the current situation is quite tense and sensitive,"" the source said. China relies on Canada to supply more than 90 percent of its canola imports. But Beijing has imposed barriers on these shipments in the past, giving reasons such as concern about fungus and foreign material in cargoes. 
Canola's name itself incorporates Canada, the country where it was developed as a new form of rapeseed in the 1970s, making it a national symbol and ""a weak spot where they can hit us,"" a Canadian exporter said, adding that other Canadian exports such as soybeans and canola meal have not faced similar obstacles in China.
Another Canadian trader said he was not aware of any Canadian export company booking a new canola shipment to China since Meng's arrest. ""It brings a lump to everyone's throat.""

Canola futures prices have stayed firm since the arrest, but brokers say worries about China have caused prices for canola to miss out on a rally in its oilseed cousin soyoil.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC is preparing to lay off dozens of staff in its global banking and markets business, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The British bank, which is conducting a cost-cutting drive aimed at protecting its dividend, declined to comment on the redundancies, which will mainly impact sales and advisory staff.
Those affected will be informed this week, the source said.
The cuts follow several weeks of performance reviews and planning for 2019 by the bank's senior management team, which was recently joined by former Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) executive Ewen Stevenson as its new chief financial officer.
The source, who declined to be named, said entire sales teams had been axed, with some members of staff leaving the bank's London headquarters in Canary Wharf on Tuesday. 
The cuts follow a turbulent period for the global banking and markets division, which houses HSBC's trading and investment banking businesses.
The investment bank suffered an exodus of high-profile dealmakers in Europe last year, amid what sources said was frustration at a lack of a clear strategy.
HSBC has since made some senior hires from rivals, including former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker Greg Guyett as co-head of global banking, and former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Peter Enns as the global head of its financial institutions group.
None of the bank's identified areas for growth in its most recent strategy update last June mentioned the trading business, with Chief Executive John Flint more focused on its traditional strengths of corporate and retail banking.

Flint said HSBC would focus on making sure revenues grow faster than costs, as the bank seeks to improve its return on equity to above 11 percent by 2020 from 6.8 percent in 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Smaller firms will not have to clear their derivatives trades under changes to European Union rules agreed by the bloc's lawmakers and member states on Tuesday to cut red tape.
The revision of rules for privately-traded or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives also streamlines requirements for reporting transactions, the bloc's executive European Commission said in a statement.
It extends a waiver from clearing of derivative contracts from pension schemes by two years, it added.
The revision seeks to make it easier to access a clearing house, a third party that stands between two sides of a derivatives trade to ensure its smooth completion.
""In particular, the text introduces an obligation on clearing brokers to provide services on fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent commercial terms by ensuring in particular transparency on fees as well as unbiased and rational contractual arrangements,"" EU member states said in a statement.
During the financial crisis a decade ago, regulators had no central records for checking which institutions were exposed to derivatives trades held by struggling banks, fuelling uncertainty in markets.
Regulators later introduced mandatory clearing and reporting of derivatives transactions that traded privately among banks and large institutional investors such as pension funds in order to increase safety and transparency.
The EU, and the United States, are now revisiting post-crisis rules that were passed quickly in order to make them work better and be less costly for smaller firms.
Tuesday's revision was thrashed out by members of the European Parliament and representatives of EU states. It will need formal rubber-stamping by both bodies to take effect.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>","Ralph Lauren steps up Instagram game, tops holiday sales forecasts","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - A marketing blitz involving supermodels and Instagram helped Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) woo more customers and report another quarter of better-than-expected sales and earnings, sending its shares up over 12 percent on Tuesday.
The 50-year-old luxury retailer, known for its preppy Polo shirts, spent about 18 percent more on marketing during the December quarter when compared with a year earlier, sponsoring fashion events and hiring supermodels and actors to promote its brand on Instagram.
Victoria's Secret model Taylor Hill promoted a new line of Ralph Lauren fragrances, while ""Quantico"" star Priyanka Chopra and singer Nick Jonas wore Ralph Lauren at their much-followed wedding.
""You can have the best product in the world but the Gen Z, Gen Y and even Gen X consumer will know nothing about it without the right influencers and the right social media,"" Jane Hali, head of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates, said.
Ralph Lauren now has 9.8 million followers on Instagram, some 1.6 million more than it did in October, research from Hali's firm showed.
The marketing helped Ralph Lauren sell more coats, shirts and accessories at higher prices even when the market was flooded with holiday-season discounts, Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said on a conference call with analysts.
Ralph Lauren has also begun timed, limited-edition sales on its mobile app, often called a ""drop,"" copying Supreme and other popular brands which use the strategy to create brand awareness and a sense of exclusivity.
Louvet also said a menswear launch with UK-based Palace had sold out in under an hour, while three-fourths of the people who bought it globally were completely new to Ralph Lauren.
""It's not really directly affecting sales because the drops aren't that large but it creates hype,"" Hali said.
NO CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA
Ralph Lauren said there were no signs of a slowdown in China, allaying concerns about customer demand in a cooling economy in the midst of a trade dispute with the United States.
Quarterly revenue from Greater China rose 19 percent in constant currency terms, Ralph Lauren said, as it opened new stores and partnered with distributors on platforms like Tmall and WeChat. Still, the New York-headquartered company was ""highly underdeveloped"" in the region, executives said.
Overall, its net revenue rose 5.1 percent to $1.73 billion, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.66 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding one-time items, it earned $2.32 per share, which also exceeded analysts' estimates of $2.15, marking the ninth successive quarter of better-than-expected sales and earnings for Ralph Lauren.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",Your Money: The romance and reality of running a food truck,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anyone with a boring 9-to-5 job and some culinary talent has at some point probably dreamed of opening their own food truck.
Just think of it: Hitting the road, hanging out at music festivals, making delicious food, being your own boss. 
While running a food truck does involve all those things, it also means plenty of not-so-dreamy things like parking tickets, health permits, hefty payments to event operators, mechanical repairs and sweaty, hard work. 
This is what Jill Moskites learned on the road in Connecticut. As one-half of the team operating Hartford’s The Whey Station (with husband Josh), she has been making divine grilled-cheese sandwiches on the go for almost eight years.
Along the way the duo has garnered accolades like Best Food Truck in Hartford, Best Grilled Cheese in Connecticut – and Jill even became a champion on the popular TV show ""Chopped.""
“It’s an exciting life, but you have to be willing to work hard, because it’s incredibly difficult,” said Moskites, who now operates three mobile locations and one brick-and-mortar restaurant, Whey Station(ary), in Middletown, Connecticut.
It took the couple a full three years before they saw the operation as a viable, standalone business.
Many other would-be chefs harbor the same dream. There are now more than 4,000 food trucks rumbling around the nation, according to market research firm IBISWorld. That means an annual growth rate of 7.3 percent over the last five years, for an industry that brought in almost a billion dollars in 2017.
Revenue can vary wildly by product and location. On average, IBISWorld found that wages will gobble up 38.7 percent, and food purchases 39.7 percent. In terms of profit, you are going to be left with 7.7 percent. If you are pulling in $200,000, for instance, that is just $15,400.
So how can food-truck dreamers drive their way to steady financial success? A few road-tested tips:
*Do one thing, and do it well. 
Most food trucks go wrong trying to generalize. ""I have personally seen 15-20 trucks come and go just in my own town, because they didn't really know what their concept was, and were just flying by the seat of their pants,"" said Bruce Smith, owner of Chick-N-Nooga in Chattanooga, Tennessee, whose truck serves his specialty fried chicken.
When you have settled on a home-run dish, then you can develop your brand by building Twitter followers, posting mouth-watering Instagram pics, partnering with other local brands and making media appearances.
* Start small with the truck.
Your natural instinct will be to buy the biggest, best food truck out there. Part of this expense will depend on your location, and state regulations: In Texas you might be able to get a new truck for $40,000, said Matt Geller, CEO of the National Food Truck Association, while in California a tricked-out ride can range from $110,000 to $170,000.
But get something reasonable - or consider renting or leasing to start. Chattanooga's Bruce Smith, for instance, stayed conservative with his $25,000 trailer.
The Whey Station started with a beater. ""Other trucks used to laugh at us, because ours was so ugly. But an hour into the event, when lines started forming, they weren’t laughing anymore,” Moskites said. 
*Be wary of events. 
Event organizers have begun to see food trucks as cash cows, skimming a big part of their take. That makes it almost impossible to make a buck - and if you have to hike your prices to break even, that risks alienating your loyal fans.
“Watch out for any event that is taking over 20 percent of your money,” said Smith. “Some are even charging 30 percent or more these days. I would just steer clear of those.”
*Calculate all costs, not just some. 
Non-food costs will probably take you by surprise.
Fuel, labor, insurance, permits, power usage and parking all add up. For food trucks around L.A. and Orange County, they might be looking at 10-15 different business licenses and $1,700 just to obtain the right to start selling, Geller said.

Since every event and each Connecticut town requires its own permit, the Moskites dropped $6,000 just on permits in a single year. For them it has been worth it, as they have managed to boost revenue by $50,000 every single year.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 11:48AM ET</span>","EU anti-fraud group heads for Estonia, Denmark to learn Danske Bank lessons","By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - In the wake of Danske Bank's money laundering scandal, an EU committee will visit Estonia and Denmark this week to meet regulators, prosecutors and the bank's new management to discuss ways to crack down harder on fraud.
Between 2007 and 2015, 200 billion euros ($228 billion) of suspicious payments from Russia and other states flowed through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank, which is being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States.
Europe has been hit by a string of money laundering scandals recently, including the collapse of Latvia's ABLV Bank, the closure of Malta's Pilatus Bank and a 775 million euro fine imposed on Dutch lender ING.
EU governments reached a preliminary deal in December to clamp down on money laundering by strengthening bank supervision through the European Banking Authority (EBA).
Now the European Parliament's Special Committee on Tax Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance is looking for inspiration to tighten laws further on a trip to Denmark and Estonia from Wednesday to Friday.
Jeppe Kofod, a spokesman for the committee, said what was needed was a European platform where the countries' financial intelligence units could exchange information swiftly to tip off each other and help solve crimes.
""I would like a financial ""FBI"" where national police authorities can cooperate and move in, in case of money laundering or other serious fraud,"" Kofod said.
Danish and Estonian financial regulators have been blaming each other for the scandal, which has highlighted the need for better cross-border surveillance.
""There have been plenty of warnings in the case, but not enough action and on-site follow-ups,"" Kofod said. ""So there is obviously clear failures from Danske Bank, but also a regulatory work that has proved not to be working properly"".
Besides the authorities' investigations more than a dozen law firms have said they are trying to gather shareholders to sue Denmark's largest bank over a scandal that has already cost it its CEO and chairman.
Brussels-based consultancy firm Deminor has sent a letter to bank's board saying it would ""seek the appointment of an independent investigator"" at the bank's shareholders meeting on March 18.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>",Too little too late? No-deal Brexit planning shakes service suppliers,"By Elisabeth O'Leary
LONDON (Reuters) - From Britain's hospitals and schools to its prisons and armed forces, firms supplying essential public services have been asked by the government to outline plans for a no-deal Brexit.
But with exit day set for March 29, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to strike a deal to leave the European Union which is acceptable to parliament, leaving the companies worried that the government is doing too little too late.
""The government has written to some of us asking us 'what are you doing in preparation for a no-deal?' - which is timely, at eight weeks to go,"" one industry source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""I have never been in such an unknowing place in all of my corporate life,"" the source added.
Private firms including Babcock, Capita, Serco,  G4S  (CO:G4S), Mitie and Compass play a central role in providing Britain's public services, which means they have to procure medicines, toiletries, food, spare parts and labor, much of which come from the EU.
Britain began outsourcing in the 1980s and private firms now carry out work with contracts valued at 250 billion pounds ($324 billion) for the government each year.
But their role has come under scrutiny since the collapse of Carillion last year, sparking a debate about how much public work should be done by private contractors.
Britain's government has allocated 2 billion pounds funding to support Brexit preparations for 2019/20 which reaches across 25 government and arms-length bodies for both ""deal"" and ""no-deal"" scenarios. 
NO-DEAL NERVES
While the government says it is confident it will strike a deal with the EU, companies worry that may not be the case. If Britain exits abruptly, new customs checks could lead to major delays at ports with a knock-on effect on the supplies needed for them to provide day-to-day services.
""Companies are getting more and more nervous (about a no-deal Brexit),"" a second industry source said, echoing fears raised by Serco's CEO Rupert Soames who in December described the British business climate as ""bad and getting worse"".
""I am increasingly worried we are now in a place where people are talking about supply chains and trying to guarantee them. But beyond stockpiling, nobody actually knows what no-deal might mean,"" another source in the sector told Reuters. 
A survey last week showed that factories had stockpiled goods in January at the fastest rate since records began in the early 1990s in case of a chaotic Brexit.
""Leaving the EU with a deal remains the government's top priority - but in December, we took the decision to step up no deal planning to ensure we are fully prepared,"" a government spokesperson said of its plans.
Providers of services for the defense sector are among those who have been asked to share contingency plans.
Three sources said they had received a letter from the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Forzani last week asking about their efforts.
""As part of our no deal preparations, we are talking to suppliers to ensure any potential challenges or impacts are addressed. This is routine contingency planning,"" an MoD spokesperson said.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>",Growing field of activist investors pushes companies to perform better,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - More investors who typically make passive bets flexed their muscles last year and helped push a total of 922 companies to perform better by improving operations and capital allocation, data from research group Activist Insight show.
The data show that 922 companies were approached last year compared with 856 companies approached in 2017 by investors who had ideas on how management could run the business better or who asked for board seats.
So-called occasional activists were the most pushy last year, contacting 266 companies with public demands, the data show. In 2017 they reached out to 240 companies. These investors are typically passive shareholders who try to protect existing investments by demanding improvements at underperforming companies.
The numbers also show that only 116 companies were contacted by primary focus activists, the large hedge funds that have made their reputations over the years by pushing for change at companies from Allergan (NYSE:AGN) to Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) 
""More entrants into the activism space does limit the options for the big name activists,"" said Josh Black, an analyst at Activist Insight, which tracks activist fund managers and their activities.
Activist Insight worked with law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel to compile its annual review.
To be sure many primary focus activists like Starboard Value, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management and Third Point were busy in 2018 targeting companies ranging from Newell Brands to United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) to Campbell Soup. 
But as a group, primary focus activists targeted only 116 companies in 2018 after having reached out to 121 companies in 2017. This made them the least pushy last year, the data show.
And the brand-name activists are still commanding attention from corporate chiefs. Elliott Management, one of the biggest firms to pursue activist strategies, was busier than ever in 2018 and launched 24 new campaigns. And Starboard won 29 seats through negotiated settlements in 2018.
Referring to these types of firms who started 2019 on a busy note, Schulte Roth partner Eleazer Klein said pure play activists will always be around and working. ""These people are not going away.""
And they will raise money even amid poor returns where the average activist hedge fund lost roughly 11 percent last year. ""Fund raising is certainly more challenging especially when firms are not performing. But I don't think these types of firms will have problems.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline bolstered its cancer drug development pipeline on Tuesday, agreeing to pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to Germany's Merck KGaA for the rights to a next-generation immunotherapy.
Merck will receive an upfront payment of 300 million euros for the drug - known as M7824, or bintrafusp alfa - and is eligible for potential payments of up to 500 million euros depending on development milestones in lung cancer, the two companies said in statements on Tuesday.
Merck could also get up to a further 2.9 billion euros, depending on commercial milestones, for a total deal value of as much as 3.7 billion euros.
Merck will book any future U.S. sales from the product, while GSK will account for sales from other parts of the world.
GSK in December moved to bolster its cancer medicines cabinet with the $5.1 billion purchase of Tesaro. 
Later that month, it unveiled plans to separate its prescription drugs and vaccines business from its over-the-counter products unit under a joint venture deal with Pfizer's consumer health division.
""For GSK, this alliance is a further step in the company's priority to strengthen its pharmaceuticals pipeline,"" it said.
The M7824 drug, a fusion protein that triggers two immune responses to cancer cells, is being tested on 10 tumour types and was recently shown to delay the progression of a certain type of lung cancer for at least 9.5 months in half of the trial participants.
Merck has already started a mid-stage phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer, comparing M7824 directly with U.S. rival Merck & Co's Keytruda, currently seen as the most promising cancer immunotherapy on the market with $7.2 billion in 2018 sales.
Keytruda is part of a class of immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, which are expected to generate well over $20 billion in combined annual revenues over the next few years.
Merck KGaA, which has no ownership ties with Merck & Co, is competing in that class with a drug called Bavencio, jointly developed with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), but analysts expect the drug to play only a minor commercial role.
For M7824, Merck combined Bavencio's mode of action with another immune response booster known as TGF-beta-inhibtion.
""This combination in a single molecule is unique. We don't know of any other at this time,"" said Belen Garijo, the head of Merck's healthcare division.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said the trial against Keytruda was the main study to watch.
""We expect investors to see the deal as a bold move to build GSK's late stage oncology pipeline, bringing in an asset with very large potential but with substantial risk,"" they wrote in a note. 
Merck's shares traded 2.1 percent higher at 1420 GMT, while GSK was up 1.7 percent, both outperforming the 0.7 percent gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",EU moves to make UK charge VAT on commodity trading include ICE Europe,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Moves by the European Commission to make Britain charge value-added tax on commodity derivatives trading will include ICE (NYSE:ICE) Futures Europe, the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM) and the London Metal Exchange (LME), trading sources say.
The Commission has been looking at zero-rated VAT on commodity derivatives trading in the UK for some years, but sources say recent activity is part of a drive to pressure Britain ahead of its European Union withdrawal in March.
Last month, the Commission referred Britain to the European Court of Justice for extending the scope of measures that allow commodity derivatives traded on ""terminal markets"" in the UK to be zero rated for VAT.
""(The) referral follows the United Kingdom's failure to bring its legislation into line with EU VAT law following the Commission's reasoned opinion in July 2018,"" the Commission, executive arm of the EU, said on its website.
If Britain leaves the EU without an exit deal, there will be no case to answer. But any deal that keeps the UK subject to EU rules could mean significantly higher costs for Europe's commodity trading community. 
""This is the latest stage in ongoing discussions with the Commission over the UK's VAT treatment of certain commodity derivatives,"" the UK Treasury said.
""This does not have any immediate effect on UK tax law on commodity derivatives. We will respond in due course.""
The ""terminal markets order"" (TMO), which allows zero VAT to be applied to commodity derivatives trading, was agreed in 1973.
""Why hasn't this come up before? They are trying to kill our commodity markets,"" a commodity trading source said.
The source added that UK authorities would have made sure ""everything was in order"" as commodities trading had expanded over the years.
Futures and options contracts for crude oil, natural gas, power, coal, emissions and soft commodities are traded on ICE Futures Europe. ICE declined to comment.
The LPPM is an over-the-counter trading centre for platinum and palladium. It is a members association and not an exchange.
LPPM consultant Anne Dennison said it was monitoring the situation.
Base metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc are traded on the LME, one of the 11 original exchanges named in the deal agreed after Britain joined the European Union. 
""The LME continues to work with its stakeholders to ensure ongoing effective trading on the LME’s market,"" the exchange said.
Paris-based Euronext applies a standard VAT rate for financial services on transaction fees for its commodity derivative markets.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that Paul Stephany, who managed about 1.8 billion pounds invested mainly in UK equities at Newton, tried to use the collective power of investors to undermine proper market pricing processes and risked causing harm to other market players.
Stephany, who had worked in financial services for a decade, told 14 rival fund managers of his valuation limits during an IPO of On The Beach Plc and used similar tactics during a share placing by Market Tech Holdings in 2015, the FCA said.
""These markets play a vital role in helping companies raise capital in the UK's financial markets and when they are put at risk the FCA will take action,"" said Mark Steward, the FCA's head of enforcement and market oversight.
Stephany, a business consultant since leaving Newton in 2017, was fined 32,300 pounds - about 10 percent of his salary at the time. He said he was pleased the FCA recognised he had acted unintentionally and that he had been open and transparent.
""I fully respect the regulator's decision, which acknowledges that my honesty and integrity as a fund manager are not in doubt and that no market user lost out financially due to my actions,"" he said.
""This is why the penalty has been set at the lowest level available and I am able to continue working in the financial sector.""
The FCA said the investigation was not related to a separate inquiry announced in 2017 into whether four asset management companies - including Newton - might have broken competition law during share sales.
A spokeswoman at Newton said it was not company policy to comment on matters relating to former or current employees, but that the firm had been cooperating fully with the FCA. She declined to comment further.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>","Bangladesh suppliers to H&M, Next lay off workers after wage protests","By Serajul Quadir and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - At least three garment manufacturers in Bangladesh that supply European brands such as H&M and Next have laid off thousands of workers weeks after they had joined wage protests, union leaders said on Tuesday.
The layoffs come after days of protests and clashes between police and workers in January that prompted the government to intervene and compel manufacturers to raise wages.
""Workers who chanted slogans or left factories and joined in processions to demand wage increases, and the ones who have any link to trade bodies, are now losing jobs,"" said Kazi Ruhul Amin, head of the Bangladesh Garment Workers' Trade Union Center.
Babul Akhter, head of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, said at least 7,580 workers from 27 factories had been laid off in recent weeks.
Bangladesh's $30 billion readymade garments industry accounts for 80 percent of the country's exports, making it the world's second-biggest garment exporter after China. 
Siddiqur Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association, said workers accused of vandalism during the protests ""and other destructive acts are facing charges and will have to face punishment.""
Some workers said they had protested peacefully and lost their jobs because they tried to unionize other workers.
""I was surprised when I saw my name at the top of the list,"" said one woman who asked not to be identified.
""During the protests, I came to work everyday. And I was never involved in any rampage or wrongdoing,"" she said. ""My name and my fellow workers' names were included because we had tried to form a union.""
A senior official in Bangladesh's Ministry of Labor and Employment declined to comment on the layoffs.
NOTHING ILLEGAL
Union leaders said three manufacturers - Crony Group, East West Industrial Park Ltd and Metro Knitting & Dyeing Mills Ltd - had laid off workers. 
The garment makers list Sweden's H&M and British clothing retailer Next as clients on their websites.
Crony and Metro were not immediately available for comment.
Aminul Islam, chief administrator of East West, said some workers attacked the factory and destroyed assets on Jan. 7. He said more than 800 of its 6,500 workers had been suspended after the incident.
Harun Ur Rashid, chairman of East West Group, said the company was ""not do anything illegal or unjust"" when asked about layoffs at the firm. 
""We know if we do that, then buyers will not take this lightly and they will not like it,"" he said.
Foreign brands said they are closely watching the situation in Bangladesh. 
""Next is aware of the situation - and its directly-employed audit staff on the ground in Bangladesh are currently investigating this matter,"" the retailer said in an email.  
H&M said it ""regards freedom of association to be a non-negotiable human right,"" and that it is ""deeply concerned by the recent events in the Bangladeshi textile industry.""

DECATUR, Texas/FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Mickey McMaster is on his 12th pickup truck. 
The 61-year old farm equipment dealer in Decatur, Texas, two weeks ago treated himself to a 2019 GMC Denali for around $69,000 - a reward for long hours at work.
“For me this is the Cadillac of trucks, it’s a real luxury vehicle,"" McMaster said. ""I’ve worked my way up to afford a truck like this and it shows that I’ve earned it.”  
McMaster is the kind of customer General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is banking on as it plans to add 1,000 jobs at a plant in Flint, Michigan that will build a new generation of its largest pickups. Demand from Texas and other heartland states for big pick-ups is providing a lifeline to many workers the No. 1 U.S. automaker is laying off at plants elsewhere. 
The Detroit Three automakers and thousands of their U.S. workers are counting on customers like McMaster to keep buying bigger and more luxurious pickup trucks even if overall U.S. vehicle demand weakens this year, as most analysts predict.
At Flint, GM will build a new generation of its heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierras, including luxury models that are some of the most profitable vehicles on the planet. GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Ram division own the segment and are each doubling down with new or redesigned models launching this year. 
Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000. 
GM on Tuesday will celebrate the launch of a new generation of heavy-duty GMC and Chevrolet pickups at the assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, that is now building all such trucks for the company. 
At the same time that GM is laying off thousands of U.S. workers and planning to shutter five North American factories, Flint is hiring. The plant runs on three daily shifts, six days a week. As the new model’s assembly system ramps up, the plant’s capacity will increase by more than 25 percent, plant manager Mike Perez told Reuters. 
The Flint plant plans to add 1,000 workers, more than half of the 1,500 factory workers who have asked to transfer from plants GM has targeted for shutdown as part of CEO Mary Barra's restructuring plan.
“We’re bringing in 50 to 100 people every week,” said Perez.
Workers last week were still finishing the job of retooling the Flint factory to build the new heavy-duty trucks as part of a $1.5 billion investment project. 
A highlight of the new assembly line: two-story tall Fanuc robots hoist a cab and a bed for a truck from separate pallets, swing them in opposing arcs, then gently lower them onto a truck frame to be bolted together by different robots. 
Detroit Three executives boast that the heavy-duty pickup market is protected by ""moats"" - a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks and decades of engineering that have yielded vehicles that haul 30,000 pound trailers, ride like large luxury sedans, and offer the same safety and connectivity technology as a BMW or Lexus luxury car.
Pickup trucks account for three-quarters of the 235 or so new vehicles Carey “CW” Williams (NYSE:WMB) sells each month at his Decatur dealership. And nearly half of those are higher-end, luxury models that can sell for $70,000 or more.
Williams said he is not concerned about the new Ram trucks as competition for GM. 
“Pickup trucks are our bread and butter, and we’ve got the new model to prove it with all the bells and whistles customers want,” he said.
Mark Ary, 37, a second-generation owner of an HVAC installation/repair business, paid $65,000 for a white 2019 Silverado High Country. He liked the air conditioning for the truck's rear seats, its 360-degree cameras, and hands-free technology that allows him to call and text. 
“GM really stepped it up with the technology for the 2019 truck,” Ary said.
'MASSIVE' TRUCKS
Ford, the leader in the heavy-duty pickup segment, will launch later this year versions of its F-series Super Duty pickups with a 7.3 liter gasoline engine - more than three times the displacement of the power-plant in a typical Ford Fusion sedan. 
Fiat Chrysler's Ram brand is revving up a redesigned lineup of heavy-duty pickups offering optional 12-inch display screens and a 6.7 liter  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) diesel engine that delivers 1,000 pound-feet of torque - enough to haul a 35,000 pound trailer. 
GM's Silverado and GMC heavy-duty trucks will offer new diesel engines, 10-speed transmissions and trailer-towing capability “well in excess of 30,000 pounds,” said Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM's large pickup and SUV programs.
The new Chevrolet and GMC trucks coming down the Flint assembly line stand out from older models on the same line. They are taller and have more imposing hoods and grilles than the older trucks.
“We wanted the truck to look massive,” Herrick said. 
HEAVY-DUTY INVESTMENT
Detroit automakers are investing heavily to expand their profitable heavy pickup franchises beyond commercial and work customers. 
Each has luxury heavy-duty pickup models, such as Ram's Laramie Longhorn, Ford's Limited and Chevrolet's High Country. GM has developed a multi-model luxury truck sub-brand, GMC Denali. Now, 60 percent of GMC heavy-duty pickups sold wear the Denali badge, GMC global brand chief Duncan Aldred told Reuters. With a diesel engine, sticker prices top $70,000.
Heavy-duty pickups are not subject to the same federal fuel economy rules as lighter trucks and sedans. They fall under less stringent standards applied to commercial trucks, where a vehicle's capacity for work allows for more fuel consumption. These pickups do not have mileage estimates on their price stickers as lighter trucks do.
The growing sales of heavy-duty pickups and their evolution toward luxury, personal use vehicles is drawing criticism from advocates of curbing carbon dioxide emissions. 
""With a 7.3-liter engine, Ford's new massive pickup deserves to be launched as the Ford Valdez,"" Dan Becker, director of the Center for Auto Safety's Safe Climate Campaign, wrote in an email. 
In Flint, the assignment to build GM's new heavy duty trucks is a lifeline for workers like Randy Randall, a 41-year GM veteran who said he has worked at several GM plants, moving when layoffs hit. Now, he checks trucks at the end of the Flint assembly line.
Randall smiled as a screen in front of his GMC truck flashed a message that it had passed the tests. “It’s got a great future,” he said.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Tuesday it will add 1,000 workers to build new heavy-duty pickup trucks at its plant in Flint, Michigan, and will give priority to GM workers who were laid off elsewhere.
GM has come under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump and Midwestern lawmakers for its plans to stop production at five North American factories and cut up to 15,000 jobs. The automaker has said it is trying to find new jobs for 1,500 U.S. hourly workers at the affected plants. Flint could be a haven for many of these employees.
Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000. 

GM on Tuesday will celebrate the launch of a new generation of heavy-duty GMC and Chevrolet pickups at the assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, that is now building all such trucks for the company.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",BP's 2018 profit doubles to five-year high as output soars,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) joined its competitors in posting a strong 2018 performance, with a doubling of profits driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following a large U.S. shale acquisition. 
Record utilization of its oil and gas fields and refining capacity further helped BP seal what was a transformational year as the aftermath of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster eased.
But while the London-listed firm's revenue beat forecasts, debt rose and the pace of its share buyback scheme slowed in the last quarter after it paid the first and largest tranche of the $10.5 billion BHP acquisition.
BP shares rose more than 3.3 percent in early trade, hitting their highest since early December. 
""We now have a powerful track record of safe and reliable performance, efficient execution and capital discipline. And we're doing this while growing the business,"" BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement on Tuesday.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) all reported stronger-than-forecast earnings last week driven by higher production in U.S. shale basins where Oil Majors have invested billions in recent years.
The strong gains came despite a sharp drop in crude prices at the end of the year that wiped out most gains made in share prices throughout the year.
Uncertainty over the outlook for oil prices as well as concerns over global economic growth and sino-American trade tensions are likely to continue to weigh on the sector.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters he expected Brent crude prices to hold around current levels of $60 a barrel in 2019, while demand was expected to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 million barrels per day, a similar pace to that seen in 2017.
Capital expenditure will be $15 to $17 billion this year, after reaching $15.1 billion in 2018, Gilvary said.
BP plans to sell $10 billion of assets over the next two years to help pay for the BHP deal, including a suite of fields in the United States as it focuses on the most attractive basins, he added.
PROFITS DOUBLE
After settling the vast majority of payments for the 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico, totaling nearly $70 billion, BP has more recently focused on growing production into the next decade, including the BHP deal which is its largest in 30 years.
For the year, BP's profit rose to a five-year high of $12.7 billion, double the previous year's $6.17 billion and above analyst expectations of $11.88 billion.
""Overall, we see this as a strong set of results, with stronger underlying earnings translating into cash,"" Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. 
Graphic: BP annual results - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Bl1O05
Graphic: BP quarterly profits - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HNkHOO
Production rose to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 after BP completed the acquisition of BHP's onshore U.S. shale portfolio and thanks to the start up of new fields including the 120,000 barrel per day Clair Ridge project in the North Sea. 
Excluding its share of production from its 20 percent stake in Russia's Rosneft, BP's production was up 8.2 percent from 2017.
Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP's market value, rose to 30.3 percent at the end of 2018 from 27.4 percent a year earlier. Net debt was $44.1 billion at the end of last year.

228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Oil Giants Are Pumping Out Torrents of Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest oil companies are pumping out cash like crude’s at $100 a barrel again, and investors love it.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc smashed analysts’ earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, giving investors assurance that their dividends and buybacks are secure even with oil trading near $60.
Those companies together generated close to $43 billion of cash flow from operations, the highest in more than four years. They achieved this despite a deep slump in crude prices at the end of the year, maintaining returns by keeping a tight grip on spending and squeezing more out of projects at lower prices.
""The 12-month rolling cash flow continues to point upwards, and I think that’s what’s important,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. “It isn’t just refining-led improvements, it isn’t just an upstream oil price, it’s widespread across the businesses.”
The market rewarded the companies’ efforts. BP surged the most in almost three years after its profit beat even the most optimistic analyst estimate. Shell’s B shares gained 3.6 percent when it reported earnings on Jan. 31, while Exxon and Chevron increased by a similar amount on Feb. 1. France’s  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), the fifth member of the oil-supermajor group, reports earnings Feb. 7.
The group’s strong performance comes at a crucial time. They need to remain attractive for shareholders who stuck with them through a years-long downturn because of the reliability and size of their dividends. Shell’s cash payout of almost $15.7 billion was the largest in the world, besting its Big Oil rivals and other corporate giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).
Beyond the dividend, major oil companies need to demonstrate they can maintain share buybacks, increase production, and still invest to grow. Shell’s Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said the company can “do it all.” BP can curb debt, repurchase shares and invest with oil at $50 a barrel, CFO Brian Gilvary said.
Chevron gave the market a pleasant surprise with a $25 billion stock buyback pledge. Exxon surpassed analysts’ forecasts with the biggest refining bonanza in six years and Permian Basin crude output that almost doubled. Exxon CEO Darren Woods said he would ramp up both spending and asset sales this year as the company plows billions into new drilling and refinery expansions.
Still, some concerns remain. BP’s debt is rising and its gearing -- the ratio of net debt to capital -- has breached the upper end of its target range of 30 percent. Shell didn’t replace all of the oil and gas reserves it produced last year, raising concerns among some analysts about future production. These issues could become significantly more urgent if oil prices were to fall again.
The companies are seeking to preempt these concerns by promising to remain efficient and disciplined with their spending and operations. For now, investors seem convinced, but companies will have to work hard to maintain this hard-won respect.
Asked in a Bloomberg interview what his focus for this year would be, BP’s Gilvary said: “Capital discipline, capital discipline, capital discipline.”

Revenue, however, came in just below Wall Street expectations at $3.09 billion compared to estimates of $3.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
That reflected lower advertising revenue and a hit from currency swings at a time when the company is fighting for its place in a hugely competitive and changing U.S. media landscape.
Domestic affiliate revenue, or the fees collected from U.S. cable and satellite operators and online distributors, rose 5 percent to $969 million. Analysts expected a 2.4 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet.
The company, which owns MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, said total affiliate revenue rose 3 percent to $1.17 billion, beating estimates of $1.11 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
As Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming service providers shake up the traditional U.S. cable industry, Viacom and sister company CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) are redoubling efforts to become original content resources for other distributors.
Viacom in November signed a multi-picture deal with Netflix and promised to make more films and TV shows for other companies.
Revenue from filmed entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures, rose 14 percent to $621 million.
Since taking charge in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish has focused on Paramount and the company's cable TV business.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.12 per share, above the average estimate of $1.03 per share. 

Net income attributable to Viacom fell to $321 million, or 80 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 from $537 million, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo demanded mining deals be more beneficial for Africa on Tuesday, calling on governments to end fiscal incentives traditionally used to attract investment to countries long viewed as rife with risk. 
Resource nationalism is high on the agenda at the African Mining Indaba in Cape Town as resource-holding governments, aware of the need for international miners to find new exploration territory, increase tax and royalty demands.
Akufo-Addo, leader of Africa's second-largest gold producer, said that the continent's reputation of political instability was outdated and improvements in the rule of law should be reflected in countries' relationships with mining companies.
""I believe we have come of age. We should not have to give unusual tax and royalties incentives. And mining companies should not expect to make extraordinary profits on our continent,"" he told the conference.
Over the past decade, a number of African governments have reviewed mining contracts, seeking to recalibrate partnerships and increase their share of mining revenues.
Last year, Democratic Republic of Congo - the world's biggest producer of cobalt - rewrote its mining code, ignoring the objections of miners. It canceled existing stability clauses in contracts and raised royalty rates across the board. 
Neighboring Tanzania, once one of Africa's most attractive jurisdictions for international investors, has also cracked down on the industry, hitting gold miner Acacia with a $190 billion tax bill.
The company has disputed the claim and its parent company Barrick Gold Corp is in talks with the government.
But other African nations, including Angola and Ethiopia, are still seeking to use tax breaks to entice investment to their nascent mining sectors.
Akufo-Addo said Africa needed mining investment, but companies needed to understand their role in developing economies.
""We want you to stay here for the long-term. Respect the land that provides the riches and be part of the transformation,"" he said. ""It's time to make Africa prosperous and allow her people to attain a dignified standard of living.""
He also called on his fellow African states to establish value-added industries on the back of their mineral wealth. 
Long a major gold producer, Ghana is now seeking to develop its iron ore and bauxite deposits. 
Under a deal approved by Ghanaian lawmakers last year, China's Sinohydro Corp Ltd will provide $2 billion for government road projects in exchange for refined bauxite exports.
The government has created a state-owned company to help establish an integrated aluminum industry. Akufo-Addo said creation of a similar company to promote an iron and steel industry would be considered in the current parliamentary session.
""We cannot, and should not, continue to be merely exporters of raw materials to other countries,"" he said.

“Isbank will become the property of the Treasury with the permission of God,” Erdogan told his ruling AK party’s parliamentary faction in Ankara on Tuesday, calling on the legislature to make “this historic decision.”
The move would be opposed by the main opposition party CHP, which holds about 28 percent of Isbank’s shares, but Erdogan indicated he has the support of his allies in parliament to soon force a vote on the takeover.
The CHP doesn’t get any dividends from Isbank but Erdogan still accuses it of “exploiting” Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey who bequeathed Isbank shares to the party he created in his will. The president contends that what once belonged to the founder of the Turkish state shouldn’t be owned by a political party.
The lender has said in the past that any effort to nationalize it would amount to a financial crime. The CHP has resisted Erdogan’s demands to give up its stake in the lender and its four seats on the board.
The AK party lacks the parliamentary majority needed to unilaterally change the laws on the bank’s ownership but Erdogan suggested its junior partner in the assembly, the nationalist MHP, would support his legislative efforts to enable the Treasury’s takeover.
Isbank shares fell as much as 6 percent on Erdogan’s comments and were trading 1.2 percent lower as of 1 p.m. in Istanbul. The lira also trimmed gains and was trading 0.2 percent higher at 5.2067 per dollar.

In a ruling late on Friday, Judge Jose Linares of U.S. District Court in New Jersey also said that claims against auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH can proceed, rejecting a bid by the German companies to throw out the lawsuits.
There has been growing scrutiny of diesel vehicles in the United States since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software on 580,000 U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit excess emissions.
Steve Berman, one of the lawyers representing Mercedes U.S. diesel owners, said ""like Volkswagen, Mercedes tried to scam consumers by green-washing its line of diesel cars. With the help of some crafty marketing, and Bosch’s defeat device, the duo set out to rake in profits from unknowing purchasers.""
Daimler spokeswoman Andrea Berg said Monday, ""These claims are without merit, and we are pleased that the court recognized the deficiencies in some of plaintiffs’ claims. We intend to continue vigorously defending against the remaining claims.""
Bosch, which makes software for Daimler, VW and other automakers' diesel emissions systems, declined to comment Monday.
The Justice Department, Environmental Protection Agency, California Air Resources Board and German prosecutors in Stuttgart are investigating Daimler for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles.
Daimler has acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In October, Daimler said operating profit would fall by more than 10 percent, blaming ""government proceedings and measures in various regions"" related to diesel emissions issues.
In 2017, Daimler abandoned plans to seek U.S. approval to sell new Mercedes-Benz U.S. light-duty diesel models.
VW pleaded guilty in the emissions scandal and agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV last month agreed to a settlement worth about $800 million to resolve claims from the Justice Department and California that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests, but still faces an ongoing criminal probe.

Last month, Bosch agreed to pay nearly $131 million to settle claims from Fiat Chrysler diesel owners and resolve all investigations by 47 U.S. state attorneys general into its involvement with diesel vehicles, including into the Volkswagen emissions cheating.

IHS Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index for the euro zone rose for the first time in four months in January, with an index reading of 51 that indicates the economy was still in expansion mode at the start of the year.
At 05:00 AM ET (10.00 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.8% at 3,189.35, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.1% and the German Dax 30 up 0.9%
Leading the charge are Italy’s bombed-out banks, which have been under pressure for months as the country slid back into recession, threatening to add to their mountain of bad debts. While there is no clear trigger in today’s news, there has been speculation that the recent collapse of small regional lender Carige could speed up consolidation in the sector.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>","Weak smartphone demand prompts AMS to suspend dividend, avoid mid-term guidance","By Kirsti Knolle
VIENNA (Reuters) - Sensor specialist AMS, which supplies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with components for its face recognition technology, warned that sales in the first quarter could be more than 20 percent lower than last year as it expects smartphone demand to remain weak. 
""Reflecting a more volatile end market and macro-economic environment, AMS has decided to suspend its cash dividend policy for fiscal year 2018 to focus on strengthening its business position in 2019,"" it said on Tuesday.
AMS's already battered shares took another hit, tumbling 15 percent as the Swiss-listed group disappointed investors and analysts with its guidance and fourth-quarter results. 
""We believe the company's outlook in 3D sensing remains weak, as a result revenue trends and margins are likely to remain under pressure,"" Liberum analysts said in a note. 
AMS provides Apple with optical sensors for 3D facial recognition features on its newest iPhones and analysts estimate Apple accounts for around 45 percent of AMS's revenue. 
AMS' statement added to a bleak earnings season for semiconductor companies and further stoked fears of an industry slowdown after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung (KS:005930) and Taiwan Semiconductor last month pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy.
German chipmaker Infineon Technologies on Tuesday revised down its guidance for full-year revenue growth and said it would trim investments due to an ""increasingly difficult business environment"". 
NO MID-TERM GUIDANCE
AMS decided to no longer provide a mid-term guidance figure, blaming volatile markets and uncertain demand trends and industry development.
""Given lack of visibility into 2019, it is not certain whether this is the last of the estimate cuts,"" JP Morgan analysts said. Analysts' estimates for the group have declined significantly in recent months due to Apple's difficulties. 
The group abandoned its 2019 revenue target of more than $2.7 billion in November, but still guided for annual double-digit revenue growth for the coming years. 
It paid a dividend of 0.33 euros per share last year and analysts had expected a higher payout for 2018.
DECLINING PROFIT
AMS expects revenue in the first quarter of 2019 to fall to $350 million-390 million amid continued weak smartphone demand. It generated adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $61.9 million and revenue of $491 million in the three months through December. 
AMS sees the EBIT margin in the current quarter falling to a ""low single digit"" percentage range from 13 percent in the fourth quarter. That would imply an EBIT of $4 to $16 million assuming a 1 to 4 percent margin range,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts calculated. 
Analysts have highlighted increasing competitive pressure, a threat from new technologies, overcapacity issues and a high debt level facing the company. Net debt increased to $1.36 billion as of the end of December from $987.9 million a year earlier. 
AMS said 3D sensor deliveries to two Asian Android smartphone makers agreed last year have started shipping or will start in the first half of 2019. It has finished a solution for sensors capable of scanning surroundings in 3D, so-called world-facing 3D sensors, for a major Android manufacturer and expects shipments to start in the current quarter, it said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.5 percent at its highest since Dec. 3 at 0839 GMT, while euro zone stocks added 0.4 percent and the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 rose 0.8 percent.
BP said its profit doubled to $12.7 billion in 2018, driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following the acquisition of a large portfolio of U.S. shale assets.
Its shares rose 3.4 percent, set for their best day since September 2016, helping the oil index lead sectoral gainers in early trading, up more than 1 percent.
Gains in iron ore prices amid worries about falling output from top producer Vale supported miners, while euro zone banks, which have been under pressure due to concerns over a slowing economy and dovish central bank stances, recovered after six straight session of losses.
Earnings drove the biggest share price moves.
Top faller on the STOXX 600 was AMS, down more than 12 percent after the sensor specialist and Apple supplier skipped its dividend and said first-quarter revenue would fall amid continued weak smartphone demand.
In the same sector Infineon managed to shrug off a disappointing update, suggesting that recent price falls may have priced in the worsening outlook for the sector.
The firm forecast full-year revenue growth to the bottom of its earlier range, as the maker of high-performance power chips blamed increasingly difficult business conditions.

Pandora rallied 12 percent after announcing plans to make cost savings of 1.2 billion crowns as it faces a drop in organic revenue growth of between 3 and 7 percent this year.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 03:15AM ET</span>",French online retail sales could rise again in 2019 despite 'Yellow Vests': Fevad,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - Online retail sales in France could top 100 billion euros ($114 billion) this year despite fears of slower consumer spending due to anti-government ""Yellow Vests"" protests rocking the country, the country's E-Commerce Federation (Fevad) said on Tuesday.
In 2018 alone, the French spent 92.6 billion euros online, a year-on-year rise of 13.4 percent although the ""Yellow Vests"" protests in November and December took their toll, knocking around 600 million euros off revenue.
""In 2018, in a climate not exactly supportive for consumers, the sector proved resilient thanks to its inner momentum. This momentum should allow it to exceed the 100 billion euros mark in 2019 in spite of uncertainties over household consumption,"" Fevad director general Marc Lolivier said by telephone.
""If consumption slows in 2019, it's bound to also impact E-commerce. The people who shop in stores also buy online. When morale is low, people don't feel like spending,"" he added.
The French finance ministry has estimated that the ""Yellow Vests"" protests, named after the high visibility vests French motorists must keep in their cars, knocked 0.1 percentage points off growth in the final three months of 2018.
Household spending -- traditionally the motor of French growth -- slowed to a standstill in the fourth quarter after expanding 0.4 percent in the previous three months, data from the INSEE statistics agency showed last week.
AVERAGE BASKET VALUE DOWN
As in past years, online retail sector growth came as the number of online vendors increased and people turned to the Internet and mobile phones to shop more often, said the Fevad organization.
The average value of the basket of purchased goods declined by 5 euros to 60 euros in 2018, extending a trend started in 2012. This has arisen as shoppers increasingly buy routine goods online and also use popular mobile shopping apps such as 'AliExpress' or 'Wish', that offer cheap items from China.
There was, however, an increase in the frequency of purchases, with a record 1.5 billion online transactions in 2018, marking a 20.7 percent rise from 2017.
Three of the most visited e-commerce websites in France are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), CDiscount — owned by French retailer Casino — and book and CD retail chain Fnac-Darty.
In 2018, E-commerce represented 9.7 percent of overall French retail sales, against 8.7 percent in 2017.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 03:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Britain's financial heartland unbowed as Brexit risks deepen,"By Andrew MacAskill and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services industry has emerged largely unscathed so far from the build-up to Brexit, with about 2,000 roles expected to have moved or been created overseas even as the risk of a disorderly exit grows, a new Reuters survey showed.
Many bankers and politicians predicted Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum would prompt a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London's position in global finance.
But the number of jobs UK-based financial institutions say they actually expect to shift overseas has fallen steeply from the 5,766 predicted to move in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the last survey in September. This new estimate is about a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in the first survey in September 2017.
A no-deal Brexit would mean Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement on trade. Currently, the UK is on track for such a scenario because a deal giving London and Brussels a 21-month transition period to negotiate a trading relationship is at risk of collapse.
Most bankers, however, are confident a compromise will be hammered out. They are waiting to see what will be agreed and what the relationship will be, before making any final decisions about relocations.
The survey results are based on answers from 132 of the biggest or most internationally-focused banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity firms and exchanges to a survey conducted between Jan. 3 and Jan. 28. The jobs are equivalent to 0.5 percent of the 400,000 people who work in financial services in London.
Meanwhile, top investment banks plan to hire far more people in London than anywhere else in Europe, indicating they expect Britain will remain their main regional hub, at least in the short term, a separate Reuters survey showed.
""It will be a slow burn. We won't know what the full impact will look like for at least 10 years,"" said Catherine McGuinness, the de facto political leader of the municipal body that helps to run London's financial district, known as the City.
""But the City is always changing and it will find a way to thrive.""
BREXIT BRINKMANSHIP
Bankers' sanguine outlook comes even as the United Kingdom is on course to leave the EU in 52 days without a divorce deal, a step that could send shockwaves through financial markets.
British lawmakers last week instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal, a move that is fiercely opposed by other members of the bloc, meaning there is likely to be weeks of political brinkmanship.
The survey findings suggest London, which has the largest number of banks and the largest commercial insurance market in the European Union, is likely to remain the region's center of international finance.
The decision to leave the EU has jolted London's finance industry, which has been a critical artery for the flow of money around the world for centuries. 
Banks and insurers in Britain currently enjoy largely unfettered access to customers across the bloc in most financial activities. Elements long taken for granted, such as the right to buy and sell products in a single market, are suddenly in flux.
Under a worst-case no-deal scenario, consultants Oliver Wyman predicted as many as 75,000 jobs could go, while the London Stock Exchange suggested two years ago that figure could be as high as 232,000.
The future of London as Europe's financial center is one of the most important outcomes in the Brexit talks because it is Britain's largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax revenue.
Large investment banks are expected to have moved about 890 jobs, just under half the number expected by end-March, according to interviews with more than two dozen industry sources.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is moving about 200 employees to Paris by the end of February, according to sources. The bank declined to comment.
But many other finance companies are holding off staff moves until the political situation becomes clearer.
HSBC, which has publicly said up to 1,000 jobs could move to Paris, has so far not moved any staff, according to a source at the bank. Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), which said it could move 150 employees to Amsterdam, also has not moved any employees, a source at the bank said.
Under the terms of the current divorce deal, only a basic level of access to the bloc's markets will be maintained after Brexit, but if Britain decides to leave the EU next month without a trade deal this would mean no transition period to lessen the turmoil.
A senior executive at one U.S. investment bank said they would have to potentially double or triple the number of staff moved overseas if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal.
So far, the executive added, the impact of Brexit had been much less than expected and was less of a concern than the slowing economy in China and political upheaval in the United States.
""It's a real pain in the arse, but it's a technical problem, it's solvable,"" the executive said.
Ninety of the companies that responded said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, although only 59 specified numbers. The rest said it would have no impact or they were still deciding what to do or they declined to comment.
For the first time since Reuters started surveying City financiers on their job plans, a handful said there was a possibility Brexit might not happen at all because of the lack of agreement within British politics over how an exit can be engineered.
But the companies said they would not reverse the job moves if Britain were to remain in the EU.

""The issue of political risk has become a really significant issue,"" McGuinness said. ""Even if you turned Brexit back, which I can’t see happening, I think we have damaged our international image and we are going to have to work very hard to regain it.""

246,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 03:05AM ET</span>",Brexit and the City: A barometer for London's financial outlook,"By Simon Jessop and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - A few miles down the River Thames from the British parliament at Westminster, months of political tremors over Brexit have still barely registered on a monitor of London's financial services.
But as policymakers seek ways to ensure the future of the financial services sector for when Britain leaves the European Union, some firms are building up their operations elsewhere in the bloc in anticipation of ""Brexit Day"" on March 29.
Reuters' fourth Brexit tracker of five indicators gauging the City of London's fortunes -- spanning jobs, commercial property prices, bar and restaurant openings and public transport usage -- shows that while some have seen a slight slowdown, others are steady or even buoyant.
The latest survey shows just under 2,000 jobs have been moved or created overseas in preparation for end-March, although this amounts to just over a third of those expected at the time of the last Reuters survey in September.
One area in rude health is City office lettings, data from property agent Savills shows.
""The City is not unique, in the UK ... pretty much every single market that we cover, barring retail, is strong,"" Mat Oakley, head of Savills' UK and European commercial property research team, said.
Oakley said 2018 as a whole was one of the best years for leasing activity in the City since Savills began compiling the data in the early 1990s.
""To put it in numbers, 7.6 million square feet of new leases were signed in the City last year; that's a lot of businesses committing to the future, on the basis that the average length of those leases was probably 10 or more years.""
Jobs leaving London
The number of jobs UK-based financial institutions say they expect to move overseas by March 29, when Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, has fallen by two-thirds from the 5,766 predicted when Reuters' last survey was published in September.
The new estimate of around 2,000 jobs is about a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in the first survey in September 2017.
Hiring numbers
The number of available jobs in London's financial services industry hit a six-year low of 55,033 in 2018, said sector recruitment specialist Morgan McKinley, down a third on the prior year and half that seen in 2015, before the Brexit vote.
Morgan McKinley bases its number on the overall volume of mandates it receives to find jobs and applies a multiplier based on its market share of London's finance industry.
Commercial property
Reuters obtained property data from Savills and Knight Frank, two of the biggest real estate firms in Britain. Savills calculates the value from all-known property deals within the City of London area.
The average price of renting prime real estate in the City of London in the fourth quarter was just under 77 pounds per square foot, unchanged on the prior quarter, Savills said.
The top price paid dipped slightly, though, to 83 pounds from 85.5 pounds, although both measures remain higher than the levels seen in June 2016, when Britain voted for Brexit.
Knight Frank, whose data comes from landlords, developers and agents, said prime headline rent in the City was 70 pounds per square foot, unchanged since the fourth quarter of 2015.
In Canary Wharf, prices have remained unchanged at 42.50 per square foot since the fourth quarter of 2017 - at a 10-year high - although the vacancy rate ticked up to 7.4 percent from 7.1 percent over the course of 2018.
""The financial sector made a comeback in 2018, accounting for 21 percent of office take-up in the City, versus 13 percent in 2017,"" Victoria Shreeves, associate in Central London Research at Knight Frank, said.
""The City has shown resilience despite the political uncertainty and we are expecting to see more rental growth as we move through the year, in particular in submarkets where there is a shortage of supply.""
Going underground
Some 90.6 million journeys were recorded over the course of 2018 at the three main underground stations that serve the City and Canary Wharf.
Reuters filed Freedom of Information Act requests to Transport for London to get the data, which showed that trips at Bank, Monument and Canary Wharf stations fell a combined 9 percent year-on-year in December.
City Airport
Flights in and out of City Airport, a popular gateway for the finance industry, enjoyed a strong end to 2018, up 4.7 percent in the fourth-quarter from the same period a year-earlier, to post the strongest annual growth since 2015.
Bar and restaurant openings
Reuters filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the City of London Corporation to find the number of new premises which have applied for licenses to sell alcohol and license renewals.
The number of venues, such as bars and restaurants, with licenses to sell alcohol in the City of London in 2017 rose 4.7 percent year-on-year in 2018 to at least a 10-year high, data from the municipal local authority shows.

The number of new venues opening and applying for a license in 2018 also hit an at least 10-year high of 70, compared with 65 in the prior year, the data shows.

DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar and the European Union are in the final stages of concluding a comprehensive air transport agreement covering fair competition and transparency, the chief executive of state-owned Qatar Airways said on Tuesday
""We have taken bold steps by agreeing to articles on fair competition, social aspects, business practices, and transparency,"" Akbar al-Baker said at a CAPA summit in Doha
He did not say when the agreement would be signed.
The agreement will see Qatar no longer force European carriers to have a local sales agent in order to operate flights to Doha.
""Qatar has committed to offer a fair and friendly business environment and as a result European airlines will enjoy unrestricted commercial opportunities unlike ever before,"" Baker said.
Qatar Airways, and other Gulf airlines Emirates and Etihad Airways, have in the past faced accusations of being unfairly state-subsidized, giving them an unfair advantage over other carriers. A charge the airlines deny.
Qatar's talks with the EU following an agreement it reached last year with the United States to disclose detailed financial information about Qatar Airways.

That agreement came about after an aggressive lobbying campaign by some of the U.S's biggest airlines urging the U.S. government to challenge the conduct of the major Gulf carriers under ""Open Skies"" agreements.

250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 02:50AM ET</span>",BP Exceeds Expectations as Rising Output Boosts Returns,"(Bloomberg) --  BP  (LON:BP) Plc joined its Big Oil peers by giving investors a positive surprise, exceeding profit estimates and earning better returns than its closest European rival.
New projects delivered an increase in oil and gas output, while the company also worked its existing fields and refineries more efficiently than ever. That helped offset the impact of a slump in crude prices in the fourth quarter.
The better-than-expected earnings should give shareholders some comfort after BP took on more debt to pay for a swathe of U.S. shale assets, its biggest deal in 20 years. The company has shown more “flexibility” than its peers as it seeks to snap up assets and boost production, Colin Smith, an analyst from Panmure Gordon & Co. Plc, said before the earnings.
Six major projects started up in 2018 and oil and gas output rose 2.4 percent to 3.683 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the first of several years of forecast growth.
“We now have a powerful track record of safe and reliable performance, efficient execution and capital discipline. And we’re doing this while growing the business,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our strategy is clearly working.”
Strong Returns
The London-based oil major said adjusted net income was $3.48 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates of $2.64 billion. Profit for the full year was $12.72 billion, as high as when oil was trading close to $100 a barrel.
Upstream facilities, such as oil platforms, ran with record reliability of 96 percent and refining throughput was also the highest ever, the company said. Return on average capital employed was 11.2 percent last year, up from 5.8 percent in 2017. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc’s comparable number was 7.6 percent.
“We see this as a strong set of results,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. “We see the right balance of growth, longevity and defensiveness in the business.”
BP faces a trickier balancing act between output growth with financial discipline than some of its peers. It’s still recovering from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, which killed 11 people and cost it more than $60 billion in penalties and compensation.
Last year, BP purchased $10.5 billion of shale assets from BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) Ltd., paying entirely in cash. It plans to sell as much as $6 billion of older U.S. onshore fields to reduce debt accrued in the purchase. The company exceeded its $3 billion divestment program for 2018.
Gearing, the ratio of net debt to total equity, rose to 30.3 percent last quarter, the highest level in at least a decade. BP has said indebtedness will fall as new projects come online and cash flow rises, although that will now happen more slowly than previously anticipated.
In the previous quarter, the company told investors to expect it to return to the middle of its 20 percent to 30 percent target range by the end of 2019. Today it said that will now happen in 2020.
""We’ll bring the gearing back down,” Dudley said in an interview with Bloomberg television. “I’m not concerned about ticking outside the range a little bit.”

Merkel, on a visit to Japan, said that due to security concerns, it was important to speak to the Chinese government so ""the company doesn't just simply hand the data to the state"".
She told students in a discussion at Keio University that security was important if firms wanted to work in Germany and it must be made clear that the Chinese state cannot access all the data in Chinese products. 
Huawei faces international scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and suspicion that Beijing could use Huawei's technology for spying, which the company denies.

The German government has yet to reach a common stance on whether to follow other countries in excluding Huawei from its market on national security grounds.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks extended gains on Tuesday as overnight strength on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve's cautious turn underpinned appetite for riskier assets, while the dollar held firm on last week's upbeat U.S. data.
European shares were expected to open higher, with financial spread-betters seeing Britain's FTSE, France's CAC, Germany's DAX to tick up between 0.3 and 0.5 percent each.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.5 percent and hovered near its four-month high marked on Friday.
Japan's Nikkei average marked its highest level in seven weeks at one point but finished the day down 0.2 percent. 
Australian shares jumped 2 percent, with long-battered financials surging on short-covering after a special government-appointed inquiry excoriated Australia's financial sector for misconduct but left the structure of the country's powerful banks in place.
Elsewhere in Asia, trade was light, with markets in greater China, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia all closed for the Lunar New Year.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained on Monday, with technology and industrials becoming the biggest winners as investors braced for another big week of fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports. (N)
The Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge,"" dropped to 15.60, its lowest level in four months, on Monday.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe reached a two-month high. It has risen more than 13 percent from its near two-year low in late December, helped by the Fed's change of tack.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled its three-year tightening drive may be coming to an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth concerns and the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The Fed said in a statement that Powell had told President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late on Monday that ""the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information.""
Data announced on Friday showed U.S. job growth surged in January while a key gauge of U.S. manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience after December's shocking fall, allaying fears the U.S. economy might be losing momentum quickly.
Hiroshi Nakamura, senior manager of investment planning at Mitsui Life Insurance, said financial markets' positive reaction to the U.S. data is diminishing with time, but hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal ""will continue to support markets until the two sides come to formal decisions"".
The dollar held on to recent gains against its major peers as investors continued to lap-up Friday's strong payrolls number and a manufacturing survey. 
The dollar's index against six major currencies was little changed at 95.847, having gained 0.27 percent in the previous day. 
The euro was also steady at $1.1431, off three-week high of $1.15405 set on Thursday.
The greenback stood flat at 109.91 yen, having risen to 110.165 overnight, its highest level in five weeks.
The British pound barely moved and was at $1.3040.
On Monday, sterling quickly erased brief gains following a newspaper report that goods shipped to Britain from the European Union could be waved through without checks in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit.
The Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7260, erasing earlier losses, after the Reserve Bank of Australia left policy unchanged at its first meeting this year but sounded less dovish than the markets had wagered on.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Aussie fell as much as 0.5 percent after a slump in retail sales reinforced concerns about slowing growth in Australia.
Traders' focus quickly shifted to U.S. President Donald Trump's delayed State of the Union address, due at 2100 ET Tuesday/0200 GMT Wednesday, as well as U.S. ISM's non-manufacturing figures, also due later in the day.
""If President Trump persists in his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the upcoming address, it would cap the dollar's rally,"" said Kengo Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities.
Trump told a White House event over the weekend that he might declare an emergency because it did not appear Democrats in Congress were moving toward a deal to provide wall money. Such a step likely would prompt a court challenge from Democrats. 
In commodity markets, oil prices inched up, buoyed by expectations of tightening global supply amid U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and production cuts led by OPEC. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $54.82 a barrel, after hitting a 2-1/2-month high of $55.75 in the previous session, while Brent crude futures were last up 0.3 percent at $62.73.
Gold prices held near one-week lows hit in the previous session, pressured by a firmer dollar and as investor appetite for riskier assets picked up.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp shares fell almost 6.5 percent on Tuesday after the electric vehicle (EV) battery maker reported a drop in quarterly earnings and cut its full-year outlook, just as EV partner Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc branched out in battery tech.
The Japanese firm on Monday chopped 9 percent from its operating profit outlook after booking a 19 percent drop in October-December, blaming weak demand for auto components and factory equipment in China, where the economy is slowing.
Both figures were far below analyst estimates.
Later on Monday, EV maker Tesla said it had agreed to buy U.S. energy storage company Maxwell Technologies Inc.
Maxwell sells ultracapacitor cells to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG subsidiary Lamborghini, its website showed. Ultracapacitors store electricity and complement battery cells.
Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, which in turn is Panasonic's biggest EV battery client. The Japanese electronics firm also makes types of ultracapacitors.
Industry analysts in Japan pointed to Panasonic's outlook as the main source of investor concern on Tuesday, saying the Maxwell deal's impact on Panasonic was as yet unclear.
""The latest earnings have revealed how tough the situation is for Panasonic,"" said analyst Masahiko Ishino at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
The Maxwell deal comes as Panasonic is set to lose its exclusivity with Tesla, whose Chief Executive Elon Musk said the U.S. EV maker plans to source battery cells locally for a new car factory in Shanghai, ""most likely from several companies.""

Panasonic has shifted toward products such as automotive batteries and cockpit systems for corporate clients and away from low-margin consumer electronics, but ""it's clear it's suffering in business-to-business areas as well,"" Ishino said.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",Australian bank shares surge as investors cheer 'best possible' inquiry outcome,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian bank shares surged the most in a decade on Tuesday after a long-awaited report on finance-sector misconduct recommended dozens of rule changes but spared the ""Big Four"" lenders any serious threat to their market dominance.
In a report released by the government on Monday, the retired judge who led a public inquiry into financial-sector misconduct last year referred 24 cases to regulators for possible prosecution.
But the inquiry's broader list of 76 recommendations on how to end greed and systemic malpractice stopped short of calling for enforced divestments, cuts to executive pay or tighter lending rules, leaving the banks largely unscathed.
""It is possible that the banks may face criminal proceedings but we do not believe that any of the 76 recommendations by themselves will have a material financial impact,"" UBS analysts said in a research note.
Citi analysts said it was the ""best possible set of recommendations given the circumstances that the sector could have reasonably expected"", while Moody's ratings agency said it was ""unlikely to alter the favorable structure of the banking industry"".
Bank shares soared in morning trade, driving the Australian financials index to its biggest intra-day rise since March 2009.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank Ltd jumped 4 percent, while Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp were up 7 percent by mid-afternoon.
Among the financial planners, which would have to disclose the commissions they receive for selling wealth management products under the report's recommendations, shares of AMP Ltd and rival IOOF Ltd both rose about 11 percent.
Mortgage brokers however were hit hard after the inquiry recommended banks should stop paying them trailing commissions - fees lasting the life of a product which were found to incentivize misspelling. 
Shares of Mortgage Choice Ltd plunged 26 percent and those of Australian Finance Group Ltd fell 29 percent.
POTENTIAL CHARGES
While the inquiry known as a Royal Commission did not name names, its final report said the taking of fees for services not rendered was a potentially criminal breach of financial laws and recommended regulators determine if any charges should be laid.
Based on evidence presented to the inquiry, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and AMP are seen as the most exposed to possible criminal prosecution. All three companies have promised to crack down on such behavior.
AMP Chairman David Murray said the company was ready to assist authorities with any inquiries, adding in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp that AMP was ""under new management"" following the departure of its CEO, chairwoman and several directors during the inquiry.
NAB CEO Andrew Thorburn cut short planned leave after Commissioner Kenneth Hayne's report accused him and NAB Chairman Ken Henry of being unwilling to accept responsibility for the bank's bad behavior.
Thorburn conceded mistakes had been made and said the report's criticism ""does not reflect who I am or how I am leading"". Henry said it was ""not so"" that he had been unwilling to accept criticism.
POLITICAL FALLOUT
The government has said it will ""take action"" on all 76 recommendations but it is unlikely to have time to get anything through parliament ahead an election expected in May.
The center-right Liberal-led government is behind the opposition Labor party in the polls, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been at pains to distance himself from his previous efforts while serving as treasurer to defend the banks and block an inquiry.
""I expressed last year my own regret as treasurer ... at some of the human factors that needed greater consideration in terms of calling the Royal Commission. But let's be frank, I called for the Royal Commission,"" he told reporters.
Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen said Labor was committed to implementing all the commission's recommendations, telling the ABC it was a ""report the government never wanted us to see"".

258,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:33PM ET</span>","J&J, plaintiffs 'close' to deal on Pinnacle hip implant lawsuits: lawyer","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's DePuy Orthopaedics unit is in settlement talks to resolve the bulk of individual lawsuits alleging the company's metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defective and caused severe injuries, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said on Monday.
Texas-based plaintiff lawyer Mark Lanier said lawyers for the consumers had talked to the company in recent days to reach an agreement to resolve the long-running litigation that includes more than 10,000 cases.
""It's still not a done deal, but we're getting close,"" Lanier said, adding that plaintiffs hope to reach a final agreement by the end of the year.
Lanier said it was uncertain at this point how many of the roughly 10,000 Pinnacle lawsuits would be subject to the settlement. He declined further comment.
A spokeswoman for DePuy on Monday declined to comment.
Bloomberg first reported on the settlement talks.
In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations.
Metal-on-metal hip implants have come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) denies those allegations, saying the company acted appropriately and responsibly in the development, testing and marketing of the devices.
Last month, J&J agreed to pay $120 million to resolve deceptive marketing claims by several U.S. states over metal-on-metal hip implants. DePuy said the settlement involved no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies.
J&J to date has faced several federal jury trials over the Pinnacle hip implants. It won the first case in 2014, but lost all subsequent trials, with verdicts ranging from $151 million to $540 million.
J&J has appealed those verdicts.

News of the settlement talks on Monday caused a federal judge overseeing an ongoing Pinnacle trial in Dallas to dismiss the jury in that case. Lanier said that case, involving five Texas plaintiffs, has not been settled yet.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 09:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing aims to speed 737 jet production in early June - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is pushing to speed up assembly of its best-selling 737 jetliner the first week in June, two people familiar with the plan said on Monday, as it tries to keep up with soaring global demand and its European rival.
Boeing aims to reach the new rate of 57 single-aisle jets per month starting on June 3, up from the current rate of 52, said one of the people. 
The goal is contingent on the world's largest planemaker overcoming persistent supplier delays on engines and other issues that have hobbled the 737 factory to varying degrees since last summer, though Boeing says it is making progress. 
The extra five planes a month is key to Boeing's effort to raise profit margins on its top-selling jetliner, which can carry a list price ranging from around $85.8 million to $129.9 million and are the company's largest source of profit. The more planes Boeing makes a month, the less it usually pays suppliers for the parts. 
It may take some time for new jetliners to work their way through final testing and delivery, when an airline hands over the bulk of the money for a plane it ordered. 
Boeing has said it would increase production later this year but has not released specifics. A spokesman declined to provide more details.
European rival Airbus SE is on the brink of producing 60 aircraft per month of its best-selling single-aisle A320-family, a rate roughly comparable to Boeing's given the long European summer holiday.
Last week, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said the company was still battling delays on engines supplied by U.S.-France venture CFM International but had moved some parts of its supply chain to the higher rate.
CFM contributed to a major bottleneck at the Seattle-area 737 factory last year. 
""We're not going to make that full transition to 57 a month until we're very confident that we're ready,"" Muilenburg said last week.
Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, which makes about 70 percent of the 737's structure and was also cited by Boeing as a cause of delays last year, said on Friday it has been conducting practice runs to support the higher rate of 57 planes per month.
Boeing is also working to hit a higher rate of 14 787 Dreamliners per month in the second quarter, the company said on Wednesday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. 

The 787 transition to 14 per month will be completed by the second quarter, Muilenburg said.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc reported sharply higher fourth-quarter spending on video content, employees and facilities, worrying investors who sent the tech company's shares down about 3 percent after hours on Monday. 
Google's parent company beat Wall Street's estimates for revenue and profit, but the bigger-than-expected spending prompted investors to question whether cash funneled into Alphabet's newer businesses will generate the returns that its search engine unit historically has. 
""While the core business is still growing impressively, the significant spending shows growth isn’t quite as capital-light as had been hoped,"" said George Salmon, a stock analyst at financial firm  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
The company reported $31.07 billion in total fourth-quarter costs and expenses, up 26 percent from last year. Capital expenditures rose 64 percent compared to last year, up to $7.08 billion.
Spending was pushed higher by Google boosting staffing on its cloud computing division, promoting its consumer devices and YouTube subscription packages and acquiring office buildings in Silicon Valley and New York City.
Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts that capital expenditures would moderate significantly this year, but the company would continue to invest in long-term bets on artificial intelligence services, consumer hardware and emerging markets. 
REVENUE, PROFIT BEATS 
Alphabet's fourth-quarter revenue rose 22 percent from a year ago to $39.28 billion, compared with Wall Street's average estimate of $38.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. About 83 percent of the revenue came from Google's ad system.
Heavy advertising in the run-up to the holiday shopping season boosted sales. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts the number of people shopping on Google.com each day during the holidays doubled over last year. 
Profit for the quarter was $8.95 billion, or $12.77 per share, compared with a $3 billion loss a year ago. That beat analysts' average estimates of $7.69 billion, or $10.87 per share. 
Partly because of the higher spending, Alphabet's operating margin was 21 percent, down from 24 percent in the year-ago period.
""For a growth company, investment should be applauded,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. ""But a lot of the additional expenditure is going into cloud where it is unclear whether there will ever be a return on that investment."" Google remains behind rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the cloud, said Cordwell. 
The company has authorized a plan to buy back an additional $12.5 billion worth of its shares, Porat said.
NO NEWS ON WAYMO
Google's mostly free search, video and productivity tools are used by billions of people across the world, despite a backlash in some countries over how the company uses and protects customer information. 
Investors concerned that Alphabet's future growth, especially in emerging markets, will not match its previous rates, are looking to the company's other businesses to provide new streams of revenue. But Alphabet gave away little new information on its other ventures on Monday.
It gave no indication when its self-driving car company Waymo will generate noticeable revenue. In October, Alphabet said Waymo had begun revenue-generating rides within a small section of Arizona but did not break out the company's financials.

Pichai said Google's cloud computing unit last year doubled the number of deals it struck worth more than $1 million. The cloud unit's G Suite productivity product now has 5 million customers, he said, up from 4 million in last year's first quarter.

In a letter to the FCC, T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere asked the government to move forward ""expeditiously"" in reviewing the merger of the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers, and attempted to allay fears the deal would mean higher prices.
""While we are combining our networks over the next three years, T-Mobile today is submitting to the commission a commitment that I stand behind -- a commitment that New T-Mobile will make available the same or better rate plans for our services as those offered today by T-Mobile or Sprint,"" Legere wrote in the letter. 
Consumer advocates have said that since Sprint and T-Mobile have a big market share in prepaid plans favored by the poorest wireless customers, they were likely to be disproportionately hurt by the planned deal.
The pledge comes a week before two committees in the House of Representatives -- Energy and Commerce and Judiciary -- hold a joint hearing to discuss the transaction. The hearing is set for Feb. 13, and both Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify.
In a separate government filing, T-Mobile noted that while it would attempt to fend off price increases it may have to adjust rates to pass through costs like taxes or third-party fees that ""are not within the control of New T-Mobile.""
The companies have also pledged to build customer care centers that will create up to 5,600 jobs and have said that they expected the merger to create more than 12,000 jobs to serve small towns and rural communities.

The proposed merger has won approval from a national security panel headed by the Treasury Department. It is undergoing an antitrust review by the Justice Department and the FCC must decide that the transaction is in the public interest.

Meng, the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, is the central figure in a high-stakes dispute between the United States and China. Canada arrested Meng in December at the request of the United States and last month she was charged with wire fraud that violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.
""The political overlay of this case is remarkable,"" Richard Peck, lead counsel for Meng, told the Toronto newspaper in a telephone interview.
""That's probably the one thing that sets it apart from any other extradition case I've ever seen. It's got this cloud of politicization hanging over it,"" Peck added.
The office of Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti said it could not speculate on Meng's possible defences.
""We are committed to a fair process unfolding before the courts and the steps undertaken by the Department of Justice Canada on this case have followed due process, in accordance with the Extradition Act, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and our Treaty with the United States,"" a spokeswoman for Canada's Department of Justice said in an e-mailed statement.
Peck's office did not respond to a request for comment. A Huawei spokesman declined comment.
In December, U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Reuters interview he would intervene in the Justice Department's case against Meng if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
Canada fired John McCallum, its ambassador to China, in January after he said Meng could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States.
""He [Mr McCallum] mentions some of the potential defenses - and certainly, I think any person that knows this area would see the potential for those defenses arising,"" Peck told the Globe and Mail.

Meng's lawyers are also planning to challenge whether her alleged conduct would be deemed criminal under Canadian law, the Globe and Mail said.

271,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>","Alphabet Earnings Handily Beat Estimates, but Stock Stumbles","Investing.com - Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines Monday, but operating income growth was a concern and shares sold off after hours.
Alphabet shares lost 2.5% postmarket.
The company reported earnings earnings per share of $12.77 on revenue of $39.28 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $10.88 on revenue of $38.91 billion. That compared to EPS of $9.70 on revenue of $32.32 billion in the same period a year earlier. Revenue was up 20.5%.
But income from operations for the quarter rose just 7% to $8.203 billion from $7.664 billion a year ago. Analysts were looking for around $8.6 billion, according to Seeking Alpha.
Traffic acquisition costs rose to $7.44 billion, up 13% but right around what the market was expecting.
Partly because of the higher spending, Alphabet reported an operating margin of 21% in the fourth quarter, down from 24% a year ago.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's better-then-expected fourth-quarter results last week had lifted expectations for Alphabet as they suggested that concerns about a global economic slowdown may be overblown.
Alphabet had $31.07 billion in total fourth-quarter costs and expenses, up 26% from last year. Capital expenditures rose 64% compared to last year, up to $7.08 billion.
A run-up in spending has reflected Google's efforts to boost staffing on its cloud computing division, promote its consumer devices and YouTube subscription packages and acquire office buildings in Silicon Valley and New York.
Fourth-quarter earnings also benefited from a $1.3 billion unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt, Alphabet said.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>",Sears makes case to judge for rescue deal with chairman Lampert,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Tom Hals
(Reuters) - The once-mighty Sears department store chain took its fight for survival to a bankruptcy judge on Monday, arguing the proposed $5.2 billion sale to its chairman, Eddie Lampert, would help save 45,000 jobs and keep 425 stores open. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said on Monday he would rule on the sale to Lampert's ESL Investments Inc later this week after hearings that were likely to run into Thursday. 
A lawyer for Sears Holdings Corp told the court he was hoping the deal would close on Friday, clearing the way for Sears to end its four-month stint in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and begin its new life as a private company controlled by Lampert.
But first the company has to overcome objections by hundreds of creditors and the official committee that represents them.
Monday's hearing in White Plains, New York, kicked off with Sears' investment banker, Brandon Aebersold of Lazard, and Sears director Bill Transier testifying about sale negotiations and Lampert's plans. 
Transier acknowledged that Lampert's plan included possibly three store closings a month this year, the sale of $600 million of real estate over the next three years and unspecified cuts to staff.
""Their ability to run their business properly should be their responsibility,"" he said. 
Creditors have argued the company's future success is premised on what they say is an unlikely turnaround led by Lampert, who creditors have accused of stripping the company of value during its years-long decline.
Creditors also have argued the sale process was flawed and that it undervalued Sears by as much as $1.3 billion. 
Creditors want to pursue ESL and Lampert, Sears' largest shareholder and creditor when it filed for bankruptcy, for what they allege are years of fraudulent deals, such as the spin-off of the Lands End brand. 
Lampert has defended the deals as a sign of his commitment to finance Sears despite its struggles, and he has noted the transactions were approved by independent directors.
In 2005, Lampert merged the department store with discount chain Kmart in an $11 billion deal.

Sears, once known for its mail-order catalogs, dates back to 1893. Merchandise from toys, medicine, gramophones, automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) of its time.

278,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 04:03PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Closes Higher as Tech Stocks Reign Supreme,"Investing.com – The Dow rose on Monday as surging tech stocks offset declining healthcare stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.70%, the S&P 500 added 0.68%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.15%.
Tech stocks reigned supreme, pushing the broader market higher, as FAANG stocks found favor, led by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Netflix rose 3% on a JPMorgan report that suggested the streaming giant could be a potential acquisition target for Apple.
“We think Netflix is best strategic fit on a leading position in engagement level as well as original content, differentiating itself from pure aggregators of content,” JPMorgan said. But Netflix would probably command a significant premium of as much as $189 billion, the bank speculated. Netflix has a current market value of $148.4 billion plus $7 billion in net debt.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day higher.
Alphabet fell in after-market trading as the tech giant reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped expectations.
The gains in tech stocks offset weakness in healthcare following a slump in Allergan.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) slumped 4% after the Federal Drug Administration approved Evolus' cheaper version of the company’s wrinkle-treatment Botox.
Evolus (NASDAQ:EOLS) said its low-cost wrinkle-treatment, Jeuveau, is expected to be available throughout the US starting in spring 2019. Its shares surged nearly 12%.
Consumer staples also kept the broader market afloat, thanks to strong quarterly results from Clorox and Sysco.
Clorox (NYSE:CLX), maker of popular household cleaning products, rose 6%, and food distributor company Sysco (NYSE:SYY), rose 5% as both delivered an earnings beat on the bottom line.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, clawed back some losses to end the day roughly flat even as U.S. oil prices ended the day 1.3% lower.
The bright start to the week for stocks comes as investors sense the U.S.-China trade dispute is unlikely to turn sour, when the trade truce expires on the March 1, following recent progress on talks between the two nations.
""While we don’t yet have a comprehensive deal, recent reported progress in trade talks and the potential for another meeting between the US and Chinese presidents in the coming weeks are encouraging, and we believe that the chances of escalation beyond March 1 have reduced,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.
In an interview with CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, President Donald Trump said talks with Beijing are ""doing very well"" and there is a ""good chance"" of a deal over tariffs.
In corporate news, Pizza delivery company Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) surged about 9% after it received a $200 million investment, with an option for an additional $50 million by March 29, from Starboard Value through a new securities purchase agreement.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) very briefly retook its title as the most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Monday, beating out Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was close behind the trio as it prepared to report its quarterly results.
With Microsoft and Apple rallying almost 3 percent, Apple's market capitalization for a few seconds was $806.6 billion, exceeding Microsoft's by $200 million and Amazon's by about $1.2 billion. 
Microsoft quickly returned to its spot as the most valuable company, but Apple was on track to end the session above Amazon, up 0.4 percent, taking the No 2 spot.
Average analyst price targets imply Amazon would become by far the most valuable U.S. publicly-listed company at $1.03 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $967 billion, Alphabet at $927 billion and Apple at just $835 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Tech heavyweights' market cap - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HTwYRR
Apple's stock has risen 11 percent since its quarterly report last Tuesday, with investors betting it was oversold following months of concern about a slowdown in iPhone demand, and the company's rare revenue warning on Jan. 2 related to soft demand in China.
After touching a record $1.1 trillion last October, Apple's market capitalization fell gradually, and it was overtaken in December by Amazon and Microsoft. 
Apple's stock market value hit a low of $675 billion on Jan. 3 after its revenue warning, but then steadily recovered, helped in part by a quarterly report that was better than feared by investors.
While Apple has gained in recent sessions, Microsoft and Amazon's stocks have fallen after their quarterly reports. Amazon has declined about 4 percent since Thursday, when it forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates and warned over new regulations in India.
Since Wednesday, when Microsoft met targets for its quarterly results and forecast, its stock has slipped nearly 1 percent.

Google-parent Alphabet was up 2.6 percent, putting its stock market value at $788 billion. After the bell, the company is expected to post quarterly revenue of $38.9 billion, up 20 percent, and a 12 percent increase in non-GAAP net income to $7.7 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bill Gross, once the bond market's most influential investor, will retire from Janus Henderson Group Plc in coming weeks, ending attempts to reclaim the stature he enjoyed leading the world's largest fixed-income investing firm.
Gross, who turned to investing after serving as U.S. naval officer, co-founded Pacific Investment Management Co in 1971, attaining rock-star status in investing circles as he attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in assets. Under his watch, Pimco blossomed into a $2 trillion asset-management powerhouse, one so influential that the U.S. Federal Reserve tapped it to help implement its program of emergency bond purchases in the financial crisis in 2008.
At Janus, however, Gross was unable to repeat his earlier success, with the performance of the fund he managed ranking near the bottom. Gross told Reuters on Friday that low rates are distorting returns.
His tenure at Pimco ended abruptly and acrimoniously in September 2014, when he was ousted. His flagship Total Return Fund - which hit a peak of $292.9 billion in assets in April 2013 - was hemorrhaging assets. At the end of April 2015, the Pimco Total Return Fund had lost its title as the world's biggest bond mutual fund to the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, which had $117.3 billion of assets.
""You have to give Bill a lot of credit because he was the prime mover, popularizing active management,"" Dan Fuss, vice chairman at Loomis, Sayles & Co LP, and one of Gross' biggest competitors, said in a telephone interview. ""I had hoped he'd be out and about and stay in the business because I know he would have wound up doing a good job."" 
Gross, 74, will leave Janus on March 1 and will manage his personal assets and charitable foundation with two of his three children, the company said in a statement on Monday.
""I've had a wonderful ride for over 40 years in my career - trying at all times to put client interests first while inventing and reinventing active bond management along the way,"" Gross said in the news release.
Gross, whose net worth Forbes magazine said on Monday has declined to $1.5 billion from $2.5 billion as recently as June 2018, endured a rocky four years of performance at Janus. 
Shares of the $950 million Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, managed by Gross, gained just 0.3 percent per year since the fund was launched, according to Lipper. Over three years, it ranks behind more than 90 percent of its peers, Lipper said. 
Gross' barely positive performance in the years since he struck out on his own underscore how much more competitive the markets have become and the difficulty of navigating in the years since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.
GRAPHIC-Bill Gross's bond performance - https://tmsnrt.rs/2t8RUdf
FALLING RATES, FEWER PENSIONS
Three decades of falling U.S. interest rates and moderating inflation starting in the early 1980s boosted returns on bond funds managed by Gross and his rivals.
Over the same period, corporations offered fewer pensions and U.S. investors, increasingly responsible for their own savings, turned to mutual funds for professional asset management. Each factor helped create significant demand for services Pimco offered as a bond specialist.
The market environment changed abruptly when the Federal Reserve and other central banks globally responded to the financial crisis by buying government bonds and other assets to stimulate the economy. The Fed still has nearly $4 trillion in such assets.
Gross said in April 2013 that the Fed's aggressive monetary policies may have changed the landscape so greatly that investors like him faced new challenges in trying to maintain their track records.
Since the early 1970s when bonds began their ""incredible, liquefying, total return journey to the present day, an investor that took marginal risk, levered it wisely and was conveniently sheltered from periodic bouts of deleveraging or asset withdrawals could, and in some cases, was rewarded with the crown of 'greatness.'""
Gross conceded to at least one ""bad trade"" during his tenure at Janus, betting that German and U.S. government bond yields would move closer together. And his assertions that bonds were now in a bear market ran against continued demand for safe assets and easy monetary policy that kept rates low.
""Interest rates in much of the developed world are distorting and limiting future returns below historical expectations,"" Gross said in an email to Reuters on Friday. Going forward, he said, policymakers could be gradual in their efforts to maintain growth and stabilize inflation or there could be a ""populist momentum that seeks to redistribute existing wealth and future incomes.""
Jeffrey Gundlach, anointed as Wall Street's new ""Bond King"" in recent years, told Reuters in 2014 that when discussing their potential legacies, Gross spun an analogy to National Basketball Association star players Kobe Bryant and the younger LeBron James. 

""I am Kobe. You are LeBron James,"" Gross told Gundlach. ""I have five rings, you have two rings - probably going to five,"" a reference to the number of NBA championships the two players had each won. Bryant retired from the NBA in 2016 after winning five championships; James had won three as of 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Monday said it was starting to hand pink slips to about 4,000 salaried workers in the latest round of a restructuring announced in late November that will ultimately shrink its white-collar workforce in North America by 15 percent out of 54,000.
Two people briefed on the cuts said GM is cutting hundreds of jobs at its information technology centers in Texas, Georgia, Arizona and Michigan and more than 1,000 jobs at its Warren, Michigan Tech Center. GM is filing new required mass layoff notices with state agencies and disclosed the cuts to lawmakers.
The largest U.S. automaker announced in November it would cut a total of about 15,000 jobs and end production at five North American plants. The cuts include eliminating about 8,000 salaried workers, or about 15 percent.
GM cut about 1,500 contract workers in December and said 2,300 salaried workers accepted buyouts, officials said.
""These actions are necessary to secure the future of the company, including preserving thousands of jobs in the U.S. and globally. We are taking action now while the overall economy and job market are strong, increasing the ability of impacted employees to continue to advance in their careers, should they choose to do so,"" GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said, adding the bulk of the cuts should be completed in the next two weeks.
Morrissey said GM would provide salaried workers with severance packages and job placement services.
GM is also cutting its executive ranks by 25 percent and last week laid off three senior people in its Washington office and some other small salaried layoffs previously took place.
President Donald Trump and U.S. and Canadian lawmakers have blasted GM's plans to end production at plants in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio and Maryland. GM said in November it would end U.S. and Canadian production of the Chevrolet Cruze, Volt, Impala, the Buick LaCrosse and the Cadillac XTS and CT6 sedans.
Trump, who made a 2017 speech near GM's Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio, said in November the company had ""better"" find a new product for that plant.
But GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra wrote last week: ""We are more convinced than ever that our strategy is sound and in the long term.""

Last month, Comprehensive Logistics said it would cease operations at its facility in Lordstown that provides logistics and warehousing, impacting about 180 jobs. Magna International Inc is also laying off about 120 people at its Lordstown Seating Systems plant that makes seats for GM vehicles.

Bondholders at nine investment firms and hedge funds from New York, Miami, London and Berlin said they had stopped trading sovereign notes and debt from the state oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela after the U.S. Treasury Department issued instructions they interpreted as forbidding most transactions.
Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that are U.S. persons “may not buy, sell, or otherwise engage in transactions related to debt, equity or other holdings in blocked persons and must block such holdings, unless authorized by OFAC,” the Treasury Department said on its website. Officials declined to elaborate on the rule and its precise implications for traders.
While European and Asian funds aren’t subject to the same restrictions, the concentration of debt trading within the U.S. financial system makes it challenging for those firms to buy and sell as well. Many financial institutions, for example, adhere worldwide to U.S. sanctions. Trace, FINRA’s bond price reporting system, showed zero trades on PDVSA’s debt since last Wednesday.
“Legally and theoretically I should be able to trade these bonds, but practically I am not able to do it anymore,” said Lutz Roehmeyer, a Berlin-based money manager at Capitulum Asset Management, which holds PDVSA bonds.
The Treasury Department has said the restrictions are intended to financially cripple the Maduro government and spur regime change. It said relief will come from transferring control of state-run companies like PDVSA to National Assembly President Juan Guaido or “a subsequent, democratically-elected government that is committed to taking concrete and meaningful actions to combat corruption, restore democracy, and respect human rights.”
Treasury’s initial guidance Friday prohibited U.S. investors from purchasing PDVSA bonds and then an amendment later that day put effectively the same restrictions on the nation’s sovereign notes, according to a report by F. Amanda DeBusk, chair of Dechert’s international trade practice in Washington.
Limits on secondary debt trading may be an effort to ""cut off oxygen"" to the Maduro government on suspicion that Caracas is stockpiling bonds in local financial institutions which it could sell when it’s desperate for cash, as it is now, Mark Weidemaier, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law in Chapel Hill, wrote on the academic blog Credit Slips.
""Perhaps the U.S. government is hoping for regime change in the near future,"" he said. ""If so, the pain bondholders feel will be temporary and offset by gains once a reasonable government is in place. But if Maduro retains power, then the pain for U.S. holders of these instruments will be significant.""
The complicated and lengthy instructions from Treasury have forced investors to seek legal assistance parsing the text word-for-word.
“If the Venezuela sanctions aren’t clarified, trading of the debt will be similar to what we had with Cuban debt,” said Jean-Dominique Butikofer, the Atlanta-based head of emerging-market fixed income at Voya Investment Management, which holds Venezuelan bonds. “Everyone will trade with a legal tweezers.”

306,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 02:04PM ET</span>",Tesla to buy battery tech maker Maxwell Technologies for $218 million,"By Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has agreed to buy energy storage company Maxwell Technologies Inc for $218 million in an all-stock deal that could help the electric car maker produce batteries that hold more energy and last longer at a time when it needs to cut costs and faces growing competition.
Tesla is rapidly increasing production of its Model 3 sedan and needs to lower the price to reach a broader customer base than its pure luxury vehicles.
Maxwell executives told investors in January that it had developed and patented a ""dry electrode"" technology that could significantly increase the driving range and reduce the cost of electric vehicle batteries. In a presentation, Maxwell said it expected strategic alliances ""within six months"" centered around this technology.
The company also makes ultracapacitors, which discharge energy faster than batteries and are seen as complementing battery technology.
Ultracapacitors, combined with the energy of batteries, can enable rapid response times, function across a broader temperature range and lengthen battery life by up to two times, according to a blog post on Maxwell's website.
Volvo-owner Geely Holding Group last May announced a deal with Maxwell and described the company's ultracapacitor technology as helping to deliver ""peak power"" for hybrid cars.
""Tesla needs Maxwell's solvent-free battery electrode manufacturing for a viable path to lower battery costs,"" said Craig Irwin of Roth Capital Partners. ""Real competitors are coming now, so Tesla needs to move fast.""
Maxwell's customers also include General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Lamborghini.
The offer values each Maxwell share at $4.75, representing a 55 percent premium to the stock's closing price on Friday, the companies said. Maxwell shares rose to trade at $4.58. 
Currently, Japan's Panasonic Corp is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla cars.
Tesla chief Elon Musk had highlighted the importance of ultracapacitors back in 2013.
""I'm a big fan of ultracapacitors. Was going to do my PhD at Stanford on them. But we need a breakthrough in energy density...,"" Musk had tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/336598500156518400?lang=en.
Tesla also sells power storage, often in conjunction with its solar power business, and ultracapacitors could be used in backup systems for homes and for utility power grids.
Maxwell expects the deal, which has already been approved by its board, to close in the second quarter of 2019, or shortly thereafter.

DLA Piper was Maxwell's outside legal counsel, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital was the independent adviser. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati represented Tesla as outside legal counsel.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 01:57PM ET</span>",Some U.S. funds waiting for earnings to buy shares of surging Chipotle,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) have surged over 70 percent over the last 12 months, but some U.S. fund managers are waiting for Feb. 6 earnings results to confirm that the burrito-chain is truly back from its 2015 food safety crisis. 
The company's shares lost nearly 70 percent of their value between October 2015 and February 2018 as it struggled to win back customers after a multi-state E. coli outbreak that was linked to Chipotle in late 2015 and early 2016. Shares have rebounded since their 2018 lows thanks in part to the moves of its new Chief Executive Brian Niccol, the former head of rival Yum Brand Inc's Taco Bell, to invest heavily in digital ordering and delivery. 
Shares of the company are up more than 23 percent since the start of January alone, yet remain well below their record highs of 2015. 
""The company is transitioning and is now back on offense versus defense,"" said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG. 
An increased share buyback and a series of positive earnings surprises helped convince 35 actively-managed U.S. equity funds to add a position in the company in 2018, pushing its total fund ownership up by nearly 36 percent, according to data from Lipper. 
Yet for the company to win more converts, it must now show that it can not only expand on its digital offerings but can maintain its profitability despite rising minimum wages that have largely soured U.S. fund managers on restaurants overall, fund managers say. The average actively-managed U.S. equity fund has slightly less than 1 percent of its portfolio in restaurant stocks, or about 16 percent less than the weighting in the benchmark S&P 500, according to Lipper data. 
""I like to buy stocks at new highs only because management is proving the fact that they can deliver. We are right at that inflection point where an earnings miss is going to lead to a significant correction and a beat is going to send it much higher,"" said Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta Fund. 
Bacarella, who does not currently own Chipotle but has in the past, said that he would likely add the company to his portfolio should it continue to beat estimates, despite its high valuation. Chipotle is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 78.2, nearly double its 52-week low of 40.8. 
The company is expected to report earnings per share of $1.37 on revenue of $1.1 billion in its most recent quarter, according to Refinitiv data. 
Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager of the $5.9 billion Federated Kaufmann fund, who does not currently have a position in the company but owns shares of Wingstop Inc, said investors will be watching whether Chipotle can maintain its margins despite a tight labor market and rising minimum wages in states including California, Florida, and New York. 
""There's no question that labor costs will continue to rise and keeping people in what tend to be high-turnover jobs is more of a challenge,"" she said. 
Chipotle's move into online ordering and delivery could help it balance out rising labor costs because digital orders tend to have higher tickets, she said. But it will need another year without any food safety scares to win back all of its former customers, she said. 

""It's usually at least a couple of years for a company to restore its reputation but now it could be longer,"" she said. ""If something goes viral these days it can be hard to live down.""

The 74-year-old fund manager increased his position in a single Mexican bond, the inflation-linked 2025 Udibono, to 10 percent of the $950 million Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond fund, in the fourth quarter, according to the latest filing data. Strategists say there’s a risk his replacement, Nick Maroutsos, could unwind the position when he takes over later this month, although it’s likely that Mexican insurance funds would be buyers.
""I wouldn’t be surprised if Janus dumps some of their Udibonds, but locals will soak that up,"" said Kathryn Rooney Vera, the head of research at Bulltick in Miami, who sees more value in other local debt and bonds from state oil giant Pemex. Still, ""the market is so one-sided on Mexico that I wouldn’t call for dramatic upside in the near term.""
Erin Passan, a spokeswoman for Janus, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Its fund will be renamed the Absolute Return Income Opportunities on Feb. 15, the firm said in a statement.
Trading on Mexican Udibonos has been choppy in recent years, although they outperformed similar-dated local notes in 2018. The debt maturing in 2025 returned 4.7 percent in dollar terms last year versus 1.9 percent for the 2027 Mbonos. That doesn’t account for the fact that the Udibonos’ return is already in real terms, as it’s inflation-protected. This year, however, they’ve underperformed once again amid expectations that inflation will slow.
Gross started talking up Mexican bonds in June 2012, citing attractive valuations compared with their German counterparts. Three years later, he said the country offered the ""most attractive yields in the world."" Since then, he’s piled in and out of Mexican assets, recommending investors buy the dip in the inflation-linked notes in the days after Donald Trump’s election in November 2016 and trimming his exposure before last year’s selloff in risk assets."

Deutsche Bank's global correspondent banking portfolio is now around 40 percent smaller than it was in 2016, Stephan Wilken, its head of anti-financial crime and anti-money laundering said.
Wilken told a committee of the European Parliament that Deutsche Bank's portfolio of correspondent banking customers it deems as high risk is around 60 percent smaller than it was in 2016.
Danske Bank is under investigation over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) from 2007 until 2015 from its Estonia branch. 
Deutsche Bank has said it acted as a correspondent bank for Danske Bank in Estonia, meaning it helped transfer funds on behalf of the Danish lender from Estonia to places like New York.
Deutsche Bank has said it had no indication of misconduct in the case, but is cooperating with authorities.

Wilken also said that in Russia, Deutsche Bank had reduced active correspondent banking relationships by around 75 percent since 2016, while it has exited such business in Moldova, Estonia and Latvia.

Clorox (NYSE:CLX), maker of popular household cleaning products, reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $1.40 a share, topping consensus of $1.30. Revenue was in line at $1.47 billion. Its share rose 7%.
Cost-savings plans and ""sound execution on pricing"" were identified as key drivers of performance, helping the company address near-term headwinds and remain on track to meet full-year sales and earnings expectations.
The company guided 2019 earnings in a range of $6.20 to $6.40, in line with Street estimates of $6.32. Full-year revenue expectations of between $6.24 billion and $6.36 billion were also in line with estimates of $6.33 billion.
Food delivery company Sysco (NYSE:SYY) topped expectations the bottom line, sending its shares 4.5% higher.
The food delivery company reported earnings of $0.75, above consensus for earnings of $0.73 a share. Revenue of $14.8 billion was about in line with forecasts.
The company's upbeat results arrived as it ramped up efforts to cut costs, including laying off workers in December last year to stave off the impact from rising transportation and food costs.

313,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",The Dumb Money Is Finally Starting to Smarten Up,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Shoppers heading to their local mall to buy socks would generally buy fewer of them if they found that prices had, say, doubled. Investors are the opposite of shoppers. They tend to get excited by higher prices for financial assets. If prices of stocks double, it is likely that investors will want them more. And the more they go up, the more investors tend to want them in a phenomenon known as “fear or missing out,” or “FOMO” for short.
That’s why measuring investor sentiment is so crucial. Analysts have built sentiment indicators for a wide range of financial assets, not just for stocks. Lots of Wall Street types don’t like them because they’re not an exact science, but it has always been my belief that sentiment analysis works better at predicting future market moves than either technical analysis or fundamental analysis. Probably the best-known is the survey conducted by the American Association of Individual Investors. And although it is flawed, it still works at the extremes.
There are many ways to track sentiment. It can be measured over the short, medium or long term, or by investor class. What’s interesting is that when the stock market was collapsing in December, measures of sentiment among “fast money” folks like hedge funds and active traders fell to apocalyptic levels. Retail investors, though, seemed unfazed, as a net $22 billion flowed into passive index funds during the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This is strange! Retail investors have a reputation for always being wrong, buying high and selling low. That’s why they are called the “dumb money.” This time around, the large parts of the stock market goes into what is considered to be the technical definition of a bear market, which is a decline of 20 percent, and retail investors are steadfastly bullish.
Today’s retail investor looks different from the 2001 retail investor that got killed when the dot-com bubble burst. Instead of day trading stocks in a discount brokerage account, they have morphed into long-term index fund investors. All the behavioral coaching by index promoters over the last 10 years, urging retail investors to invest passively with an eye on the long run while minimizing costs, seems to have worked — but at what cost?
Ordinary, fallible, all-too-human investors without a lot of financial knowledge or historical perspective are being conditioned to keep investing through major declines in stock prices. Historically, there was a penalty imposed (in terms of returns) on the unsophisticated and the uninformed. Today, the unsophisticated and uninformed are outperforming the professionals. These days, it’s retail investors who are tough, and institutional investors who cut and run at the first sign of trouble.
This is all a bit upside-down. Are retail investors getting smarter? Are sophisticated investors getting dumber? The answer to both questions might be yes, but both are cartoonish extremes of the same issue. Institutional investors — particularly hedge funds — could benefit from a longer-term outlook, which they might be able to achieve if they were able to obtain five- to 10-year lockups from their investors. Having to provide monthly or quarterly liquidity forces many hedge funds to stick to index-hugging investments that can be easily sold in the event of redemptions.
Meanwhile, retail investors could benefit from some framework of risk management, even simple stop losses, instead of having a childlike view that stocks will go up forever, monotonically. The hardiness of index fund investors might seem like an asset during a 20 percent decline, but a liability during a 60 percent decline or any bear market from which the market might not fully recover. Retail investors are taught by every guru, every website, every book and every Twitter personality that the stock market “always comes back.” But what if, one day, it doesn’t?
Yes, recent history has shown that professional investors have had great difficulty outperforming passive indexes. Retail investors beating up on the hapless hedge fund industry makes for good tweets, but we should all ask whether it is sustainable. Some 25 years ago, the top hedge funds were making triple-digit returns and retail investors weren’t making much at all. Fast forward to today, where it has been a real disadvantage to be smart. It’s not a disadvantage to be smart in too many other industries, so forgive me for believing that the current state of affairs might be transitory."

320,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Food retailer Smart & Final explores sale - sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Smart & Final Stores Inc (N:SFS), a U.S. food retailer controlled by private equity firm Ares Management Corp (N:ARES), is exploring options that include a sale of the company, according to people familiar with the matter.
An outright sale would allow Ares to cash out on its majority stake in Smart & Final. It acquired the company in 2012 from fellow buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) for $975 million, including debt. 
Ares took Smart & Final public in 2014 at a price of $12 per share. The shares have lost close to half their value since then, as the company has struggled in a tough environment for brick-and-mortar retailers.
Smart & Final, based in Commerce, California, is working with investment banks on a sale process, and has reached out to private equity firms that could be potential acquirers, the sources said on Monday.
There is no certainty Smart & Final will ultimately agree on a sale, the sources cautioned, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. 
Ares declined to comment. A representative for Smart & Final said the company is focused on executing its strategic plan and that its longstanding policy is not to comment on market rumors or speculation. 
Smart & Final shares rose 5.3 percent at $6.30, giving the company a market capitalization of about $500 million. Smart & Final had long-term debt of $619 million as of Oct. 7.
Smart & Final operated 324 grocery and foodservice stores in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana and Utah as of Oct. 7, with an additional 15 stores in Northwestern Mexico operated through a joint venture.
The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $62.3 million for the three months ended Oct. 7, down 1 percent over the same period in 2017.
Smart & Final has been facing increasing competition both from direct rivals and e-commerce firms. Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) acquired Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion in 2017.

Deep-pocketed international entrants to the U.S. market such as Lidl and Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) as well as discount retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG), have also been squeezing Smart & Final's profitability.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Monday boosted by technology shares ahead of Alphabet's results after the bell, but declines in healthcare and energy stocks kept gains in check.
A more than 2 percent rise from marquee companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) boosted the Nasdaq. The technology sector rose 1.13 percent.
Google-parent's quarterly report will round up a mixed bag of results from other FAANG stocks. Apple and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) posted better-than-expected quarterly results last week, while Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave downbeat current-quarter forecasts.
The energy sector fell 0.88 percent, the most among the seven major S&P sectors trading in the red, as oil prices fell more than 1 percent. 
At current levels, the S&P 500 was about 8 percent away from its Sept. 20 record close and was helped recently by signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and as the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes.
A stronger-than-expected jobs report on Friday underscored the strength in the domestic economy though concerns remained that a slowdown in the rest of the world could hurt U.S. earnings, with warnings from bellwethers including  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT).
""We got through last week with the employment report and the Fed. I think the focus is more firmly on earnings this week,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
""As the fourth quarter numbers are coming in, I think there is a concern around slowdown in the first quarter. Certainly the comparisons are going to be a lot tougher."" 
Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter earnings so far, 71.4 percent beat analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Since the earnings season kicked off three weeks ago, analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit growth have risen to 15.4 percent from 14.3 percent, but expectations for the first quarter of 2019 have dropped to 0.5 percent from 3.4 percent.
At 11:10 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.11 points, or 0.16 percent, at 25,023.78, the S&P 500 was up 1.49 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,708.02 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 53.45 points, or 0.74 percent, at 7,317.32.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc dropped 3.37 percent after the FDA approved Evolus Inc's cheaper version of blockbuster Botox. Evolus jumped 20 percent.
Losses in UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) pulled the healthcare sector 0.98 percent lower and weighed on the blue-chip Dow and S&P 500.
In a bright spot, Ultimate Software Group Inc surged 19.51 percent after the HR software provider agreed to be bought by an investor group led by Hellman & Friedman in a $11 billion deal.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Deutsche Bank's ratings have been under pressure from major agencies such as S&P as the bank restructures under new Chief Executive Christian Sewing who took charge last April.
The bank's earnings for the fourth quarter, announced on Friday, ""confirm our view that management's biggest challenge is to improve profitability and bolster the bank's customer franchise"", S&P said in a statement. 
Deutsche posted a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter and showed weakness at its investment bank, overshadowing a first annual profit in four years.
S&P, which rates Deutsche Bank's long-term credit at BBB+ after cutting it last year from A-, said that the bank's litigation and regulatory risks had lessened considerably. 
""But the ongoing drip of cases and adverse news flow continues to undermine management's efforts to improve stability,"" it said. 
Executives have said that negative headlines about police raids on the bank in November dented business.
The bank has vowed to do everything it can to make sure global agencies don't further cut ratings.
""We do view it as a critical objective of ourselves to be on an improving trajectory,"" Deutsche's Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told fixed-income investors on a call on Monday. 
Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially crucial for a bank such as Deutsche, whose perceived health is important in winning business.
Moody's, another rating agency, said on Friday that Deutsche's earnings were in line with expectations but that the bank's ability to rebuild and stabilize revenue in the coming quarters ""will be paramount to the long-term success of its restructuring plan"" and remains a work in progress.

For its part, Fitch said its negative outlook for Deutsche ""reflects our view that it continues to face challenges in reaching its strategic targets in 2019, in particular with respect to improving its profitability.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG unit Electrify America said on Monday it will install Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc battery storage packs at more than 100 charging stations across the United States to keep costs down for drivers charging electric vehicles.
Electricity users can incur high-demand charges from many U.S. utilities when they draw a lot of energy from the grid in a short time, which can happen charging an electric vehicle or a number of them at once at a single station.
""If you pass the demand charge onto the customer in a high-demand charge market"" it can cost anywhere from $70 to $110 to charge a vehicle, Electrify America's chief operating officer Brendan Jones told Reuters. ""If you did that, obviously nobody would buy an electric vehicle.""
Tesla Powerpack battery systems draw power from the grid during off-peak hours and store it for use during peak hours to avoid or reduce demand charges. Electrify America will install most of its battery packs in areas of the United States where there is a higher concentration of electric vehicle owners, particularly on the West Coast and the Northeast.
During a conference call with analysts this week, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said ""stationary storage"" is a growth opportunity for the automaker. 
""I expect that to grow, I mean, probably twice as fast as automotive for... a long time,"" Musk said.
VW has agreed to spend $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure as part of an agreement with federal regulators after admitting to diesel emissions cheating. 
A lack of EV recharging infrastructure is seen as a major barrier to mass adoption as consumers remain concerned over their limited range. 
By this June Electrify America will have 484 charging stations built across America. The company is discussing using more battery storage packs with regulators for its next round of infrastructure investment, company CTO Jones said.
He said that apart from keeping charges down for consumers, Electrify America will examine the possibility of selling stored energy to lower charging stations' costs.

Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China, accelerating the industry's transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to Asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:42AM ET</span>","Starboard buys $200 million stake in Papa John's, shares jump 9 percent","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Hedge fund Starboard Value LP has taken a $200 million stake in Papa John's International Inc after the No. 3 U.S. pizza chain rejected a similar offer from the company's founder, John Schnatter, according to the company and a regulatory filing.
Papa John's shares, which have tumbled nearly 40 percent in the last 52 weeks, jumped 9 percent to $42 on Monday.
Starboard co-founder Jeffrey Smith will become the pizza chain's board chairman and Anthony Sanfilippo, former chairman and chief executive officer of Pinnacle Entertainment, will join as an independent director.
Papa John's CEO Steve Ritchie, who took over the top job on Jan. 1,2018, will also join the board. Schnatter, who was fired as the company's chief spokesman last year, also sits on the board. He is considering a lawsuit over the Starboard investment, according to the filing.
Starboard's Smith has earned a reputation as a savvy investor with restaurant credentials after the firm, in a boardroom coup, replaced all directors at Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI) in 2014.
For months, Papa John's has suffered declining same-store sales and was dropped as the official pizza provider of the National Football League a year ago after Schnatter suggested that player protests during the national anthem were partly responsible for declining sales.
Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company, resigned as chairman in July after Forbes reported that he used a racial slur on a media training conference call. He was also dropped as chief spokesman and the company removed his picture from its pizza boxes.
Papa John's agreement with Starboard marked a change for the activist investment firm that often initiates a push for improvements by threatening a proxy contest.
Amid the wrangling, Schnatter offered over the weekend to make a $250 million investment ""on terms that were substantially similar to, but superior to, the Starboard transaction,"" he said in a filing on Monday.
Starboard has an option to invest an additional $50 million through March 29, 2019.
Starboard was one of only a handful of activist hedge funds to make money last year when it returned 1.7 percent, compared to an 11.3 percent loss for the average activist hedge fund, 
Papa John's says it intends to use about half the proceeds to repay debt.
Reuters reported on Friday that Papa John's was seeking to sell a stake in the company after acquisition offers from private equity firms did not meet its valuation expectations. 
The agreement with Starboard was in the best interests of shareholders following an evaluation of a wide range of strategic options, Papa John's said.
Papa John's expects systemwide North America same-restaurant sales fell 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter and full-year profit was at the lower end of its previous forecast. 
Sales have been falling for over a year as the company battles for market share with larger rival Domino's Pizza and Yum Brands' Pizza Hut. 
Papa John's is spending heavily on revamping its advertising and brand to counter the bad publicity following the Schnatter controversy.

Schnatter has been seeking internal documents to try to show the company was mismanaged and to determine if he was improperly pushed out.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>","UK offered Nissan Brexit assurances, 80 million pounds for car investment","By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain promised Nissan up to 80 million pounds ($104 million) of support and offered Brexit-related assurances to help secure a major investment from the Japanese carmaker in 2016, according to a well-guarded letter released on Monday. 
Nissan said in October 2016 that it would build the next generation of its Qashqai and X-Trail sport utility vehicles at its northern English Sunderland plant, but on Sunday canceled plans to build the X-Trail as diesel sales slide in Europe. 
The original decision, which would have created 740 new jobs, was hailed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who had newly taken office at the time, as a major boost to Britain as it began the process of extricating itself from the European Union. 
But the letter, which the government refused to publish on multiple occasions, had prompted accusations that ministers were doing secretive deals with firms, prompting some Brexiteers to question whether pledges made might keep Britain tied to EU mechanisms such as the customs union. 
""The government fully recognizes the significance of the EU market to your presence in Sunderland,"" wrote business minister Greg Clark to then Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn.
""It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK's future relationship with the EU.""
""We will set our ambitions high and vigorously pursue continued access to the European market as an objective in future negotiations."" 
The up to 80 million pounds of support on skills, research and development and innovation was contingent on the new Qashqai and X-Trail models being built in Britain, Clark wrote. 
Nissan, which builds 30 percent of Britain's 1.52 million cars at its factory, the country's biggest car plant, exports the vast majority of the vehicles to EU countries and, like the rest of the industry, is worried about tariffs if there is a no-deal Brexit. 
""The letter, written in October 2016, shows Nissan and the UK Government’s continued desire to support investment in the UK and maintain Sunderland as one of Nissan’s manufacturing hubs in Europe,"" the company said on Monday. 
The firm will still build its new Juke and Qashqai models at the factory which opened in 1986 after then prime minister Margaret Thatcher successfully encouraged Japanese companies to pick the country as a gateway into Europe. Brexit uncertainty has since prompted consternation in some boardrooms in Tokyo.
On Feb. 1, an EU-Japan free trade agreement also kicked in, which includes the EU's commitment to removing tariffs of 10 percent on imported Japanese cars, diminishing part of the business case for building in Europe. 
Union representatives met Nissan representatives on Monday and said they would push to secure the future of the site.

""Unite will continue to press for further long-term guarantees over future investment and new models to secure the site’s future for generations to come,"" said acting national officer Steve Bush.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",German grid firms see extra costs to meet renewable power target,"By Vera Eckert
ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Boosting renewables to 65 percent of Germany's power mix by 2030 could cost 20 billion euros more than previously planned, which will mean higher consumer energy bills, the four main grid operators said on Monday.
Last year, Germany raised its target for the contribution of renewables to 65 percent by 2030 from 50 percent in a bid to reduce CO2 emissions by 55 percent over 1990 levels. It is set to miss a 2020 target aimed at cutting emissions by 40 percent.
About two fifths of power needs in Europe's largest economy are now met by renewables, but this needs to rise as it seeks to close nuclear plants by 2022 and coal power stations by 2038.
As a result, power grids need to be extended to reach renewable energy sites. This will include new transmission lines to connect the industrial south with northern wind power farms.
The grid companies, known as transmission system operators (TSOs), have presented plans for a four-week consultation outlining spending on onshore lines of 52 billion euros ($60 billion), compared to the 32 billion euros previously envisaged.
The four main TSOs -- EnBW's TransnetBW, 50Hertz, TenneT, and Amprion -- said in a statement that an additional 18 billion to 27 billion euros would be needed to link up offshore wind farms.
Total spending of 70 billion to 79 billion euros over 12 years would be shouldered by consumers via higher grid fees, which account for about a quarter of their electricity bills.
However, the energy regulator Bundesnetzagentur said between a quarter and a third of costs estimated by TSOs in the past were not approved.
The TSOs said some of extra costs arose from digitalising transmission systems and running more lines underground.
The TSOs demands include adding two more cross-country lines on top of three underground ones already planned for 2025.
Between a quarter and half of power demand in southern Germany will have to be met by renewable generation in the north, where plants now generate double the north's needs.
The additional lines to be built would run from Schleswig-Holstein to Baden Wuerttemberg via North-Rhine Westphalia, with capacity for 4 gigawatts (GW) over a distance of 1,160 kms (725 miles), the TSOs said.
""We will study the draft plan very carefully to decide whether all transport capacities are being exploited,"" Peter Franke, vice president of Bundesnetzagentur, told a panel discussion at an industry event in Essen.
The regulator said in January it would seek to rein in run-away costs, especially as Germany's long-term plan to quit coal generation would demand new spending.

343,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",Bill Gross Is a Cautionary Tale for Any Future Bond Kings,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Six months ago, I asked if “it’s worth stepping back to wonder whether we’re witnessing the end of the line” for Bill Gross. There’s no need to wonder any longer.
Gross is retiring from Janus Henderson Group Plc, the firm announced Monday, more than four years after leaving his perch atop the bond-market world at Pacific Investment Management Co. His stint running the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund should serve as a cautionary tale for fixed-income investors who think they’re smarter than the rest of the market.
The issue that plagued Gross was that he was too unconstrained for his own good at Janus. His fund topped out at about $2.2 billion of assets — not an insignificant sum, but a far cry from the almost $300 billion that he ran at Pimco. That huge pool of money meant he was the market, which explains why bond traders used to hang on his every word. Being the world’s largest mutual fund also restrained his investing because by and large there wasn’t enough for him to buy aside from the more traditional fixed-income securities.
During his time at Janus, however, he was nimble enough to invest like a hedge-fund manager. He made a big bet on the convergence of U.S. and German 10-year yields at precisely the wrong time, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates while the European Central Bank remained on hold. The effective duration of his fund somehow fell to minus 4.58 years at one point, even though the prospectus on Janus’s website says the “fund’s average portfolio duration may range from negative 4 years to plus 6 years.” What’s more, it went against what Gross was saying publicly — that the bond bear market would be “relatively mild,” hardly an environment to take a big bet on rising rates. Most recently, he appeared to employ a “merger arbitrage” strategy: a long position in shares of Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding Co. and a short position in those of  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI).
This experiment didn’t end well for Gross or for those who entrusted their money with him. “The unconstrained strategy Mr. Gross manages has underperformed its three-month Libor benchmark since Mr. Gross joined Janus Henderson in late 2014,” according to the press release announcing his retirement. Just over the past year, the fund fell 4.86 percent. It gained 2.43 percent in 2017 and 5.26 percent in 2016, which trailed its peer group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2015, when the fund fell 0.43 percent, it did better than its counterparts.
Gross, for his part, seems to understand that he may have miscalculated with his unconstrained fund. 
“Maybe I should have stuck to total return and been a little more constrained,” he said in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television. He said he managed some total return accounts at Janus and they outperformed “like the old days.”
Gross said that the idea of total return investing, in his mind, was “based on measured risk taking.” He didn’t heed that advice, and that was his downfall. He seemed contemplative during the interview with Keene, comparing his big bet on Treasuries versus bunds in terms of blackjack, saying he put too many chips on the table with that trade. Of course, Gross was briefly a blackjack success in Las Vegas — turning $200 into $10,000 over four months, raising the tuition for his MBA at UCLA — which only added to his mystique as a bond savant. 
By now, it should be clear that there is no such thing. Not when a fund manager is able to “go anywhere,” unshackled by any sorts of guidelines or parameters. Gross learned that the hard way. After all, much of his own money was at stake. Anyone else who wants to stake their reputation on running an unconstrained strategy — or investing in one — should do so at their own risk.

The company agreed to appoint Joe Reece to its board and also as chairman of the transaction committee that is overseeing Del Frisco's plan to review strategic options. Reece's appointment will increase the board size to seven members.
Shares of the company, which owns Eagle Steak House and Frisco's Grille chains, rose nearly 4 percent to $8.25 in morning trade.
Engaged Capital, the company's third-largest shareholder with a near 10 percent stake, has been urging for the sale saying Del Frisco's was poorly managing its steakhouse restaurants and had rushed into buying two chains to avoid an acquisition.
In response, the company had adopted a shareholder rights plan, or a 'poison pill', with a 10 percent trigger in December, but said on Monday it was ending the agreement well before its scheduled expiration due to the deal with Engaged.
Reece, who also sits on the board of ecommerce company RumbleON Inc, will remain a board director until 2021, Del Frisco's said.
Engaged Capital will now vote in favor of Del Frisco's nominees and other proposals at any shareholder meeting, subject to certain exceptions, the company said.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 09:21AM ET</span>",Wirecard says no evidence of criminal misconduct found after FT reports,"By Douglas Busvine and John Geddie
FRANKFURT/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Wirecard said that neither it nor its law firm had found conclusive evidence of criminal misconduct after the Financial Times alleged wrongdoing at the Singapore office of the German payments company.
CEO Markus Braun said the Munich-based company had informed regulators in Germany and Singapore of investigations by its own compliance team and law firm Rajah & Tann into concerns raised last April by a member of staff.
""Until today they didn't find any proof, or conclusive findings, that any of these allegations are true,"" Braun told analysts on a conference call.
Braun said he also expected the external probe to end quite quickly. He pledged to disclose its findings in full: ""We do not expect any material thing to come up from this process.""
Braun's comments helped to fuel a 20 percent rebound in Wirecard shares, erasing half of the losses triggered by the FT's reports last week alleging forgery and falsification of accounts.
Wirecard had dismissed the two FT reports on Wednesday and Friday as ""inaccurate, misleading and defamatory"". 
It issued a more detailed response on Monday, saying that a member of its Singapore team had in raised concerns about the alleged actions of a finance team member there.
The company then started an investigation, which found no evidence to support the allegations. ""Furthermore, there were indications that the allegations could be related to personal animosity between the employees involved,"" Wirecard said.
Rajah & Tann, in a statement on Monday, confirmed that it had sent a letter to Wirecard on Feb. 3 which stated that its inquiry was ongoing. ""To date we have made no conclusive findings of criminal misconduct on the part of any officer or employee of the company,"" said the letter.
SHORT SELLERS' FAVORITE
Singaporean police on Monday said they were looking into the reports of alleged financial irregularities.
Braun, Wirecard's largest shareholder with a 7 percent stake, said the company did not rule out legal action against the FT.
Wirecard, founded in 1999, has been a perennial target for speculative short sellers - market players who seek to profit from falls in a company's share price - who have questioned its accounting methods and rapid international expansion.
These attacks have caused huge volatility in Wirecard's stock, though its share price has rebounded repeatedly, with the company last year entering the blue-chip DAX index.
The allegations have not, however, led to any investigations of the company by Germany's financial regulator or state prosecutors. Instead, both are investigating the short sellers on suspicion of market manipulation.
The Munich state prosecutor's office on Friday said it had found no evidence of the alleged wrongdoing reported by the FT.
POTENTIAL BREACHES
Most sell-side analysts remain bullish on Wirecard, with 10 out of 28 rating the stock a 'strong buy' and a further 13 a 'buy', according to Refinitiv data. Their median price target is 208 euros - 70 percent above where the stock was trading after it bounced on Monday.
UBS analyst Antonin Baudry on Monday reiterated his 'buy' rating and price target of 240 euros, citing the company's rebuttal of the FT reports, its growth prospects and relatively low valuation in relation to the payments sector.
Wirecard said that the allegations by the Singapore staffer related to potential compliance breaches between 2015 and 2018. 
These concerned revenues of 6.9 million euros ($7.9 million) and costs of 4.1 million, as well as an internal transfer of intellectual property worth 2.6 million.
The company's compliance team found that the allegations were ""unfounded, full stop"" but it brought in Rajah & Tann to investigate, said Braun, adding that this was standard procedure because the claims were material in scope.
Wirecard reported on Jan. 30 that its fourth-quarter revenues grew 40 percent and core earnings by 37 percent, and confirmed its guidance for profits of 740 million-800 million euros this year. Braun stood by that forecast.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 08:17AM ET</span>",Merger partners need to look closer to home to win over EU regulators,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - As Siemens and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) face EU rejection of their plan to create a European rail champion to fight foreign rivals, the lesson for other companies is to play up the domestic benefits of their merger deals and be prepared to sell assets. 
Backed by the German and French governments, Siemens and Alstom argue they need to team up to better compete globally with China's state-owned CRRC and other rivals such as Canada's Bombardier. 
But the European Commission bases its judgment on EU competition law which ensures consumers -- in this case rail operators -- have enough choice to maintain downward price pressure in the European market.
""Industrial champions are good for global competition but not generally for intra-EU competition and European users,"" said Oliver Bretz, a lawyer at Euclid Law. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier have said an EU veto of the rail deal would be an economic error and political mistake. The French contend that by applying antitrust rules to the letter, the EU may end up benefiting China more than its own economies. 
Siemens and Alstom failed to offer sufficient concessions to allay European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's concerns about their market power in Europe, sources told Reuters last month.
""To become competitive abroad requires competition at home,"" Vestager told her colleagues last month, according to a briefing note seen by Reuters. 
The European Commission is expected to announce its ruling this week ahead of a Feb. 18 deadline.
DOMESTIC CONCERNS
The lesson for companies wanting to merge and create European powerhouses is that they need to be more mindful of the domestic concerns of the regulators, said Ioannis Kokkoris, a law professor at Queen Mary University of London.
That could mean being prepared to sell assets in areas where there is an overlap between the two companies but Kokkoris said that the terms and conditions relating to the future behavior of the merged entity were also key.
""Carefully structured remedies can allow the creation of scale of operations... while at the same time ensure that competition harm is limited or non existent,"" he said.
The big question is how much companies are willing to sacrifice to get the deal done.
""It comes down to a simple equation. How much do you want the deal to how much it is going to cost you in remedies. There is a range of outcomes,"" said Euclid Law's Bretz.
Politicians pushing for broader industrial considerations to be part of EU merger reviews should be careful what they wish for, he added, saying that it could make merger tests more unpredictable. 
""You might as well be in China where merger control can be a tool of industrial policy. That is not how we tend to do things in Europe. If you open the floodgates, you will end up with a system which is no longer transparent,"" Bretz said.

Investors from outside the country and the Gulf were net buyers of around 4.4 billion riyals ($1.17 billion) of Saudi-listed stocks in January, the most for a single month since data became available in 2015. International funds are seeking to build exposure as some of the stocks will be added to emerging-market indexes compiled by MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell. Local funds, on the other hand, are buying less.
The purchases mark a change in trend after a selloff triggered by the killing of Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October. Back then, foreigners sold the most for a single month since they were allowed to directly trade in the country. As volatility surged, funds tied to the government were constantly mentioned by traders and investors as giving support to the market, by purchasing mostly large caps. The main Saudi index is up 8.9 percent this year.
Investors jumping at Saudi stocks now are finding high prices and an economic scenario that doesn’t corroborate expensive valuations, according to Tina Byles Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Adam Choppin, respectively the chief executive officer and investment officer at FIS Group Inc.
“Speculation around huge foreign inflows are based on naive assumptions about how index providers and ETF issuers trade through such events, and we believe those waiting for ‘dumb passive money’ in Saudi will be kept waiting come fall 2019,” they wrote in a report. “Following index inclusion, we expect to see a fair degree of selling pressure as state affiliated Saudi investors use the inclusion as a liquidity event for chunks of their Saudi equity portfolio.”

DUBAI (Reuters) - State-developer Dubai South said on Monday it aimed to spend two billion dirhams ($545 million) to build an e-commerce free trade zone offering foreign firms 100 percent ownership.
Foreigners operating outside of free trade zones in Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates can usually only hold a maximum 49 percent stake, with UAE nationals holding the rest.
The new 920,000 square meter trade zone, known as EZDubai, aimed to attract e-commerce, logistics and other related industries, the developer said, adding that construction was expected to start in 2019.
Dubai is already the headquarters of the region's largest e-commerce company, Souq.com, which was bought by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2017. It is also home to noon.com, an online shopping site set up by Dubai billionaire Mohammed Alabbar
Dubai South aimed to invest two billion dirhams over four years in the zone, although the timeline for spending the cash would depend on demand, the logistics district head for Dubai South, Mohsen Ahmad, told Reuters.
Ahmad said the funds, which Dubai South planned to raise from banks and other institutions, would be spent on infrastructure, offices and warehouses.
EZDubai will be located in the south of the emirate near industrial and residential developments and Dubai's second airport, Al Maktoum International.

Ineos has the largest shale gas license acreage in Britain and wants to develop the sites to cut its reliance on imported gas, which it says will dramatically reduce its costs.
""The Government is shutting down shale by the backdoor and is betting the future of our manufacturing industry on windmills and imported gas,"" Ineos said in a statement on its website.
Ineos said Britain must change its so-called traffic light seismicity regulations which mean fracking must be halted for 18 hours if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected at sites.
""Ineos calls upon the Government to either make shale workable or shut it down,"" Ineos said.
Cuadrilla, currently the only company to have fracked for gas in Britain, had to halt operations several times last year at its Preston New Road site in northwest England due to seismic events which exceeded the limit.
It has also said the current regulations are too stringent and experts agree that the limit for tremors could be safely raised at fracking sites.
However, the government, which initially supported fracking to cut Britain's reliance on imports as North Sea gas supplies dry up, said earlier this year it has no plans to change the rules.
Britain currently imports around 60 percent of its gas needs via pipelines from Norway and continental Europe and tankers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from countries including Qatar, Russia and the U.S..
Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure.
It is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who have raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination and say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",DSV's $4 billion offer for Panalpina gets shareholder cold shoulder,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Danish logistics company DSV's $4 billion-plus bid for Panalpina hit a roadblock on Monday when the Swiss freight forwarder's top shareholder rejected the offer, saying Panalpina should stick to its own ""consolidator strategy"". 
Panalpina shares traded 8.2 percent lower at 163.6 Swiss francs by 0940 GMT. They had risen more than a third this year on last month's DSV offer initially pitched at 170 Swiss francs per share.
The snub by the Ernst Goehner Foundation, which owns nearly 46 percent of Panalpina shares, marks the second time in the last few months that DSV Chief Executive Jens Bjorn Andersen has encountered resistance in Switzerland. 
In October, CEVA Logistics rejected the Danes' $1.55 billion approach and subsequently deepened ties with French shipping company CMA CGM.
""We strongly believe that Panalpina can create more value for its shareholders, customers and employees through its consolidator strategy than the published non-binding purchase offer from DSV,"" said Ernst Goehner Foundation board member Thomas Gutzwiller in a statement.
Another big Panalpina owner, 12.3 percent stakeholder Cevian, has been pushing for the Swiss company to consider being bought out, amid its struggles in ocean freight, a delayed IT system and profitability and growth that have lagged rivals.
Sweden-based Cevian and DSV both declined to comment. 
Andersen wants Panalpina's air- and sea-freight operations to help DSV consolidate the fragmented freight-forwarding industry. The deal, if it succeeds, would make DSV the industry's fourth-largest player, behind DHL Logistics, Kuehne & Nagel and DB Schenker.
TWICE SPURNED?
The snub of DSV by Panalpina's top shareholder could mean Andersen must raise his cash-and-shares bid to convince important investors to back the proposal. 
Previously, Andersen declined to say if DSV would consider raising its offer, should it encounter resistance, but said that ""we are not afraid of failing twice"" should the Panalpina deal end similarly to its bid for CEVA.
Analysts' views over whether Andersen would dig deeper to sweeten the offer were mixed, with some saying they would not rule out a counterproposal and others concluding the current bid may be the ceiling. 
DSV's offer implied a takeover multiple of 26.6 times Panalpina's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), or a 64 percent premium to the sector, Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors. 
""We think DSV has already made a full offer for Panalpina, which is difficult to beat,"" Jefferies said, pointing out that Kuehne & Nagel last month already panned DSV's bid as ""hopelessly overvalued"".
In response to the foundation's decision not to back the DSV bid, Panalpina said its board ""continues to carefully review the situation with its professional advisers"".
The 20 largest freight forwarders control only about a third of the market, making the industry potentially ripe for takeovers or partnerships as companies seek to boost profitability and take advantage of economies of scale.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The unlikely combination of freshwater fish and cannabis is producing outsized medical marijuana crops that Green Relief Inc aims to capitalize on, as the Canadian company plots a stock market listing and global expansion.
In an underground southern Ontario facility surrounded by farmland, Green Relief operates a cutting-edge aquaponic farm, using filtered fish waste to fertilize cannabis plants, which in turn clean the water for the fish.
The company says it is the world's only licensed producer to grow medical marijuana this way, a pesticide-free process that took 2-1/2 years to fine tune. The only signs of this operation, which is built into a hill and insulated by some three feet of dirt and grass, is above-ground ventilation equipment sticking out of the ground.
""This is the agriculture of the future,"" said Warren Bravo, a former concrete contractor who co-founded the company with friend Steve LeBlanc in 2013. ""If you're not latching on to sustainable agriculture technologies now, you're going to be a dinosaur.""
Green Relief's closed-loop system, which raises 6,000 tilapia and 4,500 plants at any given time, uses 90 percent less water than conventional agriculture, while delivering 10-20 percent better yields than traditional methods, Bravo said.
Every five weeks, Green Relief purges one of its 16 fish tanks, donating some 300 market-size tilapia to Second Harvest, a food charity which delivers the fish to a homeless shelter's kitchen.
A C$60 million ($45.9 million) expansion is underway at the company's rural base outside Hamilton, about an hour's drive west of Toronto, which will add 15,000-20,000 kilograms to annual output. The project also includes manufacturing and packaging operations, to process plants from its satellite operations.
That includes a recently acquired 100,000-square-foot indoor soccer complex in Hamilton, which will produce some 15,000 kilograms of pot after a C$9 million retrofit.
With partners, Green Relief is also building facilities in Thunder Bay, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia that will each produce some 20,000 kilograms annually, Bravo said.
Backed to date with some C$18 million from private investors, Green Relief is preparing to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange, and possibly Nasdaq, to help fund its growth plans.
An initial public offering is likely ""within months,"" depending on market conditions, and will build on a current financing that prices 100 million shares at C$3.50 each, Bravo said. Green Relief could break even within months and expects to be profitable this year, he added.
Bravo had been chief executive until he handed the job on an interim basis in January to John Durfy, who has a background in markets and investment.
As majority shareholder and director of business development, Bravo is busy securing properties in Italy and Australia while advancing such joint ventures as an alliance with Switzerland's Ai Fame and Ai Lab.
""Canada's in a very fortunate position right now,"" he said, referencing the country's world-leading legalization of recreational cannabis in October 2018. ""We get to take the lead in a brand new industry.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Julius Baer plans to axe 130-140 jobs, or around 2 percent of its workforce, as part of a cost-cutting plan announced on Monday, after a tough end to 2018 caused the Swiss private bank to scale back growth targets.
Switzerland's third-largest listed lender on Monday announced a 100 million Swiss franc ($100.3 million) cost savings program after reporting a 6 billion franc decline in managed assets in 2018 and missed its profitability and cost-income targets.
Adjusted half-year net profit fell 18 percent in the last six months of 2018 as tumbling stock markets made its customers more cautious. Full-year net profit rose 4 percent to 735 million Swiss francs, behind the 772 million Swiss francs analysts polled by Reuters had expected.
""We will follow a clear strategy centered on smarter market coverage, holistic and personalized advice, and technology transformation, aiming above all to enhance client experience, improve efficiency and increase revenues,"" said Chief Executive Bernhard Hodler in a statement. 
Last month, UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, warned of a tough start to 2019, after reporting an outflow of funds from its flagship wealth management business at the end of last year.
Over the course of 2019, Julius Baer aims to reduce its headcount by a net 2 percent from 6,693 full-time staff, but added that it will continue hiring in strategic areas.
The Zurich-based bank for wealthy and affluent clients brought in 17 billion francs in net new money in 2018, a growth rate of 4.5 percent at the lower end of its 4-6 percent medium-term target range, helping to cushion the impact from negative market performance and a declining euro, which saw managed assets fall 2 percent to 382 billion francs.
Shares in the bank were down 4.4 percent at 37.81 francs by 0830 GMT.
In November Baer had warned on its 64-68 percent cost-income target, after adverse market conditions took a larger bite out of earnings than the bank previously anticipated. On Monday the bank reported an adjusted ratio of 70.6 percent, with an increase over the target range representing reduced profitability over costs.
It said it now aimed to achieve a cost-income ratio below 68 percent by 2020.
In a call with journalists, Hodler said client activity had picked up since the start of this year compared with a tough November and December, but had not yet returned to levels seen in the first half of 2018.
The bank said it would propose a dividend of 1.50 francs per share, compared with 1.40 francs for 2017.

That means investors shouldn’t be driven by fears of recession for now, JP Morgan analysts said.
The Fed signaled last week that it’s done raising rates for at least a little while, and that it’ll be flexible in reducing bond holdings. The Fed’s changes have already been welcomed by equity investors who boosted the S&P 500 2.5 percent over three sessions, while rates traders have been working to figure out the implications of the newfound caution about shrinking the balance sheet. Demand for gold has increased as well.
Apart from the immediate implications, the Fed’s adjustments may warrant changes to JPMorgan’s previous outline that investors should consider moving fully to neutral and tilting defensive in the second half of 2019 to reposition for “durable challenges in 2020,” the firm said.
“If the Fed is less spooked by full employment, more tolerant of an inflation overshoot and less anxious to reach restrictive policy, then 2020 might not be a year to think about recession and so late 2019/early 2020 would be premature to position defensively cross-asset,” strategists led by John Normand wrote in a note dated Feb. 1.
Many global measures of assets are pricing in slower economic growth than the current pace, the report said, including on risk premiums:
Cyclically oriented gauges like the S&P 500, European Autos, Chinese Equities, Topix, Emerging-Market Equities and MSCI Mining “still seem to trade as if global growth were running about a percentage point weaker than its roughly 2.6% current pace,” the report said.
JPMorgan arrived at the figure by regressing annual returns on a PMI index, comparing actual to predicted returns, and backing out from this risk premium an implied global growth rate.
“This framework is quite crude in that a single variable like the global PMI explains only about half of the variation in most of these assets’ returns,” the strategists wrote. “But as the signal is consistent with those of other fundamental frameworks, we are comfortable asserting that even modest improvements in global growth can push markets higher, because there is no evidence of overvaluation.”

(Reuters) - AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) said on Monday four senior executives including chief operating officer are leaving the company as it restructures to cut costs and expects automotive retail to be challenging this year.
The top U.S. auto retailer is consolidating its regional structure from three regions to two and expects the restructuring to save about $50 million annually, it said.
AutoNation said COO Lance Iserman and Chief Technology Officer Tom Conophy will leave effective immediately, while its chief human resource officer, Dennis Berger, will leave at the end of the month.
Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation appointed company veteran James Bender as executive vice president of sales.
It also said Donna Parlapiano, executive vice president, franchise network, merger & acquisitions, and corporate real estate, elected to retire on Jan. 3.
The restructuring comes as analysts forecast a dip in U.S. vehicle sales this year. New vehicle sales in the United States are expected to drop as higher interest rates and rising prices could prompt customers to hold off their car-buying plans, the National Automobile Dealers Association said last month.
Recently, the company introduced a used-car subscription service from auto-leasing startup Fair through its network of more than 300 U.S. dealers.
In October, CEO Mike Jackson told Reuters the company planned to reduce investment following an ""elevated period of brand extension investment"" in higher-margin service and used car operations to offset the squeeze on profits from new vehicle sales.
AutoNation did not immediately respond to a query about any potential job cuts due to the restructuring.

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury believes it can curb the influence of Oleg Deripaska over aluminum giant Rusal despite concerns the Russian oligarch may still be able to pull the strings of his business empire from behind the scenes.
Rusal and its parent company En+ were hit with U.S. sanctions in April when Washington blacklisted billionaire Deripaska along with several other influential Russians because of their ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
After months of negotiations, Deripaska agreed in late 2018 to reduce his stake in En+ to 44.95 percent from 70 percent in a deal with the U.S. Treasury Department that allowed the punitive measures against Rusal and En+ to be lifted.
While the announcement was a relief to major companies that depend on aluminum, U.S. congressional Democrats demanded further legislation to ensure that Deripaska abides by the deal ""in letter and in spirit"".
They believe U.S. President Donald Trump let Deripaska off the hook following intense lobbying by some European companies and governments worried about the impact of high aluminum prices and the fate of workers at Rusal's operations in Europe. 
While the voting rights in En+ under Deripaska's control are now capped at 35 percent, votes controlled by potential allies could boost that percentage above 50 and allow the Russian tycoon to influence strategic decisions.
Under the new structure, Deripaska's long-term partner  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), a Swiss-based commodities trading company, gets 10.55 percent of the votes while Kremlin-controlled bank VTB holds onto 7.35 percent, according to the voting structure published by En+.
As part of the deal, four U.S.-nominated independent trustees now control the voting rights for another 37.7 percent of En+ shares held by Deripaska, former family members, his charitable foundation, VTB and some other shareholders.
The remaining votes in En+, which will have a 56.9 percent stake in Rusal once the ownership restructuring is complete, are controlled by institutional and retail investors.

STRETCHED THIN
The deal contains multiple measures, including the threat of sanctions, to prevent a scenario in which Deripaska could exercise control over the companies at board level by acting in concert with other shareholders.
But many of those measures operate on the basis of self-reporting: the companies must inform the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of any attempt by Deripaska and other shareholders to form a coalition.
Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former U.S. Treasury official at the Center for a New American Security think-tank, said OFAC, which administers U.S. sanctions regimes against Iran, Venezuela and elsewhere, may not have the resources to track Deripaska's role.
""I am worried that, in fact, the task may be beyond them and that in fact they are stretched extremely thin, with an array of other priorities ... and that they won't have the bandwidth to follow up adequately,"" Rosenberg said.
A U.S. Treasury Department spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the deal was robust enough to sever Deripaska's control over Rusal, En+ and power company ESE - as well as block any attempts to circumvent the rules.
""Those who transact business for or on his behalf run the risk of being sanctioned themselves, including VTB Bank or Glencore should they choose to work on Deripaska's behalf,"" said the spokesman.
Deripaska's representative, VTB and Glencore declined to comment.
While the threat of new sanctions is potentially serious for international companies, one European diplomat, who declined to be named, said the risk of being hit by OFAC penalties may have little impact on Russians with limited ties to the West.
""If you are a Russian, living in Russia ... why would you care?"" the diplomat
SANCTIONS THREAT
Deripaska, who created his empire after coming out on top in the brutal Russian aluminum wars of the 1990s, is known in the Russian business world as a fighter who never gives up - regardless of the domestic or global balance of power.
He has spent the past two decades carefully building his chain of assets, hand-picking management teams going back to when he took control of his first Siberian smelters. And until he agreed to cut his stake in En+ under the U.S. deal, he had never sold a major asset in his life.
The U.S. Treasury spokesman said Deripaska had contractually committed not to try to exercise control over En+ or companies it owns or controls, including their boards or management.
The deal also requires En+ and its companies to maintain records of any contacts between Deripaska and the boards, management, employees, or agents of En+, the spokesman said, adding that managers who engage in any contacts that are inappropriate under the agreement must be removed.
Asked what mechanism OFAC would use to police compliance and how much capacity it had for independent checks, the spokesman said information provided by En+ and its companies would supplement and be confirmed by a team of U.S. investigators.
""This team will review all submissions to OFAC from En+, Rusal and ESE, in addition to using other resources to monitor the actions of Deripaska, the companies, and their board members, to ensure that Deripaska is not able to exercise unofficial control over En+, Rusal, or ESE,"" the spokesman said.
He said any attempt by a coalition of shareholders to change the composition of a company's board would be uncovered by OFAC and result in the reimposition of sanctions on En+, its subsidiaries and any other parties involved.
En+ chairman Greg Barker, a former British government minister, said the board would go beyond the requirements set out by OFAC by establishing a compliance committee and would retain independent counsel to advise on governance. 
QUESTION OF CONTROL?
Some U.S. Democrats remain concerned, however, that despite the various checks and balances, Deripaska may still be able to wield influence.
Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and among the most vocal critics of the deal, said there were potential conflicts of interest in the new governance structure.
One of the trustees appointed by OFAC to exercise voting rights in En+ to ensure Deripaska cannot influence the board is a law firm based in Jersey that has worked for him and his companies for years.
""My concern all along was that Deripaska would, directly or indirectly, still retain control over his companies and benefit personally from this deal,"" Warner said in response to a Reuters question about the law firm's role as trustee.
Two former U.S. sanctions officials said the deal did sever Deripaska's control. But whether he exercises de facto influence is beyond OFAC's scope, said Michael Dobson, a former U.S. Treasury official now at the Morrison & Foerster law firm.
Analysts said Deripaska may continue to influence decisions simply because of his aluminum market expertise.
""Deripaska has a good understanding of the aluminum market, taking into account the number of years he has been dealing with it,"" said Oleg Petropavlovskiy, senior analyst at BCS Global Markets. ""En+'s independent directors will probably have their ear to him."" 
As for the managers recruited by Deripaska over the years to run his empire, a source close to En+ said there were no plans to remove anyone unaffected by the U.S.-mandated restructuring.

The source said: ""(En+ is) not pretending that Deripaska is completely removed from the business, that was never the issue. The question is the control of the business, defined by control at shareholders meetings and of the board.""

391,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 03:06AM ET</span>",Australia vows to clean up financial sector after landmark misconduct inquiry,"By Jonathan Barrett and Swati Pandey
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's corporate regulators will be subjected to a new oversight body in a shake-up of the banking sector recommended by a high-powered independent inquiry into financial sector greed and malpractice.
The government-appointed inquiry known as a Royal Commission also recommended prosecutions for 24 cases of wrongdoing and advised that remuneration structures across the industry be overhauled to remove systemic conflicts of interest.
Authorities were urged to consider laying charges over behavior such as the charging of fees for services not rendered, including instances at major lenders Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.
The commission's recommendations were released by the government on Monday after the public inquiry heard 11 months of shocking revelations of wrongdoing which wiped A$60 billion ($43.5 billion) from the country's top finance stocks.
Misconduct reached into the sector's upper echelons, with top wealth manager AMP Ltd engaging in board-level deception of a regulator over the deliberate charging of customers for financial advice it never gave.
Firms were found to prey on some of society's most vulnerable customers, highlighted by the case of an insurer who used aggressive sales techniques to sell an opaque product to a young man with Down Syndrome.
""The price paid by our community has been immense and goes beyond just the financial,"" Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said as the government promised to take action on all 76 recommendations.
""Businesses have been broken, and the emotional stress and personal pain have broken lives.""
The recommendations also include banning trailing commissions for third-party mortgage brokers, forcing financial planners to disclose any fees they receive for selling products, and banning banks from charging default interest for farm businesses affected by drought.
Regulators also needed greater oversight after they were accused of working too closely with the banks. When misconduct was revealed, it either went unpunished or the consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done, the inquiry found.
Australia's corporate regulator said in response to the report that it would prioritize serious matters referred to it by the Royal Commission for possible prosecutions.
BANK SHARES RISE
Ahead of the report's release, which came after the close of market trading in Sydney, shares in the ""Big Four"" banks closed up about one percent as investors looked forward to some certainty around the new regulatory framework.
However, wealth managers, whose reputations were shredded in the inquiry, were punished with IOOF Holdings Ltd stock closing down 4.5 percent and AMP sliding to a record low. The broader market closed 0.5 percent higher.
""The key macro issue we have been interested in is if this was going to further reduce the banks' willingness to lend, which would be a further headwind to the economy which is already under some pressure,"" said Andrew Ticehurst, a strategist at Nomura.
""At this stage, it does not appear to be the case. It would be a bit milder than expected.""
Fallout from the Royal Commission has already prompted banks to tighten lending practices in their core mortgage businesses, contributing to some of the biggest housing price falls in a generation.
The report comes ahead of an election expected in May in which falling house prices could be a hot-button issue.
The conservative government, which for months defended the banks and rejected calls for an inquiry, is fighting for its survival with opinion polls suggesting an election victory for the center-left Labor party. 
Labor says it expects to adopt all the commission's recommendations.
While Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also said he will take up the recommendations, he has warned against overreaching and cutting off credit flows. 
FAIR GO
The report from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne, a former High Court justice, found that the industry's problems were exacerbated by an unwillingness to accept responsibility.
""That is, there remains a reluctance in some entities to form and then to give practical effect to their understanding of what is ethical, of what is efficient, honest and fair, of what is the right thing to do,"" the report said.
National Australia Bank Chairman Ken Henry came in for particular criticism after appearing dismissive during his public interrogation by the commission's barristers.
""I thought it telling that Dr Henry seemed unwilling to accept any criticism of how the board had dealt with some issues,"" Commissioner Hayne wrote, adding he was ""not as confident as I would wish to be that the lessons of the past have been learned"".
Australian Banking Association chief Anna Bligh said banks ""accept full responsibility for these failings and they know that they must now change to ensure that this never happens again"".

""Banks are determined to learn the lessons, to fix the problems and to make it right,"" she said.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 02:54AM ET</span>","U.S. junk bonds are back, for now","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While stocks hog the limelight with their best January in three decades, another corner of the risk assets marketplace sprang back to life last month after having taken a pounding at the end of last year, though some investors question whether the recovery has legs.
Junk bonds in January delivered their strongest monthly performance in more than seven years with a total return of nearly 4.6 percent, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofAML index data, retracing almost all of the fourth quarter's losses. Issuance of new debt rebounded after a near-complete shutdown in December.
(For a graphic on 'Junk bonds roared back to life in January' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2t2csEy)
Along with the surge in stocks, it would appear to be an endorsement of a U.S. economy that continues to outperform its global peers, as well as the shift by the Federal Reserve to a wait-and-see posture regarding future interest rate increases.
Companies with risky credit profiles brought $11.7 billion in new high-yield debt to the market in the first month of the year, after a nearly six-week dry spell at the end of 2018. The bounce-back from December has led fund investors to put the most cash into high-yield bonds since 2016, according to Lipper.
That backdrop would typically be seen as constructive for more gains. Some big bond managers, however, remain skeptical of the rebound, attributing it more to a clutch of technical factors that will soon peter out than to a lasting improvement in fundamentals.
""We don't think this is a particularly strong buying opportunity,"" said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital, anticipating a market correction that will pull prices lower. Strong high-yield gains in January 2018 were more than erased by a volatile February.
December saw just $594 million in high-yield deals, the lowest monthly issuance since August 2008. Companies stepped back from raising debt because global macroeconomic trends - such as slowing global growth, the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit - had whipped up volatility in financial markets. But when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last month signaled a pause in the U.S. central bank's interest-rate hiking policy, confirmed in last week's policy statement, markets rebounded.
Still, the high-yield market's recovery from the December trough adds up to less than half of January 2018's issuance. The relatively small size of the market may be artificially buoying prices. The compensation paid to high-yield bond investors for holding riskier securities, which had widened to 5.357 percent over Treasuries on Jan. 3, has narrowed by 108 basis points since, according to ICE BofAML indexes.
""The (junk bond) market is currently weak. Buyers are being stingy and disciplined, and sellers are offloading as soon as they can,"" said Kathleen Gaffney, director of diversified fixed income at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance. 
Two one-time events may also be shrinking the market and inflating prices: the recent upgrade of HCA (NYSE:HCA) Healthcare's debt to investment grade and the merger of speculative-grade First Data with the investment-grade Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV). 
Nonetheless, strong investor demand has led issuers to increase the size of their deals. Military aerospace parts maker TransDigm Group priced its $3.8 billion deal Wednesday, up $1.1 billion from initial price talk. The Targa Resources bond which reopened the market in January added a tranche, doubling the offering to $1.5 billion.
The terms secured by investors are particularly impressive given that the economic and geopolitical worries that roiled markets in December have not disappeared. 
Moreover, U.S. corporate profit growth, a key driver of junk bond performance, is seen stalling through the first three quarters of this year as the tailwinds fade from last year's tax cuts, according to Refinitiv data. In the first quarter alone, profits are estimated to barely rise at all - growing by 1.1 percent year over year.
""Nothing has really changed that much,"" said Michael DePalma, chief executive of hedge fund PhaseCapital LP. ""People were just projecting forward: we're going to have trade wars, the economy is slowing, the Fed's going to raise rates and that's going to ruin everything.""
This January, he said, nobody cares.
Given the persistence of those macroeconomic themes, the volatility that spooked high-yield issuers in December could easily return in 2019. And although the Fed may be open to pause interest rate hikes this year, the continued strength of the U.S. labor market may make it difficult for the Fed to justify holding rates unchanged for too long.
""The market reaction to the Fed's dovishness is overblown. Economic fundamentals have not changed and the Fed could raise again after a pause,"" said Gaffney.

For managers skeptical of the rebound in junk, then, January provided an opportunity to remove risk ahead of anticipated volatility. ""We've used the first month to really clean up any of the mistakes we had made in our portfolio. This really is the time to get out without taking a meaningful haircut,"" said McClain.

""While corporate earnings and fundamentals remain key, political developments, notably the U.S.-China trade situation, remain potential risk factors.""
China's sprawling services sector maintained a solid pace of expansion in January even though growth moderated slightly, a private survey showed on Sunday, offering continued support for the world's second-largest economy as manufacturing cools.
A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018.
That report, along with better-than-expected ISM manufacturing activity numbers for January, pointed to underlying strength in the world's biggest economy.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 01:25AM ET</span>",Australia's CBA unit shifts to new fee model after watchdog's order,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia's financial planning unit is stopping levying service fees continuously to its customers and will only charge fees when the services are delivered, following an order from the corporate watchdog.
Commonwealth Financial Planning Ltd (CFPL) has started the process to stop levying such service fees to existing customers from Feb. 1, Australia's top lender said in a statement on Monday.
Earlier in the day, The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), in a separate statement, told CFPL to stop taking fees because it has failed to comply with a court order to fix wrongly levied fees.
The lender said that CFPL has also agreed not to enter into any new service arrangements with customers.
CBA expects the changes to have an impact of A$40 million on CFPL’s pre-tax profit.
""CFP will be moving to a new financial advice fee model where customers will pay for advice services when they are delivered,"" Commonwealth Bank Group Executive for Retail Banking Services, Angus Sullivan, said.
The orders come as the final report is released by a powerful inquiry that exposed last year systemic wrongdoing across Australia's financial sector.
Commonwealth Bank, which came under fire at the inquiry over its fee structure and for charging customers fees for financial advice they never received, is seen as particularly exposed to a regulatory crackdown owing to the size of its retail business.
ASIC said the bank's financial planning arm failed to respond adequately to its concerns about its fees for no service, triggering the restrictions.
The bank had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.
The ""Big Four"" banks - CBA, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank - plus AMP have already committed to pay more than A$2 billion ($1.45 billion) to wronged customers.
The new requirements would continue until CFPL is able to satisfy ASIC that all the outstanding issues have been remedied. 
""ASIC has also been informed by CFPL that it is now in the process of transitioning its ongoing service model to one whereby customers are only charged fees after the relevant services have been provided,"" the statement said. ""ASIC will monitor CFPL's transition to the new model.""

Shares in CBA closed 0.8 percent higher, while the broader market firmed 0.5 percent.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent-backed Maoyan Entertainment, China's biggest movie-ticketing platform by sales, fell 1.1 percent in its Hong Kong stock debut on Monday, the latest in a string of weak starts among Chinese tech firms listing in the financial hub.
Shares in Maoyan Entertainment opened at HK$14.82 ($1.89), barely higher than the initial public offering (IPO) price of HK$14.8, which was already at the bottom end of an indicative range.
They then fell to as low as HK$14, a warning sign for other Chinese tech companies that may be eyeing IPOs after achieving lofty valuations in private funding rounds. The stock closed at HK$14.64.
However, thin trading volumes in a truncated trading session on the eve of the Lunar New Year could have contributed to Maoyan's lackluster performance, said Ke Yan, co-head of research at Aequitas Research.
""While on one hand there's a lack of demand for the name given the limited upside in the online movie ticketing market in terms of market penetration, on the other hand, the upcoming Chinese holiday season could be another contributing factor for the thin volume and the poor performance,"" Yan said.
Loss-making Maoyan raised $250 million in a smaller-than-expected IPO, and could raise up to $287 million if a greenshoe, or over-allotment option, is exercised within the first month of trade. That is, however, a fraction of the amount it was looking to raise last year.
Its float is being watched as a test of investor sentiment for Hong Kong deals after a patchy performance by newly listed stocks in 2018 amid U.S.-China trade tensions.
Maoyan's IPO already implied a ""down round"" for Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, as it valued the ticketing platform at $2.16 billion - more than a quarter below the valuation reached in its last funding round in 2017.
Investors are bracing for further down rounds in China's much-hyped tech sector, as weak stock markets worldwide and the country's economic slowdown weigh on once-buoyant private markets.
Many firms such as online food delivery-to-ticketing services provider Meituan Dianping and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp, which raised billions of dollars in their listings, are trading below their IPO prices in Hong Kong.
Maoyan offers ticketing services through its Maoyan and Gewara apps in China - the world's second-largest movie market after the United States - and mainly distributes domestic films.
It also helped with the local distribution of the 2017 romantic drama ""The Shape of Water"", which won four Oscars, according to its prospectus.
Maoyan's revenue almost doubled in the first nine months of 2018 to 3.1 billion yuan ($459.76 million), the prospectus showed. It has yet to turn in a net profit, but its loss narrowed to 144 million yuan over the same period from 152.1 million yuan a year earlier.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were joint sponsors for the Maoyan listing.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 12:25AM ET</span>",Japan insurers to target China M&A in new phase after $50 billion overseas push,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Taiga Uranaka
HONG KONG/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese insurance companies have spent more than $50 billion on acquisitions over the past five years to become the world's second-largest buyer of insurance assets, and the deals spree won't be slowing down any time soon.
The cashed-up insurers are expected to step up their hunt in new markets, with Asia, mainly China, at the top of their wish list, bankers and insurance sector sources said.
Two sector giants - Nippon Life Insurance and Tokio Marine Holdings - said last month they were seeking more deals overseas, at a time when not many regional or global insurers have the appetite to splurge cash on assets.
Japanese insurance firms have been busy scooping up assets in countries, from Australia to the United States, in the last few years, as they sought to cushion the impact of negative interest rates and a fast-maturing market at home.
They struck M&A deals worth $6.1 billion last year, up 66 percent from 2017, Refinitiv data showed. Japanese insurers have spent $53 billion on deals since 2014, the second most by insurers of any country after the United States.
The overseas push, however, largely excluded China, the world's No.3 insurance market after the United States and Japan, due to foreign ownership curbs and fragile diplomatic relations between the two Asian economies.
That will change with China set to allow foreigners to own majority stakes in domestic insurance joint ventures, and Beijing and Tokyo looking to forge closer business ties amid rising trade tensions with Washington, the bankers said.
""Now finally with the easing of foreign shareholding, they would jump in,"" said Linda Sun-Mattison, an Asian insurance analyst at Bernstein, referring to Japanese insurers. ""China is probably the biggest opportunity in the life insurance sector.""
(GRAPHIC: Acquisitions by Japanese insurance companies - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TofYEx) 
China is in the process of easing foreign ownership curbs for life insurance joint ventures that will allow overseas firms to own 51 percent in those units compared to the current 50 percent. Foreign firms have already been allowed to operate wholly-owned non-life units in the country.
Beijing has pledged to remove the foreign ownership limit in life insurance ventures completely in three years.
In a sign of the growing interest in China, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, a unit of Japan's MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc, agreed in May to buy Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 37.5 percent stake in mid-sized BoComm Life for $477 million.
Bankers who work with Japan insurers said firms including Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc and Sompo Holdings Inc were expected to step up their search for Chinese targets in the years ahead.
""While you will see a few big deals happening in the U.S., the number of transactions will definitely be more in Asia ... where the Japanese insurers need to consolidate their position,"" said a Hong Kong-based financials head at an investment bank.
The banker said his firm was already working on a few possible acquisition deals by Japanese insurers in China. He declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
""We do not have a plan in China during the current medium-term business plan period, but we will continue to study the market,"" said a spokeswoman for Dai-ichi Life. 
A Sompo spokesman said the company ""will study strategies for emerging countries including China"". A Tokio Marine spokesman said: ""At this moment, we have no deal decided in China."" A Nippon Life spokesman said the company is working to grow its Chinese joint venture Nissay-Greatwall Life Insurance. 
DIVERSIFICATION GOAL
Nippon Life and other Japan insurers including Tokio Marine that have operations in China have not been able to scale up there in competition with dominant local players and global rivals including  Prudential  (LON:PRU) and Sun Life.
Top Chinese firms such as China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance Group collectively hold about 90 percent of the Chinese life insurance market.
""China has not been an easy market for Japanese insurers, but it is a huge market still despite slower growth prospects,"" said Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) managing director Teppei Takanabe, who specializes in the financial sector.
With a low life insurance market penetration of 3 percent of gross domestic product and a growing middle class, the easing of ownership curbs is set to make China the next battleground for insurers seeking growth outside their home markets.
Fitch said in a December report that Japanese insurers' M&A in the mature insurance markets of the United States, Britain and Australia would provide ""only moderate growth"", forcing some of them to divest ""unneeded"" foreign units.
For property-and-casualty insurers including Tokio Marine, Sompo and MS&AD, China's opening up comes as they themselves are looking to diversify geographically. They are seeking income from new markets that can help offset the impact of enhanced payouts due to a series of natural disasters hitting Japan.
As a result of the easing of foreign ownership rules in China, ""we will not rule out the possibility of M&A deals by Japanese insurers, if they are looking for earnings growth and diversification in the longer term,"" said Akane Nishizaki, associate director for insurance ratings at Fitch.

Shares in Maoyan fell as much as 3% earlier in the day, after opening near flat at HK$14.82. Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) is Maoyan’s second-largest shareholder, owning about 16.3% of the company ahead of its initial public offering.
The Tencent-backed company is China’s biggest movie-ticketing platform by sales. It raised $250 million in a smaller-than-expected IPO, and could raise up to $287 million if a greenshoe, or over-allotment option, is exercised within the first month of trade.
Maoyan had initially been looking to raise $500 million to $1 billion in its IPO, Bloomberg reported back in September. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were joint sponsors for the Maoyan listing.
“We are a company that focuses on long-term value creation. We're not worried about short-term market fluctuations,” Peter Zheng Zhihao, the Maoyan chief executive, said on Monday. “The most important thing is to create value for the industry and for our partners.”"

401,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",D-Day for Australian banks as bombshell inquiry report set for release,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian government is due to release on Monday the final recommendations of the independent inquiry that exposed systemic wrongdoing in Australia's financial sector last year, likely leading to sweeping changes to the country's banking industry.
The big banks, insurers, pension funds and regulators who oversee the financial industry are bracing for a brutal summary of their misdeeds and weaknesses, and a list of tough recommendations including possible criminal charges. 
The Royal Commission was a quasi-judicial independent body led by a former high court judge that was tasked by the government, reluctantly at first, with investigating financial sector misconduct following a string of banking scandals.
For 11 months its public hearings shocked the country and wiped more than A$60 billion ($43.4 billion) from top financial stocks as investors factored in the prospect of tougher regulation, higher compliance costs and thinner margins.
Regulators were also grilled by the commission's barristers about why they seemed reluctant to crack down on wrongdoing, sometimes penalizing firms with little more than a mildly worded press release.
""There will be nothing positive in the recommendations because the banks have clearly breached various obligations in the laws, and obligations to good customer service,"" said Matthew Wilson, a banking analyst at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
Among other things, analysts expect the inquiry will recommend tougher enforcement of responsible lending laws, an end to certain conflicted commissions paid to financial advisors, and limits to executive bonuses. 
In a separate but related ruling on Monday which underscored the tougher new regulatory environment, Australia's corporate watchdog ordered an arm of Commonwealth Bank of Australia to stop taking financial-advice fees due to concerns about its charging practices.
The Royal Commission's report, due for release around 0520 GMT, comes ahead of an election expected in May which opinion polls suggest the center-left Labor party will win. Labor says it expects to adopt all the commission's recommendations.
Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who initially dismissed Labor calls for a banking inquiry as a ""populist whinge"", has said he also expects to take up most of the recommendations. 
But he has warned against overreaching and cutting off credit flows, a likely battle-line for the government as it fights for electoral survival.
DAMAGE DONE
Even before the release of its final report, the inquiry has already pushed top executives out of their jobs and prompted billions of dollars of customer remediation payments.
The hardest-hit company has been financial planner AMP Ltd, which saw its CEO, chairwoman, chief lawyer and three directors leave following evidence its board allegedly doctored an independent report to a regulator.
AMP shares fell four percent to a record low on Monday and have more than halved since the inquiry began in February 2017, the biggest decline among the large institutions. The 170-year-old company, which has denied wrongdoing, issued a profit warning on Jan. 25. 
The ""Big Four"" banks - CBA, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, and National Australia Bank - plus AMP have already committed to pay more than A$2 billion to wronged customers.
Shares in the major banks edged lower in early trade on Monday before reversing to post gains of about one percent by lunchtime, helping the broader market 0.3 percent higher.
""There is growing speculation amongst traders that ... we could actually see more certainty in the sector, despite likely bad news, and that certainty will be enough to bring a bounce this week,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at stockbroker CMC Markets.

402,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>","Asia Stocks Having a ‘Bear-Market Bounce,’ JPMorgan Asset Says","(Bloomberg) -- What we’ve been witnessing in Asia and the emerging markets could just be a “bear-market bounce.”
That’s how JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management views the January rally. While Jasslyn Yeo, global market strategist at the money manager, sees the potential for more gains in the first half of the year, investors will need to reassess their positions for the second half.
Slowing economic growth globally is clouding the outlook for stocks even as a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China will help risk-on sentiment, according to Yeo. Moreover, while the Federal Reserve signaled it’s pausing its interest-rate increases, there are still higher odds of hikes than cuts, she said.
“I am not willing to back off on the whole bear-market bounce story because there are increasing downside risks to growth,” she said in an interview Friday. Her firm managed $1.71 trillion of assets as of September. But the rebound could last only in the first half of this year because “we are in such a late stage of the cycle and recession risks have increased,” she said about the U.S. economy.
With a 6.8 percent rally in January, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index had its best start to a year since 2012. The benchmark gauge for emerging-market equities climbed even more, 8.7 percent. Both are still marred in bear markets.
While Yeo didn’t provide any stock-market estimates, she said she remains bullish on Asian shares excluding Japan and emerging markets in general for the first half of the year. Her reasoning: There’s a higher chance of a U.S.-China trade agreement this time around as President Donald Trump faces a reelection bid in 2020 and the world’s second-biggest economy is slowing. Trump said he may meet soon with his Chinese counterpart to finalize details of a deal.

LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Nissan has scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain and will produce it solely in Japan, warning two months before Brexit that uncertainty over Britain's departure was making it harder to plan for the future.
Falling demand for diesel cars in Europe has forced Nissan to invest in other technologies and save costs. It cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland factory in the north of England, Britain's biggest car plant, last year as output slumped 11 percent, hit by levies and crackdowns on diesel. 
""Nissan has increased its investments in new powertrains and technology for its future European vehicles,"" the firm said. ""Therefore the company has decided to optimize its investments in Europe by consolidating X-Trail production in Kyushu.""
""While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,"" said Nissan Europe Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy.
Britain's business minister Greg Clark said the announcement was a ""blow to the sector and the region."" 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29. Lawmakers last month rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, heightening fears of a disorderly no-deal Brexit and of new trade barriers. May said on Sunday she would seek a ""pragmatic solution"".
In a letter to workers, de Ficchy said Nissan has a task force that reports to him and is ""considering all of the possible scenarios and the potential impact on the business.""
Nissan builds roughly 30 percent of the country's 1.52 million cars and exports the vast majority to the continent
It said four months after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 that it would manufacture the new X-Trail in Britain - a major vote of confidence in the country and May, shortly after she took office. 
A source told Reuters at the time that Nissan received a letter from the government promising extra support in the event that Brexit hit the competitiveness of the Sunderland plant. 
According to the Sunday Times newspaper, ministers are now considering whether to withdraw a 60 million pounds ($78.46 million) package of support for the company.
""This kind of support package to help in areas such as training and skills is typical across the industry. Clearly we will be reviewing it in the light of this decision,"" a government source told the newspaper. 
The new X-Trail could have created hundreds of jobs.
The carmaker's planned investment in the next-generation Juke and Qashqai models, which was also announced in 2016, was unaffected, Nissan said on Sunday. 
The announcement came just two days after an EU-Japan free trade agreement kicked in, which includes the European Union's commitment to removing tariffs of 10 percent on imported Japanese cars.
Many Japanese companies had long seen Britain as the gateway to Europe, after being encouraged to open factories in the country by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Brexit has thrown that into doubt, prompting consternation in Tokyo. 
Sunday's announcement also came as the carmaker continues to deal with the fallout from the arrest of its former boss Carlos Ghosn, which has clouded the outlook for the automaking alliance between Nissan,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi.

The Japanese automaker cited ongoing doubts about the U.K.’s split from the European Union in its decision to scrap plans to build a new vehicle model in the country. May’s government had previously gone out on a limb to safeguard Nissan’s investment in the U.K., offering assurances in a private letter.
“We appreciate this will be disappointing for our U.K. team and partners,” Nissan Europe Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy said in a statement on Sunday. “The continued uncertainty around the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future.”
Business Secretary Greg Clark described Nissan’s decision as “a blow to the sector and the region.” U.K. ministers are considering withdrawing a 60 million-pound ($78 million) support package for Nissan, the Times reported, citing an unnamed government official.
As time runs short to secure a Brexit deal, May’s expected to return to Brussels within days in an attempt to rewrite the most difficult chapter in the agreement she drafted with the EU last year -- on the Irish border backstop plan.
Radical Demands
May is seeking a seemingly impossible compromise between the minimal changes that Brussels says it will consider, and the radical rewrite that euro-skeptics in her Conservative Party are demanding.
On Monday the premier will launch a new government working group intended to unite the feuding pro- and anti-Brexit factions within the party, according to May’s office. The body will explore “alternative arrangements” for avoiding a hard border with Ireland, after Parliament voted to reject the so-called backstop plan last week.
Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the technology already exists to replace the proposed backstop, which critics fear would tie the U.K. into the EU’s customs rules indefinitely.
‘Fact-Checking’
Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Javid said border enforcement officials told him currently available technological systems mean there’s no need for checkpoints and other infrastructure on the U.K.’s land border with Ireland after Brexit.
But one of the EU’s most senior Brexit officials slapped down the idea in a tweet that she said was “fact-checking” British policy. “Can technology solve the Irish border problem?” Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, wrote on Sunday. “Short answer: not in the next few years.”
There’s no sign that the standoff will end soon, whatever the cost for businesses. The government expects negotiations to go down to the wire, leaving the threat of a chaotic no-deal split that casts a shadow over companies right up to next month’s deadline.
“It’s inevitable that in these types of negotiations things do get decided close to the last minute -- that’s when the maximum political pressure is,” Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told BBC Radio 5 Live.
Truss insisted that the “threat of no deal” must be maintained to get the EU “on board,” and also because it’s already helping to bring Parliament closer to a consensus.
Her comments suggest the final eight weeks until March 29 -- the U.K.’s scheduled exit day -- will be fraught with tension.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>",Swine fever outbreak may bury China's small pig farmers,"By Hallie Gu and Ryan Woo
CHANGTU COUNTY, China (Reuters) - For farmers Zhang Shiping and Bai Fuqin in northeast China, there is little to celebrate this Lunar New Year. 
Since African swine fever struck a farm in nearby Shenyang city last August, the couple has racked up about 300,000 yuan ($44,712.72) in debt, 10 times what they make in a good year raising pigs. 
The incurable disease has since traveled thousands of kilometers, striking mainly small farms in the world's biggest pork-producing country and triggering unprecedented upheaval in China's $1 trillion hog sector.
Though Zhang's farm was not infected, measures to halt its spread have effectively killed his family's livelihood.
Beijing banned the transport of live pigs from infected provinces in September, part of its ""protracted war"" on a disease that typically takes years to eradicate.
The restrictions crippled trade, particularly in northeast Liaoning province, which produces about a third more pigs than it consumes and relies heavily on exporting.
Prices in the province dropped below 4 yuan per kilogram this month - the lowest price in a decade - just weeks away from the Lunar New Year holiday, normally a time of peak pork demand.
Zhang and Bai got rid of about 30 pigs this month, losing about 800 yuan on each, after feeding them months after they should have been slaughtered while waiting for prices to pick up.
They still have almost 50 left, now so overweight and fatty that no processors want them.
""We can barely survive,"" Bai said during an interview at her modest farmhouse in Changtu county, a two-and-a-half-hour drive north of Shenyang, capital of Liaoning. 
Bai and three other farmers in Changtu said they would not continue raising pigs, even though they have few other options in the region, one of China's slowest growing.
Tens of thousands like them are expected to abandon pig farming after months of weak prices and restrictions on moving pigs to market. That will reduce production in the country by one-fifth this year, according to some estimates, and boost prices and demand for cheaper imports.
""I have experienced all kinds of ups and downs in the pig industry. But nothing has been as hard and bitter as this year,"" said Sun Hongbo, another Changtu farmer.
He will quit pig farming for good, he added, seeking manual work after the holiday.
Graphic: China pig farming structure in 2016 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CM4uHb
NO SUPPORT 
Small farmers producing fewer than 500 pigs for slaughter each year account for about 40 percent of China's output, or around 280 million pigs a year, according to 2016 figures from consultants at Rabobank. 
But the African swine fever epidemic looks set to accelerate change in an industry already shifting towards more industrialized farms, particularly in the north. 
""Even if you want to raise pigs, the government won't give you loans because you lost money. Feed sellers won't lend you feed either. How can you raise pigs then?"" Sun said.
Policy measures put in place to tackle African swine fever strongly favor larger farms considered better able to prevent the spread of disease with higher hygiene standards. A Dec. 27 government document that loosened the rules on transporting pigs out of infected counties only applied to incorporated farms.
Another rule has outlawed the use of kitchen waste for pig feed, significantly boosting costs for many farmers who can't buy commercial feed at reasonable cost.
""The government won't encourage small farmers to raise pigs, that's the direction,"" said Wang Chuduan, professor at China Agriculture University.
It's a sharp reversal from the years following the 2007 Blue Ear epidemic, which cut production by an estimated 10 percent. After that, Beijing gave generous subsidies to all farmers to replenish their herds, said Wang.
Corporate farmers like Muyuan Foods Co. Ltd and Wens Foodstuff Group Co Ltd are suffering too, reporting a sharp plunge in profits last year. But with large, efficient farms and access to loans, they are able to ride out the tough times.
RURAL BURDEN
Beijing has repeatedly called for the scaling up and industrialization of farming to raise efficiency and quality. For China's livestock industry, consolidating around more efficient producers is good, Wang said.
For some regions, however, it could bring an additional burden, just as the country's growth slows to its weakest pace in 28 years.
Pig production in China's northeast has expanded rapidly in recent years as Beijing sought to move its livestock away from heavily populated regions and closer to grain production in the north, bringing a much-needed source of revenue to laggard local economies.
Changtu, with about 1 million people, produced 1.6 million pigs in 2016 and 2.66 million tonnes of corn, positioning it to benefit under that policy. 
But swine fever looks set to halt, or even reverse, the trend. Liaoning's GDP grew 5.7 percent in 2018, well below its target that year.
""I think the expansion roadmap will be different in the next few years; there'll be less investment in the northeast,"" said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at Rabobank.
Agriculture minister Han Changfu said this week the government would work to reduce the impact of the epidemic on other areas of the economy and society.
Changtu farmers said they had seen no sign of government support. A county official said the local government had poured so much money and resources into preventing and controlling African swine fever that it risked bankrupting the county.
He declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. But he added that declining pig production in the county would hurt local revenue.
The Changtu farmers have few options. Bai, who is illiterate, said after the holiday - which welcomes the Year of the Pig - she would look for work washing dishes in the city.
""The pig cycle has never really brought me down, but then the policy did,"" said Zhang Haitao, another farmer struggling to get rid of his overweight pigs.

Nissan first said four months after Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the EU that it would manufacture a new model of the SUV in Britain, which was seen as a major vote of confidence in the country's manufacturing future.
The main production plant for the current X-Trail is in Japan, while Nissan's plant in Sunderland, northeast England, makes the smaller Qashqai SUV and other models.
""Precise details of Nissan's impending announcement were unclear this weekend, but sources said it was likely to initially involve abandoning the X-Trail production plans which had been announced in the autumn of 2016,"" Sky reported.
A UK-based spokesman for Nissan declined to comment.
Sky said the announcement due on Monday was not expected to lead to immediate job losses at the Sunderland plant, as the X-Trail is not currently made there, but would raise doubts about further Nissan investment in Britain.
As well as the X-Trail, Nissan said in 2016 it would build the next generation Qashqai SUV in Britain after receiving government assurances over Brexit, in what was seen at the time as a boost for Prime Minister Theresa May.
However, the failure of Britain's government so far to negotiate a smooth exit plan from the European Union has made car manufacturers less willing to use Britain as a European manufacturing center.
Investment in Britain's car industry halved last year, data showed on Thursday, and car production by Nissan in Britain fell by more than 10 percent.

Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said leaving the EU on March 29 without a transition deal to preserve the smooth flow of parts and finished vehicles across EU borders would cause ""permanent devastation"" to the British car industry.

417,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"1. Fed's Dovish Tilt to Make Earnings Great Again? 
In the unpredictability of the busiest week of corporate earnings, the strength of the dollar was singled out as the cartoon villain holding back growth.
But dollar strength may be on borrowed time after the Fed's dovish tilt.
""With the Fed on hold, pressure on the USD to retreat broadly from still-expensive levels is likely to persist,"" BNP Paris said in a note earlier this week.
It’s not hard to see that a stronger dollar rains on the earnings parade, with roughly half of S&P 500 companies' revenues coming from overseas.
The relative strength of the U.S. dollar not only makes products more expensive in many parts of the world, reducing their competitiveness, but also creates currency translation headwinds.
The impact of a stronger dollar played out in various quarterly results this past week, none more so than heavy-equipment maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT). It pinned blame for slowing revenue on ""currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar."" The equipment maker generated 51% of revenue in the fourth quarter from overseas.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, served up an apt recount of how a strong dollar hurt performance.
""In Turkey, for example, the lira depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018 and in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call.
The weaker dollar may not be the panacea for all woes, but it does plot a course for a sunnier outlook.
2. McDonald's Deals Aren’t Bringing in the Diners
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) shares took a tumble on Wednesday when the iconic fast-food chain reported quarterly results. While global sales were strong, investors were unhappy that U.S. comparable sales rose 2.3%, below the Wall Street forecast of 2.4%.
But what investors may have missed -- and what is concerning for the stock -- is that the number of customers going to McDonald’s fell 2.2% last year.
A decline in comparable guests counts came as the company shuttered another 122 restaurants in 2018 (hat tip Jonathan Maze of Restaurant Business Magazine), bringing its U.S. store count to 13,914, below that of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).



This may look like just evidence of McDonald’s getting leaner and focusing on stores that can easily adapt to kiosks and other technology initiatives. But a key strategy of McDonald’s has been to use promotions to drive guest count higher.
Those promotions (large discounts like the Dollar Menu and meal deals) have sparked a backlash from franchise operators who are feeling margin pressure. And by the looks of the 2018 traffic numbers, the strategy simply hasn’t worked.
Franchise owners, who control more than 90% of the global total of about 37,000 restaurants, have made their concerns known.
In the U.S. an advocacy group called the National Owners Association had a meeting last month in Dallas with more than 1,200 franchise owners in attendance.
In addition to calling for more owner control of menu pricing, the association has raised strong objections to company demands for what McDonald’s calls a service area modernization (SAM) wall between the cashiers and the kitchen, seen as another financial burden imposed on the operators.
3. No Powell Put? How About a Shale Put
This week Fed Chief Jerome Powell denied the existence of a Powell Put, a theory that the central bank will ensure equities don’t suffer too much from rate hikes, even if stricter tightening is required.
But the oil market saw a different option-analogy postulated last week, as a rally powered by Saudi crude export cuts, sanctions on Venezuelan oil and steady interest rates continued.
As U.S. crude futures hit 10-week highs on Thursday, the market was abruptly cut down by the data showing U.S. oil production hit a record 12 million barrels per day -- two months ahead of expectations.
You could call that the Shale Put, where every time OPEC cuts, shale “intervenes” to push the market back towards oversupply.
Thursday’s domestic oil production estimates from the Energy Information Administration indicate that OPEC will find it exceedingly difficult to shake its shale nemesis and cartel members will be looking over their shoulders for output surprises from the Permian to Bakken basins.
Of course, any spike in U.S. crude output would be foretold by a surging rig count.
To the relief of oil bulls, the closely-watched U.S. oil rig count by Baker Hughes showed a drop of 15 in the just-ended week. The rig reading has been volatile lately, rising by 10 and falling by 21 in the previous two weeks. But the price-sensitive barometer could move into a rising trend if U.S. crude prices advance north of $55 through February."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court asked pointed questions of the Federal Communication Commission on Friday in hearing a challenge to whether the Trump administration acted legally when it repealed landmark net neutrality rules governing internet providers in December 2017.
The panel heard more than four hours of arguments in the first court hearing on the FCC's controversial decision to reverse the Obama administration's 2015 rules, which barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization.
The arguments focused on how internet providers should be classified under law - either as information service providers as the Trump administration decided or as a public utility, which subjects companies to more rigorous regulations - and whether the FCC adhered to procedural rules in dismantling the Obama-era rules.
""We are creating rules that are built to last,"" FCC general counsel Tom Johnson told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Judge Patricia Millett repeatedly pressed Johnson over the FCC's legal basis for treating telephone calls differently than internet traffic and asked if the FCC had properly considered the public safety impacts.
Millett raised the example of police needing to send urgent photos or video of a suspect that could be delayed if some internet traffic was prioritized.
""We can't anticipate all harms,"" Johnson said. As he sought to play down the concern Millett interjected: ""There's no evidence because they haven't done it yet.""
In its 2017 decision the Republican-led FCC voted 3-2 along party lines to reverse the net neutrality rules. The agency gave providers sweeping power to recast how users access the internet but said they must disclose any changes in users’ internet access. 
The appeals panel is made up of Judges Millet and Robert Wilkins, two appointees of Democratic former President Barack Obama, and Stephen Williams (NYSE:WMB), an appointee of Republican Ronald Reagan.
CHALLENGE FROM STATES, COMPANIES
A group of 22 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia asked the appeals court to reinstate the Obama-era internet rules and to block the FCC’s effort to pre-empt states from imposing their own rules guaranteeing an open internet.
Several internet companies are also part of the legal challenge, including Mozilla Corp, Vimeo Inc and Etsy Inc (ETSY.O), as well as numerous media and technology advocacy groups and major cities, including New York and San Francisco.
The challengers also got difficult questions about their legal rationale for seeking reinstatement of the rules.
Kevin Russell, a lawyer for the challengers, said hypothetically an internet provider could now block the Daily Caller website or graphic animal abuse videos as long as they disclosed it.
""We never get a straight answer from the commission whether it thinks blocking and throttling must always be prohibited"" or only if it applies to punishing a competitor, Russell said, arguing that the FCC failed to engage in a reasoned analysis and did not properly assess consumer complaints.
Johnson conceded that providers could block or throttle traffic under the FCC rules but said it was unlikely. He said the Federal Trade Commission could take action against anticompetitive conduct.
Millett suggested that under the rules that providers would be free to block pro-Nazi websites or other objectionable content without facing antitrust issues.
The FCC repeal was a win for providers like Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), but was opposed by internet companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Major providers have not made any changes in how Americans access the internet since the repeal.
In October, California agreed not to enforce its own state net neutrality law until the appeals court’s decision on the 2017 repeal, and any potential review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

A decision is expected by this summer.

The bank also introduced a new forfeiture provision in its annual compensation plans for both its most senior executives, current Chief Executive David Solomon and former head Blankfein, relating to the ongoing 1MDB proceedings.
The move underscores the perils the 1MDB scandal still holds for Goldman, which is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion (£5 billion) for 1Malaysia Development Berhad.
The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing.
The company said in a regulatory filing on Friday that its board can reduce pay packages of top executives if it is later determined that the results of the ongoing investigations related to the 1MDB proceedings would have impacted their year end compensation decisions.
The Wall Street bank also said it paid Solomon $23 million in total compensation in 2018, a 9.5 percent jump from his 2017 compensation.

Blankfein received $20.5 million in annual compensation in 2018, down $3.5 million from 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. agency that insures worker pensions sought permission on Friday to take over two underfunded Sears Holdings Corp pension plans, after objecting to Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's proposed $5.2 billion buyout of the bankrupt retailer.
In a complaint filed in Chicago federal court, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp asked to be named trustee of the pension plans, which it said are underfunded by $1.4 billion and cover about 90,000 Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.
The PBGC also asked that the plans be terminated as of Jan. 31, 2019.
Friday's request came six days after the PBGC objected to the takeover of Sears by Lampert's hedge fund ESL Investments, which had won an auction for the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer last month.
In a filing with the White Plains, New York court overseeing Sears' Chapter 11 case, the PBGC said Lampert's proposal would strip its rights in trademarks and licensing royalties from the DieHard and Kenmore brands.
That would ""intentionally undermine PBGC's statutory and contractual pension plan protections,"" the agency said.
A spokesman for Sears declined to comment.
In a bankruptcy court filing on Friday, ESL said the PBGC ""misread"" the buyout terms and its objection should be rejected.
Created in 1974, the PBGC uses employer insurance premiums, investment earnings and other funds to pay retiree benefits.
Sears, founded 126 years ago, filed for bankruptcy in October after a prolonged decline marked by too much debt, scant investment and lost market share to retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The proposed ESL takeover calls for 425 Sears and Kmart stores to remain open and 45,000 workers to keep their jobs, but has drawn objections from a committee of unsecured creditors.
ESL on Friday urged U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain to reject those objections.
""The question before the court is whether the debtors exercised sound business judgment in approving the proposed sale,"" ESL said, referring to bankrupt Sears entities. ""The record abundantly demonstrates that they did.""
The next hearing is set for Monday morning.

The PBGC case is Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp v Sears Holdings Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-00669. The bankruptcy case is In re: Sears Holdings Corp et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-23538.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) executives met this week with Ohio's two senators and other lawmakers on Capitol Hill after African American employees sued the automaker accusing it of allowing a racially hostile work atmosphere.
The lawsuits, which were first filed in April, got wide attention after CNN reported on them in last month.
The suits said numerous nooses were found in 2017 at a GM plant in Toledo that makes transmissions and listed other conduct, including drawings of stick figures on bathroom walls with nooses around their necks and that racially-charged comments were directed at black employees.
Alicia Boler Davis, GM's executive vice president for global manufacturing, and Gerald Johnson, vice president for GM's North America Manufacturing and Labor Relations, met on Tuesday with Ohio Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown and held meetings with other lawmakers, the senators' offices confirmed on Friday.
Brown and Portman had written to GM last month seeking answers to additional questions about the racism allegations at the plant.
Johnson, in a statement, said he was ""outraged that any of our employees would be subjected to harassment.""
""My heart goes out to anyone touched by this bigotry. GM’s stand is clear: We have zero tolerance for racist or discriminatory behavior. This behavior is unacceptable and we’re going to drive it out of the workplace,"" the statement said.
Brown said the senators met jointly with GM ""to share our outrage about the pattern of racist incidents reported by workers at the Toledo Powertrain plant. We expressed our disgust that the racist behavior went unaddressed for more than a year.""
Portman spokeswoman Emily Benavides said Portman ""made clear that GM must address this issue more forcefully and do so very quickly.... The fact that it is still going on at the GM plant in Toledo is outrageous and unacceptable.""
The suit alleges that GM failed to take ""prompt corrective action"" at the plant with 1,700 employees, creating ""an atmosphere whereby the hate-driven employees felt free to hang nooses, display racist graffiti, and verbally attack and racially insult African-Americans.""
A GM spokeswoman confirmed the previously unreported meetings with lawmakers.

GM also said it referred the issue to police to investigate and that after its own investigation it disciplined some employees and fired others, but did not identify how many personnel were impacted.

Reuters reported that Foxconn was reconsidering making liquid crystal display panels at a planned $10 billion Wisconsin campus and intended to hire mostly engineers and researchers there. But after conversations between Trump and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou, the company said it would move ""forward with our planned construction of a Gen 6 fab facility,"" which is a type of plant that produces displays. 
The 20-million-square-foot campus marked the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history when it was announced at a White House ceremony in 2017. It was praised by Trump as proof of his ability to revive American manufacturing. The apparent reversal was seized upon by Democrats in Congress this week.
Trump tweeted on Friday: ""Great news on Foxconn in Wisconsin after my conversation with Terry Gou!""
Heavily criticized in some quarters, the Foxconn project was championed by Wisconsin's then governor, Scott Walker, a Republican who helped secure around $4 billion in tax breaks and other incentives before leaving office. Critics called the deal a corporate giveaway that would never result in the promised manufacturing jobs and said it posed serious environmental risks.
Foxconn initially planned to manufacture advanced large-screen displays for TVs and other consumer and professional products at the facility, which is under construction. It later said it would build smaller Generation 6 LCD screens instead.
In comments published on Wednesday, Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn's Gou, told Reuters those plans might be scaled back or even shelved, citing the steep cost of making advanced TV screens in the United States, where labor expenses are comparatively high.
After the Reuters report, Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), issued a statement confirming the global market environment that existed when the project was first announced had changed and “necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin.""
By Friday the company shifted again. The ""campus will serve both as an advanced manufacturing facility as well as a hub of high technology innovation for the region,"" Foxconn said in a statement. The statement did not reiterate its commitment to create 13,000 jobs as it did on Wednesday. 
Woo spoke with Wisconsin's new Democratic governor, Tony Evers, a past critic of the deal, on Friday, Evers told reporters. The governor's office said on Wednesday Evers' team had been ""surprised"" by Woo's comments on changing plans. 

“From what I heard today... it looks like they’re going to focus on the generation 6 technology,"" Evers said. “They made commitments and we’re going to make sure they live up to them.”

424,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 04:42PM ET</span>",Social Security expansion to get serious hearing in U.S. House,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The idea that Social Security benefits should be expanded - not cut - is going mainstream.
Until the last few years, all Washington could talk about was how to cut Social Security benefits, and by how much. But a grass-roots progressive coalition began campaigning for expansion in 2013, and the idea has since moved straight to the heart of the Democratic Party.
That was evident this week when U.S. Representative John Larson introduced his Social Security 2100 Act in the House of Representatives. The Connecticut Democrat's proposal calls for a small across-the-board bump in benefits, a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment and a higher minimum benefit for low-income workers. Larson's plan would pay for the expansion in two ways. First, it would add new payroll taxes to wages over $400,000 (currently, tax collection stops at $132,900 of annual income). The bill also would gradually phase in a higher payroll tax rate, with workers and employers each paying 7.4 percent by 2042, compared with the current rate of 6.2 percent.
This is not the first time Larson has proposed this legislation, but this year it stands a very good chance of passage in the House. The proposal had 54 co-sponsors when Larson first introduced it in 2015; now, it has more than 200 House co-sponsors - more than 85 percent of the Democratic majority. 
Larson himself is the new chairman of the Social Security subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. The new chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal, is a co-sponsor of the bill. 
    Moreover, progressive support for Social Security expansion was an important campaign plank for many successful Democratic candidates in November's midterm elections. And nearly every declared and potential Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed expansion of some type for Social Security. 
The bill is not likely to become law while Republicans control the Senate and White House. But Larson plans to hold hearings on the bill this year in Washington and around the country - the first congressional hearings focused on expansion in 50 years.
That will provide an important forum to help educate the public and could puncture many of the toxic myths that have taken hold about Social Security in recent decades. Among the most pernicious of those myths is that Social Security is headed for bankruptcy, and that benefits will not be there for young people when their retirement rolls around.
“We need to educate and unmask so many of these myths,” Larson told me in an interview. “We need to talk about why Social Security is an earned benefit and not an entitlement. Certainly it is something you are entitled to, but the word makes Social Security sound like a poverty program or a handout. Nothing roils people who have been paying into the program their entire lives more.”  
FIXING THE SHORTFALL
The myths are built on one very important kernel of truth. Social Security does face a shortfall in revenue needed to pay scheduled benefits. If Congress fails to act, Social Security benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent in 2034 - just 15 years from now. This would be a financial disaster for current and future retirees, and it would undermine trust in the program.
Larson’s bill puts Social Security back into balance over the next 75 years - the period of time the program is required by federal law to project its finances. On the benefit side, it provides an increase for all enrollees equivalent to 2 percent of the average benefit, about $30 per month. It would shift to a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment formula that is more sensitive to medical inflation and other costs disproportionately affecting seniors. The bill would also beef up the special minimum benefit paid to low-income retirees.
For higher-income seniors, the bill also includes, effectively, a benefit boost in the form of a tax cut.
Beneficiaries with higher income - usually from work, a pension or drawdowns from tax-deferred saving - often wind up paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits. 
The proportion of benefit that is taxable is determined using a formula called “provisional income” - your adjusted gross income (excluding Social Security benefits), plus non-taxable interest and half of your Social Security benefits. If your provisional income is $25,000 to $34,000 (single return) or $32,000 to $44,000 (joint return), up to 50 percent of your Social Security benefit must be counted as adjusted gross income. If your provisional income is more than $34,000 on a single return or $44,000 on a joint return, 85 percent must be added to AGI.
The Larson bill would replace those thresholds with $50,000 (single filer) and $100,000 (joint filers), and if provisional income is above those levels, up to 85 percent is counted in adjusted gross income.
Despite the bill’s strong odds in the House, the Republican-controlled Senate is not likely to take it up this year - although Larson says he is reaching out. He also has put feelers out to the White House, noting that President Donald Trump opposed cuts to Social Security during the 2016 campaign.
“I think we’re coming to some common-sense solutions,” Larson said. “Especially when one of the biggest champions of protecting Social Security is the President of the United States.”

425,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>",U.S. corporate earnings trend stokes concern about 2019 outlook,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are beating analysts' expectations this earnings season, but to a smaller degree than normal, and S&P 500 companies are now barely expected to eke out an increase in profits for the first quarter of 2019. 
The trend underscores fears about a potential decline in earnings this year, even as stocks just closed their best January in more than three decades, as the benchmark S&P 500 index rebounded from a swoon late last year.
""It does get tricky here as this quarter plays out if companies continue to see weakness. Then, there's going to be an issue and investors will become very concerned,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to be up 15.5 percent from a year ago, based on results from nearly half of the S&P 500 companies and forecasts for the rest, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, compared with about 14.5 percent three weeks ago.
That growth clip is historically strong but disappointing on two fronts. 
The rate is noticeably slower than the three earlier quarters in 2018, when the Trump administration's corporate tax cuts fueled double-digit earnings gains. Estimated profit growth for all of 2018 is at 23.6 percent, based on Refinitiv's data.
Also, given recent historical trends in earnings rates, investors might expect growth to be on track to rise even faster at this point in the reporting period.
The quarterly profit growth rate typically falls heading into a reporting period and then quickly reverses course once companies begin to report, often beating analysts' expectations.
So far this earnings season, the percentage by which companies are beating estimates for the entire S&P 500 is 2.8 percent, compared with a median of 5.4 percent over the past eight quarters, based on Refinitiv's data. 
If the index were beating estimates by the recent median, fourth-quarter profit growth would now be estimated at 17.4 percent instead of 15.5 percent, said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Refinitiv.
'LOW POINT'
The inability of the financials sector to meaningfully outdo earnings expectations is at least partly to blame for the slower-than-usual pickup in the growth rate, he said.
With results in from 66 percent of the S&P 500 financials, the sector's median earnings surprise is just 0.4 percent. That's on track to be well below the sector's 4.4 percent median surprise of the last eight quarters.
Also affecting the fourth-quarter's growth rate, profit estimates for the energy sector were still falling in recent weeks, following a 38 percent drop in U.S. oil prices in the fourth quarter, analysts said.
Oil prices have recovered somewhat this year, and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) both reported stronger-than-expected results on Friday.
At the same time, the percentage of reports beating expectations for the fourth quarter - 70.9 percent - so far is below the 78 percent average of the past four quarters, based on Refinitiv's data.
Meanwhile, estimated first-quarter profit growth has fallen to just 0.7 percent from 3.5 percent about three weeks ago, as the benefits from the tax cuts recede.
First-quarter forecasts for the energy and technology sectors have fallen the most, with analysts now expecting year-over-year energy earnings to decline 10.8 percent in the first quarter and those for technology to fall by 5.4 percent.

""On a quarterly basis, 1Q19 is emerging as the low point for growth embedded in consensus forecasts,"" Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy for RBC Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a note this week. ""Still positive, but just barely.""

426,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 04:34PM ET</span>",Ford Rides Trucks to Surprise Gain as Rivals Start Year Ice-Cold,"(Bloomberg) -- Auto sales got off to a frosty start to the year, with all major carmakers except Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. reporting weaker numbers than expected.
Ford deliveries rose about 7 percent in January, buoyed by strong demand for pickups, according to people familiar with results the company no longer makes public on a monthly basis. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). joined Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in posting bigger declines than analysts estimated in a Bloomberg News survey.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co.’s gains trailed projections, and both companies blamed the cold.
“In spite of some frigid January weather, we remain bullish on 2019 given the continued underlying strength of the U.S. economy,” Reid Bigland, Fiat Chrysler’s head of U.S. sales, said in a statement. The automaker’s only brand to grow for the month was Ram, with a 24 percent surge in truck and van deliveries.
The mostly disappointing results suggest the annualized industry sales rate may have slowed more than anticipated. Analysts had been projecting a pace of 16.9 million car and light truck deliveries for the month, compared with 17.1 million in January 2018.
“With the cold weather that’s hit, particularly this week, as well as the government shutdown that we had a little bit earlier, it has slowed things down a little bit,” Henio Arcangeli, senior vice president of automotive operations for Honda’s U.S. unit, said in a phone interview Thursday. “Our sales were very strong in the beginning of the month.”
Auto demand is likely to shrink in 2019 as borrowing costs rise and make it tougher for consumers to afford ever-costlier new vehicles. The average interest rate on new cars jumped to 6.2 percent last month, from 5 percent a year ago, according to car-buying researcher Edmunds.
Surging sales of sport utility vehicles and trucks more than made up for a 1.7 percent decline in passenger cars at Ford, said three people familiar with company’s results. GM suffered a hangover from a December sales promotion, the people said. The company also dialed back on rebates more than other automakers, according to Jim Cain, a GM spokesman.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated total sales declines of 1.5 percent for Ford and 3.7 percent for GM.
Many carmakers cut back on incentives in January after attractive year-end promotions, so a decline was bound to happen, said Mark Wakefield, who’s based in Detroit and is the head of consultant AlixPartners’ automotive practice.
The red-hot Jeep brand had its first monthly drop since December 2017. Parent Fiat Chrysler cited freezing-cold conditions in the Midwest and Northeast.
“In contrast to previous months when Jeep was the champ, Ram saved the day,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.
Fiat Chrysler put up weaker-than-expected numbers despite selling 50 percent more vehicles to fleet customers in the month. About 23 percent of the company’s January deliveries went to fleets, up from a 16 percent share a year ago.
Nissan was undermined by a 40 percent plunge in sales of Altima sedans. That’s a bad omen for auto executives who’ve said passenger cars may be bottoming out after falling to a record-low 30 percent share of the market last year.
Chilling temperatures and a push to pare back on deliveries to fleets were factors in Nissan’s drop, according to Billy Hayes, a division vice president for the company’s North American unit.
“We had many stores either completely shut or working with a skeleton crew or skeleton hours,” Hayes said. “There’s no doubt the weather had an impact.”

430,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 04:24PM ET</span>","Toyota, Fiat report fall in U.S. auto sales in January","(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday reported a 6.6 percent fall in U.S. vehicle sales for January, hurt by lower demand for its Camry and Prius cars.
The No.3 automaker in the United States by sales said it sold 156,021 vehicles in January, down from 167,056 vehicles a year earlier. Camry sales fell 3.4 percent, while Prius sales slumped 57 percent, the company said.
Auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast January auto sales to decline about 1 percent from the same month in 2018, partly due to uncertainty over the recent government shutdown.
The auto consultants also forecast total light vehicle sales this year to fall 1.9 percent to about 17 million units, compared with 2018.
However, major automakers are bullish about 2019 sales even as economists warned that rising interest rates may discourage consumers from buying cars this year.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co , the two big automakers that together commanded a 32 percent market share in 2018, have stopped reporting monthly sales numbers, opting to report on a quarterly basis.
Bloomberg, however, reported late on Friday that Ford's sales rose 7 percent, while GM's fell 7 percent in January, citing people familiar with the matter. GM declined to comment, while Ford was unavailable for comment.
Smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reported a 2 percent rise in U.S. auto sales for January, helped by higher demand for its Ram pickup trucks and said it expects strong sales in 2019.
""In spite of some frigid January weather, we remain bullish on 2019 given the continued underlying strength of the U.S. economy,"" Reid Bigland, Fiat's U.S. head of sales, said.
Fiat said it sold 136,082 vehicles last month, compared with 132,803 units for the same period a year earlier.

Sales of Ram pickup trucks surged 24 percent to 39,649 vehicles in January, compared with the same period a year earlier.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Delta trying to unload East Coast refinery - sources,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) wants to sell its oil refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, after attempts to offer a partial stake in the plant late last year failed, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The Atlanta-based airline hired investment banks last year to organize the sale of a stake in its Monroe Energy refining subsidiary, signaling it wanted to share the risk of running an energy business.
The offer failed to attract sufficient interest because a refinery on the East Coast is viewed as an undesirable asset given the rising costs of acquiring crude oil.
The airline, the largest in the United States by market capitalization, now wants to sell the entire plant with an eye toward finding a buyer that would agree to a long-term contract with Delta to buy the plant's jet fuel, the sources said. 
Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant declined to comment on the potential sale and shift in strategy, but pointed to comments made by chief financial officer Paul Jacobson last month when asked for an update on the search for a partner in Monroe Energy.
""We have continued with that process and have received some interest in having discussions with parties. There's no update on the strategy broadly as we articulated,"" Jacobson said in a January 15 earnings call.
""We're looking for ways to enhance the value and the strategic value to Delta of the refinery through a partnership and those discussions can be complicated,"" he said. 
The airline acquired the 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in 2012 for $150 million in a bet that it could lower its cost of jet fuel, among the highest expenses for any airline. The refinery also makes gasoline and diesel for profit.
The U.S refining industry has been consolidating into larger players that can use scale to lower their cost of buying raw materials and paying for regular overhauls. This week, oil giant  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) announced plans to buy a small Gulf Coast refinery to increase its crude processing capabilities. 
Four refineries on the U.S. East Coast have closed in the past decade. East Coast refiners got a lifeline for a few years from the Bakken shale boom in North Dakota earlier this decade when high production forced producers to offer them steep discounts.
The discounts have vanished in recent years as more pipeline capacity came online, however, reverting to the poor economics that hurt East Coast refiners a few years earlier.
Delta has argued that keeping the refinery open by buying it was crucial. It said jet fuel prices would have risen across the Northeast if the facility had closed, hurting the airline’s results.

More recently Delta has run the plant like a traditional refinery, choosing to make more of whatever refined product offered the highest margin.

But Amazon's tumble back into bear-market territory kept a lid on gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.26%. The S&P 500 closed flat while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq also finished higher for a sixth straight week, and the S&P 500's weekly gain was its fifth in six weeks.
The U.S. economy created 304,000 jobs in January, up from 222,000 the prior month. That was above economists' forecast of 165,000 and comes after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which seemingly had a muted impact on job growth.
Wage growth, meanwhile, slowed to 0.1%, below expectations for a 0.3% rise, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher to 4% from 3.9% in December.
But that did little sour to sentiment on stocks even as analysts said further signs of underlying strength in the economy could prompt the Fed to back away from its current wait-and-see approach concerning rate hikes.
""If the Fed keeps getting solid macro reports like this and escapes geopolitical risks into a March timeframe intact then the Powell put could well be struck down,"" Scotiabank said.
The strong jobs report helped limit the impact from weakness in consumer discretionary stocks, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Amazon fell back into bear-market territory after falling 5.4% on Friday as its upbeat fourth-quarter results was undone by concerns raised during its earnings call with investors. A bear market is usually defined as a 20% from a recent high. In late December, the shares were down as much as 36% from their 52-week high. Gains since Dec. 24 had trimmed the decline to less than 20% on Wednesday. The shares are now down 20.7%.
The e-commerce giant said it would likely increase investment in 2019 and raised concerns about new regulation in India.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), best known for its UGG brand, posted earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, and ramped up its share buyback program. Its shares surged 10.5%.
The energy sector, meanwhile, served up impressive gains as oil prices settled sharply higher following a fall in rig counts and signs that U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports have trimmed supply.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: China buys U.S. soybeans a day after trade talks - traders,"By Karl Plume
(Reuters) - Chinese state-owned firms bought at least 1 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans on Friday, a day after high-level bilateral talks yielded progress toward a trade deal and a Chinese commitment to buy more U.S. soybeans.
The purchases are slated for shipment between April and July, with a large share expected from U.S. Gulf Coast export terminals, three traders with knowledge of the deals said.
One trader with direct knowledge of the deals said total purchases were around 2.2 million tonnes. The other two traders said the sales were similar to three recent waves of buying in which state-owned firms booked 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes of soybeans.
U.S. soybean futures  rallied to multi-month highs on Friday on news of renewed demand from the world's top importer.
But the market's gains were restrained by worries that Chinese purchases will hardly dent massive soybean stockpiles in the United States and around the world. The looming harvest of a large soy crop in Brazil, the world's top supplier, further capped prices.
""It certainly is good to see some concessions and more buying interest from China, but this is a concession in terms of a larger trade agreement. Brazilian offers are cheaper than we are so it's just part of the negotiation,"" said Terry Linn, analyst with Chicago-based brokerage Linn & Associates.
Friday's purchases by state-owned firms were believed to be destined for China's state reserves, and thus immune from high import tariffs on U.S. beans. The 25 percent tariffs, imposed last summer in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, remain in place for U.S. soy imports by commercial crushers in China.
Exports to China have plummeted this season during a bitter trade dispute, with swelling supplies sending prices to near decade lows last autumn and U.S. farmers struggling to turn a profit.
China has been buying most of its soybeans from Brazil, which is in pace to harvest a bumper crop in the coming months.
Friday's sales bring China's total purchases of the 2018 U.S. soybean harvest to at least 6.5 million tonnes, a fraction of its traditional annual haul from the United States of more than 30 million tonnes.
Through January of 2017, more than 29.4 million tonnes of that season's harvest had already been shipped to China, with another 4 million tonnes sold and awaiting shipment, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
Benchmark Chicago Board of Trade March futures climbed to $9.31-1/4 a bushel on Friday, the highest point for a most actively traded soy contract  since mid-June. Beijing slapped steep tariffs on U.S. soybeans on July 6, effectively halting all U.S. shipments to their top customer.
Before Friday's sales, China had previously booked an estimated 5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in three waves of purchases since U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a trade war detente on Dec. 1.

After high-level trade talks in Washington this week, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He announced on Thursday China would buy an additional 5 million tonnes.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 03:19PM ET</span>","Exxon, Chevron fourth-quarter profits lifted by U.S. shale gains","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), two of the world's largest oil producers, on Friday posted improved quarterly earnings that benefited from double-digit percentage increases in production from the top U.S. shale field.
Shares of both companies rose about 3 percent.
The two U.S. oil majors missed the first stage of the shale boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and have been investing billions of dollars to make up for lost time. They are betting their size and other businesses offer advantages smaller producers cannot duplicate.
Combined, the two companies pumped 677,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in the shale field last quarter, close to a fifth of the region's total oil production, according to figures released on Friday.
Exxon said its fourth-quarter Permian production was 300,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 93 percent from a year ago and up 12 percent over the third quarter. Chevron's output in the Permian jumped to 377,000 barrels per day, up 84 percent from the same period a year earlier.
""In just two years we have doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs, and more than doubled our production,"" Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said on an earnings call.
Both companies are tying their shale operations to logistics and refining arms that independents do not have. 
“We’re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,"" Exxon CEO Darren Woods said on an earnings call, noting the company's close coupling of pipeline, logistics and oil refining operations to shale.
In nine of the previous 10 quarters Exxon's overall oil and gas output dropped, but its fourth-quarter production edged up to just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 3.9 million in the year-ago period.
Production at Exxon, the nation's largest oil and gas producer, was ""very strong,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
The Permian, now producing 3.85 million barrels per day, is forecast to generate 5.4 million barrels per day by 2023, greater than any single OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit.
Shale fields' fast payoff is lifting both companies' earnings and cash flow. Chevron generated $9.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, up from $8.0 billion a year earlier. Its 2019 capital spending budget is going toward projects that can deliver cash within two years, Wirth said. 
Exxon, in addition to shale, continues to invest heavily in major refining, chemical and offshore projects. 
That has not sat well with some investors. Its stock is off 13 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. Exxon is the only international oil company ""not currently repurchasing shares,"" Simmons Energy said in a note.
Exxon shares were up 3.03 percent at $75.50 in afternoon trading, and Chevron shares were up 3.04 percent at $118.13.
Exxon's fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago, when results benefited substantially from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impacts of tax reform and asset impairments, earnings rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago.

Chevron reported a quarterly profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Friday, as optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a weaker-than-expected outlook from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that battered retail stocks.
The online retail heavyweight fell 5.3 percent after its quarterly sales forecast fell short of Wall Street estimates, overshadowing its record sales and profit during the holiday season.
Those results put the Nasdaq in negative territory, while retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Kohl's Corp dropped more than 2 percent and Macy's Inc fell 1.7 percent. The S&P consumer discretionary index fell 1.8 percent.
A U.S. Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018 and beating economists' expectations for an increase of 165,000.
That report, along with better-than-expected ISM manufacturing activity numbers for January, pointed to underlying strength in the economy despite an uncertain outlook that has left the Federal Reserve wary about more interest rate hikes this year.
“What the unemployment report is telling you is that people want to go back to work,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GlobAlt Investments in Atlanta. “The consumer needs to be strong, and if the consumer is employed, the consumer will stay strong.”
Even as the United States remains on a steady footing, investors are concerned that a slowdown overseas could hurt profit growth, with high-profile companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) warning of slowing demand in China.
Data showed China's manufacturing sector shrank for the second straight month in January, heightening risks for global growth amid a trade war with United States.
At 2:14 p.m. ET (1914 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.15 percent at 25,037.53 points, while the S&P 500 had lost 0.06 percent to 2,702.38.

 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) jumped more than 3 percent after the oil majors reported better-than-expected quarterly profits, boosting the Dow Jones industrial index.
The S&P energy index rallied 1.78 percent, also helped by higher oil prices. 
 Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) fell 2.4 percent after the health insurer forecast 2019 revenue and earnings below estimates.
The S&P real estate index dropped 1.3 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.30-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 02:19PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Qatar, Exxon to proceed with $10 billion Texas LNG project - sources","By Ron Bousso and Jessica Resnick-Ault
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with a $10 billion project that will expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Texas, three people familiar with the transaction said. 
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), the third partner in the existing import terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake and does not plan to participate in the expansion, the people said. 
LNG demand is soaring. Worldwide consumption of the fuel is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. 
Golden Pass LNG began as a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas able to handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day. 
However, as U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, the demand for export capacity has increased. The potential $10 billion expansion, first announced in 2014, would focus on this new market dynamic. 
It is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest some $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint.
The most likely buyer for ConocoPhillips' stake is Exxon Mobil, two of the people said, adding that the existing partners do not want to bring in another participant, as plans for the project are in advanced stages. 
Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in the LNG export project, and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. 
Exxon expects this year to ""sanction"" the Golden Pass export terminal and another LNG project in Mozambique, Chief Executive Darren Woods said Friday on a conference call with analysts. 
The company has been ""working very closely with QP (Qatar Petroleum), our partner in Golden Pass, to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term,"" Woods said.
Qatar was the world's largest LNG producer in 2017 and has annual output of 77 million tonnes. 
Exxon and ConocoPhillips declined to comment, while Qatar Petroleum could not immediately be reached for comment.
ConocoPhillips' stake sale led to delays in announcing the final decision to proceed with the project, one of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The move comes as ConocoPhillips hones its focus on international projects. 
The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Firms are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. That's well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year’s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie’s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said last month.
More than 320 million tonnes of LNG was shipped globally in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data.

440,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:52PM ET</span>",Betting Against Trump Was a Winner for a Second Year,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Two years ago, a new presidency began, stylistically different from the one before it. As inauguration approached, I wondered: How would President Donald Trump affect the market performance of the industries and companies he championed and those he attacked?
The period between Election Day and the inauguration was filled with aggressive Twitter broadsides by the president. He tweeted at companies by name; he yelled at or praised their chief executive officers; he caused their stock prices to gyrate madly. What were the long-term consequences of being on the president’s good or bad side?
To find out, we created a pair of indexes, and tracked them for a year. The Oligarch(1) (companies he favored) and the Drain the Swamp(2) (companies he denigrated) indexes were filled with companies straight from the feed of the tweeter-in-chief. This allowed us to track how well or poorly they did relative to their relationship with the president. What impact would he have on the companies’ market performance?
Asked more simply, if you run a publicly traded company, was it better for your stock price to be Trump’s friend or foe?
The answer, as we discovered one year later, was a shocker:
When we look at the companies Trump threatened, we discover this surprising fact: Having the U.S. president get angry with you, call you out publicly and make scary sounding threats at you — well, it turns out to be not so bad. In fact, the results are really good. 
And the companies he embraced? Well, not so much.
In 2017, the Oligarch Index gained a respectable 20 percent during the year. But it lagged behind the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index's rise of 21 percent. During the same year, the Drain the Swamp Index crushed the Oligarch Index, gaining 43 percent.
But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves: it was only one year, and one where markets everywhere went up, something for which Trump had no qualms about taking credit. Here we are, one year later, and 2018 was a much more challenging period. Amid a spike in volatility, the S&P 500 declined 6.2 percent. How did these two indexes do in that very different environment?
The Oligarch Index really took it on the chin last year. For the one-year period ended Jan. 10, the index fell 23 percent. This was much worse than the S&P 500, which during the same period declined 5.5 percent.
And the Swamp Index? It not only beat the Oligarch again, it crushed it, rising 6.3 percent. That is a 29 percentage point advantage for Trump’s most-hated companies over his most favored ones. This is even bigger spread than the first year we tracked the indexes, when the spread was 23 percentage points.
Where did the performance advantages come from?
Once again, the despised Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, and founder and CEO of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). had a good year. Bezos is now the wealthiest person in the world, with a fortune many times larger than that of the president, the size of which is in some dispute. Amazon defied the gravitational pull of the markets last year and gained 32 percent (not counting dividends).
And  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)., whose founder Jack Dorsey refused to create a lying Hillary emoji (really), thus earning the president’s never-ending enmity, did even better, more than 36 percent. Even the ""failing"" New York Times added more than 23 percent during the period. Being on Trump’s bad side was not bad for business or stock prices.The Oligarch index, meanwhile had some disasters. Colony Capital Inc., whose founder, Thomas Barrack, is a close friend and ally of the president, saw its stock get cut in half.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., dealing with an ethical cloud, fell 31 percent; Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. declined 34 percent.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., a conduit for fake news that may have helped Trump's electoral prospects, lost almost a quarter of its value.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., whose former CEO served for a time as secretary of State in the Trump administration, fell 17 percent. All told, it was a rough year for the Oligarchs, with little other than huge tax cuts to comfort them.
Two very different market years that produced such similar results is curious. There was no malice aforethought on the part of this humble author in terms of picking a winning and losing pair of portfolios. But who could have imagined this would be the result, based on nothing more than presidential tweets?(3)
What explains this performance differential, or more specifically why have president’s favorite corporate managers, and their companies, done so poorly under his regime, and why have his most-despised opponents done so well?
I have a few ideas:
No. 1. The 72 year-old president is an old school guy, with old school friends. Their companies are not cutting edge, and shouldn't be expected to deliver above-average results;
No. 2. Trump, who inherited much of his wealth, is intimidated by people much wealthier than he is, who have created value or built something from scratch. Thus, he steers clear of those builders or wealth creators who make him feel inadequate;
No. 3. Dumb luck, which will eventually reverse itself.
Regardless, we will track this for the third year of the Trump presidency, and report back to you in 12 months. Expect to be surprised again.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>",Exxon Mobil profit tops estimates as production rebounds,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Friday reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts' estimates, pushing its shares up as oil and natural gas output rose slightly on a year-over-year basis.
The company's fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago. But earnings excluding the impacts of tax reform and impairments rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago.
Analysts had forecast a $1.08 a share profit excluding one-time items, according to data from Refinitiv.
Exxon's oil equivalent production rose to just over 4 million barrels per day, up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. The company said its output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, rose 90 percent over a year ago.
Results for oil and gas production were ""especially strong,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. ""It was a good quarter to end the year. I think the focus now will be on improving the cash flow,"" he said.
Exxon is not planning share buybacks this quarter, though, which makes it the only international oil company ""not currently repurchasing shares,"" analysts with Simmons Energy said in a client note.
The company now expects to spend $30 billion this year, up from about $28 billion it had forecast previously, and analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a client note that the higher spending ""takes away from the 'sizzle' of the quarter.""
CEO Darren Woods said Exxon would sanction liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Mozambique this year. Qatar Petroleum and Exxon are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with the $10 billion Golden Pass LNG Terminal export project in Texas.
Pretax earnings in its refining business were $2.7 billion, up $1.70 billion over the same period the year prior. 
Exxon earned $1.1 billion more pretax in its upstream business than it did in the fourth quarter of 2017, and said higher natural gas prices were partially offset by lower liquids pricing.
Pretax profits in Exxon's chemicals business were down $191 million on weaker margins, growth-related expenses and higher downtime and maintenance.
Woods credited better-than-expected results to the company optimizing its operations across the board, and said it has an advantage because of its ability to tie decisions in the oil field to logistics and refining. 
“Irrespective of where we are in the cycle, we’re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,"" he said. Woods joined a conference call with analysts this morning for the first time since becoming CEO two years ago.
Production declines have been a significant issue in previous quarters for Exxon and it is a ""positive sign"" that production improved in the fourth quarter, said Muhammed Ghulam, analyst with Raymond James. But he noted the earnings beat was ""partially driven by one-time asset sale gains of more than $800 million"" from a refinery sale.

Shares were up 3.4 percent to $75.74 Friday. Shares are down about 11 percent in the last year. Exxon is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

442,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: Papa John's Plunges, Takes Big Slice of Consumer Discretionary","Investing.com - Pizza chain Papa John's slumped on Friday, adding further pressure on consumer discretionary stocks after it put a stake of itself up for sale after failing with M&A bids.
Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) said the buyout offers received from private equity firms did not match its valuation, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Its shares fell 8%.
The update comes just a week after rumors swirled that former CEO John Schnatter, who owns 30% of the company, 3G Capital and Restaurant Brands were reportedly looking to join forces and make a buyout offer for the company.
The transaction, which reportedly could be structured as a private investment in public equity, would shore up Papa John’s finances, which were hurt by low franchisee profitability.
But as it stands, there is no certainty that any deal will be agreed.
A surge in Deckers Outdoors, meanwhile, did its part to lift the consumer discretionary sector, which had already come under pressure thanks to slump in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), best known for its UGG brand, posted earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares 12% higher.
The outerwear retailer posted earnings of $6.59 a share on $873.8 million in revenue, easily surpassing estimates for earnings of $5.30 a share on $819.63 million in revenue.
The company also delighted investor by launching an additional $261 million share buyback program, taking the total program to $350 million.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Wirecard denies second FT report; shares down 28 percent,"MUNICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Wirecard on Friday denied allegations of financial irregularities after a second investigative report in three days by the Financial Times sent shares in the German payments company down by 28 percent.
Friday's price plunge, which wiped $5.7 billion off the company's market value, came after the FT said that Rajah & Tann, an external law firm hired by Wirecard, had found evidence indicating ""serious offences of forgery and/or of falsification of accounts"" at Wirecard's Singapore office.
A preliminary report by the law firm was the basis for an internal presentation to senior Wirecard management on May 8, 2018, the FT reported.
Wirecard issued a statement dismissing the FT story as ""inaccurate, misleading and defamatory"", using similar language to its denial of an earlier report on Wednesday.
""Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP is one of Wirecard’s many legal advisers and regularly conducts compliance and governance related advisory work for Wirecard,"" the statement continued.
""It is untrue that Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP has ever uncovered any findings of material misconduct of any Wirecard employee in matters of accounting practices. No presentation was held to Wirecard’s senior management on May 8, 2018, on the alleged matter.""
Representatives of Rajah & Tann could not immediately be reached for comment outside office hours.
Munich-based Wirecard has been a repeated target of short-sellers - investors betting on falling share prices - who have questioned its accounting methods and rapid international expansion in recent years.
These speculative attacks have caused huge volatility in Wirecard's stock, though its share price has rebounded repeatedly, with the company last year gaining elevation to the blue-chip DAX index.
The Munich state prosecutor's office on Friday said it had found no evidence of the alleged wrongdoing reported by the Financial Times. 

A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office also said that a preliminary investigation of suspected market manipulation was continuing.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 11:43AM ET</span>",Boeing goes bionic to roll out more Dreamliners,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is counting on a new kind of worker to help it reach a long-coveted target of rolling out 14 787 Dreamliners from its factories each month: half human, half robot. 
The world's largest planemaker is equipping mechanics with exoskeletons, similar to ones that allow cameramen to quickly navigate the sidelines of NFL football games, to increase their strength and speed. The high-tech suits also help reduce fatigue on repetitive tasks, such as overhead drilling.
""You have the capability of a robot and the capability of a human being melded together,"" Christopher Reid, a Boeing associate technical fellow who previously designed NASA spacesuits, told Reuters during a factory tour.
The new technology is an example a broader shift in the industry’s focus towards production, as planemakers face the task of making good on a record order boom. After a decade in which Boeing and Airbus generated massive orders fueled by the rise of China and emerging markets, the main battleground is shifting towards production strategy rather than market share.
At twin Dreamliner factories in South Carolina and Washington state, Boeing also plans to soon deploy Bluetooth-enabled 'smart' wrenches that signal if machinists apply the correct torque to a nut, and has introduced new self-driving work platforms to shave time off aircraft assembly, according to people familiar with the technologies. 
Such technology investments will help the U.S. manufacturer accelerate 787 Dreamliner production to 14 a month from 12. Chief Executive officer Dennis Muilenburg announced the preliminary rate change on Wednesday, and said he expects to complete the production increase in the second quarter.
Building the carbon composite Dreamliner at the new rate, first reported by Reuters, is central to Boeing's efforts to raise profit margins and claw back deferred production costs as it competes with arch-rival Airbus SE in a crowded but lucrative widebody market. 
Boeing rolls out a new 787 with a minimum list price of $239 million every 1.75 days. At 'rate 14,' that new pace drops to 1.5 days to make a new Dreamliner.
At today's rate, Boeing is reducing the 787 $23 billion in deferred production costs by $16 million per aircraft, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said. ""That number will clearly improve at the new rate."" 
MELDING HUMANS WITH ROBOTS
Boeing estimates the exoskeletons, which cost about $4,500-$7,000 apiece, have sped up work tasks in test groups of mechanics in South Carolina, though Boeing declined to share data. If trials continue to show improved safety and productivity, Boeing says it wants to deploy them to thousands of workers across the company over the next two years. 
In recent weeks, Boeing has also introduced custom-built, self-driving work platforms similar to scaffolds that hug an airframe so mechanics can work as a jetliner pulses along the assembly line. Before, work stations had to be moved with fork lifts.
Boeing's 787 mostly competes against the A350, of which Airbus builds 10 a month. These widebody planes represent hundreds of billions of dollars in sales over 20 years.
Both are modernizing their factories. But on widebody jets, Boeing's higher production rate gives it the advantage to drive down costs across its supply chain and sell more of its pricier Dreamliner variants, like the newest 787-10. 
In the fourth quarter, Boeing said its operating margin on commercial aircraft increased to 15.6 percent from 11.6 percent from a year ago, partially driven by higher margins on the 787 Dreamliner widebody.
INNOVATION AND INSPECTION
In South Carolina, engineers in a tiny workstation known as an ""innovation cell"" huddle around computers, 3D printers and a virtual reality system to help mechanics test out new tools without snarling the factory flow.
Before the cells, Boeing said workers had no formal place to test out new ideas or complain about niggling problems, leaving them to fester for years in some cases.
Boeing said three innovation cells in South Carolina have saved millions of dollars in costs since 2017 with a raft of time-saving tools, such as a 3D-printed curved ruler. The ruler alone cut six hours off the time it took a mechanic to hand-measure all the placards mounted above the seats inside on section of a 787. 
In Washington state, it has opened innovation cells at its widebody plant in Everett and its 737 plant in Renton, also set for 2019 rate increase. 
The new time-saving technology is aimed to help cut back on the cost of inspections that Boeing says have been made obsolete due to the new digital technology. 
""Don't inspect things twice,"" Mark Stockton, engineering director for Boeing South Carolina, told Reuters during the factory tour. ""Inspect things once and validate things once.""
Boeing said it did not expect that these changes in inspections will result in the loss of jobs.
But a union official asked about the strategy warned it carries risks such as higher injury rates, or potentially delayed aircraft deliveries, if last-minute problems are discovered. 

""Removing thousands of inspections per airplane will negatively impact the manufacturing process and push defects down line,"" IAM 751 spokeswoman Connie Kelliher said by email.

460,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 11:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Papa John's seeks investment after it abandons outright sale - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc, the world's third largest pizza delivery company, is pursuing the sale of a stake in itself after acquisition offers from private equity firms did not meet its valuation expectations, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Any such deal would come amid a battle for control of Papa John's with the chain's founder John Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company. Schnatter resigned as chairman last July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. He retains a seat on the company's board. 
The transaction, which could be structured as a private investment in public equity, would boost Papa John's finances, the sources said, as the company seeks to recover from low franchisee profitability and boost its sales through promotional discounts. 
Shares of Louisville, Kentucky-based Papa John's dropped 6.2 percent at $39.63, giving the company a market capitalization of about $1.2 billion.
There is no certainty that Papa John's will agree to any deal, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Papa John's declined to comment.
Reuters reported in October that several buyout firms had shown interest in acquiring Papa John's, including Bain Capital, CVC Capital Partners, KKR & Co Inc and Roark Capital. None of them proposed a deal that the company would accept.
Papa John's Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie has vowed to move beyond the fight with Schnatter with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter's image from company promotions. 
Schnatter has been seeking internal documents to try to show the company was mismanaged and to determine if he was improperly pushed out.
Last month, Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the company's directors to give Schnatter documents and communications, including text messages on personal devices, related to his firing. The order covered some messages between directors and their lawyers.
Both sides said they were pleased with the ruling. The company noted the judge narrowed the scope of the document requests, while Schnatter called it a vindication of his right to the information.

It remains unclear whether Schnatter will put forward a slate of board nominees to take control of Papa John's. The company typically holds its annual shareholders meeting in May, during which directors are elected.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>","Icy blast begins to ease in U.S. Midwest, Northeast","By Michael Hirtzer and Gina Cherelus
CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Frigid weather that paralyzed a large swath of the United States this week and caused at least 21 deaths began easing on Friday as an Arctic air mass pulled away, setting the stage for a warmer weekend in the Midwest and the Northeast.
Temperatures from southern New England to the Upper Midwest should reach the mid-40s to low 50s Fahrenheit through the weekend and Monday, forecasters said, after a record-breaking cold snap that stopped mail deliveries in some parts of the Midwest and shuttered schools and businesses.
In Chicago, which experienced temperatures as low as minus 22F (minus 30 Celsius) earlier this week, temperatures of 19F (-7C) on Friday morning felt positively balmy as a measure of normalcy returned to the nation's third-largest city. 
""It feels like summer,"" said Dolores Marek, 57, as she got off her commuter train in Chicago wearing a long parka coat as set out on the 1.5 mile-(2.4 km) walk to the local college where she works. ""This is much better than it was.""
Meteorologists linked the spell of brutal cold to the so-called polar vortex, a cap of icy air that usually swirls over the North Pole. Changing air currents caused it to slip down through Canada and into the U.S. Midwest this week. 
Bryan Jackson, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the core of the vortex was pulling north into eastern Canada, though residual icy air was still pushing over to the U.S. Northeast. 
Temperatures on Friday morning ranged from below zero Fahrenheit to the teens in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey. The Washington D.C. area, which had 20F (minus 7C) temperatures, was under a winter weather advisory until the afternoon as around one inch (2.5 cm) of snowfall accumulated during the morning.
""That cold air that was over the Great Lakes, over the Midwest, has shifted off. Now the high pressure is over Pennsylvania and New York,"" Jackson said in a phone interview. ""As it moves east, it'll bring in air from the south and we do expect it to warm up over the weekend."" 
Rachel Liao, 29, a student at the New School in New York, said she wished classes had been canceled due to the cold.
""I just want to stay inside,"" Liao, a New York native, said. ""I'm not used to this.""
Temperatures in the Upper Midwest, including Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, will reach well above zero F (minus 18C) on Friday, with highs making it into the teens and low 20s.
Even so, parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa were still experiencing temperatures in the negative single digits, Jackson said. 
The lowest temperature recorded early Friday morning was minus 34F (minus 37C) in Stonington, Michigan, according to the National Weather Service. 
By Saturday, highs will be in the 30s and even low 40s in the Midwest. The central Plains will be in the low 60s, nearly 20 to 25 degrees above normal, the weather service said. 
More than 40 cold-temperature records were broken on Thursday, the coldest morning since the polar vortex moved in late on Tuesday. The mass of Arctic air had clung to a swath of the United States from Iowa and the Dakotas across the Great Lakes region and into Maine for days.
Officials across multiple states linked at least 20 deaths to the deep freeze. The death toll rose after at least nine more people in Chicago were reported to have died from cold-related injuries, according to Stathis Poulakidas, a doctor at the city's John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital.
Amtrak train services that had been halted since Wednesday in Chicago's hub resumed on Friday, as did U.S. postal service that was halted or limited in six Midwest states.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",Renault-Nissan payments to political advisers draw scrutiny,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan is examining fees paid to consultants and political advisers including a serving European lawmaker, following Chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest and ouster from the helm of the carmaking alliance, two sources told Reuters.
Past business relationships with French advisers and lobbyists are in focus as the carmakers embark on an independent audit of their Dutch-registered Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) holding that Nissan had long demanded and  Renault  (PA:RENA) initially resisted.
The Japanese carmaker is concerned that use of shared RNBV funds lacked transparency and may not have served the company's interests as much as those of Renault, or Ghosn himself, the sources said.
Strategic PR adviser Claudine Pons and security consultant Alain Bauer have already confirmed reports they were paid via the holding for their services after a scandal at Renault in 2011 that almost forced Ghosn out. The company was hoaxed into firing three innocent executives over false spying accusations.
The alliance also hired former justice minister Rachida Dati as a legal adviser soon after she left the government of then-president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009 to stand for the European Parliament, according to the same two sources.
RNBV's dealings with Dati were unknown to Nissan, which co-funds the holding, spokesman Travis Parman said, when approached for comment. ""Nissan is not aware of any such payments. We can't comment on specifics related to the joint audit,"" he said.
There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Dati, who is the highest-profile recipient of an alliance contract to have come to light.
When contacted by Reuters, she referred questions to her lawyer, Olivier Pardo. Pardo said Dati had been hired by RNBV in October 2009, four months after leaving Sarkozy's government, and retained until February 2013. He declined to comment on her remuneration.
""It was a retainer agreement that complied with the rules applying to lawyers,"" Pardo said. ""It was a very broad and wide-ranging assignment, and since she is bound by professional secrecy I can't go into any more detail.""
The decision to end her RNBV contract was taken in October 2012, according to Pardo, five months after Francois Hollande succeeded her former mentor as French president.
Spending on advisers appeared in RNBV accounts as a single line for consultants' fees, which exceeded 20 million euros in 2015 but included no further details, sources have said.
Renault declined to comment on the RNBV audit.
Ghosn, who was forced to resign as Renault chairman and CEO last week, has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional Nissan compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later.
Senior director Greg Kelly and the Japanese carmaker itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny that the deferred pay deals were illegal or required disclosure. Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
The scandal has strained Nissan's 20-year-old partnership with 43.4 percent-owner Renault.
Repairing the relationship is the biggest challenge facing Jean-Dominique Senard, who took over as Renault chairman last week, as Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore was promoted to chief executive.
Nissan began pushing for an investigation into RNBV within hours of Ghosn's arrest, and formally proposed a joint audit on Dec. 19.
But its calls were rebuffed by Renault under Bollore's leadership as interim CEO, several sources have told Reuters.
Nissan stepped up pressure for a financial audit to be conducted independently of lawyers reporting to Mouna Sepehri, a senior executive close to Ghosn, following a Reuters report on Jan. 10 about her undisclosed pay, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Renault's board agreed to the audit the following week.
Further management changes are now likely at Renault ""within a month or so"", a source close to Chairman Senard told Reuters.
Mazars, the Paris-based audit firm selected last week to comb through RNBV's finances stretching back to its creation in 2002, is expected to complete its work by the end of February.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said it will start taking orders in China on Friday for a lower-priced version of its Model 3 car, as it seeks to accelerate China sales hit by trade friction between Washington and Beijing.
The California-based firm said in a statement that Chinese customers will be allowed to place orders for a long range, rear-wheel-drive Model 3 variant whose price will start at 433,000 yuan ($64,300.56).
Previously, the starting price for a Model 3 in China was 499,000 yuan, for an all-wheel-drive long range version. Tesla said earlier this year that it plans to start delivering Model 3 cars to customers in China in March. 
Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China but is in the process of building a factory in Shanghai that will manufacture Model 3 cars in the initial phase. 
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on a post earnings call on Wednesday that Tesla's Fremont factory is focused almost entirely on building Model 3s for China and Europe. 
""It's very important to get those cars, especially to China, as soon as possible. We hope the trade negotiations go well , but it's not clear. But we need to get them there while there's sort of a de facto - sort of a truce on the tariff war,"" Musk said.
Tesla has sent two ships and at least one cargo plane with Model 3 vehicles to China, a logistics source familiar with the matter said. 
The company said in October that its China sales have been hammered after Beijing raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent in July. China has since temporarily suspended the additional 25 percent tariff, reducing it to the 15 percent level.
Tesla has adjusted prices of its U.S.-made cars in China to keep its cars affordable in the country, a move also aimed at helping it fend off competition from a swathe of domestic electric vehicle startups such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.
Tesla has said that it wants to start production at its Shanghai plant in the second half this year and is aiming to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.

Last month, the carmaker told public officials and unions it was in talks with Sao Paulo state about tax incentives.

GM declined to comment.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 07:56AM ET</span>",Stock rally pauses after disappointing China data,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares edged down from their highest in two months on Friday as data showing shrinking factory activity in China ended a rally that took them to their best January on record.
Stocks have benefited this week from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which all but abandoned plans for raising interest rates again, and on optimism that a U.S.-China trade deal might be on the cards.
But the Caixin/Markit index of Chinese manufacturing fell to its lowest since February 2016, adding to a growing list of economic readings indicating slowing global growth.
(For an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Tr5cgO)
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stock markets in 47 countries, came off its highest level since Dec. 4 after its best January gain on record - up 7.79 percent on the month.
Futures indicated a timid start to trading on Wall Street.
The weak Chinese data also took MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.2 percent, after a 7.2 percent gain in January.
The Australian dollar, a barometer of investor sentiment towards China, slid as much as half a percent. China's offshore yuan was headed for its worst day in over five months. 
Although European markets opened higher, stock fell as banks reported poor earnings. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.2 percent.
Purchasing manager indexes in manufacturing for Italy and Switzerland came in below expectations, although those for Germany, France and the euro zone were in line with forecasts.
Equity markets have been relieved by a change of heart at the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signaled this week that its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end as the outlook for the U.S. economy worsens.
The Fed held rates steady, discarded its promise of ""further gradual increases"" in rates and said it would be ""patient"" before making any further moves.
""The Fed decision should not only be supportive of risk markets, but also the weaker dollar backdrop could be extended, which should support EM assets, especially at a time when China is attempting to stimulate growth,"" said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at UBP.
""The market will now turn its attention to the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks as well as the U.S. data.""
Jobs data from the United States is due at 1330 GMT.
Stocks had also gained after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal.
The top U.S. negotiator at the talks reported ""substantial progress"" in the talks. Beijing's trade delegation said they made ""important progress"", China's official Xinhua news agency reported.
The previously upbeat mood was also chilled somewhat by White House insistence that March 1 was a hard deadline for a deal, failure of which would lead to an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
""Analysts mostly remain deeply skeptical that a genuine trade deal can be done on this time frame,"" economists from Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note.
""We are less pessimistic since these negotiations are being conducted by senior politicians, not by trade bureaucrats,"" they said. ""Both sides also have an incentive, and arguably a growing incentive, to get a meaningful deal done.""
The optimism supported Wall Street, where the S&P 500 ended Thursday with a gain of 0.86 percent. The Nasdaq jumped 1.37 percent after a near 11 percent rise in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). The Dow slipped 0.06 percent.
Over January, the S&P 500 rose 7.9 percent, its best monthly performance since late 2015 and its strongest start to a year since 1987. The Nasdaq gained 9.7 percent in the month and the Dow rose 7.2 percent.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 95.506. The euro was 0.2 percent higher at $1.14650..
The euro weakened when Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann painted an unusually bleak picture of the German economy, saying the slump would last longer than initially thought.
Gold prices hovered just short of nine-month highs, supported by the fall in bond yields and expectations for a softer dollar. Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,321.03 per ounce, having touched a top of $1,326.30.
Oil prices were subdued as the China data offset signs major exporters were reducing output. U.S. crude futures were flat at $53.79 per barrel, while Brent rose 0.2 percent to $60.93. [O/R]

481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 07:56AM ET</span>",IAG's Walsh to Airbus: drop A380 price to boost sales,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus should lower the price of its A380 jetliner if it wants to sell more of them, IAG (LON:ICAG) CEO Willie Walsh said on Friday, adding that the airline group would consider additional aircraft if the price was right.
Walsh's comments come as Dubai's Emirates is exploring switching A380 orders to the smaller A350 in a move raising new doubts about the future of the superjumbo, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
""I've been very clear with Airbus that if they want to sell the aircraft, they're going to have to be very aggressive on the price,"" Walsh said at a Oneworld event in London.
Airbus is trying to broker a deal for Emirates, the largest customer, to switch some A380 that are already on order to the smaller A350 in a move likely to trigger a shutdown in production of the slow selling superjumbo, sources said on Thursday.
That would be part of a broader package to end an impasse between Emirates and Rolls Royce (LON:RR) over terms for engine support and could involve salvaging as many sales as possible to a handful of airlines still interested in buying the plane. 
Industry sources say Airbus is in talks with IAG-owned British Airways on the A380. Rolls Royce provides engines for both the A350 and A380.
Analysts say Airbus would rather sell A350 which is generating cash than A380 which is draining cash. 
But it remains to be seen whether Emirates will agree to the reshuffle and Airbus rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) is expected to try to disrupt the move as it negotiates with emirates to finalize a provisional deal to sell 40 787s to Emirates. The A350 competes with Boeing's 787 and 777. 
Walsh said that IAG was in talks with Airbus and Boeing to get more wide-body aircraft to replace 747s that are due to be retired in the coming years.
""Those discussions are ongoing... and we're pleased to have the choice of excellent aircraft,"" Walsh said. 
IAG's British Airways currently operates 12 A380s. Walsh said he was committed to the A380s which the group already operates, and that IAG might consider some additional aircraft if the price was right.
""I've no concerns about the A380... it's been an excellent aircraft for us. We have made it clear to Airbus that that we might consider some additional aircraft,"" Walsh said.

""But the pricing of that aircraft has not been as attractive as we believe it needs to be.""

482,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>","Amazon, Walmart Reel as India Curbs Plunge Market Into Chaos","(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.’s grand plans for India were thrown into chaos on Friday after the country implemented new e-commerce regulations, which could cut their growth in the market by as much as half this year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government tightened rules for the retail giants after strident complaints from small shops and domestic sellers. Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart are now banned from cutting exclusive arrangements with sellers, offering deep discounts or holding any business interest in online merchants on their websites. Thousands of products have already vanished from the virtual shelves of the duo, which together account for 70 percent of India’s online retail market. Arvind Singhal of consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt, estimates their revenue growth could fall to 15 percent in coming months from 25 to 30 percent previously.
Amazon’s shares slid as analysts pushed the company for answers on India, a market the e-commerce titan regards as the best frontier for international expansion. Jeff Bezos has pledged to spend $5.5 billion there in pursuit of growth, but executives had few encouraging words, saying on Thursday the effects of new e-commerce regulations in the country are still uncertain. Its newfound headaches in India come as a slowing global economy threatens to curtail the consumer spending retailers rely on. Amazon shares were off about 4 percent in early trading, while Walmart was up less than 1 percent.
“It will be at least six to eight months before they are able to find workarounds and restore listings,” said Singhal, the New Delhi-based chairman for Technopak.
What’s clear is that Amazon and Walmart now have to re-tool their strategy and potentially ward off stiffer competition from physical retailers or local rivals with deep pockets such as conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., which may benefit from the new laws. The disruption comes after the two retailing giants wagered billions on the market: beyond Amazon’s spending pledge, Walmart shelled out $16 billion to acquire control of Flipkart Online Services Pvt last summer.
Walmart and Amazon have amassed vast inventories in companies in which they have business interests and had sought a four- to six-month extension to help offload those products. But the decision to go forward with the new rules on schedule was announced Thursday evening.
Now, thousands of products from Amazon’s leading vendor Cloudtail, a joint venture with Infosys billionaire co-founder Narayana Murthy, have gone off the platform. That includes its Echo smart speaker, Fire TV Stick and Kindle devices. Flipkart’s fashion arm Myntra has a wide range of labels that it’s created and invested in -- those too must go. And so-called Alpha sellers that have sealed arrangements with Amazon and Walmart cannot sell on the websites, nor can phonemakers and fashion brands sell products exclusively on either platform.
Both retailers will have to draw up new contracts with thousands of merchants and brands, deleting wording such as “exclusive.” And they may have to develop India-specific private labels, which the government allows. “Private labels are not a panacea to their current problems since their unique selling point is that they are a single stop for all products and brands,” Singhal said.
The new rules could wipe out nearly half the products on Amazon.in, said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “It’s likely to disrupt availability for customers,” he said.
That could also put Amazon’s plans to expand in food retailing into jeopardy. While India allows 100-percent foreign investment in such retail operations, the new rules bar Amazon from selling any products from entities in which it owns a stake. Last summer the government approved an Amazon proposal to invest $500 million to retail food products.
Amazon and Flipkart will have to cut back on cash-back payments and discounts. These have been a particular sore point with smaller sellers, which have accused the pair of predatory pricing practices. Behind-the-scenes and government-level lobbying is expected to continue, Singhal said.
Walmart’s and Amazon’s tactics have been controversial in a country where organized retail accounts for only about 10 percent, and the market is dominated by small sellers and mom-and-pop stores. The government’s decision on the e-commerce rules comes months ahead of a crucial general election. Small traders have traditionally been part of a support base for Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
In response to questions, an Amazon spokeswoman said via email: “All sellers make their own independent decisions of what to list and when and we cannot comment on that.”
Flipkart said it was disappointed that the government had decided to implement the regulation changes “at such haste,” but will comply. It’s previously argued that such policies should have been created after more consultation.“Despite the significant work that is required to change our supply chains and systems, we are also confident that we will continue to serve our customers and sellers to the standards we and they are used to.”
The biggest beneficiary from the tightened rules could be Reliance, which is India’s largest private company and owns the country’s biggest brick and mortar retail chain. Recently, it has spelled out ambitious plans to delve into ecommerce by getting millions of small sellers aboard a platform it’s created alongside its Jio wireless service.
“Reliance is likely to become the largest omni-channel retailer in the next 24 months as it has nearly 300 million Jio telecom subscribers who can access a bundle of financial, education, entertainment and retail services on their phone’s Jio app,” Singhal said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union and UK market watchdogs have agreed pacts for swapping information on asset managers, credit rating agencies and transaction reporting bodies to avoid chaos if Britain crashes out of the bloc in two months' time with no deal.
The pacts, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, allow regulators in the bloc and Britain to exchange information on credit ratings agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch with major operations in London that rate firms across the EU.
The MoU also covers trade repositories that banks and other financial firms must use to report derivatives transactions. Many of the repositories are based in London.
The European Securities and Markets Authority said on Friday that the MoU would allow it to ""continue to discharge its mission and meet its mandate regarding investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability in the EU"".
Confirming a brief statement issued on Thursday, ESMA said it had also reached agreement with Britain's the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on sharing information to allow cross-border asset management activities to continue if Britain leaves the bloc with no deal.
""This, in turn, will allow certain activities, such as fund manager outsourcing and delegation, to continue to be carried out by UK-based entities on behalf of counterparties based in the European Economic Area,"" ESMA said.
Sources told Reuters this month that BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management would temporarily move some British-based fund managers to New York if ESMA and the FCA failed to agree an MoU in time.
FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said the MoUs should minimize the potential for financial market disruption from a no-deal Brexit.
Britain is due by law to leave the EU on March 29, but it wants to reopen a divorce settlement negotiated with Brussels, rejected in the London parliament, that would provide for a 'status quo' transition period of at least 21 months to allow future trade arrangements to be agreed.
Many funds listed in Dublin and Luxembourg are managed from London.

""Ensuring that there is no disruption for the millions who currently save and invest via regulated funds and that they can continue to access global expertise is vital,"" said Pat Lardner, chief executive of Irish Funds.

484,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Toronto New Home Sales Plunge as Buyers Balk at Spiraling Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- New home buyers finally reached their limit in Toronto last year.
After years of frenzied price increases, sales of new homes in Canada’s biggest city sunk to the lowest in almost two decades in 2018 and the supply of unsold condos piled up, according to a pair of new reports released Friday.
“Greater caution” should be taken when investing in new condo units, particularly over the short-term, as trends point toward slower appreciation, Shaun Hildebrand, president of condo research firm Urbanation, said in the report. The “market has started to normalize after unprecedented activity in recent years.”
Toronto’s housing market is dramatically cooling after higher interest rates and new mortgage regulations bite. The city joins other global metropolises such as London and Sydney seeing a slowdown as international investors retreat and domestic buyers balk at higher prices.
Sales of new homes fell to 25,161 from 2017, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association, which used data from Altus Group Ltd. That’s the lowest annual number since Toronto-based Altus started tracking the figures in 2000.
Single-family homes showed the biggest decline, plunging 50 percent to 3,831 from 2017 and 74 percent below the 10-year average. Condos sales fell 38 percent to 21,330, but only 4 percent below the 10-year average.
While the benchmark price of a new single-family home slumped 6.7 percent to C$1,143,505 in December on the year, condo prices surged 11 percent to C$796,815 ($605,000), according to BILD’s report.
But figures from Urbanation show further weakness building in condos as well. A record 21,991 units are expected to be completed this year, up 29 percent from 2017. While 98 percent of those units are pre-sold, more than half were bought by investors who will either rent their units or sell them, the firm said.
The number of unsold units in development jumped 47 percent in the fourth quarter from the year before to more than a two-year high and price gains for units under development grew only 0.4 percent between the third and fourth quarters, the smallest quarterly increase in almost three years.
“The slowdown in activity last year can partly be attributed to less demand from investors, who typically represent the largest component of new condominium purchasers,” in the Toronto region, according to Urbanation’s report.
“The market is out of balance,” said David Wilkes, president and chief executive officer of BILD, an industry group for about 1,500 companies in the Toronto region. “We join other industry groups in calling on the federal government to revisit the stress test and allow a longer amortization period for first-time buyers. And we look forward to working with our municipal partners on removing barriers to development such as excessive red tape and outdated bylaws.”"

487,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 06:45AM ET</span>",Italian govt plans to separate commercial lenders from investment banks,"ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government intends to approve in coming months new banking regulations, including a rule that separates banks' commercial and investment businesses, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday.
Speaking to parliament's lower house, Di Maio also said that if the government needed to enter the capital of troubled Banca Carige it would take control of the lender.
Since 1993, investment and commercial banks can operate in Italy under one roof.
In June, when the populist coalition made up of the far-right League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement took power, it agreed in principle that the two divisions of the banking sector were best kept separate to protect savers.
Di Maio, who is also the 5-Star's leader, said that the government aims to approve the new rules ""in the coming months"". The governing coalition will also press for ""a reform of the European banking supervision and the creation of a EU-wide fund to guarantee savers"".
Di Maio also mentioned ""a fund to guarantee savers to be funded by putting aside up to 60 percent of bank managers' bonus for five years"".
Last month Italy set up a 1.3 billion euros ($1.49 billion)fund to cover potential costs of emergency measures to shore up Carige after the European Central Bank (ECB) put the bank under temporary administration following a failed attempt to raise new capital from investors.
""So far we do not know whether we will have to use public funds, but if we decide to put people's money into the bank then (Carige) will be owned by the people,"" said Di Maio.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) retained dollar-denominated debt issued by Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA in a key emerging market bond index in a monthly rebalancing.
Investors have been concerned that JPMorgan could exclude PDVSA from the EMBI Global benchmarks of sovereign and sub-sovereign emerging hard-currency debt after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on the company on Monday. 
""There is no immediate impact on the index status of Venezuela from the set of sanctions and licenses issued on 28 January 2019,"" Kumaran Ram and Gloria Kim from JPMorgan's index team wrote in a note to clients. 
""Both Venezuela Republic and PDVSA bonds currently remain eligible for the flagship benchmarks: EMBI Global Diversified, EMBI Global, and EMBI+.""
However, a prolonged market disruption in liquidity and pricing would warrant a further review of the company's index
status for potential removal, JPMorgan added. 
While there were no explicit rules around sanctions for index membership, any entities finding themselves under such measures would likely be removed from benchmarks on the basis of liquidity, replicability and accessibility, Ram and Kim said.
PDVSA has a weight of 0.53 in JPMorgan's EMBI Global Diversified index while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66 as of earlier this week, according to the index provider.
Many asset managers welcomed the move to keep PDVSA in the key index, for now. 
""They kept them in, there are no changes on PDVSA, and we are very happy about that,"" said one asset manager who declined to be named. ""(A change) would have come too quick, the situation is still evolving.""
Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world - has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis with hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent this year.
Since the start of the year, bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA have chalked up steady gains amid weeks of protests that saw pressure mount on President Nicolas Maduro. 
The debt rallied further after opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president on Jan. 23, received the backing of the United States along with most other countries in the western hemisphere.
However, trading in PDVSA bonds almost ground to a halt after Washington imposed a swathe of sanctions, including a ban on U.S. investors from trading in the secondary market, other than divestment.
""They were one of the best-performing bonds in January, and as a manager that is hard to overlook,"" said Abhishek Kuma, head of emerging markets debt at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. 
""Venezuela has defied all conventional wisdom for a very long time. As long as the bonds are there in the benchmark you have to consider buying them,"" Kumar added.
PDVSA's 2024 issue - previously one of the most heavily traded issues - was indicated at 0.8 cents weaker at 24.53 cents in the dollar. The 2025 sovereign bond showed at around 31.5 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

JPMorgan communicates any changes of index constituents to its clients on the last trading day of the month. The EMBI Global index includes $24.1 billion of dollar-denominated PDVSA debt, according to the index provider.

492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",European Earnings Aren’t Great. Does That Even Matter Now?,"(Bloomberg) -- What’s a good earnings season? In Europe, okay might be good enough and bad might be just okay.
That’s because expectations and valuations were already remarkably low as companies began to release fourth-quarter results. While bottom-up consensus for 2019 earnings growth in Europe remains in the high-single digits, most investors have a much lower number in mind. Top-down strategists have also adjusted accordingly: Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) expects no increase at all, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) just cut its projection to 1 percent and said that even such a dismal rate has been priced in.
“While the earnings delivery could ultimately underwhelm, we believe investors are already pricing in the disappointments,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. “The stock price reaction to EPS results is much healthier than in the prior quarters. Many companies that missed estimates or lowered guidance are trading higher, and at the same time companies beating estimates are being rewarded to a greater extent than seen historically.”
Of course, it’s not that anemic earnings growth doesn’t matter at all; it’s always been among the reasons global investors are less keen on the European market. But, the fact that the market endured a steep correction late last year means it may react less strongly to disappointing profits.
Strategists differ slightly on how to read the earnings season so far. With 15 percent of Stoxx 600 companies having reported, 44 percent have beaten EPS estimates, a six-year low, Bank of America strategists led by Manish Kabra wrote in a note. JPMorgan says 62 percent of them exceeded estimates, a higher proportion than in the last quarter.
Bank of America points out that operational margins have dropped to a two-year low, with companies giving negative commentary on Brexit and China."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors piled into bonds in the past week and pulled billions of dollars from U.S. and European stocks as they sought safety in assets seen as less risky in times of economic uncertainty, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) said on Friday.
The bank's report, based on EPFR data which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, showed investors yanked $15 billion from equities in the week to Jan. 30, the tenth outflow of the past 11 weeks.
Some $15.2 billion was pulled from U.S. stocks and $3.7 billion from Europe, marking the 46th weekly outflow of the past 47 weeks from the region.
In turn, bonds recorded inflows of $9.4 billion, their biggest since January last year. Investors pumped $4.7 billion into investment-grade bonds, the most since February last year, the data showed.
Japan and emerging market equities continued to see inflows, with $4.4 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.
Investors have pounced on emerging market equities and bonds in recent months amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates as quickly as previously expected, pushing the U.S. dollar.
Cumulative flows in EM debt and equity hit $369 billion last week, just $2 billion shy of the record last January, the data shows.

Investors are no longer extremely bearish, with the Bull & Bear indicator at 3.3, its highest since October and up from 2.8 previously, but investor positioning suggests the risk asset rally can continue, BAML said. 
For instance, the private client Treasury Bill allocation is at a record high, it said.
The data comes after big swings in stock markets in recent months - the S&P 500 just closed out its best January since 1987 after suffering its worst December in almost 90 years - as investors fret about the U.S.-China trade dispute, U.S. interest rate policy and slowing global economic growth.

495,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 05:44AM ET</span>","The Great Oil Paradox: Too Many Good Crudes, Not Enough Bad Ones","(Bloomberg) -- The shale boom has created a world awash with crude, putting a lid on prices and markedly reducing U.S. dependence on imported energy. But there’s a growing problem: America is producing the wrong kind of oil.
Texas and other shale-rich states are spewing a gusher of high-quality crude -- light-sweet in the industry parlance -- feeding a growing glut that’s bending the global oil industry out of shape.
Refiners who invested billions to turn a profit from processing cheap low-quality crude are paying unheard of premiums to find the heavy-sour grades they need. The mismatch is better news for OPEC producers like Iraq and Saudi Arabia, who don’t produce much light-sweet, but pump plenty of the dirtier stuff.
The crisis is Venezuela, together with OPEC output cuts, will exacerbate the mismatch. The South American producer exports some of the world’s heaviest oil and Trump administration sanctions announced this week will make processing and exporting crude far more difficult. American refiners are scrambling for alternative supplies at very short notice.
""We still have some holes in our supply plan"" over the next 30 days, Gary Simmons, a senior executive at  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO)., the largest refiner in the U.S., told investors on Thursday. ""We are not taking anything from Venezuela.""
Crude isn’t the same everywhere: the kind pumped from the shale wells of West Texas resembles cooking oil -- thin and easy to refine. In Venezuela’s Orinoco region, it looks more like marmalade, thick and hard to process. Density isn’t the only difference -- the sulfur content is also important, dividing the market into sweet and sour crude. Heavy crude tends to have more sulfur than light crude.
As Saudi Arabia, Russia and Canada cut production, and American sanctions force Venezuelan and Iranian exports lower, the market for low-quality crude is feeling the impact.
""The strength in the physical crude market continues, led by sour crude shortages,"" Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. in London, said echoing a widely held view within the market. 
For consumers and politicians focused on the headline oil price for Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the most popular benchmarks, it may not matter much. Car drivers could even benefit, because too much light-sweet crude often leads to too much gasoline, and lower prices. On the flip side, truckers may find themselves short-charged, as refiners prefer heavy-sour crude to make diesel.
To oil traders in the physical market, it provides opportunities for to profit from the changing price spreads between different crude varieties.
Few oil executives see the market changing anytime soon. The supply and demand balance could deteriorate further as OPEC deepens output cuts next month -- Saudi Arabia has warned it will reduce production even further in February. Saudi oil exports into the U.S. last week fell to the second-lowest level in nearly a decade.
""OPEC cuts will sustain the tightness of heavy-sour crude,"" Alex Beard, the head of oil at commodities trading giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc.
At the same time, U.S. shale production keeps growing, feeding the glut of light-sweet crude. The proportion of light crude in U.S. total petroleum output has risen to nearly 57 percent, up from 51 percent in early 2017, according to Bloomberg calculations based on U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
In the physical market, oil price differentials for some important varieties of heavy-sour crude -- including Russia’s main export grade, Urals, and Mars Blend from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico -- are at the strongest levels in five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Mars crude on Tuesday traded at a $5.85 premium to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate, compared to a discount of $1.60 a barrel a year ago. Earlier this month, Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude traded at a rare premium to its sister variety Light Louisiana Sweet.
“OPEC is having the impact that they wanted in the physical market, which is tightening,"" Marco Dunand, chief executive officer of commodities trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.
Heavy-sour crude is becoming so expensive -- and gasoline refining margins are so low -- that some U.S. refiners are running their most sophisticated kit at low rates in an effort to save money. Others are likely to follow.
The cracking margin for heavy-sour crude for the most sophisticated refineries in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico has fallen to about $2.50 per barrel in recent days, compared to a five-year average of $12 a barrel, according to data from consultant Oil Analytics Ltd.
The global refinery has no option but to adapt almost in real time. Valero is ""changing the way it’s sourcing crude on weekly, daily basis to try to get the best netback we can on the plants,"" Joe Gorder, chief executive officer, told investors on Thursday."

497,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 05:19AM ET</span>",Sony's profit disappoints as weaker games biz overshadows record result,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp (T:6758) reported lower-than-expected profit on Friday as its previously thriving gaming business sagged, though a one-off gain related to its acquisition of EMI nevertheless pushed the quarterly result to a record high.
Sony has reinvented itself as an entertainment company with stable revenue from music content and gaming, after battling years of losses with consumer electronics such as television sets that are more susceptible to price competition.
But investors are now looking for the next profit pillar as Sony's gaming business shows signs of slowing, with its popular PlayStation 4 (PS4) console nearing the end of its lifecycle.
""Hardware sales dropped to 8.1 million units in the quarter, but that's meeting our expectations for a console entering its sixth year,"" Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at an earnings briefing.
Sony said operating profit rose 7.5 percent to 376.99 billion yen ($3.46 billion) in October-December. That compared with the 383.67 billion yen average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Driving the increase was a surge in profit at its music business after completing the $2.3 billion acquisition of EMI late last year to become the world's largest music publisher.
Profit in the gaming business fell 14 percent as the popularity of exclusive titles such as ""Marvel's Spider-Man"" failed to offset shrinking PS4 console sales.
""The gaming business, which has been Sony's profit driver in the last couple of years, is set to peak out ahead of the launch of the next gaming console,"" said Ace Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. ""That's inevitable due to product cycle.""
Sony also cut its profit outlook for imaging sensors, citing weakness in the global smartphone market.
""We haven't changed our view that demand for our high-end sensors will increase, or our plans to increase production capacity to the full,"" Totoki said. ""But we will adjust the timing of the capacity boost depending on demand.""
Sony's stock price hit an 11-year high in September as investors cheered the firm's reinvention. However, it has since dropped by a quarter on concerns over gaming and sensors. 
Still, Sony maintained its annual profit forecast of 870 billion yen, exceeding an all-time high marked just last year.
Sony's results came a day after gaming rival Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) booked a 36 percent quarterly profit jump on upbeat sales of software for its hybrid home-portable Switch device. The firm, however, cut its full-year forecast for Switch console sales by 15 percent.

500,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 04:46AM ET</span>","MarketPulse Europe: Trade Hopes Lift Automakers, Luxury Groups","Hopes for a thaw in U.S.-Chinese relations nudged European stocks higher early Friday, with trade-sensitive industrials and luxury goods groups leading the way and distracting attention from weak manufacturing surveys and disappointing banking results.
At 05:00 AM ET (10.00 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 0.04% at 3160.75
Shares in automakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) were all higher after U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at a summit meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in February to reach a deal that would end the threat of fresh U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.
Europe’s automakers have been caught badly in the middle of that trade war, since a large part of their sales in China come from their plants in the U.S. and are vulnerable to Chinese countermeasures.
Luxury goods makers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), which had suffered in recent weeks amid signs of a Chinese economic slowdown, were also among the Euro Stoxx 50 leaders, while smaller rivals Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER), Moncler (MI:MONC) and  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) also gained.
The moves suggest that trade news counts for more than another set of weak manufacturing surveys. Markit’s flash Purchasing Manager Index readings for January, released Friday, showed contraction in China, Germany and Italy. The U.K. PMI also slowed more than forecast, although it stayed above the 50 level that indicates growth.
Elsewhere, it was Groundhog Day for European banks.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) continued its slide for a third day after disappointing again, with a net loss for the fourth quarter after a 23% slump in revenue at its core bond and currency trading business. Caixabank (MC:CABK) and Sabadell (MC:SABE), two of Spain’s largest banks, also fell more than 5% after missing fourth-quarter estimates, although BBVA (MC:BBVA) rose: the sale of its Chilean business and a solid performance in Mexico helped to offset weakness in crisis-hit Turkey.  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), which was hit last year by a money-laundering scandal, edged up 0.8% as its fourth-quarter report passed without any new shocks."

Electrolux was the clear top performer in early trading with forecast-beating profits sending shares in the home appliance maker up 8.6 percent.
JCDecaux revenues also cheered investors, boosting the French company's shares about 7 percent.
There were mixed feelings about results in the banking sector, particularly in Spain with Caixabank falling 5.4 percent on its 2018 results while fellow Spanish lenders Banco Sabadell and BBVA (MC:BBVA) and were down 3.5 percent and flat respectively. 
In Germany  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) lost another 2.8 percent after its results, failing to recover after sinking during the last session on speculation of a possible merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

On a more optimistic note, Danske Bank, under investigation for suspicious payments through its Estonian branch, rose close to 4 percent as it unveiled new efforts to step up anti-money laundering efforts via investments of up to 2 billion euros ($2.29 billion).

The yuan gave up a sliver of its recent advance.
Washington trade negotiations that had been tipped as “determinative” in the end broke up with an agreement to keep talking, as a March 1 deadline for tariff hikes looms. News that China plans to buy substantially more American agricultural and energy goods failed to light much fire under Asian shares already heading for a fourth straight weekly advance. U.S. futures were little changed after rising overnight, while European contracts pointed higher. Oil was around $54 a barrel in New York.
Treasuries retained most of their gains since the Federal Reserve’s pivot Wednesday toward a more neutral stance on monetary tightening. Ten-year yields at around 2.63 percent remain about 15 basis points below where they started last week and the dollar is on track for a second week of losses. It was little changed Friday.
Traders now turn their attention to Friday’s monthly U.S. labor report amid an ongoing earnings season that’s given investors mixed signals. Technology shares led gains in the U.S. overnight after some solid corporate reports, though Nasdaq futures pointed lower Friday following a tepid sales forecast from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Also on traders radar screens: any potential moves by China to shore up growth. A gauge of Chinese manufacturing came in weaker than expected Friday. The  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc economist who correctly called China’s interest-rate cut in 2014 says a similar move could come as soon as Friday.
Meantime, President Donald Trump and the China delegation said progress was made in trade negotiations in Washington. Next up, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer head to China in mid-February.
“The outlook is pretty good and markets can go a lot further,” Homin Lee, a macro strategist at Lombard Odier, told Bloomberg TV in Hong Kong. “Assuming there’s no further hiccups in the Fed communication, we can really see the rally continue for the remainder of the year.”

505,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 02:15AM ET</span>",Big cash holdings in Europe signal unease over stock market outlook,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - Stocks may have started the new year on a better footing but equity investors in Europe are hanging on to unusually big cash piles, signaling growing unease over the market's prospects.
Worries that turned a promising 2018 into a brutal year remain high and fund managers are dismissing the early rebound as a false start, anticipating more turbulence ahead.
They prefer keeping large sums of money parked until the protectionist war between Washington and Beijing clears up or Britain agrees on a Brexit deal, or data gives them some comfort that the global economy is not so in bad shape.
""There's no reason to be 100 percent invested,"" said Gilles Guibout, head of European equities at AXA Investment Managers, which manages a total of 759 billion euros ($872 billion) in various assets.
""The bounce we've seen has no real foundations. We remain skeptical on any strong market recovery because many uncertainties have still no answer.""
Guibout has raised the cash component of his portfolios to levels last seen around 10 years ago, at the start of the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.
He now holds 4-5 percent in cash, just below the upper limit allowed by the funds' policies and three times more than last summer when stocks were near peak levels.
And he was not alone in doing so. 
According to Morningstar data gathered for Reuters on more than 2,500 funds with around 680 billion euros worth of large-caps European equity, net cash allocation has reached its highest level since May 2017, climbing above 3 percent in December from a two-year low of 2.4 percent in February 2018.
The data also showed that funds managed by other big global money managers such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Allianz (DE:ALVG), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Schroder had also significantly increased their cash buffers to above average levels over the last few months.
Guibout expects to keep that buffer intact, by buying on the dips and selling the rallies: ""I'm struggling to see how all these problems could disappear from one day to the other. Without being pessimist I don't think we're out of the woods yet"".
A string of data out of Europe on Thursday added to the gloom: German retail sales fell at the fastest rate in 11 years, British car production posted their biggest drop in a decade, and Italy fell into an economic recession.
Separate data from Refintiv's Lipper showed that the average cash allocations for equity funds in Germany and Britain, Europe's two biggest economies, had reached in 2018 their highest in at least six years at 7 and 3.7 percent respectively.
European equity funds cash allocations: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BbqOa4
""CASH IS KING""
Many fund managers plan to use their firepower to snap up bargains during sell-offs, but one problem they face is the lack of companies that fit their criteria.
Once high-flying stocks like big tech or luxury groups or even the battered car sector appear to be still too exposed to risks of a slowdown, especially in China, while companies in sectors less exposed to the cycle look already over-valued. 
""I'm keeping the money until there is enough visibility and to be opportunistic during the earnings season,"" said Michele Pedroni, fund manager at Decalia Asset Management in Geneva.
""Now more than before cash is king and it will likely remain so for a while,"" he added. 
The difficulty in framing investment decisions is reflected in the wide range of forecasts concerning earnings growth. 
In Europe, for example, most strategists expect a 4-percent earnings growth this year, while the consensus still points to around 7 percent and some forecast negative growth. Global earnings growth have also been downsized.
Such uncertainty had led Pedroni to more than double his cash buffer to nearly 7-8 percent over the last few months. 
On top of that, if the slowdown is too pronounced, earnings may come under more pressure even though central banks may turn more dovish, while if growth resumes monetary policy tightening of could return to scare investors. 
This conundrum is another incentive to keep cash high. 
""People are sitting on cash,"" said Willem Sels, chief market strategist at HSBC Private Banking. 
""We need to wait a little bit before we get more economic data or more news on the political side especially on China and U.S. tariffs for people to gather that confidence,"" he added.
In the fourth quarter of 2018 when global stocks lost 13 percent, investors poured $190 billion in money-market funds, the biggest inflow in a decade, according to Lipper from Refinitiv. Another $2.8 billion were added so far this month.

507,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>","Japan's Honda Motor third-quarter profit drops 40 percent on discounting, quality costs","TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd on Friday reported a 40.2 percent drop in third-quarter operating profit, missing market expectations due to higher discounting and quality-related costs.
Japan's third-biggest automaker posted profit of 170.1 billion yen ($1.56 billion) for October-December, from 284.5 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.
The result compared with the 208.8 billion yen median of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Honda kept its full-year profit forecast at 790 billion yen, though it now assumes the domestic currency will trade around 111 yen to the U.S. dollar through March 31, from a previous forecast for 110 yen.
The weaker profit comes as Honda faces easing global demand for cars and the possibility of a new trade deal between Japan and the United States, while investing heavily in self-driving and low-emission vehicle technology to keep pace with rivals.
Honda's global automobile sales came in at 1.41 million vehicles in October-December, versus 1.34 million a year earlier, boosted by rising sales at home and in Asia.
Honda sold 498,000 units in North America during the period, up from 491,000 a year earlier, bucking the trend of slowing demand in the United States. But profitability took a hit from an increase in selling incentives, the company said.
In China, another key market where sales have also cooled after years of growth, Honda sold around 1.43 million vehicles in 2018, down slightly on the previous year. While sales in the past few months have held up against an overall market slowdown, Honda was stung earlier in the year by a quality issue with its Civic sedan, the CR-V SUV crossover and other popular models.
Honda and other automakers in China, the world's largest auto market, are bracing for a tough 2019 after weakness in sales emerged last year following years of strong growth as the country's growing middle class snapped up new cars.
China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers has said it expects to see flat sales of around 28.1 million units in 2019, after the market contracted for the first time in more than two decades last year.
Motorcycle sales have been on the rise in the past year or so due to a boost in demand in Southeast Asia. Third-quarter global sales totaled 5.01 million motorcycles versus 4.87 million a year earlier.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:12AM ET</span>","Budweiser spends big on Super Bowl, targets small markets","By Philip Blenkinsop and Jarrett Renshaw
BRUSSELS/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - This Bud's for you. 
At least, that is what Anheuser-Busch InBev hopes as it strives to reach more than 100 million U.S. TV viewers during Sunday’s Super Bowl, promoting vintage brands such as Budweiser and Bud Light.
The world’s largest brewer will not say how much it is spending for nearly six minutes of commercials, but industry sources estimate it is more than $50 million. That is up from the $42 million that Kantar Media said the brewer spent for four minutes of ad time last year.
It is only part of the company's strategy to recapture market share from craft beers and Mexican imports. 
Brendan Whitworth, the head of sales for U.S. arm Anheuser-Busch, told Reuters the company would retain its big, national campaigns but also push ahead with its new strategy of tailoring brand marketing to individual American cities.
“The things we've started to work on this year, we're starting to see real results. We're looking forward to scaling up those localized programs even more,"" he said. 
The Super Bowl’s huge and diverse audience has makers of cars, beer and other consumer goods scrambling to create eye-catching commercials that are sometimes more memorable than the game. Budweiser this year will bring back its iconic Clydesdale horses, while telling drinkers that the beer is produced with renewable energy from wind power. Bud Light has continued its mock medieval ad series.
Driven by the need to pay off some $100 billion from its 2016 purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB), the company, which is known for acquisitions and cost savings, has made top-line growth its priority. U.S. management, overhauled in late 2017, believes it is on course to rebound in the company's biggest market. Part of that is the local-ad focus and fresh versions of 143-year-old staple Budweiser, as well as Bud Light – available now in an orange flavor.
The two main brands make up 56 percent of its U.S. beer sales, according to market research company Euromonitor International. That is down from more than 60 percent in 2013. Whitworth, a former Marine, CIA officer and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc director, said the goal is to boost the brand's shares and eventually halt their sales decline.
AB InBev has a 36.4 percent share of the U.S. beer market, according to Euromonitor, followed by Molson Coors and Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). 
In general, mainstream lagers including Bud and Bud Light have fallen, while the shares of craft and imports have risen, according to market research group Nielsen. Drinkers have also shifted to wine and spirits.
Executives at Heineken, the world's second largest beer maker, have said brewers need to work together to win back drinkers. Industry leaders say there still is a space for mainstream beer, which is cheaper and less caloric than many crafts.
""When (fans)are watching an NFL game, that's a four to five hour experience... I'm not sure it's a craft moment,"" said Jonnie Cahill, Heineken USA's chief marketing officer.
Given recent trends, Anheuser-Busch needs the equivalent of a 'Hail Mary' pass. Its share of beer sales in the United States, its biggest market, is set to have declined 0.50 percentage points in 2018 after a 0.75 drop in 2017. That may seem slight, but the trend is in the wrong direction.
A return to growth is not imminent.
""It's a supertanker and it's not going to turn on a six-pence. I think it's going to be a slow journey,"" said Trevor Stirling, a London-based beverage analyst at Bernstein Research.
AB InBev's share of the U.S. beer market has declined every year but one since its formation in 2008, when Belgium-based InBev bought America’s Anheuser-Busch. Budweiser has steadily fallen. Bud Light’s share last rose in 2012, when it rolled out an offshoot: Bud Light Lime-A-Rita, a margarita-flavored brew with double the alcohol and calories of Bud Light.
Despite the revival, Anheuser-Busch said it has learned that the company should not stray too far from a brand's roots.
""Those extensions, they didn't necessarily reinforce the mother brand's position,"" Whitworth said. 
The brewer removed ""Bud Light"" from Lime-a-Rita cans this year.
Last summer, it launched Bud Light Orange, brewed with orange peels. The product, with slightly more calories, is sweet and fruity, akin to an orange soda with alcohol, some drinkers say.
Whitworth said it was one of the industry’s most successful new products of 2018, boosting sales and margins and bringing in more female drinkers. The company hopes some Bud Light Orange drinkers will become regular Bud Light fans.
Bud Light has partnerships with 28 of the 32 NFL teams, including this season’s finalists, the Los Angeles Rams and the Boston-based New England Patriots. But its marketing efforts with them have been modest to date, including special cans showing each team's logo.
Earlier this season, Bud Light focused on Cleveland, whose team, the Browns, was experiencing one of the longest losing streaks in the sport. When the Browns finally won, the brewer set up ""victory fridges"" in bars across the city. Bud Light's share of core beer sales there grew as a result, Whitworth said.
Citing another localized effort, Whitworth pointed to Philadelphia, the nation's sixth largest city. Bud Light offered free beer to fans of the Eagles when they won their first Super Bowl in 2018. This season the company unveiled a statue to commemorate the “Philly Special,"" a trick play in which the quarterback turned receiver for a touchdown in the championship game.
Whitworth said the approach led to Bud Light sales growth of 9 percent in Philadelphia in the first half of 2018.
""They had an army of people handing out beer at the parade,” said Pete Ciarrocchi, chief of Chickie and Pete's, a popular chain of sports bars in the Philadelphia area.
The brewer's U.S. arm is hoping the sales boost will help build long-term loyalty.
In one potentially positive sign, Philadelphian Peter Rosa, who normally chooses regional craft brands such as Dogfish Head and Troeg, said he turned to Bud Light this season when watching his beloved Eagles.

""I have become superstitious and will only drink Bud Light during Eagles games,"" he said.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Assault reported by 'Empire' actor condemned by family as 'hate crime',"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The family of television actor Jussie Smollett, who plays a gay character on the hip-hop musical drama ""Empire,"" spoke out on Thursday to condemn the assault he reported suffering in Chicago at the hands of two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs.
Chicago police said detectives have been unable to obtain cell phone records to ""independently verify"" a key part of Smollett's story - that he was talking with his manager by phone at the time he was accosted.
Smollett, an African-American who is openly gay in real life, has not commented publicly, but his publicist issued a statement attributed to his family that read:
""Our beloved son and brother, Jussie, was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime.""
It added that Smollett had ""told the police everything"" and that ""his story has never changed.""
But NBC News, citing police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, reported Smollett himself had refused to turn over his cell phone or phone records to investigators to confirm the call to his manager.
""Cell phone records were not provided to investigators when asked,"" Guglielmi confirmed in an email to Reuters while declining to clarify who failed to furnish them. 
Guglielmi also said police had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of both Smollett and his manager that they were on the phone together at the time of the alleged attack in the early hours of Tuesday. 
Late on Wednesday, investigators released a pair of images from surveillance video showing two ""potential persons of interest"" sought for questioning in what police said they are treating as a ""possible hate crime.""
The two figures, seen only in silhouette, are pictured walking together down a dimly lit sidewalk between a snow-covered median strip and the side of a building. Police said footage from additional cameras was being reviewed. 
Police accounts say Smollett reported two men approached him on the street shouting racial and homophobic slurs, then struck him in the face, doused him with an ""unknown chemical substance"" and wrapped a rope around his neck before fleeing.
Smollett took himself to a hospital but was not seriously hurt, police said.
The news spread quickly on social media, with many expressing outrage while others suggested the story was a hoax. In releasing the surveillance camera images on Twitter, police said detectives ""are taking this development seriously.""
President Donald Trump gave further credence to the incident in remarks to reporters, saying the attack on Smollett was ""horrible"" and ""doesn't get worse,"" Variety reported.

""Empire"" debuted on the Fox network in 2015 and has earned multiple Emmy nominations. Smollett plays the character Jamal Lyon, a member of the family that is the focus of the show.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 11:26PM ET</span>",A matter of life and death? UK stockpiles drugs as no-deal Brexit feared,"By Edward Baran
LONDON (Reuters) - With just 56 days until Britain leaves the EU, Jo Elgarf has begun stockpiling food in case politicians fail to strike an exit deal, but she says she cannot do the same with vital drugs her disabled daughter needs.
Four-year-old Nora has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and relies on imported Epilim and Keppra daily to stop her suffering seizures. Elgarf wants to stock up on the drugs in case supplies are hit but she can't because they are only available on a monthly prescription. 
For Nora, ""this could be matter of life and death,"" Elgarf told Reuters at her home in southwest London.
""It could mean being sent off in an ambulance to hospital with a massive seizure that lasts five minutes plus. She cannot miss those medicines. There's no ifs and buts about it and we cannot use alternatives either.""
With the clock ticking, British lawmakers are still struggling to agree a withdrawal treaty with the European Union, having comprehensively rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's agreement last month.
The default position means Britain will leave on March 29 without a deal in place unless something can be agreed beforehand. That has led to fears that supply chains will be severely disrupted leading to shortages of food and medicines.
According to the British government, about three-quarters of medicines used by the state-run National Health Service (NHS) come via the EU. May, a Type 1 diabetic, has said she herself relies on insulin produced in another EU country.
WORLD'S BIGGEST FRIDGE BUYER
Last August, Health Secretary Matt Hancock outlined plans to ensure Britain had an extra six weeks of supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit. 
In January, he said Britain had bought 5,000 fridges to hold medicines, making him the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, and secured warehouse space.
""Making sure patients continue to have access to the medicines they need is paramount...,"" said health minister responsible for Brexit planning Stephen Hammond.
""We are working extremely closely with industry to make sure there are significant supplies of these drugs in the UK,"" Hammond wrote in an article last week.
But some Britons do not share that confidence, and anecdotal evidence from newspaper readers suggests people are stockpiling everything from children's painkillers to medicines for serious conditions. 
For Elgarf, a member of anti-Brexit Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group ""48 per cent Preppers"" - a reference to the percentage that voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum - that is not an option, and that has left her fearful.
""It doesn’t matter even if I had all the money in the world, I can’t go and buy these medicines because they are prescription-only. I have no way of securing my child’s future,"" she said.
It is not just patients and their families who are concerned. 
The chief executive of a body running hospitals in Birmingham, England's second-biggest city, warned last week there was a risk operations could be canceled because of a drug shortage.
""In the event of a chaotic, no-deal exit, many NHS trusts could quickly run out of vital medical supplies,"" Dr Dave Rosser wrote in a memo to his board of directors.
He said ""well-informed and non-political NHS sources"" had estimated goods from Europe across the English Channel ""could be reduced to between one-third and one-fifth of current daily volumes for a period of at least some months.""
According to the Brexit Health Alliance, an industry body, 45 million patient packs go to the EU from the UK every month, and 37 million packs go the other way. 
""Any divergence from these harmonized standards by the UK in the future, and a lack of agreement on cooperation with the EU on medicines and medical devices, would mean that supply chains are at risk,"" it said. 
One unintended consequence of the concern is that patients stocking up on medicines might bring about problems themselves. 
""Hospitals, pharmacies, (family doctor) surgeries and patients should not stockpile medicines at any point during this process,"" health minister Hammond said.

""Doing so risks shortages for other patients. If everyone does what they are supposed to, we are confident the supply of medicines will continue uninterrupted whatever the Brexit outcome.""

John Brumby, a former premier of the state of Victoria, will leave the world's biggest maker or telecommunications equipment on March 1 after eight years as a director of it's Australian subsidiary.
Brumby's exit reduces Huawei's influence in Canberra at a time when Western nations increase scrutiny of Chinese telcoms equipment makers over concern that China's government could use their products for espionage. Huawei says the concern is unfounded.
Brumby was a key figure in Huawei's unsuccessful efforts to prevent Australia's conservative government banning the company from participating in the country's fifth-generation (5G) communications network last year.
""The timing of my retirement from the board is completely unrelated to any recent commentary regarding China and Huawei,"" Brumby said in an emailed statement.
""I remain a strong supporter of closer ties between Australia and China, particularly in the fields of investment, trade, education and R&D.""
Huawei has been under siege since the arrest of its chief financial officer in Canada in December at the behest of the United States. The U.S. Justice Department has accused Huawei of bank fraud and conspiring to steal trade secrets. Huawei denies wrongdoing.
Though barred from Australia's 5G network, Huawei has maintained its presence in the region and has secured a series of contracts in the face of Australian objection.

""Brumby, as a former premier, carries weight as a lobbyist. Losing someone of the stature will hurt Huawei's efforts to prosecute its case and to be allowed to expand in the region,"" said Haydon Manning, professor of politics at Flinders University in South Australia.

513,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 10:47PM ET</span>",Australia's biggest lender may turn biggest loser after powerful public inquiry,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's biggest bank has for years generated blockbuster profits by focusing on retail customers and home mortgages while its competitors sought to build exposure to business and farm lending, even forays offshore.
But Commonwealth Bank of Australia's grassroots strategy may now be its undoing, investors and analysts say, as a powerful government inquiry promises to bring unprecedented regulatory attention — and new rules — to the country's banking market.
Investors are pricing in curbs on major income generators for retail banking expected to flow out of the Royal Commission’s final report which will be handed down on Monday.
Practices including ongoing ""trailing"" commissions used to reward sales staff, and overly optimistic methods to determine how much money a retail customer can borrow are expected to be targeted, both areas where analysts say CBA has more exposure than its ""Big Four"" rivals - National Australia Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac Banking Corp.
CBA also has the highest proportion of mortgages and credit cards in its overall debt book. 
""Being forced to have tighter lending standards will impact all of them, but it will probably impact CBA more,"" said Matthew Ryland, portfolio manager at Greencape Capital, which holds bank shares.
CBA declined comment because it was in a blackout period ahead of its half-year results announcement on Feb. 6.
Graphic on share prices: https://tmsnrt.rs/2SgBQUZ
SHARES HIT
As the Royal Commission made headlines last year with witness accounts of customer rip-offs across the financial services sector, shares of all the major retail banks fell in anticipation of enforced structural changes that would result. A housing downturn and global equities turbulence further weighed.
CBA has fallen less than its rivals since the start of the inquiry but 14 analysts polled by Refinitiv predict it will lag an expected rally after the commission recommendations.
Analysts on average have a 12-month target price for CBA just 4.2 percent higher than its current value. 
Shares of NAB, the least consumer-focused bank and largest business lender, are seen rising 18.8 percent from their current level, while ANZ, which also has less exposure to consumer lending, is forecast to rise 13.1 percent.
""They are mainly business banks so growth will probably be better for them,"" said TS Lim, a banking analyst at Bell Potter Securities. ""For the likes of (CBA), they are very, very dependent on interest income, and the wholesale funding cost is creeping up slowly.""
Citi estimates CBA has made 80 percent of its profit growth in the past two years from home mortgages, and now has CBA as the only big bank without a ""buy"" rating. Of the majors, CBA has the most ""short"" positions, or shareholdings of people betting the stock price will fall, according to Australian stock exchange data.
At the inquiry last year, CBA chief executive Matt Comyn said the bank had started applying stricter reviews to check people's ability to pay home loans, checking applicants' expenses individually rather than using a formula to estimate out-goings. 
Should the Royal Commission recommend banning the formulas, CBA, which still uses that method on about 75 percent of loan applications, would be under pressure to spend more money improving its credit approval processes. 
VERTICAL DISINTEGRATION
All Australia's large banks including CBA sought to grow through the early 2000s by buying wealth management and insurance businesses and cross-selling a suite of services to customers.
But while ANZ pursued an Asia strategy and NAB tried its hand in the United Kingdom, CBA fixed its domestic stronghold by buying Western Australian rural lender BankWest in 2008 and amassing a team of thousands of financial planners. 
When the banks reversed course around 2015 and began carving off non-core assets to avoid competition, CBA shed its insurance and fund management subsidiaries, as well as offshore retail banking businesses. 
It was left with a sales force and branch network larger than rivals which depended more on paying commissions to push products through brokers.
At the bank's annual results in August, Comyn backed the strategy of focusing on its ""leading retail banking franchise in the country which we're going to continue to invest in and strengthen further"".
It may not be all bad news for CBA and its investors, some of whom say CBA's sheer size may work in its favor during the uncertainty as customers stick to what they know. 
Windfalls from sales of non-core businesses are also on the cards.
Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) expect CBA will return about A$3 billion to shareholders by 2020 as it completes the sales of various assets.
""Some people would suggest that poses the biggest risk but that's not where we are,"" said Sean Sequeira, chief investment officer at Alleron Investment Management, referring to CBA's retail exposure.
However, several analysts said the bank's retail-first strategy made CBA one of the most affected if the Royal Commission makes lenders disclose account-keeping fees, increase regulation of sales bonuses, or use enforce stricter controls to approve loans.

""We favor the commercially-orientated banks (ANZ and NAB) over retail oriented ... due to the Royal Commission's focus on consumer lending and financial advice,"" Citi analysts said in a recent note.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>","USW union, Shell agree to raise refinery worker pay by 11 percent: sources","HOUSTON (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) and Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co reached a tentative agreement on Thursday that sources familiar with the deal said would boost pay by 11 percent over three years for 30,000 U.S. refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers.
Workers represented by the USW will receive a 3.5 percent pay raise in each of the first two years of the deal and a 4 percent raise in the final year, the sources said.
The agreement between the union and Shell came about nine hours before the current contract was to expire at 12:01 a.m. on Friday.
The union entered talks with lead oil company negotiator Shell on Jan. 16 seeking an 8 percent-a-year pay increase for hourly workers. USW-represented refinery workers make about $40 an hour after four years on the job.
In 2015, following a sometimes bitter strike at 12 refineries and three chemical plants affecting 7,000 workers, Shell, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and the USW agreed to a 12 percent pay increase over four years.
USW International President Leo Gerard praised the union members' commitment in a statement about the deal.
""We reached a tentative agreement because of our members' solidarity and the industry's willingness to negotiate a contract that is fair to both parties,"" Gerard said.
The deal will be combined with local agreements at each plant to form the contract for individual sites. Ratification votes by union members will be conducted locally. 
""We believe this agreement respects the needs of our employees, underpins our resolute commitment to safety and ensures the economic health of Shell's facilities,"" company spokesman Ray Fisher said in a statement.
The two sides also agreed to keep the company portion of the health insurance premium at 80 percent.
Small plants with less 150 union members will add one union health and safety representative under the deal. Also, plants that have not adopted a fatigue reduction standard in earlier contracts, will commit to do so.
Fatigue was found by federal investigators to be a factor in the 2005 explosion at  BP  (LON:BP) Plc's Texas City, Texas, refinery that killed 15 workers and injured 180 other people. 

The contract covers 30,000 workers at plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), BP Plc,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp and Delek US Holdings Inc.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 08:52PM ET</span>",Amazon sales outlook falls short after record holiday quarter,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, warning that new regulations in India had created uncertainty around one of its key growth markets and saying it would step up investments in 2019.
Shares of the company fell 5 percent to $1,635 after the bell.
The outlook overshadowed Amazon's record sales and profit during the holiday season. Fast and free shipping helped the world's largest online retailer boost revenue by 20 percent. A lucrative cloud computing business, as well as fees that merchants pay Amazon to ship and advertise their products, has fattened the company's once-thin profit margin.
Net income jumped 63 percent to $3 billion for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts' estimates.
Yet investors focused their attention on Amazon's international operation, where the company has long lost money in the hopes of future profit. Though its international operating loss shrunk to $642 million in the quarter from $919 million a year earlier, new regulations in India are poised to take a toll. The rules seek to protect local businesses by prohibiting foreign e-commerce companies from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters that the ""situation in India is a bit fluid right now.""
The company began removing a wide array of products from its India website late on Thursday to comply with the new foreign investment curbs that kick in on Feb. 1, Reuters reported.
Still, Olsavsky said, ""India remains a good long-term opportunity."" 
Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird Equity Research, said, ""The issues in India are taking a toll on the Q1 outlook, even as growth overall slows domestically. Not a bad report, but there are enough questions where (the) stock will likely be under pressure.""
HIGHER SPENDING
The company forecast net sales of between $56 billion and $60 billion for the first quarter, missing analysts' average estimate of $60.77 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The guidance includes two percentage points of negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates.
Olsavsky said that investments would increase this year. The company had little need to splurge in 2018 thanks to prior spending on warehouses, headcount and other areas, boosting profit. But this year investments will rise, though Olsavsky did not detail where or how much.
""As a result, the profit story in ‘19 may not be as good as it was in ‘18,"" said Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson, adding that this might not be a bad thing.
""If they are stepping on the accelerator, that means they like what they’re seeing, and it’s worthy of more investment,"" he said.
Amazon forecast operating income will be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion this quarter, compared with $1.9 billion a year earlier.
A large chunk of the company's hiring has gone to Amazon Web Services, its lucrative business selling data storage and computing power in the cloud. Revenue for the unit surged 45.3 percent to $7.43 billion, beating an average estimate of $7.26 billion.
Overall, net sales for the fourth quarter were $72.38 billion and beat analysts' average estimate of $71.87 billion on the back of a strong holiday season, which includes the major U.S. shopping event Black Friday. 
The results demonstrate that Amazon continued its ""relentless assault"" on other retailers over Christmas, Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said.
Amazon said tens of millions of shoppers signed up for its loyalty club Prime during the season - more than in any prior quarter - helping boost revenue from subscription fees 25 percent to $4.0 billion. The company said last year it has more than 100 million Prime members globally.
This expansive customer base has lured merchants to sell goods on the company's marketplace, to the point where more than half of products sold on Amazon come from third-parties.
Making Amazon more profitable still are ad sales. The company now ranks alongside Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) as titans in marketing, letting these same merchants pay for high placement in Amazon's search results.
Ad sales and ""other"" revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

517,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 06:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Payrolls Expected to Rise 165,000
The employment report will dominate market tone before the bell Friday.
The Labor Department will issue the January numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 165,000 for the month and that the unemployment rate stayed at 3.9%.
Average hourly earnings are expected to post a monthly gain of 0.3%.
At 10 AM ET, the Institute of Supply Management will release its manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) for January. Economists forecast a slight tick down to 54.2.
And the University of Michigan will issue its final measure of January consumer sentiment at 10 AM ET, expected to come in at 90.8.
2. Amazon Could Weigh
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may drag on technology shares tomorrow, with the stock down about 5% in after-hours trading.
On one hand, Amazon handily beat earnings expectations and topped revenue forecasts.
On the other, its revenue guidance fell short of estimates again, its net income guidance looked cautious and its subscription services revenue growth was much lower than recent quarters.
Also in tech, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) battle against other major players continued after it revoked Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) enterprise developer certificate, as it did with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) earlier, for an app that violated policies.
3. Oil Companies, Honeywell to Report
In earnings tomorrow, major energy companies continue to report.
Following better-than-expected results from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) today, Dow components  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) weigh in.
For Exxon, analysts predict a profit of $1.08 per share on revenue of about $71.3 billion.
And for Chevron, forecasts are for earnings of $1.84 a share, with revenue of about $41 billion.
Industrial heavyweight Honeywell (NYSE:HON) will also issue numbers.
And Wall Street might pay a little more attention of earnings from New York Knicks owner Madison Square Garden (NYSE:MSG) after the Knicks reportedly traded star forward Kristaps Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks today."
518,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Airbus A380 under threat as Emirates weighs rejigged order: sources,"By Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell
PARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates is exploring switching some orders for the world's largest jetliner, the Airbus A380, to the smaller A350 in a move raising new doubts about the future of Europe's iconic superjumbo, people familiar with the matter said.
The Gulf carrier, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in more than 100 A380s, has been struggling to finalize a deal to buy another 36 to keep assembly lines open, due to differences with engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR). 
Now, Airbus is looking closely at closing A380 factories sooner than expected as part of a reshuffle of orders, with Chief Executive Tom Enders unlikely to leave the situation unresolved when his mandate ends in April, they said.
A person familiar with the matter said Airbus was looking ""extremely seriously"" at setting the timetable for a shutdown but said no decision had been taken.
Airbus said in a statement after Reuters first published news of the talks that it ""confirms it is in discussions with Emirates airline in relation to its A380 contract"". But it said details of negotiations were confidential.
Emirates and Rolls-Royce declined to comment. 
The A380s have been used to promote a luxury lifestyle with the Emirates brand, featuring lounges and showers on board, and were part of the set for a 2017 advertisement with Hollywood actor Jennifer Aniston. It says the jets, some with over 600 seats, have helped the airline at slot-constrained airports.
But sales of such four-engined planes are tumbling as many airlines switch to smaller and less thirsty twin-engined jets like the A350 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 due to improving size and range.
Emirates announced the lifeline order for up to 36 superjumbos worth as much as $16 billion at list prices a year ago, throwing a lifeline to the program's roughly 3,000 workers and securing its future for at least another decade.
But a year-long impasse between Emirates and Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings has so far blocked the order.
WORKAROUND
Airbus is trying to broker a complex workaround which could see Emirates take smaller jets also powered by Rolls-Royce while it tries to secure homes for as many A380s as possible, with British Airways recently expressing interest.
Airbus has dangled the prospect of closing A380 production before, and industry sources say such maneuvers can be a negotiating tactic and the talks remain difficult to predict.
But time is running out for the A380 with few airlines willing to spend the sums invested by Emirates, which has made it a backbone of its global network alongside the Boeing 777.
The production line is ""untenable"", a senior industry source said. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said closing production could release capacity for painting and other future production.
If confirmed, a decision by Emirates to order the A350 would ease a separate headache for Airbus and engine partner Rolls-Royce after Emirates axed an A350 order in 2014. 
Airbus and Rolls are keen to maintain a foothold at the largest Arab carrier and prevent Boeing filling the gap with more of its General Electric-powered 777s. The A350 competes with both the Boeing 777 and smaller 787.
Any deal depends on the backing of Emirates which sources say holds many of the cards in the sometimes heated discussions. 
Rolls continues to owe the Dubai carrier penalties for underperformance on Trent 900 engines already in its A380 fleet, giving Emirates leverage to win a good deal on A350 engine maintenance.

Also likely to weigh a game plan, analysts said, is Boeing. It blocked an earlier Airbus bid to put the A350 back in Emirates with a draft deal for 40 787s in 2017, and is seen likely to renew the effort as it negotiates to close the deal.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>",Germany drops F-35 from fighter tender; Boeing F/A-18 and Eurofighter to battle on,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will pick either the Eurofighter or Boeing's F/A-18 fighter jet to replace its Tornado warplanes, knocking Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter out of a tender worth billions of euros, Defence Ministry sources said on Thursday.
The ministry will make a final decision after receiving detailed information from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus about the aircraft, which must be able to carry U.S. nuclear weapons to fulfill Germany's obligations to NATO, the sources said. 
No timetable for a decision was given, but the process could take time since the U.S. government will have to certify both jets to carry the nuclear weapons. Germany has 85 operational Tornado jets, but not all are equipped to carry nuclear weapons.
The German air force will also move ahead with long-awaited plans to replace its 33 oldest Eurofighter jets, now used mainly for air policing or training, with new, more capable Eurofighters in coming years, the sources said.
That will translate into orders worth up to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for Airbus, according to sources familiar with the issue.
In marketing the F/A-18, Boeing had underscored its high readiness rates, relatively low cost and strong electronic attack capabilities, arguments that resonated in military circles.
The decision marks a big setback for Lockheed, the top U.S. arms maker, which had hoped to add to recent F-35 sales to other European countries, including Belgium.
Germany's air force chief of staff was fired last year after he expressed a clear preference for the F-35. The ministry later said it favored a ""European solution"".
Airbus welcomed the news about the Eurofighter replacement purchases, and said it remained convinced that its jet offered the lowest-risk prospect for replacing the Tornado jets.
Lockheed said it had not been officially notified of a German decision. It said the F-35 offered the most capability, lowest life-cycle cost of any fighter on the market, and long-term industrial and economic opportunities.
Boeing declined to comment, as did the U.S. embassy in Berlin.
Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition, had argued against rushing into any decision to buy U.S. aircraft and demanded closer study.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a conservative, had promised a decision on the procurement plans by the end of 2018, but her ministry became mired in scandals over the use of outside consultants and other issues. 
Military officials argue that the Tornadoes, which entered service in 1983, need urgent replacement due to rising maintenance costs. Sources familiar with the matter say it could cost around 8 billion euros to keep the planes flying past 2030.
Sources familiar with the process last year had said the ministry wanted to split the order between one of the two U.S. planes and the Eurofighter, which is built by Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo SpA. But it now appears Berlin will pick just one winner.

Paris, Germany's closest European partner, had warned that buying the F-35 in particular could derail plans to develop a new Franco-German fighter by 2040.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, but gained 8% for the month. The S&P 500 rose 0.86%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.37%.
Investors digested a slew of earnings today, including a downbeat report from DowDuPoint that weighed on the blue chip index.
DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) shares sank 9% after the conglomerate reported revenue of $20.1 billion, missing expectations for $20.95 billion. Earnings were marginally ahead of estimates at $0.88 a share.
Materials slipped 1.5% for the day.
But there was also a rally in tech stocks as investors cheered a bullish report from Facebook, prompting a string of bullish calls from Wall Street analysts.
Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) fourth-quarter profit topped analysts' estimates, driven by a surge in advertising income on the back of impressive user additions.
“This story is starting to get good,” Morgan Stanley said in a note, as it raised its price target on Facebook's stock to $190.
Elsewhere on the earnings front,  Charter Communications ' (NASDAQ:CHTR) above-consensus quarterly results sent its shares surging 14%. But Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) miss on the top line dragged its share price 2% lower.
The energy sector, meanwhile, delivered a modest boost to the broader index as falling oil prices limited gains.
A positive turn of events in U.S.-China talks moments before the bell also triggered some rapid-fire buying across Wall Street.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said in letter that he hopes to accelerate the 90-day consultation between the two parties in bid to strike a deal with the United States. The vice premier also confirmed Beijing would ramp up purchases of U.S. agriculture products, including five million tonnes of soybeans per day from U.S. farmers.
President Donald Trump told reporters he was confident ""every point (on trade) will be agreed to"" when he meets with President Xi Jinping, though he appeared reluctant to provide further details about a future meeting.
Trump said he had no plans to extend the current 90-day trade war beyond March 1, despite U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer conceding that there was still much work to be done to reach a consensus on a trade deal.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 04:49PM ET</span>",Brazilian anger unabated by Vale vows after dam disaster,"By Gram Slattery and Marta Nogueira
BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Residents devastated by a mining dam burst in Brazil that may have killed more than 300 people reacted on Thursday with indifference and in many cases anger to miner Vale SA's pledges to pay victims' families and improve safety.
""Too Late"" read newspaper Estado de Minas in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, after Vale, the world's largest iron ore miner, said it would take up to 10 percent of its production offline and spend 5 billion reais ($1.36 billion) to decommission 10 dams like the one that collapsed at its Corrego do Feijao mine last Friday.
With 110 people confirmed dead and another 238 missing, according to firefighters' count on Thursday evening, the tailings dam collapse in the town of Brumadinho may be Brazil's deadliest-ever mine disaster. In recent days, Vale has vowed to keep paying taxes on the paralyzed mine and donate 100,000 reais to the family of each victim.
For some people mourning loved ones, those pledges looked derisory. 
""It's shameful for Vale,"" said Dilson Menezes de Oliveira, 58, who stood looking at the spot where his 32-year-old cousin lies buried after the inn where he was staying at was engulfed by a wave of mud and toxic waste.
""So many innocent people died. And now this compensation of 100,000 reais. It's nothing."" 
On Thursday, state labor courts froze more than 800 million reais ($219 million) of Vale's assets as compensation for victims. That followed court orders over the weekend freezing 11.8 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in assets to cover rescue efforts and damages. The company had around 24 billion reais in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter.
A ministerial task force convened by President Jair Bolsonaro began drawing up a unified legislative plan to improve safety, oversight and the licensing of dams.
A person with direct knowledge of the proceedings said the proposals would likely include executive orders and bills in Congress and take at least seven to 10 days to prepare.
HEALTH RISKS
Residents in the devastated town of Brumadinho were still learning of the fallout from the deadly mud flow.
Minas Gerais' state government said on Thursday that initial tests of the Paraopeba River, which was contaminated by the toxic mud, indicated that ""the water poses risks to human and animal health.""
It added that locals should not use Paraopeba River water for any purpose.
On Wednesday, United Nations human rights experts urged an official investigation into the incident. Federal and state prosecutors have already said they are seeking to make the matter a criminal case. 
After a meeting with Brazil's top prosecutor, Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman told journalists that he had no reason to think the company's executives would go to prison.
Schvartsman said the company was focused on paying families as soon as possible, and he had also discussed environmental issues with federal prosecutors. He has said the miner built its facilities to code and equipment had shown the dam was stable.
Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani said Vale planned to pay some 80 million reais to the municipality of Brumadinho over the next two years, in lieu of tax payments on the mining operations that had been suspended.
Along the mudslide that was once part of the hamlet of Corrego do Feijao, from which the mine takes its name, residents concentrated on trying to put their lives back in order.
""The focus of everything is looking for my brother,"" said Pedro Ferreira dos Santos, as he dug into the dirt, looking for his sibling's body. 
""My greatest desire is that he be found.""
In another setback for Vale, the city of Mangaratiba, in Rio de Janeiro, has temporarily shuttered the company's Ilha Guaíba (TIG) iron ore terminal, CBN radio reported on Thursday. According to the report, Vale was also fined 20 million reais for failing to submit environmental licenses.
The company said it had all necessary licenses and it would take all legal measures needed to resume operations there.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos' rocket company, Blue Origin, has signed a deal with Canada's Telesat to launch part of a satellite constellation aimed at providing speedy internet access to governments and businesses globally, the companies said on Thursday.
The contract adds an important customer to Blue Origin's manifest as Bezos' space venture works to grab a share of the lucrative but crowded launch services market with its still-in-development heavy-lift New Glenn rocket planned for 2021.
Telesat, backed by Loral Space & Communications Inc, said in October that it conducted the first-ever live test of in-flight broadband via a satellite in low-Earth orbit. It was targeting 2022 for broadband services from a constellation of nearly 300 satellites.
Blue Origin's rocket will propel some undisclosed portion of the constellation into orbit over a number of launches, the companies said.
Telesat's network will ""accelerate 5G expansion, bridge the digital divide with fiber-like high speed services into rural and remote communities, and set new levels of performance for commercial and government connectivity,"" the company said in a statement.
Telesat is among a number of competing ventures planning constellations that will beam down internet broadband from space. Those include McLean, Virginia-based OneWeb, which planned a first launch in February, and Elon Musk's SpaceX Starlink project, which is scrambling for a first launch later this year.
The Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates the global market for satellite-based broadband and television services is worth $127.7 billion, dwarfing the roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Bezos' rocket company is among a crop of billionaire-backed space ventures seeking to disrupt the legacy launch services market with reusable rocket technology.
Blue Origin's New Glenn launcher is likely to face fierce competition from heavy-lift rockets like SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan, a joint venture from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT).
In a key step, Telesat said it will choose between Europe's Airbus SE and a partnership between Thales Alenia Space and Maxar Technologies Inc to develop its constellation's ground and space systems.

Telesat also said it had an agreement with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc subsidiary Loon to build a control network for the constellation.

DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) shares sank 8% after the conglomerate reported revenue of $20.1 billion, missing the expectation for $20.95 billion. Earnings were marginally ahead of estimates at $0.88 a share.
The revenue miss was blamed on lower demand for automotive and appliance-related products, which experienced ""more than normal season slowdown,"" the company said.
Materials were also weighed down by a decline in  Celanese  as investors continued to digest the company's below-consensus fourth-quarter results reported earlier this week.
Celanese (NYSE:CE) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.38 a share on $1.69 billion in revenue, below expectations for earnings of $2.40 a share on revenue of $1.73 billion.
The company also offered a dour outlook on growth in the coming year.
""Assuming this slower start and expecting some fourth-quarter 2019 moderation, which we commonly see, we would anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings of approximately $10.50 per share,"" said Mark Rohr, chairman and chief executive officer.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Thursday it is cancelling two additional shifts at its Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly plants after CMS Energy Corp (NYSE:CMS) made an emergency appeal to users to conserve natural gas following a fire at a compressor station and during extreme winter cold. 
Separately, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Thursday it was suspending operations at a total of 13 Michigan plants and its Warren Tech Center, up from its prior announcement of 11 plants. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it had also taken steps to reduce energy use at its four Michigan plants supplied by CMS. The companies said the issue could impact them through Friday.
CMS, the parent company of Consumers Energy, took the unusual step of issuing an urgent appeal to 1.8 million Michigan customers on Wednesday asking them to lower their thermostats until Friday morning to ease the burden on the system that had record demand Thursday.
CMS Chief Executive Patricia Poppe said about 79 large users in Michigan including major automakers, other manufacturers and two universities had curtailed their natural gas usage. Along with individual consumers, usage had fallen by about 10 percent over anticipated demand, she said at a news conference.

The White House National Security Council weighed in on Twitter urging people in Michigan to listen to state and local authorities ""tonight and tomorrow re natural gas use in the coming days.""

550,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 01:08PM ET</span>",U.S. natgas use hits record during freeze; utilities urge conservation,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - Several utilities urged customers to cut back on power and gas use on Thursday during the brutal freeze blanketing the eastern half of the country after U.S. homes and businesses used record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday. 
Harsh winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the Midwest, causing at least a dozen deaths and forcing residents who pride themselves on their winter hardiness to huddle indoors.
As consumers cranked up heaters to escape the bitter cold, gas demand in the Lower 48 U.S. states jumped to a preliminary record high of 145.1 billion cubic feet per day on Wednesday, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
That topped the current all-time high of 144.6 bcfd set on Jan. 1, 2018. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day.
In Michigan, auto makers agreed to interrupt production schedules through Friday after local utility Consumers Energy made an emergency appeal to curtail gas use so it could manage supplies following a fire at a gas compressor station on Wednesday.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Thursday it canceled two additional shifts at its Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly plants and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it was suspending operations at a total of 13 Michigan plants and its Warren Tech Center.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it had also taken steps to reduce energy use at its four Michigan plants supplied by CMS.
Consumers, a unit of Michigan energy company CMS Energy Corp (NYSE:CMS), said that the Ray compressor station in Macomb County was partially back in service but urged all of its 1.8 million Michigan customers to continue their conservation efforts through Friday.
Elsewhere in Michigan, DTE Energy Inc asked its 2.2 million power customers to reduce electric use voluntarily to help safeguard the reliability of the regional grid.
PJM, the electric grid operator for all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois, said there were no reliability issues and noted that power demand had already peaked on Thursday below 140,000 megawatts.
That is well below the PJM region's all-time winter peak of 143,338 MW set on Feb. 20, 2015. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.
While the brutal cold boosts gas use for heating, it can also reduce production by freezing pipes in gathering systems in producing regions, called freeze-offs.

Gas production in the Lower 48 states was projected to fall to a four-month low of 84.9 bcfd on Thursday due primarily to freeze-offs in the Marcellus and Utica, the nation's biggest shale gas-producing region in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Refinitiv.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>","Sprint beats on revenue, loses fewer phone subscribers","By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Sprint Corp on Thursday posted third-quarter revenue that beat estimates while the U.S. wireless carrier lost fewer customers than expected even as it cut back on price promotions to improve financials. 
The company posted a net loss of 3 cents a share versus a net profit last year, when it benefited from a U.S. tax cut. Analysts had expected a loss of just 2 cent a share.
Chief Executive Officer Michel Combes told analysts during the earnings call that Sprint must complete its merger with T-Mobile US Inc to effectively compete against larger rivals Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). At the same time, it has pursued a plan to pull back on expensive price promotions to stabilize the business, which has struggled with negative perceptions of network quality.
Shares of Sprint, the No. 4 carrier with over 54 million total customers, were up 1.66 percent at $6.14 in morning trading. 
Sprint lost a net 26,000 so-called ""postpaid"" phone subscribers who pay a recurring bill during the third quarter ended Dec. 31, fewer than the 32,000 subscriber losses analysts had expected, according to research firm FactSet.
Total net operating revenue rose 4.4 percent to $8.60 billion, beating forecasts by analysts who had expected revenue of $8.43 billion. 
The company has focused on promoting data plans for devices like tablets and smartwatches, which helps customers stick with the carrier longer if they have more devices on the network.
Sprint reported a net loss of $141 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a net income of $7.16 billion, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier, when the company benefited from a change in U.S. tax laws.
Analysts were expecting the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In July, Sprint revamped its unlimited wireless plans to include more perks at higher prices, in order to make more money from customers on the plans.
But the company warned churn, or the rate of customer defections, could rise in the near-term due to the higher prices. Churn for the third quarter increased to 1.84 percent, up from 1.71 percent last year.

Sprint said it continues to expect cash capital expenditures between $5 billion to $5.5 billion.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 12:24PM ET</span>","General Electric sales top Wall Street estimates, shares rally","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co beat estimates for sales and cash flow in the fourth quarter and said on Thursday it had reached a tentative deal to settle a subprime mortgage case with U.S. regulators, sending its shares sharply higher.
GE stock soared nearly 15 percent to $10.45 as profits and sales rose in its aviation, healthcare and oil-and-gas businesses, offsetting nearly $1 billion in cumulative losses at its power and GE Capital units.
Many analysts and investors had braced for disappointing results and were relieved that new Chief Executive Larry Culp was able to show some improvement while being blunt about bad news. 
Culp offered only a scant forecast, however, saying details would come at a meeting to be scheduled soon.
Investors were largely unfazed. ""The only relevant data in the quarterly numbers is that actual sales and the free cash flow from the industrials business were better than expected,"" William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said. 
GE also announced a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over its subprime mortgage practices before the 2008 financial crisis. GE will pay a $1.5 billion civil penalty, which it had already set aside.
On a conference call, Culp ruled out selling GE's $40-billion aircraft leasing unit, quelling concerns about jettisoning one of the few profitable parts of GE Capital. 
While not providing forecasts, Culp set targets that matched what analysts and investors have been requesting: lifting GE's triple-B credit rating to single-A quality, reducing industrial debt and restoring the dividend. Culp did not set a time frame.
GE's lengthy presentation, however, contained numerous warnings and unknowns. Cash is likely to decline in 2019, but GE would not say by how much; GE is still in ""early innings"" of turning around its power business, where revenue will fall again in 2019; and GE will provide more detail about its toxic long-term care insurance liabilities in February, after taking a $6.2 billion charge and setting aside $15 billion to cover premium shortfalls last year. 
It also did not provide more detail on ongoing regulatory investigations of its accounting for long-term care policies and power-plant services contracts.
""The results are better than expected because expectations were so low,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. ""The company still faces the huge challenges of managing its mountain of debt and restoring investor confidence in the accuracy of its numbers."" 
The 2018 results cap an exceptionally bad year for GE that began with an $11 billion charge and disclosure of accounting investigations by U.S. regulators, and end with GE naming an outsider CEO keen to speed up $20 billion in asset sales and chip away at GE's massive debt.
The 127-year-old conglomerate also was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, had its credit ratings cut to three notches above junk, eliminated executive bonuses, slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny, restated earnings for the prior two years and saw a $10 billion fossil-fuel power acquisition turn sour as wind and solar power gained momentum while GE's gas-turbine business struggled with faulty turbine blades.
GE said its power unit took $400 million in charges in the fourth quarter to cover blade repairs at dozens of customers around the world and other costs. 
GE booked a $666 million profit for the fourth quarter and revenue rose 5 percent to $33.3 billion, above analyst estimates of $32.6 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Industrial free cash flow of $4.9 billion in the quarter, while down from last year, topped the $4 billion threshold that investors were looking to beat, Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch wrote in a note. He said GE had liquidated inventory and improved bill collection in renewables, but it was unclear whether those improvements could continue.
GE's ailing power division lost $872 million in the quarter and its GE Capital finance arm lost $177 million, it said. 

GE's profit totaled 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.29 a share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, GE earned 17 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 22 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 12:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Teva's generic EpiPen launch stalls months after approval,"By Michael Erman and Jilian Mincer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many of the largest U.S. pharmacies and drug distributors do not have Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd's generic version of the life-saving EpiPen allergy treatment five months after it was approved for sale in the United States, pharmacy chains and a group that tracks drug shortages told Reuters.
The short supply represents a missed opportunity for Teva to compete with Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV in a roughly $750 million a year U.S. market. Mylan's EpiPen dominates that market, but has been in short supply since May, leaving many patients and their families keen for alternatives.
""The generic version of EpiPen Auto-Injector is currently available and we are continuing to build supply,"" Teva said in an emailed statement. ""We are actively manufacturing and shipping product throughout the country.""
The company did not say why its drug was in short supply.
Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, received U.S. approval for its version of EpiPen in August after several years of delay. At the time, the company pledged its ""full resources to this important launch in the coming months.""
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hailed the product as a lower-cost option for patients who depend on access to the EpiPen and similar handheld devices that make it easier to deliver epinephrine in the case of a severe allergic reaction, such as to bee stings or exposure to peanuts.
Mylan's EpiPen has been in short supply due to manufacturing problems at the lone  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) plant that makes the auto-injectors.
""We are continuing to get panicked phone calls from parents because they can't get epinephrine for their kids,"" said Kim Mudd, nurse manager of Johns Hopkins University's pediatric allergy unit.
In late November, Teva said its generic EpiPen for adults was available in limited supply in the United States and promised that more of the product, as well as a version for children, would be available in 2019. Reuters checks in late January suggest that even the available supply has dwindled.
""We get reports from pharmacies and we've been able to confirm with the suppliers that they are on back order,"" said Erin Fox, a professor at the University of Utah.
Fox maintains an independent drug shortages list for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), and added the Teva version of EpiPen to the roster this week. The device also appears on the FDA list of drugs in shortage.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said it had received limited supplies of the Teva device late last year, but does not currently have any in stock. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is not currently carrying Teva's EpiPen in its pharmacies, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Fox said pharmacies are also currently unable to order the devices through major distributors  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) or AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp. An AmerisourceBergen spokeswoman declined to comment and Cardinal Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Walgreens said it currently has limited supply of certain generic epinephrine products, including Teva's, in some of its pharmacies. Cigna (NYSE:CI) Corp's Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) unit said it has limited supply of the Teva devices in its home delivery pharmacy. 
POTENTIAL PROFIT-BOOSTER 
Wall Street has viewed the EpiPen rival as a welcome profit-booster for Teva as it contends with sharply declining U.S. margins for its older generic medicines and a series of costly acquisitions. The drugmaker has fired thousands of employees and worked to reduce its debt.
When the device's approval was announced last year, Teva's U.S.-listed shares jumped about 6 percent. Wall Street analysts suggested then that it could add $250 million to Teva's revenue annually, and account for an additional 4 cents to 6 cents per share in earnings. 
Analysts, on average, expect the company to post earnings per share of $2.80 in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Teva's devices represented only 3 percent of the EpiPen market for the week of Jan. 18, according to a research note from Leerink citing IQVIA data on prescription volume. That is down from 7 percent a month earlier and compares with roughly the 64 percent market share held by Mylan's branded and authorized generic EpiPens. 
Lisa Gable, chief executive of patient advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education, had hoped Teva's approval would help alleviate the shortage of EpiPen devices, particularly as families look to renew prescriptions ahead of summer camp or the new school year.

    ""The community has been affected by shortages because of a relatively small supplier base,"" Gable said.

Leviathan, discovered in 2010, is one of the world's largest gas discoveries of the past decade. The rig's foundation, known as a platform jacket, arrived on a barge that sailed from Texas. Its topside is expected in several months. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
""Israel is becoming an energy power. Israel is independent, and is not dependent on anyone for its energy needs,"" Netanyahu told reporters at the site, about 120 km (75 miles) off Israel's Mediterranean coast.
Leviathan will be connected by a subsea pipeline to a production platform much closer to shore, just 10 km from a popular beach, angering some opposition lawmakers, environmentalists and residents.
They have demanded, with several unsuccessful petitions to Israel's Supreme Court, that the rig be pushed farther out to sea. But the arrival of the platform's massive legs effectively stomps out the protest and any doubt it created around the completion of Israel's largest energy project ever.
The project operator, Texas-based  Noble Energy  (NYSE:NBL) has a 39.66 percent stake in the field, while Israel's Delek Drilling holds a 45.34 percent share, and Ratio Oil has the remaining 15 percent.

(Reuters) - Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc said on Thursday e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc posted more than $1 billion in revenue in 2018, up from about $200 million a year earlier, the first official growth figures for the controversial vaping product.
Altria paid $12.8 billion to acquire a 35 percent stake in Juul in December 2018, getting a foothold in a segment that is quickly becoming an attractive alternative for smokers.
The cigarette maker risks cannibalizing some of its current customers but sees e-cigarettes as a path to growth.
E-cigarettes are a divisive topic in the public health community, offering a nicotine alternative to cigarettes without the same toxic and cancer-causing chemicals, but they have also become popular with teens, drawn to candy and dessert flavor varieties.
In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced curbs on sales of flavored e-cigarette products, including Juul's mango and cool cucumber, responding to concerns of underage use reaching epidemic proportion.
After the regulatory crackdown, Juul halted all promotional use of U.S. social media platforms and continued to monitor and remove inappropriate material from third-party accounts.
""We know more must be done,"" Altria Chief Executive Officer Howard Willard said on a post-earnings call. 
Altria said removing some flavors would impact the overall growth rate of Juul this year.
Juul's refill kit pod volumes grew nearly 600 percent in 2018 and also expects U.S. e-vapor volume to grow at a compounded annual rate of 15 percent to 20 percent through 2023, the company said.

Altria's shares were up 1.5 percent at $48.56 as the company also posted fourth-quarter profit that matched analysts expectations.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In Frankfurt and Paris, the flood of banking jobs predicted to arrive after Brexit is, for now, little more than a trickle.
An analysis of job postings on eight of the world's major investment bank websites show a modest push to recruit staff in other European cities but little to suggest London is set for a rapid demise as the region's top banking hub.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JP Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are seeking to fill 1,545 new roles in Britain, numbers up to January 22 show.
In Germany and France - the two countries predicted to see the biggest influx of financial services from Britain as a result of Brexit - just 301 roles have been listed.
Only Deutsche Bank is looking to hire more people in Germany than in Britain, with 133 German vacancies posted online compared to 132 in the UK.
""It isn't really a tsunami of hires,"" said Christine Kuhl, a partner with executive placement firm Odgers Berndtson in Frankfurt.
The figures do not capture numbers of existing employees who might relocate from London to other EU offices under contingency plans following Britain's exit from the European Union (EU) or roles that are not publicly advertised.
But they are forward-looking indicators of how each bank is looking to remodel their European workforce over the coming months in the face of Brexit, and suggest banks are only making modest tweaks as Britain's EU departure approaches on March 29.
""Culturally, Paris is French, Frankfurt is German but London is international. The Americans - who own this industry - want to operate in an English speaking environment. No one wants to go,"" said Martin Armstrong, partner at headhunting firm Armstrong International.
Other recruitment specialists reported few signs of banks preparing to bulk up in a hurry, even if Britain has to leave the EU without a deal covering financial services.
The small number of moves to date have followed many months of consultations and negotiations, the headhunters said, with banks keen to avoid relocations which might prove premature or even unnecessary.
""It can be done, but we are talking months, possibly longer if there are families involved,"" said James Murray, a director at search firm Robert Walters.
""That said, if risk takers do start to move elsewhere than that is where we could start to see real movement in terms of jobs. When the risk takers move, then surely the risk managers move, and so on,"" he added.
HOMEWORK
Search firm Korn Ferry set up a Brexit task force after Britons voted in 2016 to leave the EU and met regularly to prepare for a mass transfer of talent from London to Frankfurt. But the influx hasn't happened.
One senior banker who is making the move to Frankfurt is Christoph Seibel. Seibel, a German national, left the city in 1993 to go to business school in the United States and then pursue a career in London.
Mizuho poached him from RBC Capital Markets in London to become CEO of the bank's newly headquartered EU operations in Frankfurt. He takes up the new post on March 28.
Mizuho is one of 45 financial firms that Germany's financial regulator Bafin says are setting up Frankfurt hubs after Brexit.
But moves like Seibel's are few and far between, with activity to date well short of the 6,000 financial jobs lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance previously expected to move to Germany's largest financial hub in the event of a hard Brexit.
Seven leading executive search firms contacted by Reuters reported few offerings for leadership roles in Frankfurt as uncertainty about Britain's future trading relationship with the bloc continues.
Some banks are nevertheless betting on London to retain the balance of power over rival centers in the EU, opting to base top executives and keep their European headquarters in London - for the time being at least.
Citi's new EMEA Chief Executive David Livingstone will be based in the UK capital, as will HSBC's newly appointed global markets boss Georges Elhedery, who will relocate from Dubai to London to take up the job two weeks before Brexit.
Goldman Sachs has recently expanded the role of London-based Richard Gnodde to head of the bank's international operations while Morgan Stanley has appointed Clare Woodman to head up its EMEA business - also from London.
(Graphic: Britain still top spot for investment banking job ads - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TjKgsg)
FAST-TRACK
For now at least, head hunters say London is winning the war to retain its talent, undermining Germany's 'Bankfurt' ambitions or President Emmanuel Macron's push to swell the Paris finance industry at London's expense.
Goldman Sachs for example, which is making Frankfurt its EU hub after Brexit, is looking for just 15 roles in Germany's financial center with most of them in compliance, tax, legal, risk management or operations.
By contrast, the bank has 190 jobs advertised in Britain including I.T., compliance, human resources, as well as corporate & investment banking roles.
And with the market for permanent roles seen in rude health, persuading London-based bankers to move is no easy task, with handsome pay packages and better promotion prospects central to the negotiations.
""People say: 'talk to me about jobs in Asia first, then Dublin, then Frankfurt, then Paris' – in that order. People want big upticks and guaranteed bonuses as standard,"" Darren Burns, operations director at headhunter Morgan McKinley, said.
""There's a feeling if you move to Dublin as a director now, you could be managing director in three years, whereas in Frankfurt, there is already too much competition for the top roles. The local talent is already your boss or your boss's boss.""
As banks automate more processes to cut costs, they are also recruiting more in countries where they can hire skilled workers in areas such as technology and risk management at a fraction of the cost seen in Western financial centers.
After Britain, the second hottest jobs market in Europe is Poland, where 878 posts are up for grabs across Warsaw, Krakow and Wroclaw. 
Citi and Credit Suisse have advertised 531 roles in Poland between them, compared with an aggregated 36 posts in Germany and 8 jobs in France.
Morgan Stanley has 49 vacancies in Budapest, where it opened in 2006 and now employs more than 1,300 people.
""The biggest banks have been nearshoring and offshoring roles from their most expensive centers for the best part of 15 years now, entirely unrelated to Brexit,"" Murray said.

""If they still have jobs in London, it's because they genuinely need or want those jobs to be in London.""

585,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:42AM ET</span>","DowDuPont forecasts drop in first-quarter sales, shares fall","(Reuters) - U.S chemicals company DowDuPont Inc on Thursday forecast a surprise drop in revenue for the current quarter, hit by reduced sales in its biggest unit, sending the company's shares down 9 percent in pre-market trading.
The company, formed by the $130 billion merger of chemical giants  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) in September 2017, said it expects first-quarter revenue to down in the ""mid-single digits percent"" without giving detailed numbers.
Analysts were expecting DowDupont to report revenue of $22.63 billion for the first quarter, 5 percent higher than the year earlier quarter.
The company said sales at the material science unit - its biggest revenue generator - would fall by high-single digits percent in the first quarter, weighing on the overall forecast. The unit makes chemicals that are used to make brake fluids and packaging materials among other things.
For the fourth quarter, net sales were $20.1 billion, unchanged from a year ago, but were below the average analyst estimate of $20.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales were hit by currency effects, Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider said.
""We expect global economic expansion to continue in 2019 at a moderately slower pace than 2018,"" Ungerleider said, adding that the company was closely monitoring ongoing trade negotiations and the pace of economic activity in China.
During the quarter, DowDuPont clocked double-digit percentage volume growth in China, Ungerleider told Reuters in an interview.
DowDuPont, which is in the process of splitting itself up into three companies, reiterated that the separation was on track. The new Dow will spin out of DowDuPont by April 2019 and its agriculture division, Corteva Agriscience, will spin out in early June.
In the quarter, the company said local prices in the regions they operate rose by about 1 percent, but currency changes reduced sales by 2 percent.
Sales in the materials science business fell 1 percent to $11.8 billion. Volumes - a proxy for demand - rose 1 percent.
The company said margin compression in materials science, lower equity earnings and the currency impact had all weighed on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
Net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $513 million. DowDuPont saw a $1.1 billion benefit from lower U.S corporate taxes in the year-ago quarter, but posted a net loss of $1.2 billion from continuing operations, largely on merger-related costs.
Adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at 88 cents per share, an increase of 6 percent.
The company's shares were down 9 percent at $54.04 before the bell.

587,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>","S&P 500 to Gain as Big Accounts Chase January Rally, BTIG Says","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks are fighting off excessive investor pessimism, which has set the bar quite low for good-news rallies, according to BTIG LLC.
“We’re halfway between the highs of last September and the lows around Christmas Day, and our view is that you’re much more likely to test the highs,” BTIG chief equity and derivatives strategist Julian Emanuel said in an interview from New York. “But the resistance to the market moving higher is very profound” for now, he said.
The S&P 500 fell about 20 percent from its record on Sept. 20 through Dec. 24, as investors became concerned about factors like decelerating global economic growth, the potential path of Federal Reserve rate hikes and U.S.-China trade tensions. While it’s since recovered by 14 percent, with another solid gain on Wednesday fueled by the Fed signaling rates are on a prolonged pause, the gauge still lies well off record levels. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1 percent at around 2,687 as of 8:11 a.m. New York time Thursday.
“The market is susceptible to positive news,” Emanuel said. “People are very clear-eyed about all the things that are out there as risk events” and “a lot of the negatives are built in,” he said.
Emanuel said some clients think there could be no growth at all in the current earnings season, and barely any growth in the economy -- much more pessimistic than BTIG’s forecasts. He also said China might be “near the trough of economic activity” and more stimulus measures are likely. The yuan’s exchange rate -- around the strongest since mid-2018 -- doesn’t suggest an imminent crisis, he said.
“A lot of the big accounts we talked to are already far enough behind their benchmark, they’ll have to catch up as stock prices refuse to decline,” Emanuel said. “We see all of that cocktail as fueling further upside.”
For the S&P 500, the crucial levels to watch are 2,600 on the downside, and the 200-day moving average of 2,741 on the upside, Emanuel said. He noted that the S&P 500 has spent a couple of weeks within that range, and when the market has slid back toward the lower end, there has been a lot of buying.
“You want to see the market going through the 200-DMA,” which could be considered a “dividing line” as to whether there’s a bull market, Emanuel said. “We would see that as very, very positive. Ultimately we do think it can get there, and more.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Soothing sounds from the Federal Reserve propelled world stocks to their best January on record on Thursday although, having scored stellar gains this time last year only to flop spectacularly, traders were trying not to get too carried away.
The bolt from the bulls came as the Fed said it would pause its three-year interest rate rise campaign while assessing the weakening of the economy. 
Crucially, it also said that the rundown of its balance sheet - or the stockpile of bonds it has accumulated over the past 10 years of quantitative easing - could slow too. 
That ticked all the boxes for financial markets. Wall Street and Asia both rallied and Europe ran up as much as 1 percent] until news that Italy was back in recession and other poor data took the wind out of the sails of most markets bar London. 
Futures pointed to the U.S. S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rising later though (N). That likely move added with Asia's gains lifted the $4 trillion MSCI world index, which tracks 47 countries, for the 20th day out of the last 23. 
For January it is up more than 7 percent, which is its best January since the index began in 1990 and the best performance in any month since December 2015.
""The rally really does lift all boats,"" said Pictet emerging market portfolio manager Guido Chamorro.
The gains for stocks were matched in bond markets. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, which tend to set the bar for global borrowing costs, had dived significantly and Europe's big move saw Italian 2-year yields hit their lowest since May.
But it was all pain for the dollar. It was struggling near a three-week trough against its major peers and emerging market currencies rose almost in unison having been crushed by the greenback last year.
""Risk assets are dancing in the streets and the dollar's down in the dumps,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes said.
""We may yet get a (Fed) rate hike in June, but if what matters is where policy's heading in the medium term, the FX market would overlook that and sell the dollar anyway.""
U.S. stocks were also set for another packed day of data and earnings. 
Jobless claims figures had already come out showing a 1-1/2 year high, Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) missed forecasts again but  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) surged, marked up almost 10 percent after it beat estimates.
Internet shopping behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the other big focus with it set to report after the closing bell. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped almost 7 percent on Wednesday after soothing China worries while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares leapt 11 percent after hours on better-than-expected profits following a year of high profile data scandals.

RE-EMERGING MARKETS
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose to its highest since October, helped by a 1 percent jump on Japan's Nikkei, which shrugged off the normal headwind of a higher yen.
The main emerging market index skipped to a more than 8 percent January gain while the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent, despite data showing China's factory activity contracted for a second straight month.
""We were underweight emerging markets. We have changed that yesterday,"" said Lyxor Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Guillaume Lasserre. 
With the Fed decision out of the way, investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks aimed at easing a months-long tariff war.
The two-day talks which began in Washington on Wednesday are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to budge on trade practices and fully protect American intellectual property rights.
If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2.
Donald Trump tweeted that talks were ""going well"" but ""No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points.""
In the commodity markets, industrial metals were up and oil rose for a third day, pushed up by lower imports into the United States amid OPEC efforts to tighten the market, and as Venezuela struggles to keep up its crude exports after Washington imposed sanctions on the nation.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.39 per barrel, up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. Brent was up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $62.01 per barrel.

Back in the currency markets, the pound was a shade higher at $1.3127, while gold held near an eight-month high of $1,323 an ounce hit in the previous session as its buyers also cheered the weak dollar.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>","Musk not worried about Tesla Model 3 demand, but Wall St. is","(Reuters) - Shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell nearly 4 percent on Thursday as Wall Street analysts following up on its fourth-quarter results questioned underlying demand for its crucial Model 3 sedan and the electric car maker's ability to make inroads in China.
Tesla reported quarterly profit below analysts' expectations on Wednesday and surprised investors by announcing that Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja, 56, would leave and handover the reins to 34-year-old Zach Kirkhorn, its vice president of finance.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts were among those warning that Ahuja's leaving deprived the company of long automotive industry experience and relative stability in a company which has seen a steady stream of senior staff come and go since 2016.
Analysts were also concerned by Tesla's indication that it is only making cars for China and Europe right now, and expects a gap of about 10,000 vehicles between production and deliveries due to vehicles in transit at the end of the first quarter.
""This is a strong indication that demand in the U.S. for both the mid-range and long-range Model 3 versions has largely been exhausted, and the company is still working through the estimated ~6.8k of unsold Model 3 inventory,"" Cowen analysts said.
Still, the fall in Tesla shares was less than that suggested by initial pricing after Wednesday's results and also far smaller than some of the swings in one of the past year's most volatile Wall Street stocks.
The company, which is striving to stabilize production and deliver consistent profit, ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and said it had ""sufficient cash on hand"" to pay a $920 million convertible bond maturing in March. 
Of the 31 brokerages covering Tesla, 10 have a ""buy"" or higher rating, 10 ""hold"" and 11 have a ""sell"" or lower rating and their median price target is 327.50.
Only four changed their price targets on the stock on Thursday, with two raises and two cuts. Wedbush cut its price target by $50 to $390.
While Tesla is pumping money into a Shanghai factory, which it hopes to bring on line around the end of this year with a target of producing 500,000 vehicles a year, several analysts questioned whether that investment will pay off. 

""Tesla serves the purpose of a 'stalking horse' to the fast growing domestic Chinese EV industry, but we believe it has limited to zero terminal value in a region where a number of domestic champions should emerge,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",EU charges eight banks over euro government bond trading cartel,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's antitrust authority said on Thursday that it had charged eight unnamed banks with operating a cartel in trading euro zone government bonds between 2007 and 2012.
In a statement, the European Commission said some traders at the banks exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies on the euro-denominated bonds, mainly through online chatrooms.
In a separate previous case, the Commission charged  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and a fourth bank in December with being part of a bond cartel, also citing traders using chatrooms.
If found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules, the banks could face fines up to 10 percent of their global turnover.
""The Commission has concerns that, at different periods between 2007 and 2012, the eight banks participated in a collusive scheme that aimed at distorting competition when acquiring and trading European government bonds,"" the Commission said.
""Traders employed by the banks exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated on trading strategies. These contacts would have taken place mainly - but not exclusively - through online chatrooms.""
The Commission added that its charges did not imply that anti-competitive conduct was a general practice in the euro zone government bond sector. The period in question was a time of intense activity in euro zone government bonds as several euro area governments ran into difficulties in servicing their debt.

593,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 08:59AM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank focused on profit, not Commerzbank tie-up: source","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is focused on achieving sustainable profitability, a source at Germany's largest bank said on Thursday, seeking to distance the lender from talk of a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
The suggestion that such a merger is the only option for Deutsche is ""completely false"", said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Shares in both lenders tumbled on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that Deutsche was expecting a government-brokered merger with Commerzbank by mid-year if efforts to restructure the lender fall short of targets.
A merger may become the only option if Deutsche's performance does not improve in the first quarter, the report said, citing people briefed on the thinking of executives.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.
Deutsche shares were down 5 percent at 1350 GMT while Commerzbank was off 6.7 percent.
Finance minister Olaf Scholz has spoken in favor of strong banks and his team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche, Commerzbank and major shareholders.
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing has repeatedly said that he was focused on the bank's ""homework"" - returning the bank to profitability after three years of losses.
On Friday, the bank will report its 2018 results and analysts expect it to deliver its first annual profit since 2014.
CEO Sewing is also likely to face further questions about a possible merger. 
A Deutsche supervisory board member said last week that there was no desire among board members for a merger with Commerzbank. 
Gildas Surry, a portfolio manager with Axiom, which holds Deutsche Bank bonds, said that merging the two banks would be like mixing oil with vinegar, with questionable cost and revenue synergies. 
But those hurdles may not be enough to sway governments pressing for banking consolidation. ""It is very difficult for politicians to forgo their national champions,"" he said.

(Reuters) - After 18 months of distraction defending itself over privacy and its role as a platform for electoral manipulation,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is focusing squarely on products after its strong fourth-quarter results won back investors, who sent its shares up nearly 12 percent on Thursday.
The social network has been spending heavily to boost user privacy on its platform following pressure from regulators and users around the world. But it reported better-than-expected profit and revenue on Wednesday, attributing the gains to higher ad sales and product improvements.
""We've put most of our energy into security over the past 18 months, so that building new experiences wasn't the priority over that period,"" Mark Zuckerberg, the 34-year old billionaire and chief executive officer of Facebook, told analysts on a post-earnings call.
""So this year, I think we're going to deliver several of these new experiences,"" Zuckerberg said.
Shares of the social media network rose nearly 12 percent to $168 in trading before the bell on Thursday, with at least 17 analysts raising their price targets on the stock.
Analysts said Facebook is taking cue from the early success of its popular Stories feature and will invest significantly in getting more advertisers on board to the format, which has further upside in terms of pricing.
The Stories format is used by about 2 million advertisers out of Facebook's total 7 million active advertisers, and the company said it would add more features to make it easier for advertisers to adapt their campaigns.
Facebook has intentionally kept ad unit pricing for Stories 20 percent to 50 percent lower than News Feed as it works to improve performance and could bring a double-barreled benefit to ad revenue growth if it can improve ad efficacy,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
More than 2.7 billion users interact with at least one of Facebook's apps each month, up from 2.6 billion last quarter.

""The bottom line is that with more than a quarter of the world using FB every day, we think advertisers have no choice but to follow their customers,"" Macquarie Research analysts said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish and Estonian financial regulators are blaming each other for the  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) money laundering scandal, which has highlighted the need for better cross-border surveillance.
Denmark's largest lender is being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over 200 billion euros ($229 billion) of suspicious payments through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) this week prompted a sharp rebuke from its Estonian counterpart when it said it had met its obligations.
""As the host country supervisory authority, the Estonian supervisory authority (EFSA) has had and still has responsibility for the anti-money laundering (AML) supervision of the Estonian branch,"" the DFSA said in a report.
The EFSA, locally known as the Finantsinspektsioon, responded by saying Danske Bank had failed in its governance and that the DFSA ""was and is responsible for supervising the governance of Danske Bank, including its branches"".
""Finantsinspektsioon stands ready to take over supervision of Danske Bank as whole,"" it added.
The DFSA responded by saying that the division of responsibilities was clear.
""EFSA had the power to stop the offences when EFSA became aware of them during the inspections in 2014. EFSA was not dependent on possible actions by the home country supervisory authority (DFSA),"" DFSA said on Wednesday.
Danish anti money laundering expert Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft said that although EFSA was responsible for money laundering supervision in Estonia, the DFSA should have reacted to a business model that allowed Danske Bank to operate without interference from the headquarters in Copenhagen.
""This dispute is clear evidence that there is a need for much tighter cooperation on the operational level, and to work as one authority in order to stop money laundering,"" he said.

European Union governments reached a preliminary deal last month to clamp down on money laundering by strengthening bank supervision through the European Banking Authority.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, has appointed corporate banking veteran Christian Rosset to lead a new wealth management team tasked with strengthening corporate offerings for entrepreneur clients, the bank told employees this week.
With the new appointment, Swizterland's biggest lender is seeking to boost business by increasing crossover between its flagship business serving the world's wealthy with investment and corporate banking capabilities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, banking entrepreneurs and their firms.
""A majority of the new clients we attract are entrepreneurs,"" EMEA wealth management head Christine Novakovic told Reuters. ""If we set up a small, effective team of people who have come over from the investment bank or corporate banking business, and who know our product offerings inside out, then we can build a bridge over to wealth management.""
Through the initiative, the bank hopes to generate growth in each of the divisions, providing more corporate and investment banking services--including treasury management and currency hedging--to entrepreneurs' firms, and in turn attracting more well-to-do business owners into its private banking.
""For new clients, it's about being able to provide all-around services for their firms and having that be an anchor for getting into business... That will help us bring in fresh money and generate growth within wealth management,"" Novakovic said.
""We'll be starting out in certain markets and then gradually expanding the team, building up in other regions.""
Prior to taking on the bank's regional leadership in wealth management last year, Novakovic headed the Zurich-based lender's Swiss investment banking and corporate client businesses.

Raytheon reported higher sales across its five segments, led by its missile systems unit, where sales rose 6 percent to about $2.32 billion. The increase was driven by higher sales from 'classified programs', for which the company does not provide detailed numbers.
Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to benefit from strong global demand for fighter jets and munitions as well as higher U.S. defense spending in fiscal 2020.
Operating margin in the missile systems unit, which makes Paveway smart bombs and advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles, fell to 11.8 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from 12.7 percent a year earlier, due to a change in mix.
The U.S. weapons maker forecast 2019 profit in the range of $11.40 to $11.60 per share, which came in below analysts' average estimate of $11.78 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Rivals  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) also forecast their 2019 profit below analysts' estimates this week.
Raytheon also said operating cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion in 2019, compared with $3.4 billion in the previous year. But the mid-point of the forecast fell short of analysts' average estimate of about $4.1 billion.
The company expects 2019 net sales to range between $28.6 billion and $29.1 billion, marginally below analysts' average expectation of $29.01 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue in the quarter rose to $7.36 billion from $6.78 billion a year earlier.
Raytheon's net income attributable to the company jumped to $832 million, or $2.93 per share, in the quarter, compared with $393 million, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier, benefiting from lower taxes related to the U.S. tax overhaul.

Sales at the space and airborne systems unit, which makes electronic warfare systems for tactical aircraft, helicopters and ships, rose 12.6 percent to $1.88 billion, but operating margins fell to 13.9 percent from 14.5 percent.

The company also drew a line under its involvement in the 2008 financial crisis, by announcing it had agreed ""in principle"" a $1.5 billion settlement with U.S. authorities' in respect of its now-defunct WMC mortgage business. That's in line with the provision it made in spring 2018.
Adjusted free cash flows at its industrial units rebounded strongly to $4.85 billion in the three months to December. While that's still down nearly 30% from last year, the company had had negative free cash flow over the first three quarters of 2018.
GE's overall revenue came in $33.2 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts, but earnings  per share fell short at 17c, compared to a 22c consensus. The company had reported EPS of $0.14 on revenue of $29.57B in the previous quarter.
“Our strategy is clear: de-leverage our balance sheet and strengthen our businesses, starting with Power, "" Culp said in a statement. ""We have more work to do, but I’mencouraged by the changes we’re making.""

Improved earnings at other key divisions such as aviation and oil and gas helped soften the blow.
GE said it sold another $8 billion of assets in the last three months of 2018, making a total of $15 billion in disposals over the year. That helped it to pay down a total of $21 billion in debt over 2018.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 06:21AM ET</span>",A flood of profit warnings from Chinese firms as slowdown bites,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of listed Chinese companies - from hog farmers struggling to buy pig feed, to glassware makers unable to collect receivables - flagged big losses for 2018, victim to a slowing economy and Beijing's deleveraging.
Once-acquisitive companies, who paid top dollar for assets during the boom years, are being forced to take heavy write-downs that are weighing on their balance sheets already weakened by a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war.
As of Wednesday, 129 companies estimated losses in excess of 800 million yuan ($119.3 million) each for 2018, the Shanghai Securities News reported. Nearly 200 others flagged losses of over 100 million yuan each.
China's economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year, as ramped-up deleveraging efforts to curb shadow banking triggered a funding squeeze among smaller firms and choked the private sector.
Economic growth is expected to ease further this year.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite index has fallen more than a quarter in the past 12 months.
""The economy was already cooling, and suddenly we had the trade war, which is why we're seeing so many earnings implosions,"" said Yang Hongxun, an analyst with investment consultancy Shandong Shenguang.
""But it's possible some companies are using the bad year for an accounting big bath, so future results will look better.""
Robin Xing, Morgan Stanley's chief China economist, said he was optimistic on Chinese stocks in 2019, betting that recent measures, including tax cuts, infrastructure investment and looser monetary conditions, will help stabilize growth.
Chinese companies are rushing to post profit warnings ahead of a regulatory deadline at the end of January.
Chuying Agro-Pastoral Group Co, which breeds pigs and poultry, said late on Wednesday that it will swing to a loss of 2.9-3.3 billion yuan in 2018, compared with a profit of 45 million yuan a year earlier.
The company said some pigs starved to death because they did not have the cash to buy feed on time. Asset and goodwill impairment write-downs also contributed to the loss, it said.
An estimated 1.45 trillion yuan ($216.17 billion) of goodwill impairment is sitting on the books of listed Chinese companies, threatening to worsen troubles of many firms already struggling to make margin calls.
Some firms, including gaming company Dalian Zeus Entertainment Co and Kaidi Ecological, forecast annual losses that exceed their market value.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 06:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: PetroChina to drop PDVSA as partner in refinery project - sources,"By Chen Aizhu
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - PetroChina Co plans to drop Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) as a partner in a planned $10 billion oil refinery and petrochemical project in southern China, said three sources familiar with the matter this week. 
The company's decision adds to state-owned PDVSA's woes after the United States imposed sanctions on the company on Jan. 28 to undermine the rule of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
However, dropping the company was not a reaction to the U.S. sanctions but follows the deteriorating financial status of PDVSA over the past few years, said two of the sources, both executives with China National Petroleum Corp, the parent of PetroChina. 
""There will be no role of PDVSA as an equity partner. At least we don't see that possibility in the near future given the situation the country has been through in recent years,"" said one of the executives, asking to remain unidentified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. 
The move illustrates the fading relationship between Venezuela and China, which has given $50 billion to the South American country in the form of loans-for-oil agreements. China, the world's largest oil importer, is now the second-biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude in Asia, taking in 16.63 million tonnes, or about 332,000 barrels per day (bpd), in 2018. 
That relationship began to fray in 2015 when Venezuela requested a change in the payment terms on the debt to ease the impact of its falling crude output and declining oil prices. Instead of handing out large fresh loans, Beijing has shifted to small investments or granting extensions in the grace periods for the outstanding loans.
The sanctions were imposed at the same time the United States and other nations have backed opposition leader Juan Guaido as legitimate ruler instead of President Nicolas Maduro. During Maduro's rule, oil production has plunged while millions have left amid hyperinflation and as consumer goods have vanished from market shelves. 
PDVSA was originally a 40 percent equity partner in the refinery project, located the city of Jieyang in the southern province of Guangdong. PetroChina and PDVSA received environmental approval for the project in 2011. 
Initial plans were for the refinery to process 400,000 bpd of strictly Venezuelan crude oil. The plans have now been expanded to focus on petrochemical production including a 1.2-million-tonnes-per-year ethylene plant and a 2.6-million tpy aromatics plant. The plant is expected to be operational by late 2021, Caixin reported on Dec. 5.
Under the revised plan, the refinery will not be restricted to Venezuelan oil but could process other so-called heavy crude grades that could come from Middle Eastern producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, said the third official, a PetroChina trading executive.
An e-mail response from PetroChina's public relations company Hill+Knowlton Strategies only stated ""China-Venezuela Guangdong Petrochemical Co Ltd is a joint venture company approved by the state,"" referring to the formal name for the company set up by Petrochina and PDVSA to develop the refinery. 
PDVSA and the Venezuelan Ministry of Petroleum did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

The airline said on Thursday that 10 of those 50 aircraft would now be the A321LR, to be delivered from 2020.
A321s are the larger version of Airbus' best-selling A320 narrow-body jet. 
The airline said longer range A321s will help it launch flights to new markets where there is currently not enough demand for larger aircraft but which are out of reach of smaller A320s.
State-owned Qatar Airways has been banned from the airspace of neighboring Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain since June 2017 after those countries cut ties with Qatar.
It is also banned from Egypt's airspace which also cut diplomatic relations with Qatar.
The airline lost access to 18 cities in those countries that cut ties. It has had to increase costs by operating longer flights on some routes to avoid the airspace of the four countries. Qatar Airways made a $69 million loss in the year to March 2018, blaming the rift.
Its order for 50 A321neos was made in 2017 when it upgraded an order for 50 A320neo family jets to the larger model. 
An order for 50 A321neos would be valued at around $6.4 billion based on the average 2017 list price, according to Airbus's website, but discounts are common, particularly on large orders. 

Qatar Airways also upgraded five A350-900 jets on order to the bigger A350-1000 model in October.

The Kyoto-based gaming company said it expected to sell 17 million Switch consoles in the year ending March from 20 million previously and also cut the forecast for its aging 3DS handheld, underscoring the need to find other sources of revenue.
""We didn't work hard enough to convince customers of the Switch's appeal,"" Chief Executive Shuntaro Furukawa said at an earnings briefing.
At the same time, Nintendo smashed profit estimates for its October-December quarter and upgraded its Switch software forecast to 110 million units from 100 million previously, announcing that hit titles ""Super Smash Bros. Ultimate"" and ""Pokemon: Let's Go"" have shifted over 10 million copies each.
Operating profit for October-December was 158.6 billion yen ($1.46 billion), the highest in nine years and the second consecutive third-quarter rise. That was well above the 149 billion yen average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Nintendo shares lost 29 percent of their value last year as investors questioned the Switch's ability to appeal beyond hardcore gamers and the strength of the games pipeline. However, renewed enthusiasm following reports of strong demand for Switch software has helped lift the stock 16 percent this year.
The stock closed up 2 percent ahead of the earnings.
Nintendo said it sold 14.5 million Switch consoles in the April-December period along with 94.6 million software units.
UPWARDLY MOBILE
Meanwhile, Nintendo is pushing into mobile gaming but is yet to score a major hit. Role-playing game ""Dragalia Lost"", developed with CyberAgent Inc, got off to a strong start supported by heavy ad spending but is underperforming expectations, CyberAgent CEO Susumu Fujita said on Wednesday.
And gamers hoping to play smartphone games featuring popular Nintendo characters face a longer wait after the firm pushed the release date of ""Mario Kart Tour"" to the summer from earlier in the year.
That delay means Nintendo will miss its target of releasing two to three mobile titles each financial year, though CEO Furukawa said there was no change to that goal. 
Nintendo also cut its sales forecast for its 3DS device to 2.6 million units from 4 million previously.
The need to offset the fall-off in 3DS sales has led to speculation Nintendo will release another device such as a cut-price Switch.
""While it's true demand fell more than we expected, for children playing for the first time the 3DS is light and has an advantage in price terms,"" Furukawa said.
""We want to continue with both the 3DS and the Switch,"" he said.

Markets opened higher, but turned down after an alarmingly weak German retail sales report for December, illustrating the slowdown in Europe’s biggest economy at the end of 2018. German jobless numbers also fell by less than expected in January – although there was a positive surprise in Italy, where the jobless rate  fell for a second straight month to 10.3%.
Oil and gas stocks rose after Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) reported fourth-quarter earnings well above forecasts and started the next phase of its planned buyback program. That also pulled the U.K.’s  BP  (LON:BP) and France’s  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) higher. Drinks group  Diageo  (LON:DGE), the maker of Johnnie Walker and Tanqueray, also rose 4.3% after announcing a buyback program and a bigger-than-expected rise in revenue, driven by strong growth in sales of gin and tequila.
Elsewhere, the news was less rosy. Nokia (HE:NOKIA) fell over 5% after predicting a weak first half to 2019, even though it expected a stronger second half as orders for 5G networks start to pick up.
German payments company Wirecard AG (DE:WDIG), which overtook  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in market value last year, rebounded only 1.5% after falling 13% on Wednesday on a Financial Times report that revived concerns about its accounting.
Consumer giant  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) also fell after its new CEO said revenue and margins this year would be at the bottom end of its target range. And retailer H&M (ST:HMb) fell 1.4% after figures showing that it’s still struggling with the online shopping revolution. Its shares have lost over half their value in the last two years under pressure from online rivals including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)."
624,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 04:17AM ET</span>","Nokia sees bumpy 2019 growth due to timing of 5G rollouts, shares fall","By Anne Kauranen
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA) warned of a soft start to 2019 before a better second half for its fifth-generation (5G) mobile network technology, sending its shares sharply lower on Thursday.
The outlook eclipsed fourth-quarter results that beat profit and sales expectations.
""We expect 2019 to have a soft first half followed by a much more robust second half,"" CEO Rajeev Suri said in a statement.
The Finnish firm said it expected 5G mobile networks to fuel gains over the next two years.
Nokia shares were down 5.6 percent at 0825 GMT, on track for their worst day since Oct 2017. 
""There was a bit more uncertainty in the outlook than I was expecting but the big picture is still the same. The market is recovering well with 5G and they're heading toward their 2020 targets,"" said analyst Mikael Rautanen at research firm Inderes, which holds an accumulate recommendation on Nokia. 
""Overall it was a quite good Q4 as expected.""
The networks industry has faced slowing demand since 4G network sales peaked in the middle of the decade but a new cycle of network upgrades appear to be kicking in as demand for 5G services increases.
Last week, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) beat fourth-quarter profit margin and sales forecasts, citing cost cuts and demand from U.S. mobile operators for 5G telecoms equipment.
Nokia counts Chinese market leader Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson as its main rivals. Some analysts think it might benefit from challenges faced by Huawei after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
Suri declined to comment specifically on how the fallout from the Huawei case might impact its business, saying only that the company was monitoring the situation.
Nokia reported a fourth-quarter operating profit (non-IFRS) up 12 percent to 1.12 billion euros which beat analysts' forecasts helped by its software and enterprise businesses.
Gains in the software business -- which Nokia said it plans to start reporting separately this quarter -- also underpinned the strong fourth quarter.
The company forecast 2019 earnings per share of 0.25-0.29 euros, above analysts' estimates. It also forecast 2020 EPS of 0.37-0.42 euros.
Company executives on a conference call said more than 70 5G trials were under way and that business was strong in the United States, its biggest market.
""We had a strong 2018 in North America as we had been indicating throughout the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Kristian Pullola said. 
""That's the lead market where 5G is starting to happen and Nokia has been delivering on that promise.""

625,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 04:12AM ET</span>",Unilever fourth-quarter sales miss expectations,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales on Thursday, hurt by inflation in Argentina and flat volume growth in developed markets, in its first set of results since new Chief Executive Alan Jope took charge.
The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said fourth-quarter underlying sales rose 2.9 percent. Analysts, on average, were expecting 3.5 percent, a consensus forecast supplied by the company showed.
The Anglo-Dutch group, which is working to move on from last year's botched plan to shift its main headquarters to the Netherlands, had said full-year sales growth would be at the bottom end of its 3 to 5 percent forecast range. 
Looking ahead, it said it expects 2019 market conditions to remain challenging and forecast underlying sales growth again in the lower half of a 3 to 5 percent range, with continued improvement in underlying operating margin and another year of strong free cash flow. 
It said it remained on track for its 2020 goals.
In the fourth quarter, Unilever blamed Argentina, which makes up 2.5 percent of its overall business, for hyperinflation that led prices to spike more than 50 percent and therefore volume to fall more than 20 percent in the quarter.
But more broadly, sales volume in the Americas was flat, as pricing growth was offset by volume declines. The same happened in Europe, though the company eked out 0.8 percent sales growth in the region. Overall, underlying sales in developed markets grew only 0.4 percent in the quarter. 
The company blamed declines in France and competitive pressures in North America, particular in ice cream and mayonnaise. 
For the full year, Unilever reported turnover of 49.6 billion euros ($57.05 billion), excluding its divested spreads business, with underlying sales up 3.1 percent, in line with expectations. 
Its full-year earnings were 3.48 euros per share.

626,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",Bulls Cheer as Fed's Capitulation to Markets Reaches Climax,"(Bloomberg) -- A stock-market spring-loaded for earnings season is now pushing toward its biggest January rally in three decades after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sent another care package to investors bruised in last year’s market tumult.
The S&P 500 jumped as much as 1.9 percent, its first gain on the day of a Fed decision since Powell took office and its biggest increase for such a session since 2014. The sense of relief among investors was on display across markets worldwide, with developing-nation equities hitting the highest level in almost four months, Europe’s Stoxx 600 advancing a third-straight day and almost every major currency gaining versus the dollar.
Stocks took off after the Fed chairman evinced more willingness to be patient before hiking rates and said other stimulus programs could be adjusted “in light of economic and financial developments.” In short, investors convinced policy makers were ignoring their plight in December have a lot less to worry about now.
“The Fed threw in the towel today, taking rate increases off the table,” Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed-income at Natalliance Securities in New York, said after the announcement. “We have never seen the Fed reverse cold turkey as fast as they have since the last meeting.”
It was the third time since the FOMC’s last press conference that Powell walked back hawkish testimony that pushed the S&P 500 to a 9.2 percent decline in December. Four weeks ago, Powell said he was “listening carefully” to financial markets and signaled a willingness to consider changes to the Fed’s gradual run-off of its balance sheet in any policy review.
“The FOMC obviously got scared of the downside financial risks and the recent slowing and caved,” said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital LLC. After Powell’s remarks, the dollar weakened to a four-month low and the Treasury yield curve steepened as the two-year rate crashed to the lowest since October.
The Fed “will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support” a strong labor market and inflation near 2 percent, the central bank said in a statement Wednesday following a two-day meeting in Washington.
For his part, Powell -- who was repeatedly blamed by President Donald Trump for provoking market volatility in December -- said his focus hasn’t changed. Flexibility over how to manage the Fed’s balance sheet reflects thinking that has gone on “for frankly years” and Wednesday’s press conference was an effort to provide clarity.
“Honestly my only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the American people, that’s it, and the situation I think calls for patience, I think it does, and the stance of policy we think is appropriate. We see these uncertainties and we see a time where we can afford to, when we have the luxury of being able to wait, and watch, and that’s what we’re planning to do.”
Implied yields on fed funds futures slipped after release of the FOMC statement, suggesting a less than 10 percent chance of a quarter-point increase this year. Odds of a rate reduction in 2020 increased. Government bonds rose around the world in line with U.S. Treasuries.
In a separate special statement on Wednesday, the Fed said it’s “prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.” The central bank also said it would be ready to alter the balance sheet’s size and composition if the economy warrants a looser monetary policy than the federal funds could achieve on its own.
The Fed “delivers a market-friendly dovish blast with both barrels of the shotgun: dovish on rates and dovish on balance sheet,” said Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. “This exceeds even our above-consensus expectations.”

The STOXX 600 index rose 0.4 percent to its highest since Dec. 4 in early trading and on track for its best monthly performance since October 2015.
Germany's DAX and the UK's FTSE rose 1 and 0.7 percent respectively.
Royal Dutch Shell said profits jumped by more than a third last year to $21.4 billion, the highest since 2014, sending its shares up more than 3 percent and making the oil index the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe.
Strong results also from  Diageo  (LON:DGE), up 3.9 percent after the world's largest spirits company posted higher half-year sales on Thursday, helped by strength in India and China.
Relief from the Fed and the strong update from Shell however were partly offset by some disappointing updates, which could trigger further downgrades to earning expectations as the economic outlook remains gloomy.
Swatch tumbled 7.6 percent after the Swiss watchmaker posted lower-than-expected results amid a downturn in Asia and France, while a disappointing update sent Germany's Software down 8 percent to the bottom of the STOXX.
Nokia was another heavy faller, down 5.6 percent and on track for its worst day since Oct 2017, as it forecast a soft first half after beating fourth-quarter profit and sales expectations.
Consumer goods giant Unilever was down 2.6 percent as it reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, hurt by inflation in Argentina and flat volume growth in developed markets.

Analysts have been steadily cutting profit expectations for European firms. According to Refintiv IBES, fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to have grown less than 4 percent, from more than 10 percent expected last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) vowed to stick to spending discipline this year even as 2018 profits jumped by more than a third to their highest since 2014 at $21.4 billion.
The Anglo-Dutch oil company also reported a sharp rise in cash generation, in a further sign that cost savings since the 2014 oil market downturn are filtering into its operations.
Its shares were up 3.7 percent in early trading. 
A strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven by higher oil and gas prices, year-on-year, as well as a stronger contribution from crude oil and liquefied natural gas trading.
""The cash flow is incredible,"" said Rob West, analyst at Redburn. ""It’s heavily flattered by downstream inventory liquidation, but it still squashes any lingering worries about debt and dividend coverage.""
""The debate will move to long-run growth now ... My view is that Shell could create a lot of value for investors by upping investment and returning to growth mode,"" he said. Redburn has a ""neutral"" rating on Shell shares.
The world's top oil companies are expected to have generated more cash in 2018 than at any other time this decade after years of cuts, but boards remain cautious amid uncertainty over oil prices.
Investors saw large gains in energy shares in the first nine months of 2018 that were largely wiped out in the final quarter as oil prices collapsed from a four-year high of $86 to $50 a barrel within weeks. Oil prices have hovered near $60 a barrel so far this year.
Concerns over global economic growth amid a Sino-U.S. trade war further weighed on global shares.
But Shell's strong results are set to raise confidence in the company's strategy of boosting cash generation by focusing on high margin businesses such as deepwater oil and liquefied natural gas.
""We delivered on our promises for the year, including the completion of the $30 billion divestment program and starting up key growth projects while maintaining discipline on capital investment,"" CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement.
""We will continue with a strong delivery focus in 2019, with a disciplined approach to capital investment and growing both our cash flow and returns."" 
Shell is the first oil major to report 2018 results. U.S. rivals  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) publish results on Friday.

PROFITS SOAR
Shell's 2018 profits jumped 36 percent to $21.4 billion, beating the $20.98 billion in a company-provided forecast and boosted by a strong second half performance. 
In the fourth quarter, net income attributable to shareholders, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose 32 percent to $5.69 billion as cost cuts filtered through. That topped a company-provided forecast of $5.28 billion.
Oil and gas production in the year rose slightly to 3.666 million barrels of oil equivalent per day as new fields that came online offset the effect of disposals.
Shell's cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter rose to $22 billion, boosted by a $9 billion working capital movement, which brought the annual figure to $53 billion. 
Free cash flow - cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks - rose to $39.4 billion from $27.6 billion in 2017.
Shell, the world's biggest dividend payer at $16 billion a year, started last October a three-year $25 billion share buyback program promised following the acquisition of BG Group in 2016.
Shell had acquired around $4.5 billion of shares by the end of January. On Thursday, it launched the next tranche of $2.5 billion until the end of April, it said.
It largely completed by the end of 2018 a three-year, $30 billion asset disposal program to pay for the $54 billion BG Group acquisition. The assets included large portfolios in the North Sea, Norway and Canada that led to a decline in Shell's oil and gas production.

Capital investment reached $24.8 billion for the year, slightly below the lower end of Shell's guidance.

Ghosn has been held in custody in Japan since last November, after being arrested on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.
Ghosn, who spearheaded a turnaround at Nissan turnaround two decades ago, had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and  Renault  (PA:RENA), including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese corporation.

The world's second-biggest apparel retailer after Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) saw full-year profit fall for a third straight year as tougher competition and the online shift kept dimming the appeal of its core budget H&M chain's physical stores.
Pretax profit in September through November shrank for the sixth straight quarter to 4.4 billion crowns ($482 million) from a year-ago 4.9 billion, against a mean forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts for an increase to 5.1 billion.
The Swedish company has invested heavily in logistics and digitalization and is reviewing its mix of stores and brands and is also working on a new H&M store concept.
""It has been a challenging year for H&M group and the industry but after a difficult first half, there are signs the company’s transformation efforts are beginning to take effect,"" H&M said in a statement.
H&M proposed an unchanged dividend of 9.75 crowns per share for 2018. Several analysts had forecast the retailer would lower its annual payout for the first time since its 1974 listing with the poll showing a mean forecast of 8.95 crowns per share.
H&M said improved collections generated better full-price sales and lower markdowns towards the end of the year. 
""Bolstered by these positive signals, the company accelerated its transformation plans in the fourth quarter with a particular focus on the replacement of logistics systems,"" it said.
Markdowns decreased by 0.6 percentage points year-on-year while inventories grew 12 percent to 37.7 billion crowns or 18 percent of sales in H&M's fiscal fourth quarter. H&M had said in September it didn't expect markdowns to grow in the quarter. 
H&M said it expected first-quarter markdowns to be around 1 percentage point lower than a year earlier.

Stocks of the product already in Sri Lanka can still be sold, but there will be no new imports of the talc, a popular healthcare product across Sri Lanka and much of Asia, until J&J India, from where Sri Lanka imports the product, provides fresh test results. 
On Dec. 14, Reuters reported that the U.S. drugs and consumer products group knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder, leading to tests in several countries, including in India. 
The report was based on thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports, and other confidential documents.
J&J has described the Reuters story as ""one-sided, false, and inflammatory"". 
Kamal Jayasinghe, chief executive of Sri Lanka's National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA), which is part of the health ministry, said it had informed the distributor, A.Baur & Co., that it would require further tests for it to continue importing the powder.
""We have held their re-registration and informed the distributor to submit quality reports from an accredited laboratory to ensure there is no asbestos in their products,” Jayasinghe told Reuters. 
The license for A.Baur & Co to import the product expired in December, a second person at the NMRA said.
Shalutha Perera, head of consumer for A.Baur, told Reuters the firm has informed J&J in India of the suspension of the licensing process.
""J&J India directly handles all the regulatory matters,"" he said. 
Perera said the NMRA contacted A.Baur in December regarding new asbestos testing. 
A spokeswoman for J&J India declined to comment on the halt of shipments to Sri Lanka but said the company ""is in full compliance with current Indian regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and testing of our talc"".
""We are fully cooperating with the Indian government and are awaiting results from their testing,"" she added. 

The spokeswoman said the product was routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure it is free of asbestos.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - China offered to nearly halve the cost of a $20-billion rail project to save the centerpiece of its infrastructure push in Southeast Asia, two sources said on Thursday, but contradictory remarks by Malaysian ministers leave the outcome uncertain.
The conflicting statements made over the past week on the status of the East Coast Railway Link (ECRL) underscore the political and diplomatic challenges facing the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in renegotiating the contract.
""If it was just about the cost, China has offered a big reduction on the cost, as much as around half,"" said one of the sources privy to the talks.
Contractor China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC) had offered to cut construction costs of 67 billion ringgit ($16.39 billion) for the 688-km (428-mile) project by as much as half, the sources said. 
Expenses on interest and land acquisition help make up the rest of the total cost. 
Despite the proposed discount, Mahathir's government decided to cancel the contract this month, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic.
After coming to power in May, Mahathir, a critic of China's investments in Malaysia, vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls ""unfair"" Chinese projects authorized by his predecessor Najib Razak, and suspended the ECRL in July.
However, on Wednesday Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said Malaysia was pursuing more talks with China.
That news came days after another minister said the cabinet had decided to terminate the contract and a day after Mahathir sought China's understanding over the planned cancellation.
Negotiations have continued since the July suspension, with Malaysia indicating that it was looking for cheaper proposals on what would have been China's biggest Belt and Road venture in Southeast Asia.
TOO MANY OFFICIALS
The sources also said negotiations had been complicated by the involvement of too many Malaysian officials.
Apart from the finance ministry, CCCC and its domestic partner Malaysia Rail Line (MRL) have also had to present their proposals to Mahathir's long-time adviser, Daim Zainuddin, among other government officials. 
""Each has their own agenda and looks at the project differently...it's a very peculiar situation,"" one of the sources said.
Daim led the now-disbanded advisory council formed soon after Mahathir came to power. His office declined to comment.
The Malaysian finance ministry directed queries to the prime minister's office, which did not immediately respond to questions. MRL and CCCC declined to comment.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said this week he had seen the reports of the cancellation but was unaware of the specifics.
""As far as I know, this project was agreed upon by companies from both sides in accordance with market principles based on equality, mutual benefit and consensus-building,"" he said.
""The Chinese and Malaysian sides have been in communication on the relevant matters.""
He did not elaborate. 
On Wednesday, the Malaysian cabinet said it had decided to stop making comments on the project, save for those by Mahathir.
Ties with China deteriorated after Mahathir led a coalition of unlikely partners to election victory over Najib's Barisan Nasional alliance that had governed the country for 60 years.
""It is not an easy task for a coalition of diverse parties with almost no experience in the federal government,"" said Adib Zalkapli, Malaysia director of public policy consultancy Bower Group Asia.
""And each of the parties may have different ideas about foreign policy in the 'new Malaysia'."" 
The rail project was launched in 2017 in a push for Chinese investment during the administration of Najib, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat amid a massive financial scandal.
Hit by ballooning costs, lack of transparency and the risk it could saddle Malaysia with uncomfortably large debt, the project has come to symbolize Najib's scandal-ridden administration.
At the time, the opposition, which included Mahathir, accused Najib of selling out Malaysia's sovereignty to China.

Fourth-quarter operating profit plummeted 80 percent from a year earlier to 76 billion won ($68.5 million), in line with its earlier guidance, the company said. Revenue fell 7 percent to 15.8 trillion won, matching the company's estimate.
Widening losses in the company's struggling mobile business also dragged down profit, analysts said. 
""LG Electronics' mobile business has not been generating profits at all. On top of that, high marketing expenses for its slow-selling handset models hurt the overall profit,"" said Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Investment and Securities. 
Competition in the high-end television set market, particularly from Chinese rivals, as well as global economic headwinds are clouding the outlook for LG Electronics, analysts said. 
LG's share price fell 1.5 percent in a flat broader market on Thursday after the results were released.

Sales rose 5.7 percent at constant currency rates to 8.48 billion Swiss francs ($8.54 billion), below a forecast for 8.65 billion francs in a Reuters poll.

Luxury goods giant LVMH, owner of watch brands TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot, on Tuesday reported a 9 percent increase in like-for-like sales in the final quarter of 2018, helped by improving demand for its leather goods in China, and remained upbeat on prospects for the current year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said late on Wednesday it will temporarily suspend operations at 11 Michigan plants and its Warren Tech Center after a utility made an emergency appeal to users to conserve natural gas during extreme winter cold.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also said it had canceled a shift on Thursday at both its Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly plants and was considering whether it would need to cancel additional shifts.
GM said it had been asked by Consumers Energy, a unit of CMS Energy Corp (NYSE:CMS), to suspend operations to allow the utility to manage supply issues after extreme cold temperatures and a fire at a compressor station. 
It said workers were told not to report for the shifts at its Orion Assembly, Flint Assembly, Lansing Delta Township Assembly and Lansing Grand River Assembly plants, as well as other stamping and transmission plants on Wednesday evening and early Thursday. GM said it was still assessing when employees could return to work. 
Workers at its Warren Tech Center were also told to stay home on Thursday.
In a video message posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), CMS Energy Chief Executive Patricia Poppe said large companies, including Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and GM, had agreed to ""interrupt"" production schedules through Friday to tackle the issue prompted by a fire at a Michigan facility and the record-breaking cold.
Poppe said the usage cuts by large businesses were not enough, and urged 1.8 million Michigan customers to turn down thermostats as much as they could to cut natural gas use in order to protect critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. ""I need you to take action right now,"" she said.
Ford Motor said it had also taken steps to reduce energy use at its four Michigan plants supplied by Consumers Energy, but added the situation remained fluid.
A spokeswoman said it had reduced heating levels at Livonia Transmission and Van Dyke Transmission, stopped heat treatment processes at Sterling Axle and shut down the paint process at Michigan Assembly.
Consumers Energy sent an alert to mobile phones in Michigan asking residents to reduce natural gas use.
In a Twitter message, Consumers Energy warned that ""without additional reductions, we run the risk of not being able to deliver natural gas to families and critical facilities across Michigan – a scenario none of us want to encounter.""

Consumers Energy said a fire at a gas compressor station in Michigan's Macomb County Wednesday forced it to halt gas flow from the compressor station until safety and damage assessments could be completed.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component rose 0.6% and 0.5% respectively by 10:55 PM ET (03:55 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also gained 1.1%.
The gain in Chinese stocks came even after the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported on Thursday that China’s factory activity shrank for the second straight month.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.5 in January, the reading was slightly higher than the 49.4 in December, but still below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
Meanwhile, the services PMI for January came in at 54.7, better than the 53.8 reported in the previous month.
""While the official manufacturing PMI didn't weaken any further in January, it still suggests that the economy lost momentum at the start of the year,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note that was cited by CNBC.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.2%. Index heavyweight  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) made headlines after the company posted a 29% drop in fourth-quarter operating profit.
The company also expects its “overall annual earnings to decline” and that memory demand will remain weak in the first quarter, according to a company statement.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 10:08PM ET</span>","Facebook keeps attracting digital ads, shares jump after hours","By Munsif Vengattil, Katie Paul and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) reported better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, showing that digital advertisers were still flocking to spend money on the service in order to reach customers even after a series of high profile embarrassments for the world's largest online social media network.
Investors have worried that Facebook's pledge to invest heavily to improve its privacy and security standards would blunt the company's growth, but its fourth-quarter results appeared to soothe those concerns, sending its stock price up more than 11 percent after hours. 
""The worst is over for this social media giant,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com: ""Its ad business and user engagement haven't been affected despite all the negative blows of the past year.""
The company has struggled with scandals over improperly shared customer data and propaganda on its service that tarnished its image and made it the target of political scrutiny across the globe last year. 
That has not significantly harmed advertising, where Facebook makes the vast majority of its revenue. Although ad prices have fallen, Facebook has been showing more ads, particularly on its Instagram app, as it finds users crave daily visual updates from friends, family and celebrities enough to sift past commercials and photo ads every few seconds.
The number of ad impressions across Facebook's system accelerated each quarter last year compared to the prior year's quarters, as Facebook moved more aggressively in generating revenue from Instagram after its initial caution on using that strategy, for fear of turning off users.
Total fourth-quarter revenue rose 30 percent to $16.9 billion from $12.97 billion, its slowest quarterly revenue growth in more than six years as a public company. It was, however, above analysts' average estimate of $16.4 billion. 
Net income rose to $6.88 billion, or $2.38 per share, up from $4.27 billion, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""These numbers are actually some of the most reassuring in its short history,"" said George Salmon, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""Not only are login trends in Europe improving after a stagnant couple of quarters, the group has beaten expectations on revenue and profit. These results will go a long way towards regaining the trust of Wall Street.""
Facebook shares rose more than 11 percent to $168.20 after the bell. They closed up 4.3 percent in regular trading.
MORE STORIES, MORE MESSAGES 
Facebook managed to increase sales despite a 2 percent drop in the average price per ad in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, as its ad views came from less lucrative areas such as Instagram's Stories feature and developing markets.
It was the first price decline since the final quarter of 2012, when Facebook lowered prices to stoke demand in emerging markets, but the company appeared to make up for the drop in overall sales volume.
Executives said on a conference call after reporting earnings that they would focus this year on finding new ways to push ads.
""People are creating more Stories and sending more messages, which means these are emerging areas of opportunity for marketers,"" said Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.
The higher sales figures helped offset total expenses, which surged in the fourth quarter to $9.1 billion, up 62 percent compared with a year ago. The operating margin fell to 46 percent in the fourth quarter from 57 percent a year ago.
Facebook's shares have lost a third of their value since July, when it first warned about slowing growth in revenue and operating margin. Despite Wednesday's bump, its share price remains near its lowest point in two years.
Facebook said on its conference call that total revenue growth rate this quarter would decelerate by mid-single digits, excluding currency fluctuations, compared to the fourth quarter, and continue to slow throughout the year.
It said it continued to expect 2019 total expenses to grow about 40 percent to 50 percent compared with 2018.
GRAPHIC-Facebook costs: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HD7isF 
Despite its privacy issues, Facebook managed to gain some new users, particularly in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Facebook said more than 2.7 billion users interact with at least one of its apps each month, up from 2.6 billion last quarter.
Monthly and daily users of the main Facebook app compared to last quarter were up 2.2 percent to 2.32 billion and 2.0 percent to 1.52 billion, respectively.
Estimates were for 2.3 billion monthly users and 1.5 billion daily users, according to Refinitiv averages.

Facebook shares continue to trade at a discount to peers. Shares entering Wednesday of No. 1 online ad seller Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, for instance, were priced at 22.4 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, compared to 19.3 times for Facebook.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics forecasts weaker 2019 earnings as chip sales slow,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd warned of weaker earnings in 2019 as it posted a 29 percent drop in fourth-quarter operating profit on Thursday, hit by a slowdown in demand for memory chips.
The global market leader in computer chips and smartphones said it expected ""overall annual earnings to decline"" this year, although sales of memory products would begin to revive in the second half.
Uncertainties over U.S.-China trade tensions and China's sluggish economy bode ill for global electronics makers in 2019, pressuring demand for memory chips, smartphones and display panels, analysts say.
But some investors are hoping for a recovery for Samsung in the second half, fueled by chip sales to data centers, the rollout of 5G wireless technology and the launch of new gadgets including its long-promised, high-end foldable smartphone.
""If Samsung’s foldable smartphone becomes a hit, it will be a good factor for Samsung’s shares,"" Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management which holds Samsung Electronics stock, told Reuters. 
Samsung said operating profit was 10.8 trillion won ($9.7 billion) in the fourth quarter, in line with its estimates earlier this month. Revenue fell 10 percent to 59.3 trillion won.
Samsung stock fell 0.2 percent after the result on Thursday, in a flat broader market. The shares lost 24 percent last year amid investor fears over the impact of the U.S.-China trade conflict.
The South Korean firm's chips power the handsets of most major smartphone makers, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and China's market leader, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Its memory and processor chips account for about 72 percent of overall profit. 
Samsung said memory demand was expected to remain weak in the first quarter before improving gradually from the second, helped by sales to cloud-computing companies.
Data centers have been one of the brightest spots for the memory chip market due to the growing need for cloud computing services for the e-commerce and data analytics industries. 
Such demand faltered late last year, partly because some Chinese buyers seem to have bought chips earlier than usual amid fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, according to  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Nvidia Corp and Intel both recently flagged stagnating growth in data center sales.
NEW GALAXY 
Fourth-quarter operating profit for Samsung's chip division fell 29 percent to 7.8 trillion won, the company said. Its mobile division logged a 1.5 trillion won profit, down 38 percent from a year ago.
While overall smartphone sales would remain flat this year, average prices would rise as more devices were built with expensive features like multi-cameras, Samsung said. 
Samsung is offering foldable phones and 5G-capable devices this year. Its new flagship Galaxy series will be unveiled next month, but no date has been set for the launch of the foldable device.
The South Korean giant has been struggling to defend its top rank in the global smartphone market against competition from Chinese rivals like Huawei, which last week said it could overtake Samsung this year.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief financial officer will leave the company as the automaker on Wednesday promised cheaper Model 3 sedans, the launch of Chinese production this year and profits in every quarter in 2019.
The departure of Deepak Ahuja as well as missing Wall Street profit targets for the end of 2018, sent Tesla shares down nearly 6 percent after hours. Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla's vice president of finance, will replace Ahuja, who is about 56 years old. 
Chief Executive Elon Musk touted strong demand for the Model 3, as the company begins to ship the car to Europe and Asia from its Fremont, California factory. But he acknowledged it was paramount to cut costs to lower the price of the vehicle for a wider customer base. 
""We have to be relentless about costs in order to make affordable cars and not go bankrupt,"" said Musk on a conference call with analysts. 
While the company expressed optimism that it could post a profit in the first quarter despite fewer deliveries of its flagship S and X vehicles, Tesla warned of challenges such as logistics and global deliveries of its new Model 3.
Tesla said plans to lower the price of the Model 3 were contingent on quickly building its factory in China. It hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles a year there by the last quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020, a goal it originally expected to meet in 2018. 
To start, the Shanghai factory will build 3,000 Model 3s per week, while production at Tesla's Fremont plant will rise to 7,000 Model 3s per week by year's end, the company estimated. 
""Bottom line is we need the Shanghai factory to achieve that 10,000 rate and have the cars be affordable,"" Musk told analysts. ""The demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability."" 
Musk announced a 7 percent workforce reduction earlier this month, saying it was crucial to cut costs to roll out a lower-priced, yet still profitable, Model 3.
The cheapest today is priced at $44,000. Musk gave a ""rough guess"" that Tesla would begin building its originally promised $35,000 version around the middle of this year. 
Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin called Tesla's results ""somewhat weak, but largely as expected.""
""We think people have been too bullish about Tesla showing earnings power, and sustained positive cash from operations,"" he said. 
MORE CASH 
Investors have wondered whether Tesla, which has never posted an annual profit, will seek more capital to fund a planned Model Y SUV, the building of factories in China and Europe, and the expansion of Tesla's existing Nevada battery plant, the Gigafactory.
Tesla said it ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and said it could pay a $920 million convertible bond maturing in March. 
""Tesla has a fantastic brand, and by all accounts a fantastic product, but we’re worried it’s also fantastically expensive,"" said Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""2019 could prove a make-or-break year.”
The winding down of a U.S. tax subsidy this year will make all Tesla cars more expensive and could hurt sales. 
Tesla said it expected lower S and X deliveries in the first quarter, given a ""pull-forward in demand"" in 2018 for those vehicles when the full subsidy was still available. Tesla recognizes revenue once a vehicle is delivered. 
In the fourth quarter, customer deposits decreased by $113 million from the prior quarter to $793 million. Tesla said it was working through its Model 3 backlog without clarifying further.
Asked about Model 3 reservations, Ahuja said that number was ""not relevant."" Tesla last disclosed in May that net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000. 
The company made a net profit of $139.5 million in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a $311.5 million in the third quarter, when it benefited from regulatory credits. (https:// Excluding items, Tesla earned $1.93 per share, missing expectations of $2.20 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Tesla's total revenue rose 5.9 percent to $7.23 billion, beating the analyst average estimate of $7.08 billion.

HANGZHOU, China/SHIELI, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - On a windswept steppe in southwestern Kazakhstan, the new Chinese-backed cement plant on the outskirts of the village of Shieli stands as a gleaming symbol to some of the Central Asian country's industrialization.
""We need oil-well cement for the oil and uranium industries,"" said Yevgeniy Kim, deputy governor of the Kyzylorda region where the plant is located.
""This plant should have been built much earlier. If it is needed, we will expand it,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of its opening ceremony in December, which was live-broadcast to the Kazakh capital Astana, where a nationwide event to present some of the country's newest projects to President Nursultan Nazarbayev was being held.
Built jointly by Gezhouba Group and Kazakh firm Corporation DANAKE, the plant is an illustration of how China is using its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to redraw its manufacturing footprint well beyond its own borders, reshaping industries in the process. 
But amid increased scrutiny of Belt and Road - a sprawling infrastructure plan meant to foster trade along a new ""Silk Road"" linking Asia with Europe, the Middle East and beyond - others say China is using the initiative to export industrial overcapacity, especially in heavy polluting industries.
While the drive has encouraged China's corporate giants to seek overseas business, some worry the trend could distort regional economies and increase their dependency on Chinese money. 
DRIVEN OUT
China says the four-year-old Belt and Road initiative, a signature policy of President Xi Jinping, is a ""win-win"" opportunity that helps other countries upgrade their transport and infrastructure links while boosting its own trade.
Chinese authorities have also suggested it as a possible solution to its industrial overcapacity woes, a legacy of the billions of dollars it poured into infrastructure projects to weather the 2008/09 global financial crisis, allowing firms to shift to areas where demand could still grow.
That idea has been acted upon by companies in sectors ranging from steel to cement to coal, industry executives and analysts say, shaking up global production maps.
""Every week there's news about a new cement plant in the Commonwealth of Independent States area or Asia area that is being built by (the Chinese),"" said Raluca Cercel, an associate at consultancy CW Group, which analyses the cement market.
Hundreds of cement plants have been shuttered in China under the pollution crackdown, according to state media, and the China Cement Association says that the country aims to eliminate about 400 million tonnes of capacity - about one-tenth of the total - by 2020.
Chinese majors such Gezhouba, Anhui Conch Cement and Shangfeng Cement in 2018 announced investments in at least 18 plants across Africa, Asia and South America with total annual capacity of more than 20 million tonnes - larger than the output of most European countries - according to industry publication Global Cement. 
GRAPHIC-China's concrete plans - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RywR1U
They are also building more plants on behalf of Western cement makers such as LafargeHolcim and HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), said David Perilli, an editor at Global Cement. 
These Chinese firms had no such overseas footprint a decade ago, executives said.
Gezhouba is keen to embrace the new opportunities, said Li Jinqing, general manager at the Chinese firm's Shieli subsidiary.
""We have 17 cement plants in China, this one is our first here,"" he said. ""We plan to build more plants in Central Asia and Kazakhstan, western Kazakhstan.. Everything will depend on the market.""

China has in the last five years stipulated that companies must install advanced anti-pollution technologies to meet raised standards for the production of materials such as cement, and has banned new cement capacity apart from projects that are considered ""absolutely necessary"".
Plants are also forced to shut down production when pollution levels are high.
Hangzhou-based Shangfeng Cement is another Chinese firm that is looking to expand its footprint, building plants in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. 
""The overcapacity situation in China has become very severe...which is why we considered going to countries along the Belt and Road,"" the company's vice president Qu Hui told Reuters in an interview. 
""China is currently able to produce more than 3 billion tonnes of cement, but there is only demand for about 2.2 billion tonnes in reality.""
Shangfeng had also received a $68 million low-interest loan from the Export-Import Bank of China to build its first overseas production line, an offer made under the Belt and Road initiative, he said. 
""The approval was done very quickly and the government was really supportive,"" he said. 
Chinese companies say the plants they are building abroad use the latest technology, are equipped with essential filters, and comply with local environment regulations.
However, environmental groups say the export of the pollution problems that dogged China's rapid industrialization is a concern.
""Most countries targeted by Chinese firms for industrial investments have very weak emissions and environmental standards and enforcement,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at Greenpeace's global air pollution unit.
""It's definitely a concern that they take place in this regulatory vacuum.""
Kazakhstan has no unified national pollution standards like those in place in the European Union and China, according to local campaign group the Association of Practicing Ecologists, and does not track mercury emissions from cement kilns.
""Given those differences in pollution standards in China and Kazakhstan, it might be profitable for China to shift cement plants - under the Belt and Road project - to Kazakhstan which has rich deposits of carbonates and silica used as cement feedstock,"" it said in an e-mail to Reuters.
While analysts said a number of central Asian countries were eager to ramp up cement production to create jobs and reduce reliance on imports as they seek to grow their manufacturing industries, there is a limit to how much new capacity their markets can absorb.
Landlocked Tajikistan, which has been a magnet for Chinese cement investors, exported 1 million tonnes of cement in 2017, up from just 500 tonnes in 2015, according to government data. 
Shangfeng's Qu said overcapacity could be hard to avoid, due to the highly efficient nature of Chinese cement manufacturing processes and their tendency to build bigger plants. 

""It's fine when you're the first there,"" he said. ""But when you have two to three companies building in one country together, overcapacity can emerge very quickly.""

United Natural Foods announced plans to acquire distributor Supervalu in July 2018 in a deal valued at $2.9 billion, according to a joint statement on United's website.
United claims in the lawsuit, which was filed in New York state court, that Goldman Sachs committed breach of contract and fraud, and that the firm improperly extracted around $200 million for the advisory and financing services it gave United.
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Nicole Sharp wrote in an emailed statement that the bank believes the claims have no merit, and the bank plans to ""vigorously defend ourselves against these accusations.""

651,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 06:02PM ET</span>",U.S judge holds off on imposing measures on PG&E to slash wildfire risks,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A judge on Wednesday opted against changing probation terms for PG&E Corp stemming from its felony conviction in a deadly 2010 natural gas pipeline blast that requires the power provider to take aggressive measures to prevent wildfires, including shutting down power lines.
At the end of an often heated hearing, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup said he would hold off on changing terms for now because he wants to first see a report PG&E must submit by Feb. 6 to California's utilities regulator on its measures and plans for tackling wildfire risks.
Alsup, however, scolded PG&E, stressing it is a convicted felon and that compelled him to step into the matter of its wildfire troubles out of concern for public safety.
""Safety's not your number one thing,"" Alsup said, suggesting the investor-owned power provider could have been using funds slated for dividends to instead pay for work to reduce wildfire risks from its equipment.
Alsup earlier this month proposed terms requiring San Francisco-based PG&E to cut back trees around power lines and turn off power lines during high winds that could topple trees and limbs into lines, sparking fires.
PG&E responded last week with a brief arguing it could cost up to $150 billion to fully comply with the scope of work Alsup had in mind, adding it would have to pass the cost to ratepayers who get their power from the company's nearly 100,000 miles (161,000 km) of overhead lines in northern California.
PG&E estimated it would have to remove 100 million trees and said shutting power lines during high winds would not be feasible because they traverse rural areas to service cities and suburbs. Idling lines could also affect the power grid in other states, PG&E said.
Alsup proposed the terms as PG&E was preparing to file for bankruptcy following massive wildfires that struck northern California in 2017 and 2018. 
The company filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday in anticipation of liabilities from the blazes, including November's Camp Fire, which killed 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, California.]
Filing for bankruptcy protection shields PG&E from claims, giving it time to figure out how to address wildfire liabilities it estimates at more than $30 billion.
While Alsup held off on revising probation terms, he found PG&E violated its probation by not adequately communicating with its probation officer about a settlement over a 2015 fire.
Alsup said he intends to continue scrutinizing PG&E because the start of California's fire season is only a few months away.

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the payments network processed more transactions on the back of higher consumer spending during the holiday season.
Visa's total payments volumes and the number of processed transactions rose 11 percent each, sending its shares up about 3 percent after the bell.
The United States recorded its strongest holiday season in six years backed on the strength in the economy. According to a Dec. 26 report by Mastercard (NYSE:MA), holiday spending rose 5.1 percent to more than $850 billion.
This boosted payments volume, which represents the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa's branding. The company charges a fee every time a merchant swipes a card that uses its network.
Payments volume at Visa is improving as it is heavily marketing and trying to bolster revenue at its Visa Direct platform, which enables real-time funds delivery directly to financial accounts using card credentials.
However, operating expenses rose 16.5 percent to $1.79 billion in the quarter as Visa, like its rival Mastercard spent more to partner with consumer brands, payment processors, hotels and airport lounges to offer subscribers better perks.
Due to this, expenses rose, but also boosted payment volumes. ""Visa's new partnerships and renewals are helping the company to attract more customers, boosting payment volumes,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Chris Brendler said.
Net income at the world's largest payment processor rose to $2.98 billion, or $1.30 per Class A share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.52 billion, or $1.07 cents per Class A share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, Visa earned $1.30 per share, beating the analyst average estimate of $1.25, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net revenue rose 13.24 percent to $5.51 billion in the quarter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.77%, the S&P 500 added 1.55%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.20%.
In the clearest sign yet that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to hike rates, the central bank ditched its statement language committing to gradually raising rates, pledging to remain patient.
""In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes,"" the Fed said.
On the balance sheet, the Fed said it ""is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.""
The dovish language allayed investor fears the central bank will overshoot on monetary policy, adding further momentum to stocks, which were on course to close higher thanks to upbeat earnings.
Dow components Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surged after delivering results that topped estimates.
Apple's report cleared up some of doubts that had clouded investors' outlook on the tech giant and suggested that iPhone sales may have bottomed, analysts said.
""Importantly, Apple made investors feel better about several recent debates -- weaker iPhone demand, gross margin risk and services growth deceleration,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
""IPhone sales trends may have bottomed, supplier data points are likely overly negative due to Apple's inventory build,"" it added.
Boeing, widely viewed as key barometer for global growth given its international exposure, shrugged off the ongoing U.S.-trade spat as it beat consensus on both the top and bottom lines.
On the economic front, investors digested mixed economic data. The private sector created more jobs than expected. But weakness in housing continued as pending home sales slumped to their lowest level since April 2014.
The bullish day on Wall Street arrived as the second round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks got underway. Investors are hopeful both nations can resolve their differences on trade and reach consensus on a deal before March 1, when the current 90-day trade-war truce is set to expire.
Without a deal, the United States has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and raise duties on imports to 25% from 10%.
In after-hours trade, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rallied as it topped analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 04:16PM ET</span>",Big thumbs-up from Wall Street after Fed signals patience on rates,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year, reassuring investors worried about a slowing economy.
Along with better-than-feared quarterly results from Apple Inc, the Fed's comments helped Wall Street reverse two down days triggered by profit warnings from U.S. bellwethers that signaled a bigger impact from a slowdown in China. 
The U.S. central bank held interest rates steady, as widely expected.
While the Fed said continued U.S. economic and job growth were still ""the most likely outcomes,"" it removed language from its December policy statement that risks to the outlook were ""roughly balanced"" and struck language that projected ""some further"" rate hikes would be appropriate in 2019.
It also said it could alter the pace of its balance sheet reduction ""in light of economic and financial developments"". The Fed's balance sheet surged following the 2008 financial crisis, and many investors believe its effort to shrink it may stifle economic growth.
Investors in recent months have become more concerned about the global economy. U.S. corporate results have shown companies including Apple,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) are feeling pain from the slowing expansion of China's economy, which has been hurt by a trade conflict with the United States. 
""The markets got what they were hoping for in the Fed's written statement, including both the notion of the central bank's patience on future rate hikes and greater flexibility in its approach to reducing its balance sheet,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz (DE:ALVG) in Newport Beach, California.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 6.83 percent after the company reported a sharp growth in services business, easing concerns after the iPhone maker earlier this month cut current-quarter sales forecast.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co gained 6.25 percent after the world's largest plane-maker forecast full-year profit and cash flow above analysts' estimates amid a boom in air travel and speedier 737 production.
Following the Fed's rate announcement, all three main U.S. stock indexes extended gains from earlier in the session and the S&P 500 closed at its highest since Dec. 6.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.77 percent to end at 25,014.86 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.55 percent to 2,681.05.
The Nasdaq Composite surged 2.2 percent to 7,183.08.
Investors were also tracking the latest round of talks between Washington and Beijing that began on Wednesday, the highest-level meeting since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce to their trade war in December.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index surged 2.87 percent, while the S&P technology index jumped 3.03 percent.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), set to report after the closing bell, rose 3 percent or more.
Of the 168 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, 73.2 percent have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 28 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.9 billion shares, compared with the 7.7 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 02:43PM ET</span>","Boeing shares soar on profit, aircraft forecast","By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co raised its profit and cash flow expectations for 2019 on Wednesday, sending shares up more than six percent amid a boom in air travel and faster production, though it was still fighting supplier delays on its cash-cow 737 jetliners.
The world's largest planemaker said it expects to deliver between 895 and 905 commercial aircraft in 2019, up from 806 aircraft it delivered last year, which - although just below company targets - kept it ahead of arch-rival Airbus SE for a seventh year.
Investors closely watch the number of planes Boeing turns over to airlines and leasing firms in a year for hints on the company's cash flow and revenue. 
Despite its rosy outlook, America's biggest exporter faces possible turbulence on a number of fronts in 2019, including financial stress felt by some of its airline customers, signs of a broader economic slowdown and U.S. trade tensions with China, where Boeing ships about 1 out of 4 aircraft that it makes. 
There are also unanswered questions related to the deadly crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia in October that thrust a spotlight on the newest version of the best-selling jet, as well as on airline training and maintenance.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts during a conference call that he saw progress in fresh U.S.-China trade talks and separately said aircraft orders would be ""moderated"" but healthy in 2019, although deliveries dropped in January.
Muilenburg said Boeing would make a final launch decision in 2020 on a proposed new mid sized jetliner, aimed at a niche market falling between narrow- and wide-body aircraft, depending on the results of a round of commercial pre-marketing which it may begin this year. He had previously spoken of a launch decision in 2019.
The decision on whether to launch the new jet, known as NMA, is expected to reshape competition with Airbus, which dominates the top end of the medium-haul sector.
Muilenburg said Boeing started running 787 Dreamliner assembly lines at a rate ready to support higher output of 14 jets a month, confirming an earlier Reuters report, bringing it within reach of a closely-watched goal designed to boost cash and reduce costs. 
The 787 transition to 14 per month will be completed by the second quarter, Muilenburg said.
Chicago-based Boeing said its quarterly operating margin on commercial aircraft increased to 15.6 percent from 11.6 percent from a year ago, driven by higher 737 production and higher margins on its Dreamliner.
Boeing's upbeat forecasts and full-year 2018 results - which included surpassing the $100 billion revenue mark for the first time in its 102-year history - boosted shares nearly 7 percent to $388.64, helping boost the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
737 ENGINE DELAYS 
Despite faster production, Boeing said it was still muscling through delays on engines supplied by CFM International - the trans-Atlantic venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), which contributed to a major bottleneck at the Seattle-area 737 factory last year. 
Related production problems dragged down quarterly free cash flow to $2.45 billion, below the previous year, Boeing said.
""We are deploying additional resources with them into their factories and supply chain,"" Muilenburg said regarding CFM. ""We do expect to recover, we're seeing signs of recovery, but we still have work to go.""
A chunk of the earnings call turned to newer aircraft, with Muilenburg telling analysts the first all-new 777X widebody test airplane completed final body join and power-on ahead of flight tests later this year. The program remains on track for first delivery in 2020, he said. 
Boeing also raised its full-year core earnings per share forecast to $19.90-$20.10 from $14.90-$15.10, and revenue to a range of $109.5 billion to $111.5 billion, from $98 billion to $100 billion, fueled by strong volume across its commercial, military and services businesses.
The company forecast operating cash flow between $17 billion and $17.5 billion in 2019, compared with cash flow of $15.32 billion in 2018, and above analysts' average estimate of $16.73 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It expects 2019 core earnings between $19.90 per share and $20.10 per share, and revenue between $109.5 billion and $111.5 billion. 
Boeing's core earnings rose to $5.48 per share in the fourth quarter, from $5.07 per share a year earlier, and came in above Wall Street's estimate of $4.57 per share.

Quarterly revenue rose 14.4 percent to $28.34 billion, above analysts' average expectation of $26.87 billion. Boeing's 2018 revenue surpassed the $100 billion mark for the first time in its 102-year history.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU considers proposals to exclude Chinese firms from 5G networks,"By Robin Emmott, Foo Yun Chee and Joanna Plucinska
BRUSSELS/WARSAW (Reuters) - The European Union is considering proposals that would effectively amount to a de-facto ban on Huawei Technologies Co. equipment for next-generation mobile networks, four senior EU officials said, adding to mounting international pressure on the world’s largest maker of telecom gear.
While efforts by the EU's executive are still at the very early stages, and could prove complicated to implement, the move marks a shift in the EU’s stance amid growing security concerns in the West about China.
A move to exclude Chinese firms such as Huawei would likely be welcomed by the United States, which has been trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei infrastructure equipment and has been pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are concerned the gear could be used by China’s government for espionage - a concern Huawei calls unfounded.
According to the four senior EU officials, one option under consideration by the European Commission is to amend a 2016 cybersecurity law, which requires businesses involved in critical infrastructure to take appropriate security measures.
By amending the definition of critical infrastructure to also include so-called fifth generation mobile networks, the law would effectively prevent EU businesses from using such equipment provided by any country or company suspected of using its equipment for spying or sabotage, the officials said.
Other changes could also be required or made, such as changes to procurement rules, the officials added.
The officials stressed that any changes weren’t about one company only and were prompted by broader national security concerns regarding China.
A Huawei spokeswoman said that “Huawei is open and committed to work with European institutions to develop a cyber security standard for Europe,” and added that the company’s opening of a new cybersecurity center in Brussels in March underlines its commitment to Europe.
“Huawei has a clean track record on cyber security,” the spokeswoman said. Huawei has denied accusations of spying and sabotage.
The Chinese government denies any intention to spy on the West and has decried a ban on Chinese 5G suppliers in the United States and Australia as unfounded. 
China's Ambassador to the EU, Zhang Ming, took a similar message to a private meeting at the Commission with EU tech commissioner Andrus Ansip on Jan. 29, arguing that Huawei should not be blocked from 5G auctions in Europe, one of the four officials said.
China’s mission to the EU could not be immediately reached for comment.
POTENTIAL SETBACK
The tougher stance reflects growing security concerns in the West about Huawei. Some Western countries, including the US and Australia, have restricted Huawei from accessing next-generation mobile networks and Germany is considering whether to do so.
European telecoms companies are preparing for the 5G technology that promises to link up everything from vehicles to factories at far greater speeds. If such measures were introduced by the EU, it could prove a setback for European efforts to stay competitive in 5G because it would likely lead to delays and extra costs in building out networks.
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Europe’s largest telecoms operator, on Wednesday proposed a series of steps to ensure that Chinese vendors could take part in building Germany’s 5G mobile networks without jeopardizing national security.
According to an internal Commission document reviewed by Reuters, the EU shift has been prompted by changes to Chinese intelligence and security laws in recent years. In one example cited in the Commission document, China's National Intelligence Law states that Chinese ""organizations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work.""
That has sparked fears that Chinese companies like Huawei could be asked by the Chinese government to incorporate “backdoors” into their equipment that would allow Beijing access, for spying or sabotage purposes, the EU officials said.
The Commission concluded that there didn’t need to be evidence that China was actually spying before a change in policy was made, according to the document.
Changing EU law isn’t straightforward and such an amendment would need to win approval from EU capitals. Even with that approval, it could be a year or more before a change to the law was made.
It might also involve the U.S.-led NATO military alliance through coordination with the EU on protecting 5G networks, although discussions are at a very tentative stage, the EU officials and two NATO diplomats said.
Still, the Commission hopes that the process of changing the law would have a chilling effect on business conducted by European countries with Chinese telecom equipment makers, according to one of the EU officials.
WAKE-UP CALL
The four EU officials say a wake-up call was Poland's arrest of a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegations earlier this month, which Huawei denies. Warsaw is in close contact with the Commission in Brussels and is pushing the EU to use legislation to exclude companies such as Huawei, according to a senior Polish government source.
China's Premier Li Keqiang is also expected to raise objections to any EU ban on Chinese equipment with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk at an annual summit in Brussels, which has been brought forward to April 9 at Beijing's request, the officials said. EU-China summits usually take place in July. 

But the EU has also insisted that Li meet Juncker and Tusk in Brussels before he meets central and eastern European leaders in a separate summit later in April. That format of 16 EU and non-EU states is unpopular in Brussels, which sees it as an attempt to divide the European Union.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>",Boeing to decide in 2020 whether it will launch new mid-sized jet,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday it would make a final launch decision in 2020 on its proposed new mid-sized jetliner, depending on the results of a round of commercial pre-marketing which it may begin this year.
Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg, who previously spoke of a launch decision in 2019, said no decision has yet been made on whether to provisionally offer the aircraft to airlines in order to test demand.
But if it does so, that would happen this year, followed by a decision on whether to go ahead with the industrial launch, which typically marks the official start of the development work for a new aircraft in 2020.
""So this year's decision is what we call authority to offer,"" Muilenburg told analysts on a conference call after the company reported better-than-expected results. ""That's based on the business case and our ability to go and have deep, detailed discussions with customers.""
""And then, depending on the market response and our ability to build the right kind of group of launch customers, then we get to an official launch, or authority to launch, decision next year,"" he said.
Whether or not Boeing moves forward with the new mid-sized plane, known as NMA, to serve a niche market falling between narrow- and wide-body aircraft is expected to reshape competition with arch-rival Airbus SE which dominates the top end of the medium-haul sector. 
The clock is ticking. Boeing's plane must enter the market in 2025, when airlines will be retiring Boeing 757s and 767s, with Airbus poised to scoop up new plane orders.
In July, Muilenburg said, ""we're looking at making a launch decision in 2019."" Muilenburg at the time said Boeing was working to protect 2025 as the entry-into-service date that ""aligns with our customers' needs and desires.""

692,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: AMD, Apple Tee up Tech Rally ","Investing.com – A surge in Advanced Micro Devices and Apple teed up a strong rally across tech stocks as earnings from both companies were not as bad as many had feared.
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) posted in line earnings and revenue that narrowly fell short of estimates. Its shares rallied 16%, though some analysts continued to express caution.
Fourth-quarter earnings were $0.08 share, in line with consensus estimates and revenue of $1.42 billion just missed estimates for $1.45 billion.
Investor expectations heading into the report had been dented by Nvidia warning on Tuesday that revenue would miss expectations, owing to slowing revenue in gaming and data center segments.
For the fiscal first quarter, the chipmaker expects revenue in a range of $0.75 billion to $1.25 billion, which would be a 24% year-on-year decline, the company said. That was short of analysts' estimates of $1.47 billion.
Still, some on Wall Street expressed caution on the stock.
""We continue to model for server share gains at the more optimistic end of the company's 4-6 quarter target, and solid continued gains in consumer desktop and notebook, but still think the most likely path is slow growth this year,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, reported earnings of $4.18 share on $84.3 billion in revenue in the fiscal first quarter, ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings of $4.17 on $84 billion in revenue. Its shares rose 5%.
Total revenue from all other products and services grew 19%, while iPhone sales declined 15%.
The earnings report suggested that iPhone sales may have bottomed and cleared up some investor doubts that had clouded the outlook on the iPhone maker, analysts said.
""Importantly, Apple made investors feel better about several recent debates -- weaker iPhone demand, gross margin risk and services growth deceleration,"" Morgan Stanley said.
""iPhone sales trends may have bottomed, supplier data points are likely overly negative due to Apple's inventory build, and while iPhone replacement cycles are lengthening globally this headwind appears manageable outside of a few emerging markets facing macro and currency headwinds."""

712,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",Luxury stocks may yet lose luster despite China's taste for Vuitton,"By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - Even if LVMH is right that Chinese demand is as strong as ever for items like its $3,150 Louis Vuitton mini-backpacks, there are still plenty of danger signs for luxury stocks this year, from slowing U.S. growth to a drop in Swiss watch exports.
LVMH's reassuring fourth-quarter performance and outlook put paid to fears for now that demand in China is stalling and lifted shares at European luxury peers on Wednesday, who depend on Chinese consumers for a third of sales.
But hints of softer demand in the United States evoked by Britain's Burberry, and dips in Swiss watch exports spell challenging times ahead after a mixed 2018, including for the likes of IWC owner Richemont or Swatch. 
Brands at the top end of the luxury scale - which like Vuitton retain a strong pricing power, and have built an exclusive image by banishing discounts and controlling stocks tightly - may continue to fare better, some investors said. 
""The very high end of the market seems to be immune for now,"" said Frederic Rozier, a portfolio manager at Mirabaud, which holds LVMH shares. 
A standout performance at LVMH's fashion and leather goods unit was encouraging for peers like Kering's Gucci, and Hermes, maker of $10,000-plus Birkin handbags, due to report sales in February, Rozier added. 
By contrast, Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo and Burberry - both in turnaround mode, with the former trying to limit outlet sales and the latter bidding to move its ranges more upmarket - posted muted October to December sales growth, despite also reporting encouraging signals from China. 
Enduring momentum in Asia bears out for now brands' argument that young, middle class Chinese are developing a lasting taste for high-end goods, after luxury stocks were battered in recent months by worries about a fallout in China from the Washington-Beijing trade war and cooling economic growth.
Shopping in Paris last week, Michelle Wang, a 38-year-old who runs her own small business in Shanghai, said premium brands retained their allure for her and her friends. 
""Even if it's expensive, the quality is high,"" Wang said, adding she had bought a passport holder, handbag and scarf at Vuitton on her French trip.
(Graphic: Luxury earnings revisions Jan 30 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TmpCrs)
SOFTER U.S. SALES?
But changing spending patterns could catch out brands unless they adapt quickly enough. Roughly two thirds of Chinese consumers' purchases are made overseas, but soon half could happen within mainland China, analysts at HSBC estimate. 
U.S. jeweler Tiffany, with more stores in the Americas than elsewhere, felt the pinch during its holiday sales, with a strong dollar dissuading Chinese travelers.
Hong Kong, the world's biggest market for premium watches, has lost out in recent months as a weak yuan deters China's shoppers, dragging on Richemont's sales growth there.
Some recent data points also jar with a rosy picture even in mainland China. Global Swiss watch exports fell in December, dragged down by a downturn there, figures this week showed. 
In the United States, LVMH said Vuitton and its Christian Dior brands's performance among American clients was ""excellent"". 
But Burberry, which partly sells through wholesalers, highlighted a trickier U.S. backdrop, at a time when it is also grappling with Britain's potentially chaotic exit from the European Union. 
""We saw a softening in sentiment generally in terms of the macro environment in America,"" financial chief Julie Brown told analysts in January, citing falling traffic at department stores. 
Anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests in France, which forced some Parisian boutiques to close during riots last December, are also expected to rumble on. 
Revenues from tax refunds in France, frequently used by Chinese or U.S. shoppers, could fall 4 percent in the first quarter as a result, according to sector specialist Global Blue.
LVMH did not disclose any discernable impact from the French demonstrations on Tuesday, however. Its shares were up 7 percent by 1500GMT, leading a rally across the sector.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) reported slower wireless customer growth and larger declines in its pay-TV business than Wall Street expected, sending its shares down 4 percent on Wednesday.
The second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has turned its focus to paying down debt after spending $85 billion to buy media company Time Warner. It has also pulled back on promotional pricing for phone and television plans, sacrificing new customer gains.
""I would say we're ahead of schedule in each of our key priorities,"" said AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson during a call with analysts.
The company's debt was $171 billion at the end of 2018, after paying off some $9 billion since the Time Warner merger closed in June. 
In communications, AT&T's largest business, the carrier gained a net 134,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, falling far short of analysts' estimates of 208,000, according to research firm FactSet. AT&T has 153 million total phone subscribers. 
Churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 1 percent during the fourth quarter, up from 0.89 percent the previous year.
AT&T has had a relatively ""burdened"" wireless network, which can lead to slower data speeds, while smaller rival T-Mobile US Inc has been rapidly expanding its network capacity, contributing to the higher churn, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research.
AT&T's entertainment segment, which includes satellite TV provider DirecTV, has been in continuous decline. It lost more subscribers during the quarter as viewers shifted to cheaper streaming services, just not those owned by AT&T.
DirecTV Now, AT&T's streaming service, lost 267,000 subscribers, more than analysts expected, which the company blamed on customers leaving once discounted introductory offers ran out. 
DirecTV lost 403,000 satellite TV subscribers, more than the estimate of 328,000 customer losses, according to research firm FactSet. 
Analysts had been closely watching the entertainment segment's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) after AT&T had committed to stabilizing the decline.
But entertainment EBITDA fell by 15.6 percent during the quarter. That illustrated ""just how steep the climb"" will be to reach stability, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, in a note. 
AT&T's investors may be expecting the company to eventually cut its 7 percent dividend yield, shown by AT&T's falling stock price over time, Moffett said. 
The new WarnerMedia segment, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported quarterly revenue of $9.23 billion, beating estimates of $9.05 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
AT&T's total revenue rose 15.2 percent to $47.99 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $48.5 billion.
Net income attributable to AT&T fell to $4.86 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $19.04 billion, or $3.08 per share, a year earlier, when the company had a big one-time benefit from the U.S. tax overhaul.
Excluding items, the company earned 86 cents per share, in line with estimates.
Shares of AT&T declined 3.7 percent to $29.56 in afternoon trading.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",Offtakers face challenge as Asia demand lags surging U.S. LNG output,"By Sabina Zawadzki
VIENNA (Reuters) - Surging production of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and slower growth of demand in Asia this year could leave companies that have committed to long-term purchase contracts struggling to find markets.
Several European and Asian utilities have signed up to long-term deals for U.S. LNG that last 10 to 15 years.
When they signed up five years or so ago, buyers were confident Asia could soak up any extra supplies produced by the U.S. LNG industry, which at the time had barely got going.
But forecasts for Asian LNG demand have been reined in, despite strong growth in China last year, while U.S. output has been shooting up. U.S. capacity is expected to hit 65.2 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by the end of 2019 from 36.8 mtpa in 2018.
""You've seen some European utilities getting into the U.S. and I'm not sure it's going well. There are some contracts where they probably wish they hadn't,"" said David Cox, who runs London Energy Consulting.
Asian demand is still expanding. China's LNG imports in December climbed 25 percent from the same period a year earlier to a monthly record of 6.29 million tonnes.
But the 2018 surge was exceptional. The spurt at the end of the year was in part due to Chinese firms stockpiling supplies to avoid a repeat of last winter's gas shortages.
Analysts at IHS Markit and Wood Mackenzie expect growth to slow to 15-20 percent this year, as China eases up on its push to switch to gas from coal for heating.
As a result, some U.S. companies are pinning their hopes on Europe. When U.S. Cheniere Energy started two new LNG facilities at the end of last year, it led to record amounts of U.S. cargoes heading to Europe.
OFFLOADING COMMITMENTS
""The equation is very, very simple at the moment. Supply is coming on, Asia is growing. The extent to which supply beats Asia, we’ll see supply coming into Europe,"" said Andrew Walker, vice president of strategy at Cheniere Marketing.
Europe consumes half a trillion cubic meters of natural gas a year, far more than the total global LNG market, which stood at 300 mtpa at the end of 2018.
But most European supplies come via pipeline, much of it from Russia. Despite Washington's push to wean European states off those supplies, there is little sign of major shift yet.
European utilities such as  Centrica  (LON:CNA), RWE,  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and EDF (PA:EDF) do not face an immediate crunch. Some long-term U.S. contracts only kick in later this year.
But some buyers in the Asian market have already been offloading commitments to buy U.S. LNG, including Australia's Woodside Petroleum, GAIL (India) and Indonesia's Pertamina.
Japan's Toshiba paid $800 million to transfer its obligation to buy 2.2 mtpa from a U.S. terminal.
Europe also made an attractive market for U.S. LNG when shipping rates spiked last year because it is closer than Asian markets to U.S. terminals, which lie on the eastern side of the United States.
Elena Sidorochkina, head of LNG at the trading arm of Austria's energy company OMV, said high shipping rates could force more cooperation and partnerships between buyers. 
""If there is a lack of shipping, the offtakers will have to find a different way of placing them (cargoes),"" she said.
Tokyo Gas and RWE and Centrica have already reached deals to combine some shipping and delivery arrangements.
""There will be a day when shipping capacity will be traded in the same way you trade LNG -- you will have shipping futures contracts,"" said Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at Total. ""It will be part of the trading tools.""

736,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>",Boeing speeds 787 line to prepare for output of 14 jets a month,"SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has started boosting 787 Dreamliner production to 14 jets a month from 12, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Wednesday, putting the U.S. planemaker within reach of a key target designed to boost cash and lower costs.
It expects to complete the increase in production in the second quarter, Muilenburg told analysts on a conference call.
""We have started transitioning to 14 a month in our factories and supply chains as we prepare to begin delivering at this higher rate,"" Muilenburg said.
The comments follow an earlier Reuters report that Boeing had starting running 787 lines at a rate ready to support the higher output of 14 jets a month.
While factories are already absorbing parts at the new speed, it can take several months for new jetliners to work their way through final testing and delivery. Some gaps in production are typically introduced to smooth such changeovers.
Boeing has previously said it aims to reach the new production rate in 2019.

Boeing shares jumped on Wednesday as the world's largest planemaker raised its profit and cash flow expectations for 2019 amid a boom in air travel.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 10:39AM ET</span>","GE to combine renewable, grid assets into single unit","By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co said on Wednesday it would fold its battery storage and electrical grid units into its wind turbine and hydropower business to cut costs, speed decision-making and cater to surging demand for renewable power.
The announcement, a day before GE was due to report fourth-quarter results, will eliminate a layer of management mostly based in Chicago, with minimal reduction in staff. The combined unit will have about 40,000 employees and annual revenue of about $16 billion, GE spokesman Jim Healy said in an interview, compared with $10.2 billion for renewable energy last year.
GE's renewables business currently comprises on- and offshore wind turbines, plus hydropower. GE's units handling electrical transmission and distribution grids, battery storage and solar inverters and controls had been in GE's Power business, which is focused on fossil fuel generation. Regional leaders for renewables will now deal directly with the company's renewables headquarters in Paris. GE does not make solar panels.
The move is GE's first big structural shift since October, when it said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice had expanded accounting probes to include a $22 billion writedown of goodwill at GE Power in the third quarter.
To help its ailing power business, GE said in October it would separate natural gas power from coal, nuclear and grid, and named new leaders for the units. Some analysts interpreted the moves as GE preparing its non-gas businesses for sale.
GE's newest gas turbines are under scrutiny after a broken blade severely damaged a unit in Texas last year, causing a two-month plant outage. The break has forced some utilities to curtail use of their new GE turbines while they await blade replacements, and GE has since said it knew about the problem after a similar blade broke in 2015. 
GE's power division took on added importance to GE's future earnings after the company announced last year it would focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy and dispose of its healthcare unit and majority stake in Baker Hughes, along with other restructuring.
GE's renewable energy unit contributed about 9 percent of the company's industrial revenues in 2017, before the integration. Power contributed about 28 percent.
""This strategic realignment positions GE to lead in the fast-growing renewable energy market,"" GE Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Culp said in a statement.

GE shares were up 0.7 percent at $8.96 in early trading

Man Group Plc, the world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager, is poised to start a fund to finance construction of affordable homes, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Man has hired former Cheyne Capital Management (U.K.) LLP partner Shamez Alibhai to run the pool, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Man Group and Alibhai declined to comment through representatives for the firm.
The hedge fund will join investors such as buyout firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP as well as mutual funds in seeking to tap opportunities within the social housing sector as money managers pursue higher yields in the prevailing low-interest rate environment. The stock of affordable housing in the U.K. remains under pressure following a cut in government grants to support new construction and soaring values that are putting home ownership beyond the reach of many families.
More than 1.1 million households were on local authorities’ waiting lists in England for housing as of April 1, according to government data.
Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity investor in real estate, made its foray into the sector by acquiring a 90 percent stake in social housing provider Sage Housing in late 2017. The firm’s strategy is to buy and then rent out lower-cost apartments that developers are required to build alongside private homes.
Alibhai, a former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG executive, joined investment manager Cheyne in 2006 and set up its Social Property Impact Fund in 2014. Under his leadership, the pool of money was used to acquire and build properties for the elderly and people with low incomes or disabilities in the U.K., and then lease the buildings to social-service providers. Following Alibhai’s departure in December, Cheyne moved the pool to sit within the real estate group led by Ravi Stickney.
Man Group, which managed about $114 billion at the end of September, is no stranger to real estate investing. In 2016, it purchased Aalto Invest Holding AG, whose portfolio includes direct investments in U.S. single-family homes as well as commercial and residential properties in Europe."
747,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 10:03AM ET</span>","U.S., China launch high-level trade talks amid deep differences","By David Lawder and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China opened a pivotal round of high-level talks on Wednesday aimed at digging out from their months-long trade war amid deep differences over Chinese practices on intellectual property and technology transfer.
Cabinet-level officials, led by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, gathered in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House, with about a month to reach a deal before a March 2 U.S. deadline to increase tariffs on Chinese goods.
During a photo opportunity at the start of the scheduled two days of talks, Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top Trump administration officials sat silently across a long table from their Chinese counterparts, ignoring a reporter's questions.
After a few minutes, Lighthizer broke the silence with joking small talk about table positioning and appearing in photographs from the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina last year. 
The talks began two days after the United States charged Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide.
Meng was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which is seeking to have her extradited.
The talks in Washington are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Chinese officials are willing to address core U.S. demands to fully protect American intellectual property rights and end policies that Washington has said force U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms.
The U.S. complaints, along with accusations of Chinese cyber theft of U.S. trade secrets and a systematic campaign to acquire U.S. technology firms, were used by the Trump administration to justify punitive U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.
Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2 if an agreement cannot be reached. He has also threatened new tariffs on the remainder of Chinese goods shipped to the United States. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own, but has suspended some and is allowing some purchases of U.S. soybeans during the talks.
Chinese officials deny that their policies coerce technology transfers. 
They have emphasized steps already taken, including reduced automotive tariffs and a draft foreign investment law that improves access for foreign firms and promises to outlaw ""administrative means to force the transfer of technology.""
China is fast-tracking that new law, with the country's largely rubber-stamp parliament likely to approve it in March.
A crucial component of any progress in the talks, according to top Trump administration officials, is agreement on a mechanism to verify and ""enforce"" China's follow-through on any reform pledges that it makes. This could maintain the threat of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods for the long term.
As members of the Chinese delegation left their hotel near the White House, a small group of Chinese protesters held placards highlighting various grievances against the China's government, including the unfair taking of properties. 
TEMPERED EXPECTATIONS
Some business groups watching the talks were tempering expectations for a breakthrough. With a month to go before the deadline, it was unlikely that either side would put their best offers on the table in the next two days, said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
""I don't think there's going to be any big outcome,"" Ennis said of the talks scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. ""Hopefully they make some good progress that will set them up to be able to get to completion at the end of the 90 days.""
But the Chinese side would likely have to bring to the table a new offer that goes significantly beyond its previous offers to significantly increase purchases of U.S. goods, including soybeans, energy and manufactured goods.

People familiar with the talks said manufactured goods, a key priority for the Trump administration, were among the largest components of Chinese purchase pledges aimed at significantly reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China. But here, too, there are ""no guarantees"" that Beijing would follow through on these pledges, one of the people said.

749,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 09:40AM ET</span>","U.S. Debt Sales Break Records Again, Feeding Deficit Criticism","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury Department announced plans to issue another record-breaking amount of debt, giving President Donald Trump’s re-election opponents more ammunition as they question whether his tax cuts will pay for themselves.
The federal budget shortfall is set to swell, driven by tax cuts, spending increases and an aging American population. As a result, the Treasury is raising its long-term debt issuance at its quarterly refunding auctions to $84 billion, the department said Wednesday, $1 billion more than three months ago. Such elevated levels of borrowing will finance the widening deficit, with Wall Street strategists projecting new debt issuance will top $1 trillion for a second straight year.
The ballooning national debt is already being drawn into the 2020 presidential election campaign. Former  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering running as an independent, earlier this week said the U.S.’s debt levels are a example both Republicans’ and Democrats’ “reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.”
Debt sales have already surpassed levels last seen when the country was digging out of its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Combined with needing to fund the shortfall, the Treasury has been selling more debt as a result of the Federal Reserve’s strategy to slowly let government debt roll off its balance sheet.
Initial tax receipts call into question the Trump administration’s projection that extra economic growth would generate enough revenue to offset its tax cuts. Corporate income taxes paid to the U.S. Treasury fell to $205 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 -- a 31 percent drop from the prior year. A decrease of that magnitude is unusual during a period of economic growth.
The Congressional Budget Office forecasts the federal budget deficit will top $1 trillion in 2020, with the U.S. government spending about $7 trillion just to service that debt.
The massive fiscal shortfall has drawn concern from investors, with DoubleLine Capital LP’s Jeffrey Gundlach calling it a “horrific situation” in his annual webcast. Billionaire investor Seth A. Klarman, in a letter presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said global social tension, receding American leadership and rising debt levels all present a red flag.
In its refunding announcement, the Treasury said it will keep auctions of nominal coupon and floating-rate debt stable over the coming quarter and anticipates boosting issuance of inflation-linked securities starting in February.
The Treasury Department reiterated that a suspension period for the nation’s statutory debt limit ends March 1, though so-called extraordinary accounting measures can continue to finance the government temporarily. In the statement, the Treasury said it’s too early to provide a precise forecast for how long those will last.
“Treasury does not anticipate bill issuance to be as volatile as it has been in the past when prior debt limit suspension periods expired,” the agency said. It does not expect to reduce bill issuance in advance of the debt limit expiration date.
Strategists at most dealer firms had predicted Treasury would not lift nominal note and bonds sales and begin expanding TIPS issuance. That’s because bolstered auction sizes over the past four quarters, along with utilizing bills sales, is seen sufficient to allow the government to finance its funding gap with a second year of over $1 trillion in new debt.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 09:32AM ET</span>",Alibaba sales grow at weakest pace in three years as slowing China bites,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - E-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's quarterly revenue grew at its weakest pace since 2016, as the impact of a slowing Chinese economy and a crippling Sino-U.S. trade war kept buyers away during its top-sale season.
The result is likely to add to investor worries as it highlights the mounting pressures facing the e-commerce behemoth, whose sales are often seen as a yardstick of consumer spending in the world's second-largest economy. 
Alibaba, the second most valuable public company in Asia after Tencent, posted on Thursday third-quarter revenue of 117.28 billion yuan ($17.47 billion), compared with 83 billion yuan a year earlier.
That compares with an estimate for revenue of 118.9 billion yuan from 31 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Net income rose 33 percent to 30.96 billion yuan, however, beating estimates and sending Alibaba's stock up by about 1.6 percent in pre-market trade. Alibaba typically posts its highest revenue in the December quarter due to its mega ""Singles' Day"" in November - the world's biggest online sales event that outstrips the sales of U.S. shopping holidays Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. In 2018, even though Alibaba netted a record $30 billion from the Singles' Day, annual growth dropped to the weakest rate in the event's 10-year history as a slowing Chinese economy and trade tensions chilled sentiment.
Anticipating headwinds from economic uncertainty, Alibaba had lowered its revenue outlook for its financial year ending March even before the top sales season.
However, last week, Alibaba's executive vice-chairman, Joe Tsai, noted that sales had ticked up in December, although demand for big-ticket items continued to slow. 
Tsai also brushed aside concerns about the trade war, saying people were overly worried about its impact on China's economy.
Chinese consumers are still fundamentally very strong and consumption is going to grow over the next 5-10 years, he added.
""We live in an environment where external factors seem to drive investor sentiment regarding Alibaba's business,"" said Tsai in a call with analysts following the results on Wednesday.
On the same call, chief executive Daniel Zhang said the company remains optimistic despite facing uncertainties, adding that younger buyers were driving sales. 
Alibaba's founder Jack Ma has previously described the China-U.S. trade spat as the ""most stupid thing in the world"".
China's economic growth in 2018 slowed to its weakest in nearly three decades amid faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs. Growth is expected to ease further this year.
On Tuesday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said revenue growth rates for domestic technology companies did not rise in 2018, and that consumer spending had slowed amid increased economic pressures.
Businesses worldwide are bearing the brunt of slowing growth in China growth, which has generated a third of global growth in recent years. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) this weak said its iPhone sales slipped in the holiday shopping quarter for the first time due to weak demand in the Asian country.
Given signs of saturation in China's urban market, Alibaba has been trying to grow outside of its core e-commerce business to win new customers. 
The company continued to invest heavily in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and online entertainment in the December quarter. Revenue from its cloud business rose 84 percent to 6.6 billion yuan, while sales from its digital entertainment and media business rose 20 percent to 6.5 billion yuan.

There were 1,442 restaurant insolvencies in 2018, up 40 percent compared to 2017, Insolvency Service data obtained by Price Bailey showed. Four restaurant businesses a day are going bust, up from under two a day in 2010.
Paul Pittman, Partner at Price Bailey, said 2018 was ""easily the toughest year for the sector.""
""The challenging trading conditions facing the restaurant sector show no signs of improving,"" he said.
""Chain restaurants are particularly vulnerable to changing consumer fads. What was once flavor of the month can quickly go out of fashion.""
In 2018, burger chain Byron, Argentinian steak restaurant Gaucho, and Italian chains Prezzo, Carluccio's and Jamie's Italian all used Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVA), an insolvency procedure to restructure their businesses and remain trading.
Price Bailey said mid-market restaurants had expanded too quickly, resulting in too many restaurants competing for customers. Apps like Just Eat and Deliveroo have also increased competition from the takeaway sector.
As well as issues with oversupply, demand from consumers is also dwindling. 
Personal insolvencies have soared to their highest level since 2010, data on Tuesday showed, the latest sign of vulnerability in Britain's consumer economy.

""Restaurants are capital-intensive businesses,"" Pittman said. ""Many are perpetually walking a balance-sheet tightrope and it often only takes a few months of poor takings to send them over the edge.""

Alibaba’s results came after a stunning day for China when at least 20 companies warned investors that full-year earnings would lag expectations. Its resounding beat stemmed in part from a $3.3 billion accounting gain after revaluing a subsidiary, and executives warned of uncertainty during a deceleration of the world’s second largest economy.
China is showing signs of further deterioration, hurting the consumer demand that Alibaba’s e-commerce businesses rely on. Still, it’s been spearheading a drive into lucrative new spheres such as rural markets, cloud services and entertainment. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang told analysts those new initiatives as well as a global expansion should help offset the impact of an economic slowdown.
“China’s economy is facing some uncertainty, but we do see opportunities,” Zhang told analysts on a conference call. “One of the key regions we will stay focused on in the near term is Southeast Asia.”
Shares of Alibaba were up about 2 percent in pre-market trade, after sliding 1.3 percent Tuesday.
Net income at China’s biggest e-commerce company rose 37 percent to 33.1 billion yuan in the December quarter, outpacing the 22.1 billion yuan projected. It booked a gain of 21.99 billion yuan after re-valuing on-demand services arm Koubei. The share of losses from the numerous companies it’s invested in also narrowed sharply. Adjusted earnings-per-share was 12.2 yuan compared with the 11.2 yuan projected.
While revenue rose 41 percent to 117.3 billion yuan, that was the slowest pace in more than two years and lagged the 119.4 billion-yuan projected. Alibaba itself is bracing for more nervous consumers in 2019: in November, it trimmed its sales outlook by as much as 6 percent.
“The market might view this as the end of the adjustment period and the worst is behind us, and send shares up,” said Eric Wen, founder and CEO of Blue Lotus Capital Advisors. “E-commerce active customer growth is good, mobile monthly active users of e-commerce app is good, but profitability was pretty bad as expected.”
Cloud revenue rose 84 percent in the December quarter, helping the company command half the domestic market for internet-based computing services. Growth also sprang from a decision to take control of delivery network Cainiao, meals-on-demand service Ele.me and video platform Youku. Those expansions however have shifted the company away from an asset-light model.
Alibaba could tap new revenue spigots this year such as personalized feed recommendations, which now generate more traffic than traditional search on its e-commerce platforms. The feed on Taobao, one of Alibaba’s largest shopping platforms, pushes products that it thinks users will likely purchase based on their history. Many users browse those recommendations to kill time, driving engagement.
But for now, executives sounded a cautious note on the looming economic uncertainty, joining a chorus from around the globe warning about China’s weaker demand.
“While the Chinese economy suggests a bleaker outlook in 2019, the company continues to grow its user base at a healthy rate and is working on monetizing new ad revenue streams, which should keep driving growth in the coming year,” said Oscar Orozco, an eMarketer forecasting analyst.

Congress increased the debt ceiling through March 1, after which the Treasury will need to use so-called ""extraordinary"" accounting measures to fund itself until it runs out of cash. Analysts expect the cash could run out late in the summer without a new agreement.
The Treasury said it will have a larger cash balance in the run-up to March 1 relative to past debt ceiling impasses, which will mean a relatively steady level of short-term bond issuance.
""As a result, Treasury does not need to reduce bill issuance as dramatically,"" Brian Smith, Treasury's deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said in a statement. ""Treasury does not anticipate bill issuance to be as volatile as it has been in the past when prior debt limit suspension periods expired.""

The Treasury also said it was keeping issuance of bonds and notes steady in the coming three months although it anticipated an increase in bill issuance until around the middle of April.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","PwC, EY join KPMG in banning consulting for audit customers","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Two of the Big Four accounting firms said will stop offering consulting services to audit customers in an effort to restore public trust in a sector shaken by corporate scandals.
PwC and EY told a panel of British lawmakers they would mirror a change already underway at another Big Four firm, KPMG, in a bid to end a ""perception"" of conflict between selling audit and consulting work to the same customer.
Consulting is better paid than audit work, raising concerns that an accountant won't challenge a company's management properly regarding an audit for fear of losing more lucrative advisory work.
KPMG said last November it would phase out advisory work for its British accounting clients as the Big Four faced calls from lawmakers to be broken up after the collapse of construction firm Carillion, which KPMG audited.
""We will do a ban on anything for audit clients other than audit related services,"" Kevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner of PwC UK told parliament's business committee.
It would not improve audit quality, however, Ellis said.
The ban would be put in place over the next six months as new work comes up, Ellis said.
""Yes, we will follow that,"" said Steve Varley, chairman of EY UK, adding that EY was consulting with clients about a ban.
The largest Big Four firm, Deloitte, said it wanted to see the final package of audit market reforms before deciding whether to stop offering consulting services to its top audit customers.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed measures to inject more choice in the audit market where the Big Four check the books of most big listed companies.
""We want to wait to see what the total package agreed is,"" David Sproul, Deloitte UK's senior partner and chief executive officer, told the business committee.
""The CMA, in their interim findings, decided there was no problem with non-audit services,"" Sproul said.

Lawmakers are looking at how it could ensure that reforms being proposed by the CMA and plans to replace the sector's regulator will be implemented.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 08:27AM ET</span>",Pernod stocks drinks cabinet to prevent no-deal Brexit headache,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) has begun shipping extra stocks of some alcoholic drinks between Britain and continental Europe as part of its contingency plans in case of a no-deal Brexit. 
The maker of Chivas Regal whisky in Scotland, Perrier-Jouet champagne in France and Campo Viejo wine in Spain has taken ""progressive"" steps in some markets in recent months, a spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday.
With Britain at risk of leaving the European Union without a deal after lawmakers demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate an accord with the rest of the bloc, Pernod is not alone in increasing stocks to avoid potential border delays for imports and exports.
L'Oreal said last week it was stocking up on cosmetics in Britain, and other firms including Nestle, Burberry and Airbus have also increased stocks ahead of the March 29 Brexit deadline.
""In some markets we've already done it, in some markets no,"" the Pernod spokesman said, without giving details on specific brands or markets. ""There is no panic. It's just a plan to avoid any disruption of our distribution.""

Pernod, which is a major whisky producer in Britain, had not rented any new warehouses to stock mountains of bottles, the spokesman said, adding that the firm hoped that a divorce deal will be agreed between Brussels and London, echoing other makers of Scotch, Britain's biggest food and drink export.

The company, which has radically rebuilt itself in the last couple of years under pressure from changing consumer tastes, booked a rising number of guests for the second straight year as global comparable sales rose 4.4% in the fourth quarter. That was a modest acceleration from 4.2% in the third quarter. It was the first time it had posted two straight years of customer growth since 2012, chief executive Steve Easterbrook said in a press release.
Notably, consolidated earnings adjusted for foreign exchange effects were flat year-on-year, after being down 5% in the three months to September.
The firm reported earnings per share of $1.97 on revenue of $5.16 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $1.89 on revenue of $5.17 billion. That compared to EPS of $1.71 on revenue of $5.34 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported EPS of $2.05 on revenue of $5.37 billion in the previous quarter.
McDonald’s shares edged 0.07% higher to trade at $180.22 in pre-market trade following the report.

792,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",Subject to contract: German firms set own Brexit terms,"By Caroline Copley
CHEMNITZ, Germany (Reuters) - With Brexit less than two months away, and no divorce deal in sight, some German companies are taking matters into their own hands to limit any damage to their businesses. 
The small and mid-sized firms - albeit a small minority - say they can't wait any longer to see what agreement, if any, will emerge between London and Brussels. They are taking steps to protect themselves should a chaotic British withdrawal lead to traffic tailbacks, heavier customs bureaucracy and rising delivery costs after March 29, the planned break-up date.
Kieselstein International, a maker of metalworking machines, has for example successfully introduced a clause into a contract to deliver goods to British Steel that puts the onus on the UK firm to bear the costs of any extra red tape linked to Brexit.
""We included a clause that says if delivery takes place after March 29 the goods cannot be delivered to the buyer's warehouse but are to be picked up in Chemnitz,"" managing director Jens Kieselstein told Reuters, referring to the town in Saxony where his business is based.
Others are taking measures such as finding new suppliers in continental Europe, should imports from Britain become more costly, stockpiling parts, or rushing to complete British orders before March 29 to avoid any disruption.
Such precautions are exceptions rather than the rule; among small and mid-sized companies - Germany's so-called Mittelstand - 77 percent believe Brexit will not affect them, according to a survey by the BVMW trade association conducted in December. 
""We still have no binding information and have therefore decided to accept new orders and process them normally in the hope that the situation will soon be resolved,"" said Jakob Kania, managing director of Support Q, a consultancy firm for suppliers to the automotive industry.
Mittelstand businesses, some of which are big suppliers to Britain's machinery and automotive sectors, are typically family-owned with up to 500 workers and annual revenues below 50 million euros. Many lack the resources for the detailed contingency planning carried out by corporate heavyweights. 
Their fortunes are nonetheless crucial to Europe's biggest economy, accounting for more than half of Germany's jobs, a third of its corporate turnover, and almost a fifth of the nation's exports - 7 percent of which went to Britain in 2017, worth about 84 billion euros ($96 billion). 
Mario Ohoven, president of the BVMW Mittelstand trade body, urged companies to check their contracts for Brexit risks, get to grips with customs procedures and visa formalities, and to consider switching to British haulage firms.
'ORDERS NEAR STANDSTILL'
British politicians continue to quarrel over the terms of Britain's exit from the EU, with parliament in deadlock. It is possible that Britain will leave without any deal to govern its trading relationship with the bloc - a scenario many businesses fear will bring chaos to the world's fifth-biggest economy.
With no visibility about future customs arrangements, Kieselstein, whose firm employs 50 people and has an annual turnover of 8 million euros, told British Steel he may have to add German sales tax of 19 percent onto the bill after March 29.
Kieselstein isn't the only Mittelstand firm taking precautionary measures.
Zabag Security Engineering, a maker of high-tech security gates and bollards, said it is looking for a new supplier in the EU for the grid mats it currently imports from Britain to avoid any disruptions to its supply chain.
The company, which makes about 10-15 percent of its sales in Britain, predicts difficulties in sending spare parts to Britain if extra customs red tape is introduced, and said this would have a big impact on trade and flexibility. 
""The English market has always been a big part of our export business,"" said a Zabag spokeswoman. ""But the uncertainty of the English over Brexit has increasingly minimized the number of orders placed with us and almost come to a standstill.""
Joerg Daubner, managing director of DHD audio in Leipzig, which builds mixing consoles for radio and TV stations worldwide, said he was preparing to deliver a large order to Britain's BBC before March 29. 
""The transition period will be critical so we want to avoid delivering during this time,"" he told Reuters.
Even for firms taking precautionary measures, the ongoing uncertainty limits how much they can act.
Max Frank, a Bavarian producer of products to reinforce concrete buildings, has started stockpiling parts at its British subsidiary in Stoke-on-Trent to limit any delays from customs disruption. 
""Our plan is to increase the stock of standard goods by roughly 10-20 percent from mid-February,"" said Gerhard Bumes, who runs the subsidiary that employs 65 people. 
""However, we produce a lot of goods made-to-order which we can't stock. We hope not to have any delays in our imports, but unfortunately there is no defined political plan at the moment.""
HOPING FOR THE BEST
Germany's VDMA engineering association warned on Wednesday that a no-deal Brexit was getting closer by the day, after the British parliament instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to renegotiate an exit treaty.
""Unfortunately even after the vote in the British lower house, there is no new hope of avoiding a disorderly Brexit,"" said VDMA head Thilo Brodtmann.
Patrice Kaiser, a trade expert at Merkur Bank, said many companies had overlooked that border checks, blocked ports and major tailbacks would not just be a problem for those who import and export directly to Britain.
""If you import parts from Asia or China you should take a look at your supply routes because most of the imports up to now have been processed in Britain,"" Kaiser warned executives at a Brexit seminar organized by the BVMW in Chemnitz last week.
The eastern state of Saxony is home to many Mittelstand companies, and Kaiser said the region's dependence on the auto sector made firms particularly vulnerable to Brexit. Britain is the single largest export market for German automakers.
BVMW Chief Economist Hans-Juergen Voelz said many Mittelstand companies were simply hoping for the best.
""Many are not letting themselves be influenced by the images they see on TV of the British parliament and believe reason will prevail at the last moment.""

A government-appointed commission has proposed Germany shut down all of its coal power stations by 2038 at the latest, recommending at least 40 billion euros ($45.7 billion) in aid to the regions affected.
The move deals a particular blow to RWE, which operates 13.3 gigawatt (GW) of lignite and hard coal-fired power plants in Germany, significantly more than smaller peers LEAG, EnBW, Uniper, Steag and Vattenfall
""From the municipalities' point of view, the decisions can only be absorbed financially if there is adequate compensation,"" said Ernst Gerlach, head of VkA, which represents RWE's municipal shareholders.
""RWE should take a tough stance in the pending negotiations over power plant shutdowns,"" he said on Wednesday.
Gerlach said the municipalities hold about 18 percent in RWE after some cities and regional authorities sold shares in the group following years of poor performance. Shares are down 78 percent from their all-time high in 2008.
RWE has said that the commission proposals, which foresee 12.7 GW of plant closures by 2022, would cause severe job cuts at the group, which employs about 10,000 staff in the Rhenish coal mining area alone.
""We are very concerned by the looming staff reduction. An RWE worker driving an excavator cannot simply find a new adequate job,"" Gerlach said.
The commission's proposals also include a recommendation to permanently cease mining activities at Hambach Forest, RWE's key source of lignite, the scene of riots and significant media attention in the run up to the coal exit talks.
Bernstein reckons that shutting down Hambach as well as the power plants it supplies will result in a 2.25 billion to 3.8 billion euro hit for RWE.
""Clearing Hambach Forest should not simply be given up,"" Gerlach said, adding RWE should wait for the next ruling after a German court halted activity at the site in October.

Chinese executives are sounding warning bells over the world’s second-largest economy.
At least 20 companies, including China Life Insurance Co. and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., told investors late Tuesday that full-year earnings would fall well short of expectations. Reasons they cited included the country’s economic slowdown, as well as recent changes to accounting rules and the equity market’s $2.3 trillion rout last year, the world’s biggest loss of value. China Life fell as much as 4.3 percent in onshore trading Wednesday.
The firms join a growing chorus from around the globe warning about China’s weaker demand. More gloomy signals are likely before a deadline Thursday, when many Chinese companies must report whether they expect any substantial changes in their financial results. More than 1,800 firms have announced preliminary data, with those in the tech, communications and financial sectors suffering the most.
“Private companies are particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn,” said Lv Changshun, a money manager at Beijing Dajun Zhimeng Investment Management Co. “The deleveraging campaign and the deterioration of their corporate health is normal for any economy that is shifting gears and slowing down.”
Changan, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s main partner in China, said 2018 profit probably tumbled as much as 93 percent. China Life, the country’s biggest life insurer by market share, said net income may have dropped as much as 70 percent. Detailed releases are due by the end of March.
Beijing HualuBaina Film & TV Co., cloud-storage operator Gosun Holding Co. and First Tractor Co. all said they’ll probably post billions of yuan in losses for 2018 after being profitable in 2017. Anhui Shengyun Environment Protection Group Co. and Anhui Ankai Automobile Co. -- which makes buses and auto parts -- said their net losses will be at least twice as large as in 2017.
Guangdong Homa Appliances Co., a maker of refrigerators, dropped by the 10 percent daily limit Wednesday to its lowest price since June 2014 after predicting a loss in 2018. That’s only months after saying it would post a profit. An equity benchmark for Shenzhen, where most of the stocks are listed, closed 1.3 percent lower.
China’s economy slowed for an eighth straight month in January, as weaker global demand and decelerating factory inflation combined to undercut growth, according to a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest-available indicators on business conditions and market sentiment. The data suggests government efforts to stimulate the economy have yet to translate into more business activity so far in the first quarter.
Tougher regulatory scrutiny on accounting calculations has also forced companies to reduce the value of goodwill on their balance sheets, after expensive acquisitions proved less fruitful than expected. The China Securities Regulatory Commission in November required listed firms to assess goodwill impairments at the end of each year, spurring concerns that those costs will dent earnings over a number of years.
Impairment Charges
Instead of posting years of losses, some companies have opted to bite the bullet in one go, allowing them to report better numbers going forward.
“Companies whose shares are already quite battered have nothing to lose by lowering earnings forecasts or taking large impairments for 2018,” said Qi He, a fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management Co. in Shanghai. “Many of these companies are actually ‘taking a bath’ to begin anew in 2019.”
A case in point was Anhui Liuguo Chemical Co., which warned it will probably report a net loss of as much as 620 million yuan ($92 million) due to impairment charges at its subsidiaries. The stock also closed limit down.
More companies on Wednesday said impairment losses have hurt profits, including chemical-maker Sichuan Hongda Co. and brokerage Industrial Securities Co.
Chinese equity investors had nowhere to hide last year in a market under pressure from a slowing economy, record defaults and the country’s souring relationship with the U.S. Throw in a national vaccine scandal, a decline in consumer spending, the Trump administration’s crackdown on Chinese tech and Beijing’s tightening grip on education, gaming and drugs, virtually no sector was spared in one of the broadest sell-offs since the global financial crisis.
“While investors had expected poor earnings given the economic slowdown, the scope and magnitude of profit declines and losses were bigger than expected,” said Ken Chen, a Shanghai-based analyst with KGI Securities Co. “A lot of companies’ guidance and estimates were too aggressive in 2016-2017, making their earnings’ slide last year all the more drastic.”

813,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",No ECB? No sweat for euro zone bond markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - For euro zone debt markets, life after the end of the European Central Bank's asset-buying buffer may not be that bad after all -- bonds from the bloc's three biggest markets have just enjoyed their best January in three years.
This was the first month without the protective shield of new bond-buying by the ECB, which ended its huge stimulus program last month after more than three years, yet euro zone governments' borrowing costs are near multi-month lows.
And 10-year yields in Germany, France and Italy are set for their first January fall since 2016, confounding predictions of a bond selloff as soon as the biggest debt buyer stepped away.
French yields, down 10 basis points in January, are set for their biggest monthly drop in eight months, while Spanish yields have slid 16 bps -- on track for their best month since March. 
(Graphic - January: A stellar month for euro zone bond markets - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TjiV9p)
In many ways, the solid start to 2019 for bond markets is not surprising, given economic growth has proved weaker than anticipated just a few months ago. 
Together with risks from Brexit and U.S.-China trade tensions, it has caused talk about the timing of the ECB's first rate rise since 2011 to be replaced by what stimulus measures might be needed to support a flagging economy.
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), inflows into fixed income funds more broadly recorded their largest inflow since August 2017 in the week ending Jan 23. Investors pumped $5.2 billion into bond funds that week, while yanking a net $500 million from equities.
BACK TO SQUARE ONE?
""The global growth cycle has peaked, inflation is dormant and we may find that central banks have to go back to stimulus,"" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital.
""In bond markets generally, there is a storyline that perhaps the transition from QE (quantitative easing) to QT (quantitative tightening) was going to be the big story this year. Maybe it turns out this transition is a 24-hour wonder and we're back to square one again quickly.""
The ECB still supports markets by reinvesting proceeds of maturing bonds it holds, but it has stopped buying new assets. But the weaker economy has fueled speculation it could launch a new round of cheap multi-year loans to banks, a scheme that would especially benefit weaker southern European countries.
The fall in yields in the first full month of the ECB's absence is all the more striking because -- as is traditional as the year starts -- January has been heavy with new debt supply from European governments, which tends to raise borrowing costs.
(Graphic: First January falls in 3 years for German Bund yields - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HyHHku)
Proof that the absence of the ECB safety net has not put investors off lower-rated debt markets came as new long-dated bond sales from Italy and Spain, conducted via syndicates of banks, met with record demand.
FOREIGN FAVOR
""Now that the ECB is out (of QE), the question is do those other investors, including foreign investors who sold their bonds to the ECB, step back in?"" said Said Haidar, chief investment officer at New York-based hedge fund Haidar Capital. 
""In this environment, why not? People are worried about what happened in stock markets last year and don't want to take a plunge there, so you have people going back into government securities,"" said Haidar, who was a buyer in Italy's recent 15-year syndicated bond deal.
A truce between Italy and the EU at the end of last year over Italy's spending plans has lowered political risks.
There is another factor at play -- the appeal of euro-denominated bonds to non-European investors when currency hedging costs are taken into consideration.
The return that investors outside Europe get from hedging their bond purchases via foreign exchange derivatives known as cross-currency basis swaps remains juicy.
In particular, big Japanese investors such as pension funds were expected to favor bond markets in France and Spain, given the pickup they give over euro zone benchmark issuer Germany. 
Asian buyers accounted for almost 12 percent of Spain's 10-year syndicated bond deal, U.S. and Canadian investors made up 6.5 percent. A Spanish bond of the same size and maturity sold by syndication a year ago, saw just a 0.7 percent take up from Asia and almost 6 percent from the United States and Canada.

""For U.S. (investors) it's an over 3 percent benefit to buy European assets. It's one of the big stories in fixed income,"" said Michael Krautzberger, head of the fundamental pan-European fixed income team at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

MILAN (Reuters) - World stocks and the dollar steadied on Wednesday ahead of policy guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) results providing relief while market confidence that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided took a hit.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent higher by 1140 GMT following gains in Asia overnight and a muted start to trading in Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index was also up by 0.1 percent.
Investors pondered the possibility of a ""no-deal"" British departure from the European Union after UK lawmakers instructed Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday to reopen the treaty she had negotiated with Brussels to replace a divisive Irish border arrangement. 
""While a no deal scenario is still unlikely, these developments increase the risk of accidentally leaving the EU without a deal and plans may intensify from both sides to manage that outcome,"" said Bethany Payne, Global Bonds Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upped its ""no-deal"" Brexit probability to 15 percent from 10 percent, and cut the chance of Brexit not happening at all to 35 percent from 40 percent.
Worries over a disorderly exit of Britain from the club it joined in 1973 hammered the pound overnight and that in turn helped lift the internationally exposed UK top share index by 1.3 percent in late morning deals.
Sterling recovered to be up 0.25 percent at $1.3101, suggesting investors remained hopeful that a chaotic Brexit could still be avoided even though Brussels has indicated that the divorce deal was not up for renegotiation. 
Talks between the sides continued. European Council President Donald Tusk and British Prime Minister Theresa May will have a phone call about Brexit later on Wednesday, an EU source said.
Earlier, Apple results provided some reassurance as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business.
Investors were relieved that there was no more bad news after the company shocked financial markets at the start of this month with a revenue warning that triggered fears that U.S.-China trade tensions were taking a toll on the tech sector.
""Apple earnings delivered enough for investors to come back on board,"" said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson.
""Although Apple still faces big questions like pricing structure, upgrade cycles, FX headwinds and weaker Chinese demand, we did get a positive answer to the key question on whether services margins can help rerate the stock higher.""
U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures added 0.25 percent, while European tech shares were among the best performers in European trading. Luxury stocks, heavily exposed to the Chinese markets, also rose.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, lifting the mood before another round of official talks on Wednesday in Washington.
The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December. 
""I expect that the Washington summit will help pave the way for an extension of the trade truce. This is also what markets expect and a failure of the talks is not priced in at all,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital.
FED FOCUS 
Expectations from Wednesday's Federal Reserve rates review are that policymakers will reinforce their recent dovish stance, given signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
""We believe the Fed is likely to show the flexibility markets are seeking at its upcoming meeting, as it balances still solid domestic economic growth against slower global growth and less significant, but persistent, domestic risks,"" said John Lynch, Chief Investment Strategist at LPL Financial.
U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in virtually no change in official rates this year.
Investors are looking for hints from Chairman Jerome Powell on whether he has any inclination to slow the drawdown of the Fed's balance sheet by up to $50 billion a month.
The dollar index - a gauge of its value versus six major peers - was flat at 95.816.
The Australian dollar surged 0.6 percent as inflation topped forecasts, while the Chinese yuan reached a six-month high in the offshore market before the trade talks.
In commodities, gold rose to fresh 8-1/2-month highs, supported by uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations and expectations the Fed will keep policy on hold. It was up 0.09 percent of $1,313.26 per ounce. 
Oil prices inched up, supported by concerns about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry but pegged back by a darkening outlook for the global economy.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.69 percent at $53.71 per barrel, while Brent crude oil futures added 0.70 percent at $61.75 per barrel.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 06:24AM ET</span>",Investors brace for China tech funding 'down rounds',"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for a series of “down rounds” in China’s much-hyped tech sector as weak stock markets worldwide and the country's economic slowdown weigh on once-buoyant private markets.
Falling valuations risk denting investor enthusiasm for future funding rounds - potentially limiting the amounts startups are able to raise. One senior tech-focused dealmaker estimated that targeted valuations have fallen between 20 and 40 percent in China's tech space over the last three months alone.
This week Maoyan Entertainment, China’s top movie ticketing app, became the latest example of the trend as the Hong Kong initial public offering of the group backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd valued the company at $2.16 billion - more than a quarter below the valuation reached in its last 2017 funding round.
Valuations of some sizeable unicorns - startups with at least a billion-dollar valuation - have also been dropping in the more opaque market of private secondary trading, where investors trade their holdings in unlisted companies.
Stakes in China's ride-hailing champion Didi Chuxing have traded at prices implying a valuation of $40-44 billion, according to Moncef Heddad, managing partner and head of Asia at securities brokerage firm Rainmaker Asia Holdings.
Didi's valuation exceeded $65 billion after its 2018 funding round, according to two sources familiar with the company. The privately held firm had been valued at $56 billion in a 2017 fundraising. Didi declined to comment.
""Most people pay for forward-looking valuations assuming that growth will only go in one direction, but when the economy is having a downturn, these forward-looking valuations are not going to sustain and need to adjust and correct too,"" said Hong Kong-based Heddad.
Companies expected to seek funding in public or private markets this year include Beijing Bytedance Technology Co, owner of leading news aggregator Jinri Toutiao; artificial intelligence firms Megvii and SenseTime; and coffee startup Luckin, sources have told Reuters.
Bytedance, SenseTime and Luckin declined to comment. Megvii didn't respond to a request for comment.
Other companies have had to lower their target valuations in funding rounds, including Ping An-backed financial technology company Lufax, which closed its latest funding effort in December at a valuation of $38 billion versus a target of $40 billion.
IPO MOMENT OF TRUTH
Tech investors in China have for the last few years enjoyed soaring valuations and a far-faster pace of unicorn creation compared with other markets, including the United States
But Hong Kong's IPO markets in 2018 began to dampen the dizzying optimism as a string of hotly anticipated floats, including smartphone maker Xiaomi, priced towards the bottom end of their indicated ranges - and then fell further on trading.
Xiaomi's July IPO valued the firm at about $54 billion, or just over half the $100 billion that industry insiders had touted early in the year. Its current market cap, at around $33 billion, is also below the $46 billion valuation it reached in its last pre-IPO fundraising in 2014.
""I think it's healthy,"" said Joe Tsai, co-founder of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group when asked about the effect of such down rounds at a Reuters BreakingViews event in Hong Kong last week. 
""The public markets have already reflected the down round... and I expect to see that happen in the next 6-9 months in the private markets.""
""I think the entrepreneurs had it too easy being able to raise gigantic billion dollar levels of capital at multi billion dollars of valuation. It's just distorted,"" he said.
Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial was one beneficiary of the funding boom. Last year it raised $14 billion in the world's largest single fundraising by a private company - a deal that also made the payments operator the world's largest unicorn with a valuation of $150 billion.
But even IPOs backed by Alibaba have since felt the chill: Babytree Group, a parenting website operator backed by the e-commerce giant, was valued at $1.5 billion in its $217 million November IPO in Hong Kong - down from a $2 billion valuation when Alibaba invested last May.
LESSER OF TWO EVILS
Investors concerned by the outlook have increasingly begun to demand downround protection clauses in fundraising agreements, industry sources said.
These can take different forms, but typical conditions involve a company agreeing to buy back shares, or otherwise compensate investors, if it fails to go public within a certain period or above a specified valuation.
Beijing Bytedance is one example, according to sources. The company, which also owns popular short video streaming app TikTok, raised $3 billion at a $78 billion valuation late last year.
But two sources say that at least some investment agreements for the deal included a pledge it would reach a value of at least $90 billion when it launches an IPO.
Industry participants have cautioned however that the deals may not be enforced when it comes down to it since for many late-stage investors, a down round via IPO is often a better option, despite the price, than being trapped in a still-private company.

""A down-rounded IPO isn’t good news but is more acceptable for investors because that at least offers an exit and creates market liquidity,"" said a senior private equity investor who focuses on tech investments. ""Of the two evils, we choose the lesser.""

823,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 06:24AM ET</span>",SocGen Plans Investment Bank Job Cuts After Trading Slump,"(Bloomberg) --  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA is making a last-ditch effort to boost its performance after a trading slump threatened Chief Executive Officer Frederic Oudea’s targets.
The French bank -- recovering from regulatory probes that cost it billions of euros and a management reshuffle -- plans to cut jobs in less profitable investment banking businesses to save at least 100 million euros ($114 million) annually, people with knowledge of the matter said. The extent of the cuts may be made public as soon as next week, they said.
The stakes are high for Oudea as he tries to meet next year’s goals and restore confidence after a profit warning and a history of disappointing investors. The CEO is among the longest-serving leaders in European banking, having been at the helm for about a decade, and took his third set of financial targets to investors in 2017 after missing earlier multi-year goals.
A spokesman at SocGen declined to comment.
SocGen shares fell 0.4 percent as of 12:08 p.m. in Paris trading. The stock has declined about 40 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 27 percent drop for Europe’s STOXX 600 banking index.
SocGen is seeking to bolster profitability after warning last month that revenue at its key global-markets and investor-services business slumped about 20 percent in the final three months of the year because of reduced client activity. France’s third-largest bank said it has been hurt by the “challenging markets environment in global capital markets” that will see revenue for the full year in the unit also fall about 10 percent from 2017.
“It makes sense for SocGen to take action on costs,” RBC Capital Markets analysts including Anke Reingen wrote in a note Wednesday, estimating that a 400 million-euro cost reduction would help improve SocGen’s 2020 earnings by about 6 percent.
The French bank will likely seek to preserve its traditional trading strengths in equity derivatives and structured products, with potential reductions coming in less profitable parts of its fixed-income activities, the people said. Decisions on the magnitude and scope of the cuts may come when the bank announces annual results on Feb. 7, the people said.
SocGen’s targets, presented in late 2017, are predicated on progressive dividend growth, improved profitability, revenue growth and 1.1 billion euros in annual cost savings by next year, including hundreds of branch closures and thousands of job cuts at the French retail networks. The new cost-cutting measures would come on top of existing efforts.
SocGen’s said it will pay a stable dividend of 2.20 euros for 2018 -- the floor it had promised in its strategic plan -- and will offer a stock alternative. The bank on Jan. 17 said its pro-forma key capital level for the fourth quarter was in line with its 2020 goal.
Oudea reorganized his top management and hired senior traders from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). last year to help reboot the bank’s global-markets business after the shock departure of investment-banking boss Didier Valet. SocGen’s board last year took the step of proposing a new four-year term for the CEO, and shareholders will vote on that at their annual meeting in May.
For Deputy CEO Severin Cabannes, in charge of investment-banking businesses, the priority is now to readjust a business plan that was crafted under Valet after the economic and market context worsened, one of the people said.
Here are some of the bank’s key targets to 2020:

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 06:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. regulator drops fine against Citi over fair-lending claims - sources,"By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator has decided not to fine  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) for discriminating against minority mortgage borrowers, dropping the public rebuke that some officials had sought, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The decision is sure to be watched by consumer advocates who have questioned whether the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will enforce fair lending rules under the leadership of Joseph Otting, an appointee of President Donald Trump and former banker who has pledged to be friendlier to the industry.
Reuters reported in October that the OCC was mulling sanctions against Citi for failing to give minority customers mortgage discounts that were available to many other borrowers.
Instead of a fine, the OCC issued a warning after Citi assured the regulator it had repaid borrowers and fixed faulty lending policies, the people said this week.
A spokesman for the OCC declined to comment, and a Citi spokesman declined to comment for this story.
In October, Citi told Reuters it believed it had not engaged in discrimination but also said it had reimbursed affected customers and that the third-largest U.S. lender had strengthened internal controls.
The warning from the OCC, known as a ""matter requiring attention"", does not entail the monetary penalties or reputational hit that makes public sanctions more effective at discouraging misconduct, said enforcement experts. 
""There is no deterrence for banks when abuses are kept secret,"" said Eric Halperin, CEO of non-profit Civil Rights Corps and a former Department of Justice official who prosecuted discrimination cases under former President Barack Obama. 
""Regulators should bring bad behavior to light.""
Some OCC staff have argued since early 2017 that the faulty mortgage program violated federal law requiring equal treatment for all races, Reuters has reported.
But officials seeking a tough line against Citibank were disappointed. This summer, the Justice Department decided it would not penalize the bank, Reuters reported in October. In recent weeks, the OCC also declined to publicly sanction Citi, sources said.
Citi's problem sprang from a ""relationship pricing"" program, common throughout the industry, that gives customers holding large deposits with the bank a preferential mortgage rate.
In 2014, Citi identified ""errors"" implementing the program, the bank said in October. Sources familiar with the issue said some minority borrowers who qualified for the mortgage rate discount had not received it.
Citi flagged the issue to the OCC, saying the discrepancies were inadvertent and it had taken steps to resolve them. Following a review, OCC staff agreed in early 2017 that the loans were racially skewed and recommended public sanctions, according to the sources.
In recent weeks, a panel of senior OCC officials voted to issue the written warning, the sources said. Although Otting does not sit on that panel, he has the final say on enforcement.
In October, Citi said less than 4 percent of its mortgages were affected by the relationship pricing problem and harmed customers were typically refunded $850. 

The bank declined to say exactly how many customers were harmed, but a Reuters estimate based on mortgage lending data provided by Inside Mortgage Finance suggests thousands of qualified borrowers may have missed out on the discounts.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Vale's Brazil disaster to prompt buyers to take more Australian iron ore,"MELBOURNE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Vale SA's catastrophic dam failure in Brazil may knock it off its perch as the biggest iron ore exporter as the resulting rally in high-grade ore prices steers buyers towards rivals offering cheaper ore, industry sources said on Wednesday. 
The world's largest iron ore miner is facing public ire and tougher regulation after the collapse of its tailings dam in the Brazilian region of Brumadinho killed at least 84 in one of the country's worst ever industrial disasters. Hundreds are still missing and presumed dead. 
Vale on Tuesday said it would take up to 10 percent of its output offline as it decommissions a total of 19 dams over three years, a move that would cut up to 40 million tonnes of iron ore production a year. 
That could dethrone Vale as the No.1 supplier of sea-borne iron ore, and benefit Australian rivals such as  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), BHP Group and Fortescue Metals Group, said Vivek Dhar of Commonwealth Bank. 
""Rio is about 23 to 24 percent of the sea-borne market, and Vale is 24 percent. If we see that (Vale's shipments) come down further I think Rio could become the biggest player,"" Dhar said. 
Weakened margins at steel mills in China have also worked against the high-grade ore supplier, with Chinese operators slashing input costs by taking lower-quality, cheaper ores in recent months. 
(Graphic: China crude steel production vs steel margins - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HRJEsH)
That trend has benefited lower-grade producer Fortescue since late 2018, and going forward may also boost sales for other Australian miners. 
""What will likely happen, is that if we see Vale high grade material go (from the market), you'll see an increased demand for mid-grades. That will favor more of BHP's and Rio's material,"" Dhar said. 
(Graphic - Making the grade: High & low grade iron ore producers part ways as China's mills cut costs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TkqDA5)
POST-HOLIDAY MARKET
Steelmakers and traders in China were also preparing for a drop in iron ore supplies from Vale in the post-Chinese New Year restocking period. One customer with a long-term contract in China's top steel-making province Hebei, though, said he had not been notified by the Brazilian miner of any change to supply. 
""Forty million tonnes of output reduction is quite a big amount ... We expect Vale will prioritize supply to steel mills who signed long-term contracts with them, which means the amount Vale will put into the spot market will be less,"" said a Qingdao-based iron ore trader. 
""Prices have soared ... but we don't know how long for. If steel mills do not accept such high prices, they would turn to cheaper alternatives from Australia,"" he said. 
Chinese iron ore futures rose to their highest level in nearly 17 months on Wednesday. 
Vale has said the impact will be offset by increased production elsewhere, but analysts deem any speedy ramp up unlikely. 
""When your social license to operate is under threat, to start new operations or ramp up production will come under scrutiny,"" said Matthew Keane, an analyst at broker Argonaut in Perth. 

Shares in Vale have fallen 23 percent since Friday, while shares in Rio have gained 8.4 percent, BHP 4.7 percent and Fortescue 12.9 percent.

Investors have been speculation that index providers such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could exclude PDVSA's debt from their key benchmarks after the United States imposed sweeping sanctions on the firm on Monday.
""As a result, benchmarked investors would become overweight Venezuela risk,"" Jane Brauer, sovereign debt fixed income strategist at BAML wrote in a note to clients late on Tuesday. 
Trading in Venezuelan debt ground to a halt on secondary markets on Tuesday, further adding to expectations that the debt could be excluded. Liquidity - the ease of trading - is a key requirement for index membership.
""We believe that if benchmarked investors cannot exit their PDVSA positions, that they will reduce positions in Republic bonds instead, putting downward pressure on Republic bond prices,"" she said, adding that a risk on additional sanctions in future on the sovereign bonds themselves added to the pressure.
PDVSA has a weight of 0.53 while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66 as of earlier this week in JPMorgan's EMBI Global Diversified index, according to the index provider.

PDVSA's 2024 issue - previously one of the most heavily traded issues - was indicated at 0.25 cents weaker at 25.25 cents in the dollar on Wednesday. The 2025 sovereign bond showed as being 0.445 cents higher at 31.82 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

The California-based chipmaker will receive an Israeli government grant of 9 percent of its planned 40 billion shekel investment to expand its manufacturing operations in the country.
As a condition, the economy ministry said, Intel agreed to spend 15 billion shekels in ""reciprocal procurement"" from Israeli companies.
Economy Minister Eli Cohen said an agreement of this magnitude ""will lead to the growth of many companies in the economy, to an increase in their activities and to success in international markets as well"".
Intel is already one of the biggest employers and exporters in Israel, where many of its new technologies are developed.
The expansion of its Kiryat Gat manufacturing site will add 1,000 new employees to Intel's workforce of almost 13,000 in Israel, government officials said.
Last month the chip giant said it began plans for site expansion projects in Ireland, Israel and at its U.S. plant in Oregon as it looks to diversify its products for a broader set of customers, such as auto safety and wireless connections for mobile phones.

The morning’s mood was set by two quarterly reports – from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and from French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH)- that came after the European close on Tuesday and reassured traders that demand from China is still holding up nicely.
LVMH said revenue hit a record high in 2018, finishing the year with a 9% year-on-year rise in the fourth quarter. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told the Wall Street Journal that spending by Chinese customers either in China or on trips abroad grew by double digits for most of its major brands in the quarter, and that there had been no visible slowdown at the end of the year. LVMH shares were up 6.9% by 04.55 AM ET (09.55 GMT), and the results also pulled rivals Hermes (PA:HRMS) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) up to the top of the French CAC 40 index. The U.K.'s  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) also rose in sympathy.
U.K. stocks posted mixed reactions to the votes in parliament last night that reaffirmed a ‘no-deal’ Brexit as the default option for March 29 and rejected the chance to call for an extension of a deadline that’s now less than two months away.
The British pound lost nearly 1% against the dollar and euro on the votes but had recovered much of those losses by mid-morning. At 04:55 AM ET, the GBPUSD was at $1.3117, up over half a cent from its overnight lows.

Speaking to the Nikkei newspaper in his first media interview since his arrest on Nov. 19, Ghosn said he had discussed plans to integrate the companies with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa in September.
But Nissan executives employed ""plot and treason"" to uproot those plans, Ghosn said.
Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese corporation.
He remains in detention following his arrest and indictment on charges related to breach of trust and understating his salary.
His arrest has clouded the outlook for closer ties between Nissan and Renault, along with Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the third member of the automaking alliance
Since his arrest, Saikawa has said it was not the time to discuss revising the partners' complex capital ties. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors have dismissed him as chairman, while he has resigned from the helm at Renault.
Ghosn denied accusations of improper payments to a company run by a Saudi businessman, saying the payment had been approved by a Nissan executive. 
Ghosn also called accusations by both Nissan and Mitsubishi that he received nearly 8 million euros in improper payment through a Dutch-based joint venture of the two automakers ""a distortion of reality"", and argued his luxury residences in Rio de Janeiro and Beirut were approved by Nissan's legal department.
Nissan has said it was not aware that it had paid for many of Ghosn's properties. On Wednesday, a spokesman said that the company was unable to comment on Ghosn's legal defense.
Ghosn, in the 20-minute interview, denied that his tenure at Nissan had been a ""dictatorship"".
""People translated strong leadership to dictator, to distort reality"" for the ""purpose of getting rid of me,"" he said.
Ghosn added that his health was fine, and that he wouldn't flee if freed on bail.

Meanwhile, NHK reported that Saikawa plans to hold his first face-to-face discussion with new Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard on the sidelines of an alliance meeting in the Netherlands on Thursday.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",Siemens makes last ditch appeal for EU to approve rail merger,"By John Revill
MUNICH (Reuters) - Siemens has made a last gasp appeal to European antitrust authorities not to be ""backward-looking technocrats"" and approve its planned rail merger with France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO).
Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said on Wednesday that Europe needed to stand together to compete with the United States, China and India. He said EU competition rules from the 1990s were from a different era that were now outdated. 
He said a merger of Siemens's rail business with Alstom's would be positive for the two companies and customers, but Kaeser also appeared to be resigned to the deal being rejected when the EU gives its decision next month.
""It is naive to think individual European states can compete with China and America and at some point India, this is impossible,"" Kaeser told journalists at news conference after Siemens's reported its first quarter results.
""Now it is up to the antitrust authorities to make a decision, and it will be interesting to see if the future of mobility in Europe will be determined by backward-looking technocrats or future-oriented Europeans,"" he said.
The European Commission could give its ruling on the tie-up as early as next week. The plan could fail despite concessions from Siemens and Alstom to try to address antitrust concerns.
The merger aims to create the world's second largest rail company with combined revenues of around 15 billion euros ($17 billion), still half the size of China’s state-owned CRRC Corp Ltd but twice that of Canada's Bombardier.
However, the plan has met opposition since it was announced in September 2017.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has described Siemens and Alstom as world champions which can compete without a merger. People familiar with the matter have told Reuters regulators were minded to reject it.
Kaeser said on Wednesday Siemens would not pursue the merger at all costs, and would accept the EU's decision. Siemens had options to develop its own rail business, he said, without elaborating. 
""We are not bitter, we are not angry at all. We have different options. If it works it will be good for Europe, Siemens, Alstom, and for customers,"" Kaeser said. ""If not, we will continue to lead in mobility as we have before.""
The German firm's main customers include Deutsche Bahn and Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. In the first quarter, Siemens signed a 1.54 billion euro deal to supply London Underground with 94 new trains.
During its first quarter Siemens reported weaker-than-expected industrial profit, as problems persisted at its power and gas business which has hit by collapsing demand for large turbines.
Siemens reported a 6 percent fall in adjusted operating profit for its industrial business during the three months ended Dec. 31 to 2.07 billion euros ($2.37 billion), missing the forecast for 2.15 billion euros in a Reuters poll.
The company's stock was down 1.2 percent in early trading.
Profit halved at its Power and Gas business, although the downturn was partly balanced by an improvement in profit at Digital Factory, the company's automation unit.
During its fiscal first quarter, Siemens posted a 1 percent rise in group revenue to 20.12 billion euros, falling short of forecasts for 20.32 billion euros. Orders rose 12 percent to 25.17 billion euros, beating expectations.
The company maintained its guidance, expecting moderate revenue growth in 2019 when currency swings and acquisitions were removed. It said it also expected a profit margin of 11 to 12 percent from its industrial business.
It said it still expected basic earnings per share (EPS) from net income in the range of 6.30 to 7.00 euros, excluding severance charges.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 03:54AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Juul plans India e-cigarette entry with new hires, subsidiary","By Aditya Kalra and Chris Kirkham
NEW DELHI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S.-based electronic cigarette company Juul Labs Inc is hoping to launch its products in India by late 2019, a person familiar with the strategy told Reuters, marking one of its boldest bets to expand away from its home turf.
After recruiting Uber India executive Rachit Ranjan as a senior public policy strategist, Juul this month hired India-based Mastercard (NYSE:MA) executive Rohan Mishra as head of government relations.
It plans to hire at least three more executives, including an India general manager, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) job postings showed. It also plans ""a new India subsidiary"", according to one posting.
""It (the plan) is currently at an exploratory stage, but the company needs people on the ground in India,"" the source said.
Juul's sleek vaping devices, which resemble a USB flash drive and offer flavors such as mango and creme, are a sensation in the United States but have drawn tighter regulatory scrutiny due to surging use among teenagers.
Juul devices, like most electronic cigarettes, vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush. 
Advocates for the devices say that they are far less of a health threat because users don't inhale the dangerous matter taken into the lungs through cigarette smoking.
Opponents argue the devices still involve addictive chemicals and can be a gateway to cigarette smoking, especially for the young.
The push to launch in India is part of the company's broader Asia strategy. India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China in the world, making it a lucrative market for firms such as Juul and Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM).
However, India's regulatory environment for tobacco and electronic cigarettes is highly restrictive. The health ministry last year advised states to stop the sale or import of e-cigarettes, saying they pose a ""great health risk"". Eight of India's 29 states currently ban e-cigarettes.
Juul is studying federal and state regulations that could block its plans, the source said, adding that it would engage with the medical community to build acceptance for the devices.
Juul said in a statement India was among the Asian markets under evaluation, but there were no ""definitive plans"".
""As we explore potential markets, we are engaging with health regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders,"" the company said. 
MEDICAL JOURNAL
As part of its evaluation, Juul said it would consult with the Indian Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP), a healthcare communications company. 
One of the journal's editors is a former president of the Indian Medical Association, K.K. Aggarwal, who has publicly voiced his support for e-cigarettes.
The IJCP will advise Juul on the regulatory landscape and offer advice on how it should approach the market, a second person familiar with the plans said.
Juul would face competition from leading players in India's $10 billion cigarette market - ITC and Godfrey Phillips - which sell such electronic devices as well.
India's vapour-products market was valued at only $15.6 million in 2017, according to Euromonitor International, but it is expected to grow by nearly 60 percent a year up to 2022.
Juul could be ""potentially very attractive"" to the growing number of young and wealthy smokers in India, said Shane MacGuill, Head of Tobacco Research at Euromonitor International.
 Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc last month paid $12.8 billion to take a 35 percent stake in Juul, a move expected to boost the company's international growth prospects.
Philip Morris is also considering a launch of its heat-not-burn tobacco device iQOS in India, which it says is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, Reuters reported last year. 
Many tobacco-control activists are opposed to e-cigarettes, saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people to consume tobacco. More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses.

""If they (Juul) try to launch in India, they need to be nipped in the bud before they become a major health hazard,"" said Sanjay Seth, head of tobacco-control at Indian non-profit Sambandh Health Foundation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A crash by a Tokyo biopharmaceutical firm's shares on Wednesday ended a month-long rally in Japan's start-up market that was fueled by retail investors feeling small-cap stocks could rise despite global economic risks.
Through Tuesday, the Mothers market had far outperformed the broader market this month - up 18 percent compared with the Nikkei's 3 percent - in heavy volumes as retail buyers and day traders bought biopharmaceutical companies such as SanBio Co, PeptiDream Inc, Sosei Group Corp, NanoCareer Inc and AnGes Inc.
But on Wednesday, the market tumbled 8.1 percent, its biggest drop in a year.
The spark was SanBio, seen as a market leader. Its shares dived 26 percent after investors were disappointed with news that it and Dainippon Sumitomo Phama Co saw their joint drug's clinical trial in the United States did not succeed.
The news caused Mothers index futures to trigger a circuit breaker and halt trade temporarily.
""When retail investors had to sell the stock on margin calls which sent the stock plunging, it gave a domino effect throughout the Mothers market and dragged down other biopharma shares,"" said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.
Shares of DaiNippon plunged 19 percent.
""Investing in biopharmaceutical company is like investing in a dream,"" Hiroki said, adding that compared to other themes such as 5G and the internet of things, biopharma investment can generate ""explosive"" returns if clinical trials are successful.
Tomoichiro Kubota, a market analyst at Matsui Securities, said short-term themes, like with biopharma companies, ""draw buying opportunities for day-traders who wanted to make a quick buck using volatility"".
He said clinical trials are major catalysts for biotech and pharmaceutical companies and positive study can boost their share prices.
""But on the other hand, chances are small that clinical trials proceed to the next phase. When it fails, there is a turnaround in their stock price and can fall sharply, which is seen in the SanBio case,"" Kubota said.
Hiroki of Monex Securities said that while the index's ""biopharma rally"" seems to be over for now, it will likely resume when the ""SanBio shock"" is priced into the market.
The theme ""will make a comeback, for sure,"" he said. ""It's similar to investing in private equity deals or venture capital.""

 Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Motors Corp together sold 10.76 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2018, according to Reuters' calculations after new data released on Wednesday. The group doesn't sell heavy trucks.
Nissan said on Wednesday it sold 5.65 million vehicles last year, down 2.8 percent on the year. Mitsubishi reported an 18 percent rise in sales to 1.22 million units while Renault sold 3.88 million units, up 3.2 percent on the year.
Volkswagen's deliveries rose 0.9 percent to a record 10.83 million last year, including its MAN and Scania heavy trucks, the German company said earlier this month. Excluding heavy trucks, it sold 10.6 million units. 
Toyota Motor Corp retained its third spot, announcing on Wednesday that it had sold 10.59 million vehicles last year including its Toyota and Lexus brands, along with minicars made by subsidiary Daihatsu and light and heavy trucks produced by its truck division Hino Motors Ltd.
Excluding Hino trucks, Toyota sold 10.39 million units last year. The automaker has said it expects to sell a total of 10.76 million vehicles in 2019. 
Many automakers are trying to boost sales volumes to achieve economies of scale and reduce costs amid soaring investments needed to develop next-generation technologies, including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.
This has been a focus of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors group, which is looking to share more vehicle parts and consolidate production platforms to trim R&D and manufacturing costs, while raising profitability. 

The alliance, which brought Mitsubishi Motors into its fold in 2016, is currently in crisis with its former Chairman Carlos Ghosn arrested and indicted on charges of misconduct. Nissan has also been indicted, and Renault appointed new top management last week.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>","Undeterred by Sanofi's stumble, Takeda takes similar path with dengue shot","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new vaccine for the dengue virus is taking a potentially risky road to prevent the mosquito-borne disease that infects nearly 400 million people each year.
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd plans to seek approval for the experimental vaccine first in countries where the virus is endemic, rather than starting with the United States or Europe, whose rigorous reviews are often used as a benchmark worldwide, company executives told Reuters.
The strategy mirrors one used by Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA, which licensed the world's first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, in endemic markets in 2015 before attempting to get approval from Western regulators, and forecast up to $1 billion in annual sales. 
But the drugmaker failed to hit that target. In late 2017, Sanofi disclosed that Dengvaxia could increase the risk of severe dengue in children who had never been exposed to the virus, triggering a government investigation in the Philippines where 800,000 school-age children had already been vaccinated. 
Fallout from Sanofi's vaccine has raised the bar for demonstrating the safety of future dengue vaccines.
Takeda officials are banking on a different result, hopeful that their approach will help avoid the setbacks that Sanofi experienced. 
On Tuesday, Takeda said its vaccine was effective at preventing all four types of dengue, meeting the main goal of its late-stage clinical trial. The company said no significant safety concerns have emerged, raising hopes it may be the next viable vaccine for the tropical virus that kills up to 25,000 people each year.
Takeda will first seek approval in each of the eight countries where its clinical trial took place: Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka.
""We're still expecting to go first to dengue-endemic countries with a dossier because we think this is where the vaccine's most important use is,"" Derek Wallace, who runs Takeda's global dengue vaccine program, told Reuters.
VACCINE FUTURE
The success of TAK-003 is crucial to Takeda's vaccine ambitions as the Japan-based drugmaker integrates its $59 billion purchase of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP). 
""The global business was predicated on global products and a global pipeline,"" Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda's vaccines business, said in a telephone interview.
Under pressure to cut costs after the Shire deal, Takeda needs a strong performance from both its dengue and norovirus experimental vaccines to prove the viability of the global vaccines business. 
""Once those two programs declare themselves, we’ll then map out what our future looks like,"" Takeda research chief Andy Plump said in an interview last month. Venkayya said he is encouraged by the results so far.
Dengue experts have questioned whether Takeda's vaccine may pose similar risks to Dengvaxia, and the results released on Tuesday were not detailed enough to provide answers.
Takeda executives said they had taken steps to ensure their vaccine did not run into the same issues.
Takeda's TAK-003 is based on a dengue 2 virus, with genes from the remaining three dengue viruses added in. Dengvaxia is based on a yellow fever virus with dengue genes added in. Takeda hopes the all-dengue design will trigger a more robust immune response.
Unlike Sanofi, Takeda researchers took blood samples from all 20,000 trial participants before they received the vaccine. That should allow them to see differences in the vaccine's performance in people who had a previous dengue infection versus those who had not, according to dengue experts. 
Takeda delayed the release of its trial results for several weeks to characterize the immune responses of all participants. The company expects some of that data will soon be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
SANOFI'S REGRET
Earlier this month, Sanofi vaccines chief David Loew told FiercePharma that the company regretted launching Dengvaxia in emerging markets before it was reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency. It was the first time Sanofi had taken such an approach with a vaccine, he said.
""Other regulatory authorities often look to the FDA and EMA for their own guidelines,"" Loew told Reuters via email. 
To share its data with endemic countries and answer questions on Dengvaxia, Sanofi took part in a three-day meeting hosted by the World Health Organization and the Dengue Vaccine Initiative in July 2015. Regulators from seven countries where dengue poses the biggest threat, including the Philippines, were there.
Dengvaxia has since won European approval for people living in endemic areas who have a documented prior infection. The vaccine is also under FDA review.
Dr. Joachim Hombach, senior health adviser in WHO's vaccine department, said that governments in dengue-endemic countries in Latin America and Asia are now ""highly sensitized"" to the potential risks in the wake of Dengvaxia.
""We will be looking at this very carefully,"" Hombach said of Takeda's data.
Takeda is undeterred. 
The company plans to file in the U.S. and Europe within a year of filing in dengue-endemic countries, Venkayya said. Takeda and dengue experts are already planning ways to review the latest vaccine data with those regulators.
The Global Dengue & Aedes-Transmitted Diseases Consortium (GDAC), a group funded in part by drugmakers that works closely with WHO, scheduled a meeting for early March in Bangkok with regulators from at least six countries to take a first look at Takeda's results, said Dr. In-Kyu Yoon, director of GDAC. 
Yoon said the meeting will be paid for by the International Vaccine Institute, funded largely by charities and the Korean government. He plans to ask countries whether they want a joint regulatory review similar to the one Sanofi attended in 2015.

""Right now, there is clearly some caution,"" Yoon said.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>","Trade wars: We're next, European investors fear","By Julien Ponthus and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - While global markets would hail a U.S.-China trade deal, fears are growing that the European Union could be the fall guy in any breakthrough, which would allow Donald Trump to turn his attention to German cars or French luxury wines.
Investors thinking of chasing a rally on a trade accord through European trade proxies, such as Germany's export-heavy DAX index or the continent's luxury names, should probably think twice, analysts believe.
For trouble could come in a lot of different forms. 
Alicia García-Herrero, Chief Economist at Natixis for Asia Pacific, and a researcher at the Bruegel think-tank, is among those who have warned that a deal ""could cost Europe dearly"" if China substitutes a large part of its European imports for U.S. goods in a bid to appease the Trump administration. 
There is a lot at stake. European-listed firms expect 456 billion euros ($521 billion) in total revenue from China in 2019, with luxury brands and automakers the most exposed sectors, a Refinitiv analysis of company data shows.
Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at INTL FCStone, said that in the case China and the United States fail to clinch a deal, Europe could be flooded with cheap Chinese goods. 
""Europe stands to lose the most when the truce expires on March 1st as China would surely dump billions of discounted goods on the old continent,"" Deluard wrote. 
In 2017, China exported goods worth 374 billion euros to the EU and 505 billion dollars to the United States. 
Another dire scenario sketched out by Deluard would be a bitter lose-lose for Europe and arguable win-win for Trump: ""Imposing tariffs on European cars and reaching a deal with China could allow the Trump administration to claim two victories at the same time"". 
Many investors fear the immediate relief of a China-U.S. deal could be swiftly followed by a bitter confrontation between the EU and its closest ally. 
""WE ARE NEXT"" 
While Germany takes the lion's share of the EU's trade surplus with the United States, over 63 billion dollars in 2017, other European countries such as Ireland, Italy or France have a lot to lose if tariffs are imposed on European goods. 
(GRAPHIC: U.S. trade balance with EU - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SdAeeO)
The diversity of their exports highlights how wide the impact would be. 
A graphic from the Atlas of Economic Complexity, Center for International Development at Harvard University, shows how French exports in 2016 ranged from wines (3.80 percent) to gas turbines (10.95 percent) and medicines (6.08 percent). 
(GRAPHIC: French exports to the United States in 2016 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Sht7C0) 
Analysts trying to decipher the U.S. president's strategy believe that a confrontation with the EU is a probable next step following the revamping of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his current efforts to slash the U.S. trade deficit with China from a record 375 billion dollars in 2017. 
""We are next in the queue,"" warns BNP Paribas' chief economist William De Vijlder, adding that ""the subject of the EU-U.S. trade negotiations has been under the radar up to recently but could resurface soon.""
Lombard Odier strategist Charles St-Arnaud believes a period of prolonged EU-U.S. tension, with daily incendiary headlines making European markets jittery, is a distinct possibility.
""What Trump tweeted about French wine, I can see the parallel with Canadian milk,"" he said recalling the tense U.S. NAFTA negotiations with Canada. 
On Nov. 13th, Trump complained that while France could easily export wines to the United States, U.S. winemakers' access to the French market was restricted. 
""Not fair, must change"", he said on Twitter. 
(To see Trump's tweet click, https://tmsnrt.rs/2B75aUk)
St-Arnaud argues that the threat of a trade war with the United States could mean another grim year for European stocks, which have already suffered collateral damage from the trade spat between the world's two biggest economies. 
""A European underperformance is possible in 2019,"" he believes.
If the Chinese negotiating team currently in Washington was to achieve significant progress, European stocks would get a boost, at least in the short-term. 
""It is crucial for the world economy that this man-made uncertainty ceases,"" said De Vijlder. An escalation would meanwhile sharpen the global growth downturn and hit bourses worldwide, according to a big Reuters poll of economists.
But while both emerging and European stock markets underperformed Wall Street during 2018 due to the trade stress endured by exporters, European shares remain very much less loved by global investors than their EM peers.
According to data provider EPFR, while emerging markets equity funds have recorded 15 straight weeks of inflows, European funds saw outflows for 45 of the past 46 weeks. 
""TAKE THE WIND OUT TRUMP'S SAIL"" 
With a concerns about Brexit, unrest in France, Italy's populist government and May's EU elections, the big European benchmarks are seen by many foreign investors as ""uninvestable"", especially as growth slows.
""It's pretty clear that during the course of conversation with any client, political risk premium, political uncertainty will come into the conversation,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of strategy at Aberdeen Investments. 
Joerg Kraemer, Commerzbank's chief economist, said a confrontation with Washington could be very damaging, notably for the German car industry and that the European Commission would be wise to make a pre-emptive move. 

""Europe needs to take the wind out Trump's sails and move first,"" he told Reuters, calling for the EU to scrap its 10 percent tariff on U.S. cars to defuse tensions.

The Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal also ordered Left to repay HK$1.6 million - around $206,000 at the then prevailing exchange rate - in profits made while shorting the stock. 
On Wednesday the three-judge panel hearing the appeal said they would issue their decision at a later date. 
Among the arguments presented on Wednesday by counsel representing Left, Gerard McCoy, was that in 2016 the tribunal had not used an appropriate definition of recklessness. 
In June 2012, Left published a research report in which he claimed that Evergrande was insolvent and had defrauded investors. 
After the publication of the report, Evergrande's shares dropped nearly 20 percent.
In its 2016 ruling, the Market Misconduct Tribunal said that Left had been reckless or at the least, negligent, and that the report's allegations of fraudulent accounting and insolvency were ""false and / or misleading."" 
In 2016, Left said the ruling marked a step backwards for fair and open markets in Hong Kong.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd on Wednesday warned of weaker panel prices in the year ahead due to global economic uncertainty and U.S.- China trade tensions, as it posted a jump in quarterly profit thanks to surging sales of wearable screens.
The company said strong sales of high-end screens for smart watches helped improve profitability, even as overall sales fell due to weakness in the television segment.
The surge in profit from wearable screens underlines the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier's ongoing efforts to focus on high value-added products to fend off declining prices for large panels due to aggressive output from Chinese rivals. 
""It seems hard to forecast a positive panel price trend for 2019,"" Daniel Lee, head of LG Display's Market Intelligence Division, told an earnings call, citing the U.S.-China trade war and panel oversupply.
Operating profit for October-December came in at 279 billion won ($249.7 million), from 44 billion won in the same period a year ago, LD Display said. Revenue fell 2.5 percent to 6.9 trillion won.
Operating profit was above a 132 billion won forecast of 10 analysts based on I/B/E/S Refinitiv data, but the company's shares fell more than 4 percent following the results on concerns for panel prices, analysts said.
""The negative panel price outlook given by the company is dragging down the shares,"" said Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities.
LG Display said it expected panel shipments to fall by a high-single-digit percentage in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter due to seasonally weak demand. It gave no specific guidance on the full-year price outlook.
Weaker global smartphone sales particularly in China, the world's biggest market, have clouded the outlook for electronics makers including Apple, which said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected.
Even so, the U.S. tech giant told analysts on an earnings call it had seen strong growth in sales of wearable devices including the Apple Watch in the fourth quarter.
Shinyoung Securities analyst Lee said increasing demand for LG Display's smaller liquid crystal display (LCD) panels helped to offset poor sales of its LCD panels for Apple's struggling XR smartphone.
LG Display shares fell 40 percent last year amid a global tech selloff prompted by investor fears over the impact on supply chains of the U.S.-China trade war. 

The stock was down 4.2 percent as of 0419 GMT versus the wider market's 0.7 percent rise.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 12:06AM ET</span>",Apple lowers some iPhone prices outside U.S. to offset strong dollar,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to cut the price of some of its flagship iPhones for only the second time in the device's 12-year history, pegging its retail value to past prices in local currencies outside the United States instead of the rising U.S. dollar. 
The move is an attempt to stem weak sales of the iPhone, particularly in overseas markets such as China, where a 10 percent rise in the U.S. dollar over the past year or so has made Apple's products - which already compete at the top end of the market - much pricier than rivals. 
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook disclosed the plan on Tuesday after the company reported the first-ever dip in iPhone sales during the key holiday shopping period. The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.
Apple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.
The company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at $999, the same price in U.S. dollars as its predecessor, 2017's iPhone X. 
That worked for U.S. consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey the local currency had fallen so much against the surging U.S. dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before. Apple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.
On Tuesday, Cook said Apple will adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.
""We’ve decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview. 
RISING DOLLAR HURTS APPLE SALES 
In the company's quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 percent against the dollar and Apple's sales were down by $700 million from the previous year. In November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia. 
Apple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.
Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the price adjustments may not extend to its services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store.
While that unit beat analyst expectations with $10.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended in December, growth has slowed compared to previous years.
Maestri said slower growth was partly because prices rose for users in non-U.S. markets.

""Roughly 60 percent of our services business is outside the United States, and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months,"" Maestri said. ""And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.""

858,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 11:12PM ET</span>",Canada Has Until March to Assess U.S. Request for Huawei CFO,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada has until March 1 to assess a U.S. request to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co. in a case that’s sparked an unprecedented diplomatic dispute as Washington broadens its attack on the Chinese technology giant.
Meng Wanzhou appeared in British Columbia Supreme Court Tuesday where Justice William Ehrcke granted her request to change one of the sureties backing her bail. He also agreed to push back Meng’s next Vancouver court appearance by a month to March 6 to account for the 30-day window that Canada has to review the U.S. request and decide whether to proceed to extradition hearings.
The developments come in a dramatic escalation of tensions between the world’s two largest economies after U.S. prosecutors in Washington and New York unsealed two indictments against Huawei on Monday.
Huawei and its U.S. affiliate were ordered to appear in a federal court in Seattle on Feb. 28 to face charges that they engaged in a scheme to steal trade secrets of T-Mobile US Inc.
The Brooklyn case alleges that Huawei, two affiliated companies and CFO Meng engaged in bank and wire fraud as well as conspiracy in connection with business in Iran. Meng, 46, was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities and later released on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail.
The Seattle case entails a 10-count indictment that alleges the company conspired to engage in a “concerted effort” to steal a mobile phone testing robot T-Mobile created called “Tappy.” The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez.
The indictments intensify the spotlight on Huawei, which has come to symbolize China’s economic rise and challenge to the U.S.’s status as the world’s top superpower. In particular, the decision to prosecute Meng -- daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei -- has riled Beijing and increased concerns around the globe of a new Cold War.
Meng, currently under house arrest in Vancouver, will have several opportunities to appeal. The final decision on extradition will be up to Canada’s Justice Minister David Lametti.
Extradition cases “can take a long time” in part because of defenses that review someone’s rights, Lametti told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. He said he would only have a role in Meng’s extradition at the end: if a judge orders her removal, it’s up to him to decide whether to hand her over.
“I only will have to make a decision at the end of the process,’’ he said.
When Meng’s defense lawyer asked Ehrcke if he would also be assigned to the extradition proceedings, the judge said he didn’t know.
""I think that remains somewhat open depending on scheduling,” he said. “I have no idea whether we’re looking at months or years. And maybe you have a better idea than I do, but at this point that’s completely unknown to me.""

China’s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component edged up 0.1% and 0.2% by 9:50 PM ET (02:50 GMT), while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.4%.
Apple’s CEO Time Cook, who is reportedly in regular contact with Trump, said trade tension between China and the U.S. is easing this month.
Despite Cook’s comments, traders remain sceptical whether the two sides could bridge their differences over a number of issues, especially after the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled two criminal cases against China’s technological giant Huawei on Tuesday.
Citing people familiar with the talks, Reuters said there have been few signs that Chinese officials are willing to address core U.S. demands on intellectual property rights and technology transfers.
""Clearly on the structural concerns, on forced technology transfers, there remains a significant gap if not a wide chasm between the two sides,"" a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The two nations are trying to reach a deal before a deadline on March 1. Otherwise, Trump is likely to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%.
Meanwhile, investors also await the monetary policy decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve later in the day following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>",EBay's poor revenue outlook overshadows first-ever dividend,"By Arjun Panchadar and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - EBay Inc on Tuesday forecast March quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates after reporting disappointing growth in the sales volume on its platform during the key holiday quarter, overshadowing news of its first-ever dividend.
Shares of the online marketplace were down 1 percent in after-hours trading, reversing course after an initial jump following eBay's move to pay a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share.
The lackluster forecast comes as San Jose, California-based eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) faces demands from two prominent activist shareholders to sell some divisions and restructure others amid fierce competition with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers.
EBay said consumer spending in December, a normally busy shopping period, was slow despite more buyers using its platform.
Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig also predicted more near-term pressure on eBay's gross merchandise volume (GMV) - the value of all products sold on its websites - as the company reduced some marketing spending. He said he was confident, however, the company would boost GMV in the long run and benefit from new ad sales and a payments initiative.
""We believe that the actions we're taking in '19 will set us up well,"" he said on a conference call with analysts.
EBay forecast revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion for the current quarter, compared with analysts' target of $2.66 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
GMV overall rose just 1 percent in the December quarter and also missed analysts' estimates, while it dipped 1 percent in the United States.
Still, results for the final quarter of 2018 showed eBay's sales had climbed 6.3 percent year-over-year to $2.88 billion, exceeding Wall Street's estimates.
A multi-year effort by eBay to make its platform simpler to users, by introducing grouped listings, personal recommendations and an easier-to-use payment process is helping attract shoppers.
EBay had 179 million active buyers at the end of the December quarter, about 2 million more than the previous quarter.
The company also announced an increase to its share buybacks by $4 billion, reflecting the influence of eBay's activist investors, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.
""The hope for eBay, in my opinion, is their ability to supplement the marketplace with advertising and a growing payments business, but I think the core marketplace is still a challenged business,"" he said.

EBay's quarterly profit from continuing operations reached $763 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 billion a year earlier, when eBay recorded a one-time expense of more than $3 billion.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 07:49PM ET</span>",Apple services business grows; CEO Cook says China tensions ease,"By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported sharp growth in its services business on Tuesday and Chief Executive Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, helping boost the company's shares after hours even though iPhone sales dipped in the holiday shopping quarter for the first time. 
Apple said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected, a signal that it continues to face weak demand for the iPhone, especially in China, the world's biggest smartphone market. 
But investors focused on the company's growing services, which include Apple Music and its App Store. 
""The services number is good, and that is the growth engine going forward that people will continue to focus on,"" said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners.
Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, said there were signs of a detente in trade tensions with China, which may have depressed sales of its phones. 
""If you were to graph up trade tension it’s clearly less in January than it was in December,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""I’m optimistic that the two countries will be able to work things out.""
The company's shares rose 6 percent to $163.50 in after-hours trading. They had fallen more than 30 percent since November on concerns about weak iPhone sales and a general decline in high-tech stocks. Shares of iPhone suppliers including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) , Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions rose more than 1 percent in extended trade after Apple's report.
""It appears that the bears pressed way too hard on the negative bets and even this more negative report couldn’t drive the stock lower,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. 
SUBSCRIBERS UP
Apple said revenue from services, which investors are counting on to fuel growth, reached $10.8 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. Services gross margin hit 63 percent, up from 58.3 percent a year ago. Analysts previously estimated the services gross margin could top 60 percent.
""They get more efficient as they get larger,"" Cook told Reuters. 
The company said it has 360 million subscribers to both its own and third-party services, and set a goal to expand that to 500 million by the end of 2020. It said it has 1.4 billion active devices, an increase of 100 million from last year, and that 900 million of those are iPhones. 
Apple said it would start providing regular updates on the number of iPhones and overall devices in use - what is known in the tech industry as the installed base. The company stopped reporting unit sales of its iPhones the latest quarter. 
Apple counts both subscribers to its own services as well as Apple device users who subscribe to outside apps or services using Apple's payment systems. Apple keeps up to 30 percent of the payments it handles.
Apple's iPhone revenue declined 15 percent year-over-year to $51.9 billion. Cook said China's economic weakness hurt iPhone sales there. 
He said Apple is rethinking how it prices the iPhone outside the United States after largely setting the price in U.S. dollars, which made the phones more expensive in local currencies as the dollar strengthened.
In markets with currencies that weakened considerably against the dollar over the last year, iPhone price ""increases were obviously more,"" Cook told Reuters. ""And so as we’ve gotten into January and assessed the macroeconomic condition in some of those markets, we’ve decided to go back to more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago in hopes of helping the sales in those areas.""
OUTLOOK LARGELY BELOW WALL STREET 
Apple said it expects revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion for the current quarter ending in March, largely below analysts' average estimate of $58.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
For the quarter ending in December, the company's busiest due to the holiday shopping season, Apple reported revenue of $84.3 billion, slightly above analysts' average estimate of $84 billion. Apple warned in early January that sales would miss the targets it gave in November. 
Earnings per share were $4.18, compared with Wall Street's average estimate of $4.17, according to Refinitiv data.
Investors have been closely tracking the company's share repurchase activity in hopes that it will help buoy the falling share price, which has knocked Apple off its throne as the world's largest technology company with a market value of more than $1 trillion.
Apple said it bought back $8.2 billion worth of shares in the quarter ended in December, less than half the $19.4 billion it purchased in the quarter ended in September. Apple said its net cash position - cash minus its debt - was $130 billion, up from $123 billion in the previous quarter. Apple has publicly said it plans to draw its net cash position to zero.
Some investors were disappointed Apple did not take advantage of low prices over the last quarter to buy back more stock. Ross Gerber, chief executive of Santa Monica, California-based Apple shareholder Gerber Kawasaki, said that Cook ""is very annoying in this way"" and was ""just playing the game so safely."" 

""Tim just wants to be predictable and it seems to be working for now,"" Gerber said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - An ex-stripper who became a regional sales director at Insys Therapeutics Inc gave a doctor a lap dance at a Chicago club as the drugmaker pushed the doctor to prescribe its addictive fentanyl spray, a former Insys employee testified on Tuesday.
The testimony in federal court in Boston came in the first criminal trial of painkiller manufacturer executives over conduct that authorities say contributed to a U.S. opioid abuse epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people a year.
Former Insys sales representative Holly Brown told jurors the incident with her boss, Sunrise Lee, took place after Insys began rewarding the doctor for prescribing its opioid product by paying him to speak at educational events about the drug.
That Illinois doctor, Paul Madison, is one of several whom prosecutors say Lee and four other former Insys executives and managers including wealthy founder and ex-chairman John Kapoor conspired to bribe to boost sales of the spray, Subsys.
Lee, Kapoor, Michael Gurry, Richard Simon and Joseph Rowan deny wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved Subsys for treating cancer pain. Prosecutors allege doctors paid by Insys often prescribed Subsys to patients without cancer. Defense lawyers note, though, that doctors may prescribe medications for off-label purposes.
Drugmakers often retain doctors to speak at events with other clinicians about the benefits of their drugs, and defense lawyers argue the events were legal compensation for the doctors' educational work.
Yet Brown said Madison's events, held at a Chicago restaurant Kapoor owned, were attended by his friends instead of clinicians.
""The idea was these weren't really meant to be educational programs but were meant to be rewards to physicians,"" Brown said.
After one dinner in mid-2012, Brown said she, Lee and Madison went to a club, where she witnessed Lee ""sitting on his lap, kind of bouncing around.""
""He had his hands sort of inappropriately all over her chest,"" Brown said.
Brown testified that at the time, Madison ran a ""notorious"" medical practice, which in a 2012 email shown to jurors she described as a ""shady pill mill.""
Prosecutors say Insys paid Madison at least $70,800 in speaker fees.
Asked on cross-examination by Lee's attorney, Peter Horstmann, if Madison ""appeared to be taking advantage of Ms. Lee,"" Brown said yes.

Madison was convicted in November of unrelated charges that he defrauded insurers into paying for unperformed chiropractic procedures. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Vale eyed dam design changes in 2009 that may have prevented disaster,"By Marta Nogueira and Ernest Scheyder
RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA identified concerns around its tailings dams in 2009 and studied but did not implement several steps that could have prevented or lessened the damage from last week's deadly disaster, according to a corporate presentation seen by Reuters.
A tailings dam, used to store the muddy detritus of the mining process, collapsed on Friday, killing at least 65 in one of Brazil's largest industrial accidents on record. 
The Brumadinho disaster, coming just over three years after a similar incident at another mine partially controlled by Vale, has fueled calls for a management overhaul and erased more than 70 billion reais ($18.61 billion) in Vale's market value.
But a decade ago, the world's largest iron ore miner was considering ways to use fewer tailings dams, including alternative uses for the waste rock, according to the 73-page presentation.
The presentation pointed to the rising volume of tailings produced at the company's mines, with some locations producing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of tailings daily.
The report suggested Vale make building materials from tailings, including bricks, a step that would give the company another revenue source and lessen the volume needing to be stored using dams.
The 2009 Vale report had recommended the company undertake a project to be called ""Zero Dams"" that would have involved drying out tailings, among other steps. It was not known whether the report reached the top levels of Vale management nor why it was not implemented.
Vale declined to comment. The report's author, Paulo Ricardo Behrens da Franca, left Vale a year after submitting it and now works as an industry consultant. Reached by Reuters, he did not comment.
Late Tuesday, Vale said it would take as much as 10 percent of its ore output offline in order to decommission 10 more dams like the one that burst last week.
'INHERENTLY DANGEROUS STRUCTURES'
Vale's Brumadinho facility was built using the cheapest and least-stable type of tailings dam design, a commonly used structure in mining known as ""upstream construction."" 
Chile, Peru and other earthquake-prone countries ban the design, in which tailings are used to progressively construct dam walls the more a mine is excavated. Brazil is not as earthquake-prone as its western neighbors, but even small seismic activity has been shown to affect tailings dams.
Because these types of tailings dams are waterlogged, they are easily susceptible to cracks and other damage that can cause bursts like the one that occurred last week near Brumadinho.
""A tailings dam may look safe, but it's still retaining a lot of moisture behind it,"" said Dermot Ross-Brown, a mining industry engineer who teaches at the Colorado School of Mines. ""They're inherently dangerous structures.""
Tailings dams tend to be shorter in height than conventional water dams, but often are far wider in span.
The disaster's cause remains unknown. Vale said the dam had not received tailings for about two and a half years and was in the process of decommissioning, a step that should have lessened risk, engineers said.
""It's really puzzling to me this happened as the (dam) was closing,"" said Cameron Scott of SRK Consulting, a mining engineering firm. ""This disaster will make future mine permitting harder.""
The dam had passed a September 2018 inspection by the German firm TUEV SUED AG and Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said equipment had shown the dam was stable on Jan. 10.
On Tuesday, Brazilian state prosecutors arrested three Vale employees and two TUEV SUED employees. 
RISK
Brazil has nearly 4,000 dams that are classified as having ""high damage potential"" or being at high risk, with 205 of those dams containing mineral waste, the country's Regional Development Minister Gustavo Canuto said.
Analysts and engineers said that the Brumadinho disaster will hopefully push the industry to stop storing wet tailings and instead move toward the more-expensive-but-safer process of storing dry tailings. 
That process requires drying the tailings and storing them on-site, abrogating the risk of a dam burst. The approach is becoming more popular in Canada and other countries with stricter mining regulations. 
""The industry doesn't yet fully realize the risk its taking on with those type of wet tailings dams,"" said Matt Fuller of Tierra Group International Ltd, a tailings engineering consulting firm. 
Officials in Brazil's Minas Gerais state, where the disaster occurred, say they are now going to push for legislation requiring dry mining and forcing miners to tear down tailings dams when they are located above communities.
A similar proposal failed last summer, with its defeat attributed by the bill's sponsor to lobbying pressure from mining companies.
Brazil is still reeling from the 2015 collapse of a larger dam, owned by the Samarco Mineracao SA joint venture between Vale and BHP, that killed 19 people.
After Samarco, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) issued updated guidelines for its members to try to safeguard tailings dams used to store waste left over from mining operations.
The ICCM said on Saturday that the mining industry still has ""lessons to learn"" from Samarco and similar events.
Mining companies typically hire engineering firms that specialize in tailings dams to build the structures, not necessarily dam contractors themselves, a step that some industry observers hope changes soon.     
""The mining companies are not placing dam safety at the forefront of their preoccupations,"" said Emmanuel Grenier, a spokesman for the International Coalition of Large Dams (ICOLD), a non-governmental organization focused on dam engineering.

The group ""is recommending that dams, especially large dams, be built by dam professionals, but it is too rarely the case for tailing dams,"" Grenier said.

867,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 06:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Apple Results Hit Targets
Apple will likely lend support to stocks at the open tomorrow after it reported profit and revenue just above analysts’ forecasts.
The company also guided its second-quarter revenue in line with consensus estimates.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 5.4% in postmarket trading.
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) should also help techs. It gained more than 8% after hours, despite missing on quarterly revenue targets, after it said it sees 2019 revenue growth in the high single digits.
Tomorrow is another earnings-packed day, with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) reporting ahead of trading.
After the bell brings results from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
2. Fed Day; Pending Home Sales Scheduled
The Federal Reserve will announce its decision on interest rates tomorrow, although there’s little suspense.
There is a 99% chance that the FOMC keeps rates steady in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Of more interest will be Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference, with expectations that he will reiterate that the Fed can be patient on monetary policy.
The decision comes at 2 PM ET (19:00 GMT), and the press conference is slated for 2:30 PM ET.
Even though the partial government shutdown has ended, there’s still a knock-on effect with economic data.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis is delaying the releases of advance fourth-quarter GDP and December personal spending.
No new date for the reports has been set yet.
But there will be the latest numbers on pending home sales at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect the National Association of Realtors to report a 1.1% rise in pending home sales for December.
3. Oil Inventories Arrive
The weekly oil inventories numbers continue to have a big impact on the market.
The Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly figures at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
In the previous week to Jan. 18, the EIA announced a larger-than-expected build of 4.05 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles to a record high 259.6 million barrels.
Crude inventories rose by 7.97 million barrels while stockpiles of distillates, which produce diesel and other commercial fuels, decreased by 0.62 million barrels."
868,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:45PM ET</span>",Macro trader Adam Fisher exits Soros for second solo act,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Adam Fisher, a portfolio manager at Soros Fund Management, is returning to running his own firm less than two years after joining the approximately $25 billion investment firm.
Fisher exited the New York-based family office, which invests the fortune of famed trader and philanthropist George Soros and his family, earlier this month, two people familiar with his move told Reuters.
He is now working on launching a macro-oriented hedge fund and expects to oversee some money for Soros through a managed account, one of the people said. 
Soros Fund Management officials did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Fisher's departure coincides with the firm's decision to pull back some money from so-called macro investing - the types of big wagers on currencies, bonds and stocks that turned Soros' former hedge fund firm into one of Wall Street's most lucrative and revered shops nearly three decades ago.
Dawn Fitzpatrick, Soros' chief investment officer, over the last year has made adjustments to the portfolio as she felt the opportunities to make money have shifted. Fitzpatrick joined Soros in 2017, and while the firm does not invest money for outsiders, its moves are still closely watched on Wall Street because the portfolio is large and influential.
Fisher's team lost money at Soros last year, but the firm earned roughly 1.5 percent, one of the sources said.
Fisher joined Soros in 2017 after his hedge fund firm, Commonwealth Opportunity Capital, invested money for Soros as well as public pensions and other external clients. He had run Commonwealth since 2008 and the firm oversaw roughly $2.2 billion two years ago. Reuters previously reported that the fund produced average annual returns of nearly 10 percent.
Now he and his team are planning on going back to what they did before, managing money for outside clients, including Soros. Fisher could not be reached for comment and it was not immediately clear how much money Soros would invest with Fisher. Other details about Fisher's new firm could also not be immediately learned.
Investing in global macro strategies has become less popular over the last months as performance sagged. Data from Hedge Fund Research show that the average macro-oriented fund lost 3.6 percent last year and that investors pulled out $6.6 billion in assets in the fourth quarter alone.

869,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:29PM ET</span>",Apple Shares Rise Despite iPhone Miss,"Investing.com - Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were rising after hours after the tech giant reported a rare revenue decline due to slow iPhone sales in China and elsewhere. But the company produced the results it had told investors to expect in early January.
Shares were trading at $160.19, up 5.5% in after-hours trading. Shares were off 1% to $154.68 in regular trading.
Apple said it earned $4.18 a share in its fiscal first quarter, a penny better than expected. Revenue of $84.3 billion was slightly better than the Street -- and company -- estimate of $84 billion. Still, revenue overall was down 4.5%. For the second-fiscal quarter, the company sees revenue at $55 billion to $59 billion, a touch lower than the Street estimate of $58.97.
Revenue from iPhone sales fell 15% from a year ago to $52 billion, the company said, with much of the weakness coming from business in China. The company said sales in Greater China fell a whopping 27% to $13.2 billion, largely because of Sino-American trade tensions and weakness in the Chinese economy. In addition, Apple has been facing intense competition from other smartphone makers offering products at much lower prices.
Other businesses at Apple reported gains.
Apple stunned investors after the Jan. 2 market close by warning that first-quarter results would be weaker than it expected. Apple usually beats its own projections. The shares fell to as low as $142 the next day. They're up more than 13% since and are up 1.4% for the month. But the shares are still down more than 31% since peaking in September.
The good news from the report was services revenue jumped 19% in the quarter to $10.9 billion. Sales of Macintosh computers grew 9% to $7.4 billion. IPad sales were up 17% to $6.7 billion. Wearable product sales soared 33%. As CEO Tim Cook has noted, the wearables and services businesses are not dependent on business in China.
Operating cash flow was about $26.7 billion and the company finished the quarter with about $130 billion in cash and equivalents."
870,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:26PM ET</span>",Wall Street wavers as tech gives ground and industrials rebound,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Tuesday, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and other technology-related shares dipping, while a rebound in 3M (NYSE:MMM) and other industrials elevated the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 4 percent in extended trade after the iPhone maker posted quarterly results following its warning earlier this month that revenue would be less than previously expected due to softness in China, whose economy has been damaged by a trade war with the United States.
Apple's stock had fallen 1.04 percent during the trading session, and its rebound after the bell helped push S&P 500 futures up 0.2 percent, suggesting Wall Street could open in positive territory on Wednesday.
Interest rates were also in focus as the Federal Reserve began a two-day monetary policy meeting. After raising rates gradually last year, the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach to further tightening in the face of an overseas slowdown and market volatility.
The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, and investors will look to Friday's January jobs report for clues about the pace of future inflation.
""It's a day of indecision. I don't think anyone wants to make a big bet ahead of all that news,"" Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird, said of corporate earnings, the Fed decision and the employment report. 
The S&P industrials index, which took a beating after a warning from  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) on Monday, rebounded 1.37 percent, helped by better-than-expected reports from 3M Co and defense companies.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which are all due to report quarterly results later this week, fell more than 2 percent each. 
The S&P technology index lost 1.01 percent.
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' aggregate earnings per share to have risen 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter. But with U.S. corporate tax cuts now a year old, 2019 earnings are seen rising a more moderate 5.6 percent.
As Washington and Beijing officials prepare for a high-level trade meeting this week, the Justice Department leveled charges against Chinese telecom giant Huawei, potentially casting a cloud on the talks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.21 percent to end at 24,579.96 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.15 percent to 2,640, dragged down by technology and communications stocks. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.81 percent to 7,028.29.
Defense contractors L3 Technologies Inc jumped 8.44 percent and Harris Corp (NYSE:HRS) climbed 8.78 percent after topping quarterly earnings estimates. 
3M rose 1.94 percent after its fourth-quarter results beat estimates, even as the Post-It notes maker trimmed its 2019 earnings outlook, saying that a slowdown at its Chinese business was hurting revenue.
Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) dropped 5.05 percent after the motorcycle maker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hit by declining sales in the United States.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc fell 8.55 percent after the Botox maker forecast 2019 revenue below expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 31 new highs and 29 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.9 billion shares, compared with the 7.6 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

871,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Closes Mixed as Tech Tumbles,"Investing.com - Wall Street closed mixed as tech stocks tumbled and partly offset gains in industrials, which bounced back from a selloff a day earlier, led by 3M.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.21%, the S&P 500 fell 0.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.81%.
Tech was dragged lower by ongoing weakness in semiconductor stocks in the wake of Nvidia's downbeat quarterly results released Monday.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 4.6%, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) fell 1.29% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 4.6%, but bounced back 5% postmarket after reporting quaterly results.
Industrials limited losses in the broader market.
3M (NYSE:MMM) rose 2% after reporting fourth-quarter results that topped estimates, though soft full-year earnings per share guidance kept a lid on gains in the stock.
The company lowered its full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $10.45 to $10.90 from a prior range of $10.60 to $11.05.
""MMM is seeing growth across all geographies and all business units, which we find encouraging,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
Elsewhere a slump in Harley-Davidson overshadowed gains in Whirlpool, pressuring the consumer discretionary sector down 0.8%.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.17, below consensus of $0.28, and revenues of $956 million missed expectations.
Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) rose 9.6% as its fourth-quarter earnings topped expectations, but revenue fell short as sales declined in Latin America and the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.
Souring sentiment on trade also weighed on stocks after the Justice Department filed charges against China's Huawei, a day ahead of a second round of trade talks between the two nations.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin attempted, however, to quell investor fears, saying the criminal charges filed against Huawei will not be part of the trade talks.
""Those are separate issues, and that’s a separate dialogue,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Network. ""So those are not part of trade discussions. Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions, but any issues as it relates to violations of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track.""
Energy stocks, meanwhile, found their footing from a slide a day earlier following a rise in oil prices after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. The sanctions could curb the country's crude exports at a time when many fear a glut in global supplies will keep a lid on oil prices.
Economic data offered little optimism as U.S. consumer confidence dropped to an 18-month low in January, weighed down by the government shutdown and volatility in markets.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Corning (NYSE:GLW) and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, the central figure in a high-stakes dispute between the world's two largest economies, made her first appearance in a Canadian court in more than a month on Tuesday as Ottawa weighs extraditing the Chinese executive to the United States.
Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the Chinese telecommunications company's founder, attended the hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court during which Justice William Ehrcke approved her request for a change in who is financially responsible for her bail.
Canada arrested Meng on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which on Monday brought sweeping charges against Huawei and Meng that paint the company as a threat to U.S. national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.
""I can confirm that the United States has filed a formal request with my department for the extradition of Ms. Meng,"" Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters in Ottawa.
Canada's government now has a month to decide whether the U.S. extradition request is strong enough to be presented in the British Columbia court. Lametti, asked whether a decision could come sooner than 30 days, said officials ""will take the time that they need to make an enlightened decision based on the evidence in front of them.""
Neither Lametti nor Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland gave any hints on whether Canada would back the extradition request. Freeland told reporters Meng ""has been afforded access to Canada's impartial and objective judicial system.""
Ehrcke on Dec. 11 approved Meng's release on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail, and she has stayed at a family residence in Vancouver. Canada's government agreed to her request concerning bail at Tuesday's hearing, which the judge granted. Ehrcke also postponed Meng's next scheduled court appearance by a month, to March 6, which comes after the 30-day extradition decision deadline.
Before the hearing, Meng, who is fighting extradition, spoke with her lawyer David Martin, holding a notepad. 
Her arrest further aggravated U.S.-Chinese tensions at a time when the two economic powerhouses are locked in a trade war. President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Meng's case if it would serve U.S. national security interests or help close a trade deal with China. 
Following Meng's arrest, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds. A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drug smuggling and sentenced him to death. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday fired his ambassador to China, who had said Meng could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States.
'A HOSTAGE'
    In a previous sworn affidavit, Meng said she is innocent and would contest the allegations at trial in the United States if she is extradited. Her lawyer Reid Weingarten said Meng ""should not be a pawn or a hostage"" in ""complex"" Sino-U.S. relations.
Huawei is the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones. It derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.
In Ottawa, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Canada's decision on whether to ban Huawei from supplying equipment to 5G networks is ""some ways off into the future."" 
Goodale's comments were the most specific indication yet from Ottawa on the timing of the politically sensitive announcement. Officials are studying the security implications of 5G networks, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. The United States and other Canadian allies have already imposed restrictions on Huawei equipment, citing the risk of espionage.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday he expected significant progress in Washington trade talks with Chinese officials, set for Wednesday and Thursday. Mnuchin said the U.S. security concerns raised by the Huawei case were separate from the trade issue.
China's foreign ministry has urged the United States to drop the arrest warrant against Meng and end ""unreasonable suppression"" of Chinese companies. China has demanded the executive's immediate release.
Huawei's global reach has come under attack from the United States, which is trying to prevent U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are worried the gear could be used by China's government for espionage, a concern Huawei calls unfounded.
U.S. intelligence and national security officials expressed fresh national security concerns about Huawei during a U.S. Senate committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers the lines between ""the Chinese government and ostensibly private companies"" are blurred if not totally erased and ""especially the lines between lawful behavior and fair competition and lying and hacking and cheating and stealing.""

896,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 04:12PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela proposes new oil contract terms to sidestep U.S. sanctions,"By Marianna Parraga
(Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA is seeking to sidestep Trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, four sources involved in the talks said.
The U.S. government issued an executive order on Monday freezing PDVSA assets and requiring U.S. firms to pay for PDVSA oil using accounts controlled by the country's congress head and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro into stepping down. 
PDVSA began calling customers ahead of the sanctions, urging them to swap foreign fuel and other products for its Venezuelan crude cargoes, the sources said. It is also considering asking trading houses to act as intermediaries for a portion of its oil sales to indirectly supply customers in the United States and elsewhere. 
""We are trying to redo the contracts. It is not yet entirely clear how because customers are being individually called, but we are studying alternatives,"" said a PDVSA source familiar with the efforts. 
It was unclear on Tuesday whether the approach of using intermediaries or swaps would avoid violating U.S. sanctions, the sources said. 
Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Venezuela's export revenue. Falling output, corruption and mismanagement have battered the nation's economy, leading to hyperinflation and malnutrition that have prompted some 3 million people to leave the country. 
The South American country exports 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, including 500,000 bpd to the United States, and imports over 200,000 bpd of refined products, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The imports from the United States are crucial for Venezuela's production of diluted crude oil (DCO), as they use heavy naphtha to dilute Venezuela's extra heavy crude and produce oil ready for export.
Industry traders on Tuesday said that U.S. refineries were making inquiries to replace those shipments from other countries. World oil futures rose by more than 2 percent on Tuesday, but the market has not seen panicked buying as a result of the U.S. decision to target Venezuela's oil output, particularly as the country's production was already near seven-decade lows. 
FREEZING PDVSA PROCEEDS
Washington said on Monday proceeds from PDVSA's sales to companies in the United States will be frozen until a new government can take control of the accounts. 
The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA's U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India's Reliance and Russia's Rosneft.
Oil firms that had sent tankers to Venezuela to lift crude bound for the United States were ordered by PDVSA on Monday to pay for cargoes before departure, sources told Reuters.
But such prepayment could violate the sanctions, setting the stage for a standoff at Venezuelan ports. Regular buyers of Venezuelan crude, especially in the United States, have started hunting for alternative supplies of heavy oil, a difficult task as other Latin American exporters from Mexico to Colombia do not have surplus capacity. 
PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Several U.S. refiners, including  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) said they were studying the sanctions and would comply with U.S. laws.
Valero, the second-largest buyer of Venezuelan crude after Citgo, said it will ""re-optimize"" its crude supply. 
Washington's fast action on Venezuela and efforts by Maduro's government to defend its grip on PDVSA have sent shockwaves around the world, triggering angry responses from China and Russia.
INTRICATE DEALS
Swaps and three-way trades have become routine due to PDVSA's oil-for-loan pacts and U.S. sanctions first imposed in 2017, according to internal PDVSA documents and trading sources.
The Caracas-based company's barrels typically go through several hands before reaching a refinery. Its fuel imports mostly come from swaps, according to PDVSA's internal documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.
PDVSA approached an Indian refiner seeking to modify terms of its contracts, including adding partial payment in the form of refined products through swaps, a source from the refining company said.
With other customers, payments in medicines or food for settling outstanding balances also are on the table, one of the PDVSA sources said.
India's Reliance and Nayara Energy, partially owned by Rosneft, did not respond to emails requesting comment.
Swaps are one response to U.S. sanctions, but dealing with traders for triangulating Venezuelan oil sales could be PDVSA's last resort as intermediaries make a profit from buying cheap barrels, storing them and then offering them to refiners.

""Traders buy our oil at obscene prices,"" the PDVSA source said.

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as sales rose and tax expense fell, but competition for older medicines is growing and the drugmaker forecast 2019 earnings below Wall Street estimates.
For the full-year, Amgen projected adjusted earnings of $13.10 to $14.30 per share on revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.9 billion. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast $14.61 per share on revenue $22.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The world’s largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $1.93 billion, or $3.01 per share, compared with a net loss of $4.26 billion, or $5.89 per share, a year ago, when it took a large charge related to changes in U.S. corporate tax laws.
Excluding items, Amgen said it had adjusted earnings for the quarter of $3.42 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $3.27 per share.
Total revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $6.23 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.84 billion. 
The rise in sales was driven largely by increased demand for medicines such as cancer drug Kyprolis, cholesterol fighter Repatha and osteoporosis treatment Prolia.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>","U.S. senator asks J&J for documents on talc, baby powder safety","(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Patty Murray sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Tuesday seeking information related to allegations in a Reuters Special Report that the healthcare company knew about the presence of asbestos in its talc-based baby powder.
The letter addressed to J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky asks for documents and information related to testing of its talc products for the presence of carcinogens and ""how it presented that information to regulators and consumers.""
Reuters on Dec. 14 published a Special Report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for cancer-causing asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers. 
While exposure to asbestos has been linked to mesothelioma, J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.
J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz, in an emailed statement, acknowledged receiving the letter and said the company looks forward to sharing its response with the senator.
“As we have consistently stated, we firmly stand behind the safety and purity of our talc, which has been confirmed by thousands of independent tests by regulators worldwide, including the U.S. FDA and many of the world’s leading independent laboratories,"" the company statement said.
Murray, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, referred to the Reuters report in her letter. It began, ""I am troubled by recent reports of an alleged decades-long effort by Johnson & Johnson to potentially mislead regulators and consumers about the safety of one of its products, which may have resulted in long-term harm for men, women, and children who used Johnson & Johnson baby powder.""
J&J is facing more than 11,000 lawsuits alleging that use of its talc products, including baby powder, caused cancer. 

Murray asked for documents to support the company's claim that its current talc products do not contain any level of asbestos, documents on the testing of its talc products and communications with the Food and Drug Administration about the safety of its baby powder dating from 1966 to present.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>","Verizon sees no increase in 2019 profit, misses fourth quarter revenue estimate","By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) on Tuesday said it does not expect profit growth in 2019 due to a higher tax rate and interest expense, and missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter revenue.
The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers said 5G, the next-generation wireless network that is expected to bring much faster data speeds, will not have a large impact on Verizon's financials until 2020, foreshadowing a year of flat growth for the major U.S. carriers. 
Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said in a note on Tuesday that investors have been focused on what the build-out of 5G will cost Verizon rather than how much it will earn from the technology.
Moffett also said the company's profit guidance this year was ""not very inspiring,"" given the strong U.S. economy.
Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said during the earnings call with analysts that the company expects earnings per share growth to be reduced by between 24 cents and 28 cents, due to the higher effective tax rate and increased interest expense. 
Ellis said Verizon's business was still strong enough to offset the ""non-operational items"" and balance out to the same earnings per share level from 2018. 
Shares of Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, were down 2.4 percent to $53.75 in afternoon trading.
Total operating revenue rose 1 percent to $34.28 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of $34.44 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company forecast an increase in 2019 capital spending to a range of $17 billion to $18 billion, including expansion of the commercial launch of its 5G wireless technology, up from $16.7 billion last year.
Verizon, which has 118 million wireless customers, said it added a net 653,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the fourth quarter, beating the average estimate of 355,600, according to research firm FactSet.
Analysts pay attention to postpaid customers, or those with a recurring bill, because they are more valuable to carriers and remain with the company longer than prepaid customers.
The company lost 46,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 29,000 it lost last year, as viewers leave for cheaper internet TV services rather than pay for pricier cable packages. Analysts looked for 51,000 losses.
Net income attributable to the company fell to $1.94 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the quarter, from $18.78 billion, or $4.56 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $16.8 billion one-time benefit from the U.S. tax overhaul.
Revenue for the Verizon Media Group, formerly called Oath and which includes Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and AOL, was $2.1 billion during the quarter, down 5.8 percent from the prior year.

Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.12 per share, above the average estimate of $1.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",OECD working on plans for minimum corporate tax,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is working on plans for a minimum corporate tax rate as part of a global revision of tax rules for the digital era, it said on Tuesday.
The emergence of digital giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has pushed international tax rules to the limit because they can book profits in countries with the lowest taxes no matter where the customer is.
Some 127 countries and territories agreed last week that a planned revision of global tax rules by 2020 would tackle some of the most vexed issues, such as how to divide up the right to tax digital firms' cross-border income between countries, the OECD said.
Under a proposal from France and Germany, they also agreed to look at ways to give countries more leeway to tax revenue booked in other countries with no or low tax.
""We are working ... on the concept of a minimum tax, we are exploring aspects and we will certainly take into account and may be informed by the experience of the U.S,"" said OECD head of international cooperation Achim Pross.
The OECD, made up of 36 states with advanced economies, does research and helps member countries draw up economic policies. Cross-border taxation is one of its focuses.
The Trump administration's 2017 tax overhaul included a provision meant to discourage multinational corporations from avoiding U.S. taxes by holding intangible assets such as software patents abroad in low-tax countries. 
The provision for global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, imposes an effective 10.5 percent tax rate on income from tax havens.
Meanwhile, France is using its year-long presidency of the Group of Seven economic powers, which started this month, to push for an agreement on a minimum corporate tax.
""Governments must be able to tax companies in countries with excessively low taxes,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Twitter, welcoming the news from the OECD.
In the absence of international rules preventing firms from shifting profits to low-tax countries, a growing number of countries are creating their own national taxes specifically targeting big digital firms.
Britain, France and Spain are going ahead with such plans, while the broader European Union is struggling to agree a bloc-wide levy by March.

929,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: Traders Hit Brakes on Harley-Davidson After Sales Slip,"Investing.com - Harley-Davidson skidded Tuesday, dragging consumer discretionary stocks through the mud, after rolling out fourth-quarter results that fell short of estimates.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.17, below consensus of $0.28, and revenues of $956 million missed expectations. Its shares fell 7%.
Worldwide retail sales of motorcycles fell 6.1% to 228,000 for 2018 from a year earlier, as a 10% slump in U.S. sales weighed.
The motorcycle manufacturer expects to ship 217,000 to 222,000 motorcycles this year, after bike shipments dropped to 229,000 in 2018.
Analysts flagged the ongoing drop in the company's U.S. retail sales as a concern and warned there's more road for further downside.
""U.S. retail sales continued its downward trajectory and remains a source of concern,"" Stifel said. The company's 2019 shipment guidance implies levels not seen since 2009-2010 and will likely drag estimates lower, it added.
Harley's downbeat results kept the consumer discretionary sector in the red even as Whirlpool rallied on fourth-quarter quarterly results.
Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) rose 8%, shrugging off a dour outlook on full-year earnings. The major appliance manufacturer's fourth-quarter earnings topped expectations, but revenue fell short as sales declined in Latin America and the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.
The company reported earnings of $4.75 a share, above expectations for $4.24. But revenue of $5.66 billion missed consensus of $5.76 billion.
The company guided full-year earnings in a range of $14 to $15, below Wall Street estimates for $15.99, citing cost inflation, currency headwinds and a higher tax rate.
Analysts said they continue to see more pain ahead for the appliance maker in the wake of slowing U.S. housing market and a global economy expected to weaken in 2019.
""On today's call, Whirlpool did not address a more uncertain and slowing global economy, but it is reflected in earnings guidance,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>",PG&E files for bankruptcy as California wildfire liabilities loom,"By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - PG&E Corp, owner of the largest U.S. power utility, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in anticipation of liabilities in excess of $30 billion from the deadliest and most catastrophic wildfires in California's history. 
PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California and employs 24,000 people, vowed to keep the lights on and continue with the critical investments it said were needed in its system's safety and maintenance.
""The power and gas will stay on ... We are not 'going out of business,' and there will be no disruption in the services you expect from us,"" interim Chief Executive John Simon said in a letter to customers. 
PG&E faced no immediate cash crunch. Its decision to file for bankruptcy was driven by its assessment of upcoming legal liabilities. While state investigators cleared PG&E this month of liability in a 2017 wildfire in California's wine country, the company is expected to be found liable for a fire that killed at least 86 people in northern California in November.
The San Francisco-based company faces lawsuits from owners of homes and businesses that burned during that and other fires. Filing for bankruptcy temporarily shields PG&E from these claims, allowing it to negotiate settlements in bankruptcy court.
PG&E's decision to proactively file for bankruptcy, however, attracted criticism from some California politicians, shareholders and wildfire victim advocates. California Senate President Toni Atkins called PG&E's decision disappointing and said the bankruptcy was not the optimum solution for Californians.
""That was PG&E's choice but it does not change my focus, which remains protecting the best interests of the people of California,"" Gavin Newsom, who took office as governor of California earlier this month, said in a statement. 
BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, an investment firm that owns about 2 percent of PG&E, called the company's decision ""reckless"" and detrimental to shareholders. It has vowed to launch a proxy contest next month to replace PG&E's board directors.
PG&E's shares jumped on Tuesday despite the bankruptcy filing as investors speculated over how much equity holders will be able to recover. 
PG&E listed assets of $71.39 billion and liabilities of $51.69 billion as of Sept. 30 in the voluntary Chapter 11 document filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, indicating that its equity would likely retain at least some of its value. 
PG&E's shares were trading up 14 percent at $13.69 on afternoon trading, giving the company a market value of $7.1 billion. Still, the stock remains down close to 80 percent since October, before the latest round of wildfires broke. PG&E had said earlier this month it was preparing for bankruptcy.
PG&E is seeking court approval for $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing from J.P. Morgan, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Citi, and other banks, it said. The sum is roughly equal to PG&E's annual spending.
PG&E also carries a debt load of more than $18 billion. Company advisers expect that it may take two years or more to emerge from bankruptcy.
IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
An arcane California legal rule, known as ""inverse condemnation,"" exposes California utilities to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved.
This has raised concerns among some PG&E investors that exiting bankruptcy could take longer if there were more wildfires, a real threat given that climate change has turned the blazes into an annual occurrence. 
Investors in other utilities are fretting, as well, about the potential impact of climate change. Shares of Rosemead, California-based Edison International (NYSE:EIX), for example, are down 20 percent since the November wildfires. 
Another issue at stake is PG&E's contracts for renewable power. These are critical for California, which last year delivered 33 percent of its energy from renewable sources and has a goal to source 60 percent of its power from renewables by 2030. PG&E has more than 250 contracts for renewable power that represent $57 billion in investment, it said last month.
Federal energy regulators said on Friday they had joint jurisdiction with a bankruptcy court over requests to cancel or renegotiate power contracts by PG&E.
Last year, lawmakers gave PG&E permission to raise rates to cover wildfire losses from 2017. But elected officials have shown little appetite for new rate hikes or other maneuvers to prevent a bankruptcy filing. 

This is the second bankruptcy for PG&E in as many decades. Its subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Company filed for bankruptcy in 2001, at the height of California's energy crisis. It exited bankruptcy three years later.

Prudential said its retirement business holds more than $445 billion in retirement account values as of Sept. 30. It makes more than $10 billion in pension payments to more than 1 million retirees annually.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Tokyo Gas CEO says to step up overseas LNG investment,"By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese gas distributor Tokyo Gas will target investment in overseas infrastructure projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable energy to boost its offshore earnings, its chief executive said.
The country's biggest city gas seller and major buyer of LNG plans to leverage its links with foreign partners or team up with other Japanese companies to chase deals, President & CEO Takashi Uchida said.
""We want to make an aggressive investment in Southeast Asia and North America this year to expand our LNG value chain,"" Uchida told Reuters in an interview this week.
Under a three-year business plan that kicked off last April, Tokyo Gas plans to spend 260 billion yen ($2.4 billion) to boost its earnings from abroad to 20 percent of its targeted operating profit of 130 billion yen in the year to March 2021.
In the year to March 2018, earnings outside of Japan accounted for about 5.8 percent of its group operating profit of 116.3 billion yen.
""Since we have struggled to win any major overseas deals through auctions last year, we plan to seek one-on-one deals through our foreign partners or join forces with other Japanese companies,"" he said.
Tokyo Gas is eyeing LNG import terminal projects in the Philippines and Vietnam. 
The company also wants to proactively seek new deals in renewable energy, such as offshore wind power, Uchida said, as it aims to raise its equity interests in renewable energy to 600,000 kilowatts abroad by the mid-2020s from zero now.
SAVINGS ON LNG
In an effort to diversify procurement sources and reduce costs, Tokyo Gas last year signed non-binding contracts to buy LNG from Anadarko Petroleum's Mozambique project, Royal Dutch Shell's LNG Canada project and Sempra Energy's Energia Costa Azul LNG project in Mexico.
""Given the soft LNG market, we were able to win those new deals that were more beneficial to us than the existing contracts,"" Uchida said.
""We have not abandoned our goal to raise short-term and spot LNG purchases, but we can derive good terms for long-term contracts under the current market circumstances.""
Uchida said Tokyo Gas' tie-up with Britain's  Centrica  (LON:CNA) in LNG procurement from Mozambique was an example of winning more flexibility from sellers.
Japan's Fair Trade Commission in 2017 ruled that destination restrictions that prevent the reselling of contracted LNG cargoes breach competition rules. 
""Some suppliers have relaxed destination restrictions over the existing contracts,"" he said.
Asked whether Tokyo Gas may scrap a new 2 gigawatt coal-fired power station project in Chiba, near Tokyo, Uchida said: ""We are still assessing with Kyushu Electric Power and Idemitsu Kosan whether it is economically feasible.""
""We will make a decision by the end of March,"" he said, adding that the partners may consider an LNG-fired plant if the coal-fired power plan is scrapped.

""We want to be the most profitable vehicle player and to have access to all global profit pools and do this in a smart way,"" Traton chief executive Andreas Renschler said at the company's capital markets day in London.
Renschler told investors he wanted to expand into new profit pools using alliances like those with Navistar and Sinotruk.
""We want to develop this with our partner into a new dimension,"" Renschler said.
Traton had already struck a partnership in the area of procurement with Japan's Hino, which is also a partner for developing alternative powertrains, Renschler said. 
""This is a great platform for future development.""

""Our strategic target is to achieve a 9 percent return on sales over the cycle,"" Renschler said of Traton's profit target.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>","New boss, familiar strategy in sight for insurer Aviva","By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Two insiders are favorites to be the next CEO of  Aviva  (LON:AV) according to sources, potentially disappointing some expectations for a major strategic re-think at Britain's second biggest insurer. 
Andy Briggs, head of the company's UK insurance business, or Maurice Tulloch, who leads its international insurance arm, are frontrunners to land the job, which one source said was expected to be decided by the board on Feb. 4.
Aviva's decision in October to replace chief executive Mark Wilson prompted analysts and investors to speculate this might mean a major shift from the company's ""composite"" model under which it sells everything from life to car insurance. 
That broad strategy has so far failed to deliver the same shareholder returns as more focused rivals like  Prudential  (LON:PRU) and Legal and General.
Some in the market had speculated Wilson's exit could spur more radical change, such as hiving off general insurance, selling off closed life insurance books or by reassessing the international businesses.
But Briggs and Tulloch are seen, in the short-term at least, as being committed to the status quo. The pair, both board members, are currently running the company, in conjunction with Chairman Adrian Montague and Chief Financial Officer Tom Stoddard.
Aviva declined to comment. 
Salvatore Cavallaro of executive search firm Spencer Stuart, hired by Aviva to find the new CEO, said the process was ongoing but declined to comment further. 
External candidates who have been considered include Bruce Hemphill, who oversaw the break-up last year of Old Mutual, the Anglo-South African financial services group, and former Lloyd's of London commercial insurance market boss Inga Beale, four sources said.
CHANGE
Aviva, with a market capitalization of around 16.8 billion pounds ($22.06 billion), is second only to Prudential in size, but has a much larger proportion of its business - around 60 percent of revenues - in Brexit-bound Britain, which is run by Briggs.
Tulloch's focus, meanwhile, has been on general insurance. He is currently based in Canada and is also chairman of Aviva's global insurance business. 
Of the two, Briggs would be the person least likely to change things dramatically, one industry source said, whereas Tulloch may put more emphasis on non-life, as he has been in that area longer.
""He's from Canada which has had a few issues in more recent years, and maybe offers a fresher face with a number of different ideas."" 
The company has previously flagged higher auto insurance claims in Canada as one factor impacting group performance.
Unlike its UK rivals, Aviva has a much broader array of insurance products, similar to European insurers Allianz (DE:ALVG), AXA and Generali (MI:GASI), banking on selling each customer more than one product - something most companies have struggled to do at scale.
""There's not a huge amount of cross-selling between life and general insurance,"" said Paul De'Ath, analyst at Shore Capital. ""In theory it should work. In practice there has not been a huge amount of evidence that it has helped.""
The emphasis on cross-selling may have been a factor contributing to the company's long-term underperformance against rivals, which hastened the demise of Wilson. 
Since a post-financial crisis low in 2009, Aviva's shares have risen around 150 percent while shares in rival Legal & General have risen ten times as much.
As a result, whoever gets the top job will have to consider if there is a need to change tack.
But one investor who has spoken to the board said it was focused on improving on the current strategy's execution and explaining its success to the market more effectively rather than wholesale change.
A second investor said Wilson had led a broad restructuring of the company through selling non-core operations, particularly overseas, and cutting debt. But this investor also said the problem that the stock market had had with Aviva was one of lack of growth and that Wilson struggled to change that perception.

""This is something the new CEO will need to address ... the company does have growth – Canada, UK pensions etc. Let's see that showcased.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's bankruptcy court said on Tuesday creditors could reject a $7.5 billion offer from the owners of debt-stricken Essar Steel to settle the company's debts, giving a boost to global steel giant ArcelorMittal's bid to takeover the plant.
The settlement proposal presented to the consortium of lenders by the billionaire Ruia family was not ""maintainable"", and it would not be illegal for the banks to reject the offer, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) said, according to television news channels.
An appellate court had asked the NCLT to rule on Essar Steel - one of the biggest defaulters in India's $150 billion mountain of bad loans - by Jan. 31.
Lawyers said, however, that the actual intent of the ruling could only be understood in its entirety after a copy of the order has been seen, and that based on procedures the Ruia family could potentially appeal the decision.
While any appeal could further draw out the protracted case, the ruling gives a shot in the arm to foreign investors, who had been getting impatient with India's lengthy bad loan resolution process.
""We hope now for a swift resolution to this case,"" ArcelorMittal said in a statement, adding the tribunal ruling was a positive development for India's bankruptcy process.
The resolution process for Essar Steel has taken more than 500 days so far, well beyond the 270-day limit stipulated under India's two-and-a-half year-old bankruptcy law.
The bid for Essar Steel's assets has seen several back and forths in the tribunal courts since it was admitted into bankruptcy, with global and Indian steel majors and financial investors vying for the company.
In October, creditors of Essar Steel, which has a 10 million tonnes steel plant in western India, approved a 420 billion rupees ($5.9 billion) joint bid from ArcelorMittal and Japan's Nippon & Sumitomo Metal Corp as the final offer for the debt-laden company.
However, Essar Steel made a higher offer of 543.89 billion rupees to creditors to settle their claims.
In a statement after the ruling Essar said its offer was ""the most compelling proposal available to Essar Steel creditors"".

Power, LMC","(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in January are expected to fall about 1 percent from the same month in 2018, partly due to uncertainty around government shutdown causing some customers to delay purchases, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
Total vehicle sales in January are estimated to be about 1,141,300 vehicles, the consultancies said on Tuesday.
""In addition to the disruption from inclement weather, the uncertainty of the government shutdown also caused some customers to delay their purchases,"" said Thomas King, senior vice-president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Retail sales are expected to fall 2.4 percent to 864,300 vehicles in January, while the overall total seasonally adjusted annualized rate for vehicles is expected to be about 16.8 million vehicles, down 2.3 percent from a year ago.
This would be the third consecutive year where retail sales are expected to show declines at the start of the year, according to the consultancies.
The average transaction price, however, is expected to be about $33,285 in January, compared with the previous high of $32,313 a year ago.
Incentive spending per unit in January is expected to be about $3,720, down from $3,856 during the same period a year ago, J.D. Power and LMC said.
The consultancies also forecast 2019 total light-vehicle sales to fall 1.9 percent to about 17 million vehicles, compared to 2018.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 09:07AM ET</span>","Lockheed Martin forecasts 2019 profit below estimates, shares off","By Rama Venkat Raman and Mike Stone
(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), the Pentagon's top weapons supplier, on Tuesday forecast 2019 profit below estimates and reported that quarterly margins slipped at the unit that makes the radar-evading F-35 fighter jet and C-130 transport plane.
The company's shares fell nearly 2.4 percent in premarket trading.
Lockheed expects full-year profit to range between $19.15 and $19.45 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $19.55, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Lockheed and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to benefit from stronger global demand for fighter jets and munitions and higher U.S. defense budgets in fiscal 2020.
During the fourth quarter, Lockheed's order backlog grew 19 percent to $130.5 billion from $109 billion. 
The company finished the year delivering 91 F-35 jets in 2018, up from 66 jets a year earlier. Lockheed has said it aims to deliver more than 130 F-35s in 2019. 
Operating margins at the aeronautics division, its biggest, fell to 10.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 11.6 percent a year earlier. The company said the miss was due to lower volume on the C-130 transport aircraft program. Operating margins measure how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales. 
The company earned $4.39 per share from continuing operations, just short of estimates of $4.40 per share.
Net sales rose 4.1 percent to $14.41 billion.

During the quarter Lockheed had an effective tax rate of 13.6 percent which gave it a full-year tax rate of 15.5 percent following corporate tax reform in the United States.

The drugmaker, along with partner Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) & Co, also reported data from a late-stage trial of painkiller tanezumab, that some analysts said could raise safety concerns.
Pfizer has outlined tanezumab, an experimental non-opioid drug for osteoarthritis pain, as one of its blockbuster drugs it intends to win approval for within five years.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said the 2019 forecast, along with the data on tanezumab that will likely not ease any outstanding safety concerns on the drug, will lead to some pressure on Pfizer shares.
The stock was down 3 percent in trading before the opening bell.
To counter revenue loss from generic competition to Lyrica, the largest U.S. drugmaker has been investing heavily in its portfolio of cancer treatments and expects to gain approval for a new heart drug later this year.
The drugmaker's robust pipeline is seen by analysts as key to helping it ride out upcoming patent expirations and fighting increased competition from cheaper generics.
In the quarter, sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance rose 58 percent to $1.13 billion, helped by demand in Europe, but came in slightly below the consensus estimate of $1.16 billion, according to Credit Suisse.
In the fourth quarter, Lyrica brought in quarterly sales of $1.32 billion, compared with a consensus estimate of $1.21 billion.
The company earned 64 cents per share excluding items, just above the average analyst estimate of 63 cents per share.
Revenue rose about 2 percent to $13.98 billion, also beating the estimate of $13.90 billion.
Pfizer forecast 2019 adjusted earnings of $2.82 to $2.92 per share and revenue of $52 billion to $54 billion.
The outlook includes a $2.6 billion hit from patent expirations and about $1 billion from forex losses, the company said.

Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.04 per share and revenue of $54.25 billion.

The company said it had held discussions with other firms, but did not get financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer.
Shares of the company surged 16 percent in September, when media reports said GameStop hired Perella Weinburg to explore a sale.
Like most brick-and-mortar retailers, GameStop has suffered from heightened competition from online companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Game retailers have also had to cope with a decline in physical video game sales, although GameStop has partly weathered these declines by expanding into used video games and devices as well as digital products. 
GameStop sold its Spring Mobile business to Prime Communications LP for $700 million in November.
The company's board is still looking for a permanent chief executive officer, it said.
In May, CEO Michael Mauler stepped down from his post after only three months on the job, citing personal reasons. In June, the company brought on board former Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox executive and board director Shane Kim as interim CEO.

DUBAI/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Union National Bank and Al Hilal Bank agreed a merger on Tuesday to create the third-largest bank in the United Arab Emirates.
The bank will become the fifth largest in the GCC with 420 billion UAE dirham ($114.35 billion) in assets with increased productivity and economies of scale expected to boost profitability, the statement said.
Lower oil prices and weak economic growth is pushing consolidation across the Gulf.
The merger, first announced in September, was unanimously recommended to shareholders by the boards of ADCB and UNB, the banks said in a joint statement. 
The tie-up is expected to take effect in the first half of 2019.
It will involve a statutory merger between ADCB and UNB. ADCB will issue 0.5966 shares for every UNB share, corresponding to a total of 1.64 billion new shares issued to UNB shareholders and valuing UNB at nearly $4 billion. 
Al Hilal Bank will operate as a separate Islamic entity within the merged bank. 
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan said in a tweet that the merger would bolster the competitiveness of the UAE's economy. 
UAE has 50 commercial banks including 22 local lenders, a number seen as too high in a country of about 9.5 million people. 
Saudi Arabia, which has a population of 32 million, has 12 banks and is set to lose two of those if announced mergers are successfully concluded.
""The Abu Dhabi government is continuing its restructuring efforts to create stronger entities with a strong financial base to grow globally,"" said Tariq Qaqish, managing director of asset management at Menacorp.
Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), a government investment arm, is the majority shareholder in ADCB and UNB, both listed in Abu Dhabi. Unlisted Al Hilal is wholly owned by ADIC, which is now part of Mubadala Investment Company.
On the date the merger takes effect UNB shares will be delisted from the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, with the combined bank retaining ADCB's identity and legal registrations.
The combined entity will acquire Al Hilal Bank for 1 billion dirhams ($272 million) by issuing a mandatory convertible note for up to 117.6 million post-merger ADCB shares to ADIC.
""UNB has a weaker asset quality and much lower profitability than ADCB, and both (of these factors) have been taken into consideration to arrive at the swap ratio,"" said analyst Chiro Ghosh at Bahrain’s SICO.
""It definitely presents a strong case for further consolidation. We believe banks with similar shareholders have a higher likelihood of merger,"" Ghosh said.
ADCB on Tuesday also reported annual profit of 4.84 billion dirhams, up from 4.28 billion a year earlier.
After completion of the merger, ADIC will own 60.2 percent of the combined bank, other ADCB shareholders owning 28.0 percent and other UNB shareholders holding 11.8 percent. 
As reported by Reuters on Monday, Eissa Mohamed al Suwaidi, chairman of ADCB, will retain the same post at the new bank, as will ADCB CEO Ala'a Eraiqat.

(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday amid a prolonged struggle to revive demand for its bikes in the United States where sales dived yet again, sending its shares down over 6 percent.
The Milwaukee-based company reported an adjusted profit of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected the profit to come in at $0.28 per share.
Revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 8.7 percent to $955.6 million.
Retail sales in the United States, which accounts for more than half of the company's sales, fell 10.1 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, more than the 8.3 percent decline expected by analysts.
Harley's demographic challenges in the domestic market are well documented - core customers are growing older and outreach efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results.
To offset weak demand in the domestic market, it is trying to grow sales overseas. However, those efforts have yet to bear fruits as sales in foreign markets fell 2.6 percent in the latest quarter from a year ago.
After missing its shipments guidance last year, Harley expects to ship up to 222,000 motorcycles globally this year, its lowest in eight years.
Analysts on average were expecting 2019 shipments of 228,190 motorcycles, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.
To woo the next generation of riders, the company is betting on the small but growing market for electric bikes. Its LiveWire electric bike is now available for pre-order in the United States at a price of $29,799, with delivery expected this fall.
But with electric motorcycles available at around $10,000, along with a worsening outlook for the economy and rising interest rates, the bike might not be affordable for many riders.
While the pricing strategy is aimed at retaining Harley's ""premium"" tag as well as preserving profit margins, analysts and some dealers reckon it is hurting sales.
A recent dealer survey by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) found demand for used, cheaper bikes are growing at the expense of newer ones.
Against this backdrop, President Donald Trump's call to boycott the motorcycle manufacturer for its decision to move production for European markets overseas has only compounded the company's troubles.

The company's shares have fallen about 30 percent since the beginning of 2018. The stock was last trading down 6.6 percent at $34.2 in premarket hours.

Neuberger Berman Group and Legal & General Investment Management are among those defying Wall Street warnings to snap up the volatile, debt-ridden stocks and exploit what may turn out to be the bull-market’s last gasp.
So far, so good. The Russell 2000 Index is up 9.3 percent this year compared to 5.5 percent for the S&P 500 Index, as they emerge as January’s leaders.
Now, their performance is set to deliver a test of the rally’s strength as earnings season gathers pace.
Small stocks have proven a reliable compass for the wider market: They signaled the bottoms for the S&P 500 in 2011 and 2015, and then led large caps out of their troughs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.
“From here, market participants know that a late-cycle melt-up is always a possibility,” said Erik Knutzen, co-chair of the asset allocation committee at Neuberger Berman. He boosted allocation to U.S. small- and mid-caps to overweight from neutral at the start of the year, as part of the $300-billion asset manager’s push into risk.
A melt-down is also a possibility, one entertained by believers of the “January effect” that says investors starting the year in a buying mood push up prices of the riskiest stocks. Big headwinds for smaller companies -- 40 percent of which are still in cash-burn mode -- are gathering in slumping earnings estimates, a slowing global economy, and rising rates.
Legal & General’s multi-factor team started buying small-cap shares last week as many peers hunker in blue-chips in anticipation of the next downturn. While U.S. large-cap stock funds added $400 million of cash in the week through Jan. 23, just $28 million went into small caps.
“Size is relatively attractive on the valuation front and investors seem to focus more on the large stocks,” said Andrzej Pioch, a money manager at the firm, which oversees 985 billion pounds ($1.3 trillion). “We would normally consider the market sentiment as the contrarian indicator, making us more comfortable about small caps.""
They also offer tantalizing valuations. December’s sell-off has swollen the premium of the Russell 3000 Index over Russell 2000 to the highest since at least 2006.
“The market dislocation in the fourth quarter created value opportunities that are attractive despite the elevated risk,” said Olivia Engel, the chief investment officer for active quantitative equities at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. She’s eyeing some beaten-up small-caps, especially utilities with track records of decent earnings, but so far hasn’t added to her holdings.
According to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s January survey, 48 percent of investors still expect large-cap stocks to outperform small caps, but that’s down from 55 percent in December.
“If you think markets can go up, small caps give you more exposure and more contribution to this upward potential,” said Thorsten Paarmann, a quant portfolio manager at Invesco Asset Management.
Yet strategists at UBS Group AG and BofA say it’s not the time to be tempted by small caps and advise investors stick to safer bets in blue-chips.
“Ultimately we find sentiment-reversal rallies are short-lived,” said Manish Kabra, head of European equity and quantitative strategy at BofA. Small-cap performance will suffer in “a material slowdown in profit growth” this year, he said.
So far, fourth-quarter earnings in the U.S. have been mixed, with 57 percent of companies beating sales expectations, but with major companies like  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) disappointing analysts. The U.S. economic expansion is also expected to be less robust this year, while the partial government shutdown is likely to have sapped growth in the first quarter, according to the latest forecasts from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc.
In this uncertain environment, Irina Sidorovitch, head of quantitative portfolio management equities at DWS Group, is focusing on small-cap firms with better quality characteristics.
“Small caps have a higher sensitivity to the risk perception in the market,” she said. “Our portfolios traditionally have some tilt towards smaller-cap companies because they have higher growth expectations and alpha opportunities.”

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The trade war between Washington and Beijing is forcing Dutch health technology company Philips to move ""hundreds of millions"" of euros worth of production from the United States to China, and vice versa, to avoid punitive tariffs.
""This is not peanuts"", Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters on Tuesday. 
""These are serious changes to our supply chains,"" he said, adding the switches would take place in the first half of 2019. 
Philips, whose healthcare products range from high-tech toothbrushes to medical imaging systems, stuck to an earlier prediction that increased trade tariffs would cut around 60 million euros ($69 million) from core profits this year.
But the effects of the trade war go beyond tariffs, the CEO said, as it is hitting consumer confidence in China, slowing demand for consumer healthcare products in the world's second-largest economy.
Philips' sales in China will continue to grow in 2019, however, Van Houten said, as strong demand for hospital equipment will outweigh the weakness of the consumer market.
Overall, Philips held on to its target for total comparable sales growth of 4 to 6 percent per year until 2020. 
HIGHER SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
Strong demand for hospital equipment in China, Latin America and Europe helped Philips beat analysts' forecasts in the last quarter of 2018, as comparable sales rose 5 percent and core profit (adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased 10 percent to 971 million euros.
Together with a 6 percent dividend hike and a new 1.5 billion euros share buyback plan, this lifted Philips shares 1.8 percent to 32.89 euros at 0930 GMT.
""On headline numbers, Philips reported a decent update"", ING analyst Marc Hesselink wrote in a note. ""Underlying, the quality of the beat was lower (as) Connected Care & Healthcare Informatics was, like previous quarters, well below expectations.""
Rival Siemens Healthineers said on Tuesday it would take steps to raise profitability at its diagnostics unit after lengthy installation times for its new Atellica blood and urine testing machines hit profit at the division.
Philips reported comparable sales growth of 3 to 5 percent for its two largest businesses, which make hospital equipment and personal healthcare products. Sales of its connected care division, which specializes in remote patient monitoring, were flat.
Philips expects rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases to lead to growing demand for devices that allow patients to stay at home, while their data is monitored.
But Van Houten in November said demand for such products would remain modest in 2019.

The company is streamlining its business and scaling operations under a new management backed by activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason while cutting costs to compete with smartphones which have reduced the need for printing.
Xerox had agreed to merge with its long-standing joint-venture with Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp last year, but that deal was scrapped under pressure from investors Icahn and Deason, and control was handed over to a new management under Icahn-aide Visentin. 
Net income attributable to Xerox was $137 million, or 56 cents per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $190 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue fell 7.8 percent to $2.53 billion, missing estimates of $2.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.14 per share beating estimates of $1.04, helped by 5 percent drop in total costs.

The Justice Department charged Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Monday, alleging the company stole trade secrets and evaded economic sanctions on Iran.
The news will overshadow trade talks between the U.S. and China, which are scheduled to begin on Wednesday. While the Chinese government is keen to avoid any further pressure on its slowing economy from new U.S. sanctions, any concessions so soon after the Huawei charges would require it to lose considerable face, both at home and abroad.

All three indexes tumbled on Monday after profit warnings from  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with both companies citing slowing Chinese demand.
Earnings season continues on Tuesday, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) out after the markets close. Investors will be watching closely for further signs of slowing growth, after the company warned it would miss its revenue target for the quarter due to weak Chinese sales.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) are expected to report before the market opens.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",Europe's listed firms expect to glean $521 billion in revenue from China,"By Helen Reid and Lea Desrayaud
LONDON (Reuters) - European listed firms expect to receive 456 billion euros ($521 billion) in total revenue from China in 2019, with luxury brands and automakers the most exposed sectors, a Refinitiv analysis of company data shows.
The data underscores the role China's burgeoning middle class is increasingly playing in determining the corporate and economic health of Europe, as concerns grow that their spending has slowed as Chinese economic growth cools.
Among the pan-European STOXX 600 index, consumer firms including Swatch, Richemont and BMW, derived the biggest chunk of revenues from China - with a total of 127 billion euros ($145 billion) sales from the country, the analysis based on companies' estimates of their 2019 revenue shows.
That is nearly a third of the estimated 456 billion euros in total revenue to be derived from China. The total 2019 revenue for Europe's listed firms is 6.7 trillion euros, meaning China accounts for about 7 percent overall.
Energy and basic materials companies are among the biggest recipients of revenues from China, the world's biggest consumer of metals, and the most exposed.
More than half of BHP Group's annual revenue comes from China, while  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) relies on China for 44 percent of its revenue.
China's fourth-quarter growth data topped off a year of figures showing a serious slowdown, confirming that 2018 was its worst year for GDP growth since 1990 amid an ongoing trade dispute with the United States which has dented global growth.
The world's top two economies will try to agree a truce to end the spat with the latest round trade talks which are due to kick off in Washington on Wednesday.

1004,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Message to World With Huawei Case: Don’t Trust China on 5G,"(Bloomberg) -- None of the scores of pages of U.S. indictments handed down Monday against Huawei Technologies Co. explicitly mentioned anything about 5G networks or China’s spy agency.
But they sent a clear message to world leaders weighing whether to use Huawei equipment for next-generation wireless networks connecting everything from phones to cars to supertankers: China’s largest technology company is a threat to national security.
“They aren’t just going after the notion that there is hard evidence of previous spying,” said Graham Webster, a fellow at Washington-based research group New America who studies China’s digital economy. “They are trying to undermine trust in Huawei overall, saying that this company cannot be trusted in your infrastructure.”
The case is a further sign that wider strategic tensions between the world’s two largest economies will persist even if they reach a deal to end a months-long trade war that is starting to hit global growth and company earnings. That may be harder now as Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top economic aide visits Washington this week for talks to stave off more tariff increases.
The indictments intensify the spotlight on Huawei, which has come to symbolize China’s economic rise and challenge to the U.S.’s status as the world’s top superpower. In particular, the decision to prosecute Meng Wanzhou -- daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei -- has riled Beijing and increased concerns around the globe of a new Cold War.
For Huawei, the indictments couldn’t come at a worse time. Since Meng -- Huawei’s chief financial officer -- was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 after a U.S. request, the company has struggled to convince the world its equipment won’t be used for espionage. This month, Poland arrested one of its employees for spying, prompting Huawei to disavow any responsibility for his actions.
Ren, Huawei’s founder and CEO, used a rare press appearance this month at its Shenzhen headquarters to insist the company doesn’t help Beijing spy.
“I love my country, I support the Communist Party, but I will not do anything to harm the world,’’ Ren said. On Tuesday, Huawei issued a statement saying once again it had done nothing wrong in either case.
The indictments are a direct attack on Huawei’s credibility.
In one, the U.S. alleges that Ren and Meng misrepresented Huawei’s business with Iran to the American government and four financial institutions since 2007, in violation of American sanctions. The indictment also accused the company of destroying evidence once it became aware of the U.S. investigation.
The other set of charges cite emails between Huawei USA and China to show how engineers conspired to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile USA Inc. The documents cite emails from employees in China who repeatedly pressed their colleagues to collect key information on “Tappy,” a robot used to test mobile phones that Huawei wanted for its own use.
When T-Mobile complained about the attempted theft, Huawei allegedly covered up the matter with a faulty internal investigation and blamed rogue employees for any wrongdoing. In fact, Huawei had set up an internal committee that handed out monthly bonuses to employees who stole the most valuable IP from competitors, the suit alleges. Twice a year, special bonuses were paid to employees from three regions who had collected especially important confidential information.
“Employees were directed to post confidential information obtained from other companies on an internal Huawei website, or, in the case of especially sensitive information, to send an encrypted email to a special email inbox,” the indictment says.
Taken together, the charges bolster the Trump administration’s case that Huawei is operating at the behest of the Chinese government. While there’s no explicit evidence that the company’s products are compromised, it’s very difficult to know for sure -- a risk the U.S. argues is too big for critical infrastructure like 5G.
Already Australia and New Zealand have joined the U.S. in keeping Huawei out of its 5G networks. Other countries like Canada, the U.K., Germany and France have yet to make a decision.
It’s not an easy choice. On the commercial side, Huawei presents a cheaper option than its competitors: The company said it has already won more than 30 5G contracts globally, including 18 from European countries. Australia’s TPG Telecom Ltd. on Tuesday pulled the plug on plans to build the country’s fourth mobile network, saying it no longer made financial sense after the government banned Huawei.
“Because the global market is now deeply consolidated and Huawei enjoys a lead in technology and solutions, I don’t think the recent news about the company will impact Huawei’s 5G deployment -- both in China and abroad,” said Bing Duan, an analyst with Nomura Asset Management.
‘Cannot Be Naive’
Even more than current technology, control over 5G networks could allow an enemy to wreak mass industrial sabotage and social collapse, according to U.S. officials. This week the European Union’s digital chief Andrus Ansip urged companies to reconsider partnerships with Chinese companies due to an intelligence law that mandates any organization and citizen to assist Beijing’s spy agencies with investigations.
“We cannot be naive anymore,” he said.
China’s government sees the charges as part of a bigger U.S. plan to hold back the world’s second-biggest economy. On Tuesday, the foreign ministry in Beijing urged the U.S. to revoke Meng’s arrest warrant and stop its “unreasonable crackdown” on Chinese companies.
“For some time now, the United States has used its national power to smear and attack specific Chinese enterprises in an attempt to stifle their legitimate operations,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement. “There are strong political attempts and manipulation behind this.”
‘Tech War’
China has threatened countermeasures against governments that ban Huawei, and detained two Canadians on espionage charges -- a move that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government saw as retaliation for Meng’s arrest. Those actions have only helped confirm the links between Huawei and the government, according to a European diplomat in Beijing who asked not to be identified.
The battle over Huawei and 5G is only part of the fight. The U.S. is also looking to curb China’s “Made in China 2025” plan to dominate other vital technologies, from robotics to new-energy vehicles to biotechnology, as part of its trade war.
“The tech war between the U.S. and China is going to intensify over the course of this year,” David Loevinger, a former Treasury official who is now a managing director at TCW, a Los Angeles based asset manager, said on Bloomberg Television. “And it’s not just legal actions against Chinese firms and Chinese executives: We’re going to see much broader restrictions on exports of technology to China and much broader restrictions on Chinese investment in the tech sector.”

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:52AM ET</span>",SAP plans restructuring after signs of weakness emerge,"By Douglas Busvine
WALLDORF, Germany (Reuters) - SAP will take a restructuring charge of up to 950 million euros ($1 billion) to reshape its business after growth slowed in parts of the software maker over the last three months.
SAP, Europe's most valuable technology company, will reassign some employees and offer early retirement to others, but still expects its overall head count to exceed 100,000 by the end of 2019, up from 96,500 at the turn of the year.
""This is not a cost-cutting move. We are a growth company,"" Chief Executive Bill McDermott told Reuters in an interview at SAP's sprawling campus in Walldorf.
Around 4,400 people would leave under the restructuring, CFO Luka Mucic said. He added that SAP remained committed to its headquarters in the small town of Walldorf in southwest Germany.
SAP will take charges of 800 to 950 million euros, mainly in the first quarter. It sees a minor cost benefit in 2019 and savings of 750 to 850 million euros from 2020.
The shakeup comes as SAP announced an 11 percent increase in 2018 non-IFRS revenues, at constant currencies, that beat its thrice-raised guidance. Operating profits rose 10 percent, in line with SAP's own expectations. 
Yet key indicators showed signs of weakness in the fourth quarter, with growth in new cloud bookings slowing to 23 percent from 37 percent in the third quarter.
Underlying non-IFRS operating margins, at constant currency, were squeezed by 1.5 percentage points in the quarter to 33.2 percent as SAP implemented hyperinflation accounting for crisis-hit markets in Latin America such as Venezuela.
Mucic noted that margins were stable at 28.8 percent for 2018 as a whole following years of declines as the company invested in its transformation. ""Now we are at the point where we can start to see rising margins,"" he told a news conference.
The figures illustrated the challenge that SAP continues to face as it makes the transition from its traditional model of running business processes such as finance or logistics at on-premise servers to hosting them in remote datacentres.
The legacy software license business, which generates chunky up-front fees, continues to throw off profits.
Cloud is driving growth, meanwhile, but margins are tighter as SAP seeks scale and competes with rivals such as Salesforce and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), exerting pressure on the overall 'mixed' margin that the company reports.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
McDermott, a 57-year-old American, played down concerns that the weakening global economy and U.S.-China trade frictions might dent SAP's business, saying his company was not as exposed to the economic cycle as technology hardware players.
""We're not seeing that,"" said McDermott, adding that individual risk factors, such as Britain's looming exit from the European Union, were offset by the company's global reach.
Shares were down 1.3 percent at 91.12 euros by 1024 GMT, underperforming the blue-chip DAX index which was broadly unchanged.
""The one surprise for us is the announcement of a major restructuring program in FY19,"" analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said. ""It seems likely that the vast majority (of cost savings) will be reinvested back in the business,"" they said.
SAP, which has just closed its $8 billion takeover of Qualtrics, a U.S. company that tracks customer sentiment online, baked the impact of that deal into raised 2019 revenue guidance of 28.6 to 29.2 billion euros.
But it kept its forecast of non-IFRS operating profit unchanged at 8.5 to 9.0 billion euros, up 7.5 to 11.5 percent year on year.
McDermott said that Qualtrics would add a ""customer experience"" dimension to SAP's core strengths. The combination ""becomes the defining strategy for the winning company in the 21st century"", he said.
Giving its first forecasts for 2023 ahead of a capital markets day in New York on Feb. 7, SAP said it expected to more than triple cloud subscription and support revenues.

Total revenues would reach 35 billion euros and operating profits would outgrow revenues to expand at an annual rate of 7.5 to 10 percent.

Software maker SAP (DE:SAPG), Germany’s most valuable company, set the tone with a sharp slowdown in new cloud bookings in the fourth quarter. It will take a hit of up to 950 million euros this year as part of what it called a “fitness program”.
Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG), one of last year’s biggest European IPOs, fell 4.8% after saying the roll-out of diagnostics business Atellica is costing more than expected.
The U.K.’s  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) fell over 11% after reporting a collapse in snail-mail volumes despite a 10% annual rise in parcel deliveries over the Christmas period.
 Bankia  (MC:BKIA) - Spain’s fourth-largest bank – swung to a loss in the fourth quarter as it hurried to get bad loans off its books. The Spanish government had to put on ice its plans to sell down its 64% stake last month, given the stock’s low valuation.
Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) plummeted another 11% after announcing a $350 million capital increase and abandoning its short-term growth plans. Its shares have fallen nearly 30% in the last week after IAG, (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia, said it wouldn’t make a bid for the struggling low-cost carrier.
Somewhat surprisingly, given all of the above, the Euro Stoxx 50 benchmark is in positive territory. At 05:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT), it was up 0.4% at 3,149.55, driven by Dutch conglomerate Philips (AS:PHG), one of few companies to beat earnings expectations, and a surprisingly strong January consumer confidence report in France. That was at odds with the ongoing negative publicity generated by the ""yellow vests"" protest movement. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold climbed to a seven-month high on Tuesday as markets opted for caution before three major macro events and a blizzard of big tech company earnings in the coming days, starting with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) later. 
Despite the upcoming action - a key Brexit vote in the UK , Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve decision and Thursday's conclusion of the latest Sino-U.S. trade talks - European and Asian stocks held up relatively well. 
London's FTSE rose 1 percent and Frankfurt and Paris both made some ground. Utilities and other safety plays benefited from a series of U.S. profit alerts, including from digger maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), overnight.
News that the U.S had leveled charges against China's telecom giant Huawei days before the next round of trade talks between Washington and Beijing knocked sentiment.
But it was offset by promises of more economic stimulus from China, which had berated Washington on Monday for blocking the appointment of judges for its World Trade Organisation appeal against U.S. tariffs.
Amid the turmoil, gold broke through $1,300 an ounce to reach its highest since mid June. 
""Investors are very cautious with many uncertainties on U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit. Huawei is at the center of dispute, creating very noisy background for the trade talks,"" said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets.
""All these are making it more difficult for investors to judge the market's direction. Money is fleeing into assets such as gold, seeking safety."" ,""
The U.S.-Sino moves, as well as bets that the U.S. Fed will sound more cautious on Wednesday, kept the dollar near a two-week low and heightened the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. 
Sterling held at $1.3166 and 86.88 pence to the euro before crucial votes later in the day aimed at breaking a deadlock in the UK parliament over Brexit .
The pound has rallied 6 percent from Jan. 4 lows, but further gains may be limited unless lawmakers emerge with a big majority on the votes.
Most European government bond yields were little changed. Weaker economic data and unknowns like the trade feuds and Brexit have all boosted expectations that interest rates will stay low. 
New debt deals from Greece, Belgium and Austria were also in the pipeline. The slide in rates has also encouraged governments to launch new bond deals. Even Angola, which has just taken IMF aid, said it was eyeing a bond sale. 
In Asia, shares were mixed, with losses for Australia and New Zealand, with their benchmark indices down 0.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Japanese and Chinese stocks both recovered from early wobbles to finish in the green. 
WARNING BELLS
Markets will have more catalysts this week with over 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq was off more than 1 percent.
The losses came after Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand.
""Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers, and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China's slowdown is for real,"" said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank. 
Worryingly, earnings at China's industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country's vast manufacturing sector, which are already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures.
Oil recovered after overnight losses. U.S. crude was last up 35 cents at $52.34 a barrel; Brent gained 37 cents to $60.30.

Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA on Monday, a step that is likely to curb its crude exports to the U.S. and ratchet up the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.

LONDON (Reuters) - Liquidity, or the ability to buy and sell currencies whenever needed with minimal market impact, is seen by currency traders as the biggest challenge for 2019, according to an annual client survey by JP Morgan published on Tuesday.
The views of the biggest 200 institutional trader clients, mostly focused on the $5.1 trillion a day foreign exchange markets, polled by JP Morgan point to a tricky year ahead. 
As electronic trading platforms have proliferated and banks and investors ramp up the use of complex foreign exchange algorithms, currency markets have become vulnerable to a drop in liquidity, causing sudden episodes of wild market moves.
The most recent example of such ""flash crashes"" was the sharp moves in the Japanese yen at the start of the year, which were seen as exacerbated by a dearth of liquidity with Japan still on holiday, and by automated algorithmic trades carried out by computers in micro seconds.
The availability of trading liquidity tops the list of daily trading issues for JP Morgan's clients, identified by 40 percent of those polled. This was followed by efficiency of trading process.
The implementation of new trading rules in Europe since the start of 2018 has also made the overall liquidity environment slightly more challenging at a time when major central banks are unwinding their multi-year stimulus measures.
The survey also predicted that 80 percent of JP Morgan's clients' trading volume would flow through electronic trading channels by 2020. Trading via algorithms is expected to see a significant jump in coming years, according to the survey.

""With the growth of electronic trading, there is a lot more activity in FX markets and market participants are investing a lot in technology,"" said Scott Wacker, global head of e-commerce sales and marketing at the U.S-based bank.

The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt have imposed a diplomatic, trade and transport boycott of Qatar since June 2017 over allegations Doha supports terrorism, a charge Qatar denies.
Qatar filed in July 2017 a wide-ranging legal complaint at the WTO to challenge the trade boycott by the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The case is still ongoing.
""The UAE's action comes after the Qatari ministry of economy banned the sale of consumer goods manufactured in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt,"" WAM reported.
The report did not state when the complaint was filed. 
Qatari officials were not immediately available for comment on the complaint. 
The UAE said Qatar had also removed the names of Emirati companies from the list of approved vendors for infrastructure projects and has maintained an ""undeclared ban"" on products coming from the Emirates.

Qatar banned products originating from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain, in May 2018.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 03:40AM ET</span>",PG&E Files for Bankruptcy While Facing Billions in Fire Damages,"(Bloomberg) -- A series of devastating wildfires that killed more than 100 people and scorched hundreds of thousands of acres in California over the course of two years just brought one of the nation’s largest utilities to its knees.
(NYSE:PG&E Corp.), California’s biggest power company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Northern California bankruptcy court as investigators probe whether its equipment ignited the deadliest fire in state history. The San Francisco-based company listed more than $50 billion in estimated liabilities. A Chapter 11 filing allows a company to keep operating while it works out a plan to turn the business around and pay off creditors.
California’s wildfires have in the past saddled utilities with millions of dollars in damages, but never have the blazes exacted such a massive financial toll from a company -- creating one of the country’s largest utility bankruptcies of all time. Since November’s Camp fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise, PG&E has seen about three-fourths of its market value wiped out, its chief executive officer leave, its bonds plunge to junk status and estimates of its fire liabilities swell to more than $30 billion.
The only time the company’s ever faced such dire financial straits was during the 2001 energy crisis when it was forced to place its utility unit in bankruptcy protection.
The utility giant’s financial crisis had some of the biggest names in the investment world working up last-minute financing packages that would rescue the company from insolvency to no avail. A consortium including Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. was said to have sent a proposal to PG&E backed by $4 billion of bonds that could convert into shares. At least one other group that included Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC and Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management LLC was said to be pitching a rival plan.
PG&E’s demise serves to underscore the increasing vulnerability utilities face to natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes that are becoming more extreme. That’s especially the case in California, where state law holds utilities liable for damages even if they aren’t found to be negligent.
While the company’s been cleared of fault for the deadliest of the wildfires that devastated California’s wine country in 2017, investigators have tied PG&E’s equipment to more than a dozen of the other fires and are looking at its power lines as a possible ignition source for the Camp Fire, which killed 86.
State officials including Governor Gavin Newsom had said it would be in the state’s best interest to keep the utility healthy and financially viable. PG&E is considered a linchpin in helping achieve California’s ambitious climate goal of getting all its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045. At the same time, Newsom chose not to take measures drastic enough to avoid a bankruptcy filing, and regulators actually began a process to evaluate whether to break up or take over the utility.
A bankruptcy will probably result in higher bills for customers because it will be more expensive for PG&E to borrow the money it needs to make infrastructure investments and keep the lights on. The company supplies natural gas and electricity to about 16 million people in Northern and Central California. PG&E said Jan. 22 it expects the bankruptcy to take about two years to resolve and arranged $5.5 billion to fund its operations during the process.
“With utilities, bankruptcies take multiple years,” Kit Konolige, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview before the filing. “There is no such thing as a quick utility bankruptcy. And it creates a lot of uncertainty for everybody involved.”

S&P Global (China) Ratings, the credit assessor’s Chinese local unit, has already hired 30 analysts at its Beijing office and will open for business soon after ""some preparation,” Simon Jin, the chief executive officer of the unit, said in an interview. China’s interbank bond market represents over 95 percent of the market size and trading volume, according to Pacific Investment Management Co. in August. The nation also has a relatively small exchange-traded note market.
The People’s Bank of China gave S&P the green light for the firm to rate Chinese local bonds, according to a a statement on Monday, which didn’t mention Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. The move is to meet foreign investors’ demand for various yuan-denominated assets and improve credit rating quality in the domestic market, according to the central bank.
“Throughout our interaction with market participants over the last year or so, we found there was strong demand for high quality rating and research,” Jin said. “We believe with our product, reputation and history, we are in the best place to serve the market.”
He said S&P will implement a credit-ratings scale tailored for China and will rate bonds from a variety of issuers including financials and corporations, as well as structured products and panda bonds.

The Shenzhen Composite Index suddenly tumbled as much as 2.7 percent Tuesday morning, with shares of more than 20 companies dropping by the 10 percent daily limit that’s allowed by the exchange. While traders initially attributed the moves to criminal charges filed Monday by the U.S. against Huawei Technologies Co., the bulk of the declines only occurred about 30 minutes after the open.
The losses eased after China’s securities regulator dismissed a local media report that said newly-appointed Chairman Yi Huiman would prioritize the introduction of short-selling tools in 2019. The Shenzhen benchmark, punished because it hosts new-economy stocks that tend to command the loftiest valuations, ended the day down 1.1 percent. It’s still advanced 2.6 percent this month after a 33 percent rout in 2018, its worst year in a decade.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission’s response gave some relief, KGI Asia Ltd. executive director Ben Kwong said. “Investors are usually worried about policy changes, so they’re a bit sensitive to market speculation. They will keep an eye on what kind of new measures will be announced after the change in the CSRC chairman,” he said.
Short selling gained a bad reputation in China after it was partly blamed for the market’s spectacular crash in 2015, with leveraged punters using index futures to bet against the entire market. Curbs put in place at the time largely shut out bearish speculators. China has been considering easing some restrictions since last year.
The U.S. decision to file charges against Huawei -- China’s largest technology company -- added fuel to the sell-off. The move increases tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which are already mired in a trade dispute that battered Chinese stocks last year. Optimism had been building that an agreement can be reached, with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He now in Washington for the latest round of high-level talks.
“The U.S. government’s accusations against Huawei are hurting tech and telecom stocks,” said Shen Zhengyang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Northeast Securities Co. “ChiNext and many Shenzhen-listed firms already faced earnings pressure thanks to the economic slowdown.”
Also greasing the losses was the Shenzhen Composite’s failure to hold above its 50-day moving average this week, a level that’s been a key resistance for most of the past year. Infotmic Co. and Henan Tong-Da Cable Co. were among stocks limit-down Tuesday.

ULAANBAATAR/LONDON (Reuters) - Mongolia is working with overseas investigators to look into claims of corruption at its giant Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, the country's anti-graft body said on Tuesday, after the re-arrest of a former minister suspected of ""abuse of power"".
Bayartsogt Sangajav was first arrested last April and released in June in a probe into 2009 negotiations over the development of the mine, then owned by Canada's Ivanhoe Mines and now managed by Anglo-Australian miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO). Bayartsogt, a former finance minister, was among the signatories to the investment agreement, approved by Mongolia's parliament.
Munkhtungalag Tumur, a spokeswoman with the country's Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC), told Reuters it was now conducting a thorough financial investigation into the allegations that would be international in scope. She did not identify with which other countries the IAAC was collaborating.
The mine, run by Rio Tinto since 2010, is central to the firm's push to reduce its reliance on iron ore sales. But the miner has faced a series of wrangles with the Mongolian government over tax payments and cost overruns.
Expansion plans will make Oyu Tolgoi, located near the southern border with China, one of the world's biggest copper mines early in the next decade.
""An investigation is ongoing into suspected abuse of power - that former finance minister Bayartsogt held shares in a foreign company before the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement,"" the head of investigations at the IAAC, Idertsog Erdene, told a news conference on Friday.
Idertsog said authorities were looking into allegations that the ex-minister, one of six people now being investigated in relation to the case, ""gained a large amount of money by selling the shares when the prices went up after the signing agreement"". He didn't identify the foreign company.
Bayartsogt was re-arrested on Jan. 16, according to Mongolian media reports.
The former minister, who has previously denied all charges, is now in custody, according to his assistant, and unavailable for comment. His assistant and lawyer both declined to comment.
The 2009 deal gave 34 percent of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold project to the government of Mongolia, with the remainder held by Ivanhoe, now known as Turquoise Hill Resources. Turquoise Hill is now 51 percent-owned by Rio Tinto.
Turquoise Hill and Rio declined requests to comment.
The Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) is also conducting a separate criminal investigation into a seized bank account that court documents indicated was used to transfer $10 million to Bayartsogt in September 2008.
In an emailed statement, the OAG said it could not discuss further details with the criminal investigation still ongoing.

Samsung BioLogics filed an administrative lawsuit at the Seoul Administrative Court to nullify the watchdog's findings and sought an injunction to halt any disciplinary action until the court rules on the matter.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 12:27AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing nears $3.5 billion 737 MAX jet deal with Japan's ANA - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is close to a deal worth $3.5 billion at list prices to sell 30 737 MAX jetliners to Japan's biggest carrier, ANA Holdings, two people familiar with the matter said.
A deal would be the first sale in Japan for the newest version of Boeing's best-selling 737 family. Five years ago, ANA was also the first carrier from the country to pick the competing A320neo narrowbody from France's Airbus SE. 
It would also come at a time when Japan is facing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to cut its trade surplus with the United States.
An announcement on an ANA-Boeing deal could come as early as Tuesday, subject to the airline's final approval, the people told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
ANA confirmed it was considering an order of Boeing jets, but did not provide any details. 
""We are in discussion with Boeing, but we have not made our final decision yet,"" an ANA representative said. The airline is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Tuesday. 
Boeing declined to comment.
Boeing and Airbus, the world's two top planemakers, have amassed thousands of orders for their narrowbody jets on significant fuel savings offered by a new generation of engines, but they continue to battle for global market share, with the U.S. firm chipping away at its European rival's recent lead.
At end-March, 81 percent of ANA's aircraft with more than 100 seats were Boeing built, the carrier's website shows.
ANA's rival Japan Airlines Co. Ltd also operates a mostly Boeing fleet, giving the U.S. company its most dominant position in any major aviation market.
The case for Japanese carriers buying Boeing is also boosted by the fact that its aerospace firms such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Subaru build major portions of Boeing's aircraft, including the 787 Dreamliner's carbon composite wings. 
Around 80 percent of large jets operated by Japanese carriers are Boeing planes, a Boeing spokesman in Tokyo said. 
TRADE TENSIONS
Japan has used major plane orders in the past to demonstrate a commitment to buying U.S. goods in the ebb and flow of trade frictions, and a new deal for Boeing's 737 MAX would coincide with similar tensions now.
Washington and Tokyo are discussing a potential trade pact, with Japan facing mounting pressure to cut its trade surplus with the United States that stood at $56 billion in 2018, versus $69 billion in 2017.
Trump and other top U.S. have asserted that Tokyo unfairly ships millions of cars to North America while blocking imports of U.S. autos and farm products. Japan says its markets for manufactured goods are open.
In September, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to start trade talks that appeared, temporarily at least, to protect Japanese automakers from further tariffs on their exports, which make up about two-thirds of Japan's trade surplus with the United States.

Japan has insisted any pact would not be a wide-ranging free trade agreement, but U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last year he was aiming for a full free-trade deal requiring approval by Congress.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 11:32PM ET</span>",U.S. charges China's Huawei over alleged Iran sanctions violations,"By Diane Bartz and Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday announced criminal charges against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, escalating a fight with the world's biggest telecommunications equipment maker and coming days before trade talks between Washington and Beijing.
The Justice Department charged Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran by doing business with Tehran through a subsidiary it tried to hide and that was reported on by Reuters in 2012 https://reut.rs/2sRL7Ve and 2013 https://reut.rs/2sUq8RT.
In a separate case, the Justice Department said Huawei stole robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc. Huawei has said the two companies settled their disputes in 2017. 
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1. China subsequently arrested two Canadians on national security grounds.
Meng, who has been on monitored bail, is set to appear in a Canadian court on Tuesday to discuss changes to her bail terms, according to British Columbia Supreme Court schedules.
Canadian public broadcaster CBC on Tuesday said Canada has received a formal extradition request, citing Canada's Justice Department.
China's Foreign Ministry expressed ""grave concern"" about the charges and urged the United States drop the arrest warrant and end ""unreasonable suppression"" of Chinese companies. 
Huawei did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the charges are ""wholly separate"" from the trade negotiations. Yet the development is likely to upset high-level talks between Beijing and Washington this week as part of negotiations intended to walk back trade tensions between the globe's two largest economies.
According to Canada's legal procedures, its Justice Minister will have 30 days from receipt of the extradition request to decide whether to issue an authority to proceed. If he grants it, Meng's case would be sent to the British Columbia Supreme Court for an extradition hearing, which could take weeks or months.
U.S. authorities accuse Meng of playing a lead role in the scheme to use a subsidiary to conduct business in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions against Tehran. Meng has said she is innocent.
HUAWEI TROUBLES
Huawei, whose equipment includes base stations, switches and routers, derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.
However, the Trump administration is trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei gear and pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are concerned the equipment could be used to spy on the United States.
Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, denies Huawei's products would be used by the Chinese government to spy.
News of the charges against Huawei and Meng marks a serious blow to the company's global ambitions. It has been battling against piling security concerns as Western governments including Australia and New Zealand followed the U.S. lead in restricting its market access over the past year. 
Huawei is the world's leading provider of 5G technology. It has said it has won 30 5G contracts globally - more than any of its competitors - including 18 in Europe, three in Asia-Pacific and nine in the Middle East. 
It is unclear how the U.S. charges would impact Huawei's business. Chinese peer ZTE Corp (HK:0763), which was similarly charged, was slapped with a devastating supply chain ban last year that prevented it from buying essential components from U.S. companies.
ZTE only resumed normal business after paying up to $1.4 billion in fines and replacing its entire board, on top of a near $900 million penalty paid in 2017.
CHINA TENSIONS
President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Meng's case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said the alleged criminal activity at Huawei ""goes back at least 10 years and goes all the way to the top of the company. The charges against Meng and Huawei cite stories from Reuters in 2012 https://reut.rs/2sRL7Ve and 2013 https://reut.rs/2sUq8RT that said Huawei's Skycom unit had sought to sell goods to Iran in violation of U.S. law.
The indictment noted that the denials from Huawei in the stories were relied upon by financial institutions ""in determining whether to continue their banking relationships with Huawei and its subsidiaries.""
Also according to the indictment, in July 2007, the FBI interviewed Huawei founder Ren and U.S. authorities said he falsely told them Huawei did not violate U.S. export laws. 
In August 2013, Meng met with an executive from one bank, which is not identified in the indictment. Sources said the bank is  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC, which paid $1.92 billion in 2012 for violating U.S. anti-money-laundering and sanctions laws. 
During the meeting, Meng used a PowerPoint presentation that misrepresented Huawei operations in Iran and ownership and control of Skycom, according to the indictment.
If the banks knew about Huawei's violations of Iranian sanctions, they would have ""reevaluated their banking relationships with Huawei,"" which included U.S. dollar and euro clearing. 
The Justice Department has confirmed that HSBC is not under investigation in this case, HSBC said in a statement last month.
FBI Director Christopher Wray said the Huawei cases, which were filed in New York and Washington state, ""expose Huawei's brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace.""

He also said he is concerned about Huawei devices in U.S. telecommunications networks. ""That kind of access could give a foreign government the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, conduct undetected espionage, or exert pressure or control.""

(Reuters) - California utility owner PG&E Corp is preparing to name a restructuring chief as it finalizes preparations for a bankruptcy filing expected to come as soon as early Tuesday morning, people familiar with the matter said. 
PG&E plans to file for bankruptcy protection in a San Francisco federal court, the sources said, in part to address liabilities it expects to top $30 billion stemming from catastrophic wildfires in the last two years that have killed more than 100 people and destroyed numerous homes. 
The San Francisco-based utility owner, which carries debt exceeding $18 billion, is in the final stages of discussions to appoint longtime turnaround specialist James Mesterharm as its chief restructuring officer to help the company navigate bankruptcy proceedings, the sources said. 
The company is pressing on with its bankruptcy plan, which it announced earlier this month, even as some of its creditors proposed last-ditch rescue-financing packages to prevent such a move, some of the sources said. 
The sources asked not to be identified discussing internal company developments and cautioned that Mesterharm's appointment was still in the process of being finalized Monday evening. A PG&E spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
On Monday, the California Public Utilities Commission approved PG&E's plans to tap up to $6 billion in so-called debtor-in-possession financing to help it operate while under bankruptcy protection.
VETERAN FROM KODAK, ZENITH
Mesterharm, a managing director at turnaround and consulting firm AlixPartners LLP, previously served as restructuring chief at Eastman Kodak Co during its bankruptcy proceedings. Other companies he has advised on restructurings include mall owner General Growth Properties and Zenith Electronics. He has advised PG&E in the weeks leading up to its anticipated bankruptcy filing, the sources said.
An AlixPartners spokesman had no immediate comment. 
PG&E debtholders in recent days delivered separate multibillion-dollar rescue proposals to the company, people familiar with the offers said. The proposals, also shared with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, each offered financing in exchange for debt that can later be converted into shares when PG&E's stock trades at a certain price, the sources said. 
A Newsom spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A group comprising investment firms Apollo Global Management LLC, Citadel, Davidson Kempner Capital Management and Centerbridge Partners LP proposed between $3 billion and $5 billion of financing, the sources said. Another team of Elliott Management Corp and Pacific Investment Management Co offered $4 billion, they said. 
The debtholders either declined to comment, had no immediate comment or didn't respond to requests for comment. 
The financing proposals came on the heels of state investigators clearing PG&E of liability in a 2017 fire that tore through wine country and killed 22 people. 
PG&E still faces scrutiny over its equipment's role in a November blaze that ignited in the northern California mountain community of Paradise, killing at least 86 people in the most catastrophic wildfire in state history. 
PG&E has pointed to extensive litigation and a deteriorating financial situation leading up to its expected bankruptcy filing. In a securities filing earlier this month, PG&E said obtaining additional financing to avoid a bankruptcy filing, though possible, would be expensive, complicated and fail to address the company's fundamental problems. 

At least one shareholder, BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, has criticized the plan as harmful to investors and has launched an effort to oust PG&E's entire board.

The casino company, which has operations in Las Vegas and Macau, said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, the investigation into Steve Wynn had completed and it looked forward to reviewing the settlement.
Founder Wynn resigned as CEO of the company in 2018 following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. He has denied the accusations.
The company called the settlement an ""important remedial step"", adding that any employee mentioned in the Nevada Gaming Board's investigation, who was aware of Wynn's sexual assault allegations ""is no longer with the company"".
Steve Wynn was not immediately reachable for comment.
Wynn Resorts has over the past year tried to refresh its image with the company's largest shareholder Elaine Wynn, who co-founded the firm with her ex husband, agitating for changes on the company's board. 
In August last year, Wynn named industry veteran Phil Satre its vice-chairman. Satre, who was previously chief executive of Harrah's Entertainment Inc, now known as Caesars Entertainment Corp said he believed the board's follow up and reaction to the investigations has been ""thorough and decisive"".
The company said it has taken several steps including adding more female directors to result in a board now nearly 50 percent women.
Shares in Wynn Resorts closed down 0.3 percent on Monday while shares in Wynn Macau fell 1 percent in trading on Monday. 
Steve Wynn, who started in Las Vegas in the 1960s, created some of the neon strip's most iconic landmarks like the Mirage, Bellagio and Treasure Island. 
The 77-year-old businessman, whose signature denotes the company's logo, had built two lavish resorts in the former Portuguese colony of Macau where only six companies have licenses to operate casinos. 
Macau authorities told Reuters they had met with top executives from Wynn Macau last year to ""better understand"" the situation but declined to give any further update.

In October, the Montreal-based plane-and-train-maker sued the aircraft unit of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, alleging that former Bombardier employees passed on trade secrets to help with the development and certification of the company's new MRJ regional jet.
The MRJ would compete with regional jets produced by Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer SA.
Mitsubishi said in a counter-filing claim that Bombardier tried to coerce it and Seattle-based Aerospace Testing Engineering & Certification (AeroTEC) to sign no-poach agreements in 2016 that would stop them from hiring Bombardier's employees.
Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare also implicitly threatened the continuation of its ""supply relationship"" with Mitsubishi Heavy in a 2016 letter to board chairman Hideaki Omiya unless the Japanese company ""ceased the solicitation of Bombardier employees,"" Mitsubishi said in the claim.
""We believe that in response to the threat posed by the MRJ, Bombardier has chosen to engage in a pattern of anticompetitive conduct instead of competing on the merits of its product,"" said Mitsubishi in a company statement. 
""Bombardier has threatened, pressured and sought to coerce Mitsubishi Aircraft, its U.S.-based partners, and individual employees working on the MRJ program."" 
Mitsubishi's regional jet program, Japan's first passenger plane since the 1960s, has been delayed by several years, with first customer ANA Holdings Inc now expecting the 90-seater plane in 2020, rather than in 2013 as originally envisaged.
Bombardier has said it hopes to make a decision this year on the future of its money-losing CRJ regional jet as it ""aggressively"" pursues new orders to secure its industrial future.
In response to the latest filing, Bombardier repeated its view that its rival was illegally trying to obtain and use its trade secrets.
""Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation's attempt to recast the dispute as anything other than Bombardier's justified protection of its intellectual property is misguided and disingenuous,"" it said in a statement.
""Bombardier will vigorously enforce its rights and that includes holding (Mitsubishi Aircraft), AeroTEC and individual wrongdoers accountable.""
In the October lawsuit, Bombardier accused Mitsubishi Aircraft of violating the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 by trying to use the confidential data and documents obtained from former employees to accelerate the ""extremely complex and costly"" process of getting its planes certified.

Mitsubishi Aircraft asked a U.S. court in December to dismiss Bombardier's lawsuit, arguing that the allegations were baseless and designed to ""disrupt development"" of its rival jet.

(Reuters) - Thoma Bravo LLC, a private equity firm specializing in buying technology companies, has raised $12.6 billion for its latest flagship fund, the firm's managing partner, Orlando Bravo, said on Monday, amid strong investor demand for deals in the sector.
The buyout firm's fundraising hit its ""hard cap"" limit for Thoma Bravo Fund XIII, with commitments from investors exceeding the maximum size set for the fund.
""It was as quick a fundraising as we've had for the last four funds. We launched the fund in March and after six months we were oversubscribed,"" Bravo said in an interview.
Thoma Bravo plans to officially announce the completion of the fundraising on Tuesday.
Based in Chicago and San Francisco, Thoma Bravo acquires technology companies in sectors ranging from cybersecurity to business software. Its deals include the $2.1 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Imperva Inc and the $3 billion purchase of data analytics firm Qlik Technologies.
The latest fund is two-thirds bigger than its $7.6 billion predecessor, Thoma Bravo Fund XII, which was raised in 2016, and more than three times the size of Thoma Bravo Fund XI, which totaled $3.65 billion when raised in 2014.
The growth is emblematic of the overall private equity industry, which raised a record $566 billion in 2017 and $426 billion in 2018, according to market research firm Preqin.
The influx of cash has raised some concerns whether firms can continue to find enough lucrative deals to deliver attractive returns for investors, which range from public pension funds to wealthy families. Private equity firms had $1.2 trillion that they had raised and had yet to invest at the end of 2018, according to Preqin.
Bravo said the biggest hurdle to good deals was elevated valuation expectations from acquisition targets, rather than competition from private equity peers.
""It is going to be very difficult to generate those spectacular returns (of prior funds),"" Bravo said. ""At the same time, and we have shared this with our limited partners, we are very confident that we will continue to significantly outperform.""
Thoma Bravo's four funds prior to Fund XII had net internal rates of return -- a key benchmark for investment returns -- ranging from 21 percent 38 percent, according to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, which committed up to $30 million to Thoma Bravo's most recent fund.

It includes Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).’s tools, PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG).’s automotive coatings,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).’s processors and Trinseo SA’s synthetic rubber tires.
Nvidia and Caterpillar were the latest examples of this anecdotal evidence. Here’s a rundown of what we’ve heard so far from U.S. and European businesses:
Industrials
Caterpillar, an industrial bellwether, sent a gloomy signal on Monday when it posted its biggest quarterly profit shortfall in a decade, and provided a 2019 forecast that trailed some of Wall Street’s estimates. Sales of excavators will be flat year-over-year in China, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said.
Shares of Japanese rivals Komatsu Ltd. and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. each lost over 4 percent in early trading in Tokyo. China’s stock market is yet to open but investors will be monitoring Sany Heavy Industry Co. and other heavy equipment makers.
Stanley Black & Decker CEO Jim Loree wasn’t shy about raising the alarm bells on China last week, saying it was facing slowing economic growth there, along with most of the rest of the world. The previous week, paint maker PPG talked about “sluggish industrial activity in China” among pressures that the company will hit the first half of 2019.
Technology
Santa Clara, California-based Intel, whose processors are the main component in most of the world’s personal computers and servers, cited softness in China among the reasons for its lower-than-expected annual forecast last week. Nvidia, the biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards, echoed those comments on Monday, saying that “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand” for its products.
Chip-equipment manufacturers in Tokyo fell. Tokyo Electron Ltd. dropped as much as 2.9 percent, while Advantest Corp. slid 6 percent.
Cars
Car sales in China fell last year for the first time in more than 20 years.
“China is under threat, for sure,” Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Davos, Switzerland, last week. “This year will be challenging.”
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. posted a fourth-quarter loss of $534 million in China last quarter. Wholesales by the carmaker’s China joint ventures -- a measure of how many vehicles are shipped to dealers -- plunged 57 percent during the period. By the end of last year, only about a third of the company’s dealers were profitable, Jim Farley, Ford’s president of global markets, said on a Jan. 23 earnings call.
U.S. auto-parts supplier Lear Corp. offered more color on China on Friday. Lear, whose biggest customer is Ford, said it expected orders for parts like seating systems to fall more than 10 percent this year.
“They confirmed auto weakness in China,” Douglas Rothacker, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview. “Lear offers a good read across the industry for expectations in 2019.”
 Continental AG  (DE:CONG), Europe’s second-largest car parts maker, warned earlier this month that Chinese auto production might stagnate at best this year, leading to a muted earnings forecast for 2019.
Bright Spot: Retail
So far, luxury and consumer goods have been spared. Jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF). enjoyed strong growth in China in the final two months of the year.
“The holiday period has actually been very positive -- China is a big area of focus,” Tiffany’s Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Bogliolo said in an interview on Jan. 18. He said a boost in marketing spending there about a year ago has started to pay off. “We have seen an acceleration in mainland China.”
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). is opening a new stores every 15 hours in the country. Executives at consumer giant Procter & Gamble Co. said last week that they haven’t seen any sign of a slowdown in the country, although “things in China can change quickly.” Investors will scrutinize the financial results of Paris-based luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, due Tuesday, for any hint of the outlook for luxury in the country.

1043,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","U.S. Ramps Up Huawei Fight With Iran, Trade-Secret Charges","(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for our new China newsletter, a weekly dispatch coming soon on where China stands now and where it's going next.
U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against Huawei Technologies Co., China’s largest technology company, alleging it stole trade secrets from an American rival and committed bank fraud by violating sanctions against doing business with Iran.
Huawei has been the target of a broad U.S. crackdown, including allegations it sold telecommunications equipment that could be used by China’s Communist Party for spying. The charges filed Monday also mark an escalation of tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which are mired in a trade war that has roiled markets.
In a 13-count indictment in Brooklyn, New York, the government alleged Huawei, two affiliated companies and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou of bank and wire fraud as well as conspiracy in connection with business in Iran. Charges filed in Washington state accuse the company of stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile USA Inc. and offering bonuses to employees who succeeded in getting technology from rivals.
The cases “expose Huawei’s brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace,” Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said at a press conference in Washington announcing the charges.
Huawei didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment on the allegations.
Prosecutors said that Huawei concealed its relationship with Skycom Tech Co., a company in Iran, in violation of U.S. laws. Meng “personally made a presentation in August 2013 to an executive of one of Huawei’s major banking partners in which she repeatedly lied about the relationship,” prosecutors said in a statement announcing the charges. Skycom was also charged.
Meng, 46, the daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada on allegations that she committed fraud to sidestep sanctions against Iran. Meng’s next court date is set for Feb. 6 in Vancouver, where she is out on bail following her detainment on Dec. 1 while in transit at the Vancouver airport. She is fighting extradition to the U.S. to face criminal charges.
Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said at a news conference Monday that the U.S. intends to file a formal extradition request by tomorrow. Once that occurs, Canada’s justice minister has up to 30 days to assess it and issue an “authority to proceed” with hearings. Canada has little leeway to refuse the request, assuming the alleged crimes she committed also violate Canadian law. A hearing could still be months away, and Meng will have several opportunities to appeal. The final decision on extradition is up to Canada’s justice minister.
Canadian judges end up approving about 90 percent of extradition requests because the system makes it nearly impossible to mount a defense, says Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who’s been involved in hundreds of extradition cases.
In the Brooklyn indictment, the U.S. says Huawei misrepresented its business with Iran to the U.S. government and various financial institutions since 2007. That year, FBI agents interviewed Huawei’s founder, identified in the indictment as Individual 1, according to the U.S. During the interview, Individual 1 falsely stated that Huawei didn’t conduct any activity in violation of U.S. export laws, and that it didn’t deal directly with any Iranian company, the U.S. said. Huawei was founded by Ren Zhengfei.
Charges in the Brooklyn indictment include bank and wire fraud, conspiracy and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In addition, Huawei and Huawei USA are accused of conspiring to obstruct justice.
Trade Secrets
Prosecutors also alleged that Huawei began a “concerted effort” in 2012 to steal information from a phone-testing robot developed by T-Mobile USA Inc. and even offered bonuses to employees who could get their hands on the technologies of rivals.
In the indictment filed in Seattle, the government alleged Huawei violated confidentiality agreements with T-Mobile in an effort to build their own robot to test phones. A Huawei engineer secretly took photos of T-Mobile’s robot, called Tappy, took measurements of parts of the robot and, in one instance, stole a piece of the robot, prosecutors said.Huawei then blamed “rogue actors” within the company when T-Mobile threatened to sue, the U.S. said.
T-Mobile sued Huawei and its U.S.-based unit, Huawei Device USA Inc., in 2014. Three years later, a federal jury in Seattle found Huawei liable for both breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes of the Western District of Washington, whose office is handling the trade-secrets case, said Huawei’s actions showed a pattern by the company.
‘Steal Technology’
“Huawei wanted to build its own robot, and rather than engineer its own device, it decided to steal T-Mobile’s technology,” Hayes said.
The Chinese company also obstructed justice by preparing a report claiming to be an investigation of rogue employees, even though “Huawei clearly knew that the thefts were part of an organized effort by the company,” Hayes said. “During the time period of the alleged crime, Huawei announced a bonus for stealing confidential information from competitors.”
It’s unclear how Huawei will respond. The company could appear in court and defend itself against the charges, as any criminal defendant might. Or it could challenge the U.S. jurisdiction to bring charges against the Chinese company, though there’s no question that prosecutors have authority over domestic units, said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor now with Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP.
Ignoring the case won’t be an option, Sandick said, as that could result in a company becoming a ""fugitive"" entity that’s unable to do business in the U.S.
“Usually these are hypothetical questions because the government rarely charges business organizations,” Sandick said.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is cutting some jobs in declining areas of its business, while hiring more people in faster-growing segments, an AT&T spokesman said on Monday.
The layoffs will affect a ""small"" portion of the workforce and are consistent with staffing changes AT&T has done in the past, spokesman Jim Greer told Reuters by telephone. He declined to specify how many positions would be cut.

AT&T is the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. Last year it agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion, and it said in June it plans to achieve annualized cost savings of $1.5 billion over three years.

The sovereign fund, with help from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), hedged most of its 4.9 percent stake in Tesla after the market closed on Jan. 17, FT reported https://www.ft.com/content/d501c670-2307-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf.
On Jan. 18, Tesla said it would cut thousands of jobs to rein in costs as it plans to increase production of lower-priced versions of its crucial Model 3 sedan, sending its shares down as much as 10 percent.
As part of the hedging program, PIF will still hold the shares but with little exposure to the stock's movements, according to the report.
The derivative used to put on the hedge is known as an equity collar, which are bespoke instruments that are costly to finance and have become popular with Middle Eastern and Asian investors, the newspaper said.
Tesla and PIF each declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Tesla's shares, which fell as much as 3 percent, ended marginally lower at $296.38 on Monday.
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in August that the PIF had expressed support for a $72 billion deal to take the company private.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its suit, however, had said that the meeting between Musk and the fund ""lacked discussion of even the most fundamental terms of a proposed going private transaction"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. House panels will hold a joint hearing on Feb. 13 on T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp's proposed $26 billion merger and its potential impact on consumers.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee will hold a joint hearing to ""examine the merger’s potential impacts on consumers, workers and the wireless industry,"" the committees said in a statement on Monday. Both T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify.
""A merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would combine two of the four largest wireless carriers and the carriers with the largest numbers of low-income customers,"" said senior Democrats on the two panels and two subcommittees. ""We look forward to examining this merger from the perspective of what is in the best interest of consumers and hardworking people.""
The U.S. Senate held a hearing on the merger in June.
Last month, the companies won backing for the merger from two national security reviews, clearing key hurdles in their tie-up bid.
The deal got a nod from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, as well as the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department -collectively referred to as Team Telecom.
T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, said Team Telecom, in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, indicated it had no objections to the merger after reviewing “potential national security, law enforcement, and public safety issues.”

T-Mobile has previously said it expects the deal to close in the first half of 2019. The U.S. wireless carriers still need to win antitrust approval from the Justice Department and the FCC.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 06:10PM ET</span>",Citi sees stronger China wealthy client base in 2019 despite economy slowing,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Jennifer Hughes
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expects its China wealth management client base to grow faster in 2019 than last year, at more than 30 percent, the bank's country chief said, despite the world's second-largest economy slowing and feeling the pain of a trade war.
Citi's total number of wealth management clients in China, with at least 1 million yuan ($148,610.49) in investable assets, grew 21 percent last year, Christine Lam told Reuters in an interview.
""The fact there's significant accumulation of wealth in China, that is not going to change,"" said the Citi veteran who has worked at the bank for more than three decades and was named China chief executive in 2016.
Citi is planning to invest more in digital initiatives to help expand its distribution reach and take a bigger share of the onshore wealth management business in China, she said.
Foreign banks including Citi, HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) have been investing heavily in courting the mass affluent - those with investable assets of between $100,000 and $1 million - in China.
The banks are bullish about the medium-to-long-term growth prospects in the country with the world's fastest-growing pool of wealth, even as a bruising trade war with the United States dragged the economy last year to its slowest growth in nearly three decades and caused volatility in markets.
Individual investable assets as per top markets png - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SafPar
Chinese citizens collectively held investable financial assets of around 133 trillion yuan at end-2017 and the pool would rise to 175 trillion yuan by 2020, consultancy PwC said in a report in October.
Regulatory measures to boost scrutiny and transparency in the wealth management business augur well for foreign players already used to close regulatory scrutiny, it said.
Apart from cracking down on the sale of shadow banking-linked wealth products, China is also getting local banks to set up separate subsidiaries for their wealth management business for better oversight.
Lam said that those regulatory initiatives would ""educate investors about risk and suitability – and that's good for us"".
China is one of Citi's 10 markets in Asia that generate over $500 million in revenue annually.
Besides wealth management, the bank's onshore China businesses include retail, corporate and commercial banking.
Under new rules announced by Beijing in late 2017, foreign firms can now own 51 percent of an onshore Chinese securities joint venture, which provides debt and equity underwriting and financial advisory services.
Late last year, Citi agreed to sell its minority stake in its China brokerage joint venture to its Chinese partner, Orient, paving the way for the U.S. bank to set up a majority-owned underwriting and trading business.
Lam said that Citi was currently in talks to find a potential partner for the new securities business and that the new venture would have additional offerings such as equities trading.

(Reuters) - Warnings from  Caterpillar  and Nvidia on Monday about weakening demand from China signal investors could see more profit shortfalls from U.S. companies that count on the world's No. 2 economy for a big portion of their business.
Shares of Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) and Nvidia Corp sank after the two manufacturers joined a growing list of companies warning about the crippling effects of the fall-off in growth in the world's most populous country.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a host of chipmakers, and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) had already stoked fears of a global slowdown, particularly in a technology sector that depends heavily on China to drive revenue.
It does not bode well, several analysts said, for the rest of an earnings season that has only just started. With fourth-quarter S&P 500 profit growth now estimated at 14.2 percent, expectations for the quarter remain down from Jan. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The earnings risk from China ""is definitely something you need to brace for,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
""Although some of these companies may meet earnings now, those forward-looking statements are really going to be where the gold, if you will, is. Are they really going to slash expectations everywhere?""
China's economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest level in nearly three decades.
President Donald Trump is bent on curbing what Washington says is Beijing's deliberate theft of American intellectual property and trade secrets. Without progress in the weeks ahead, he has threatened a new round of tariffs from March 2.
Tariffs remain a concern for many companies this reporting period. Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR) cited tariffs as a drag on its North American business in its report after the bell. The company's stock fell in after-hours trading on a disappointing full-year forecast.
Monday's stock market declines, following an unusual warning from Apple earlier this month, underline the flip side of such moves for U.S. companies.
""Investors in general are at a point where they feel less certain about the earnings picture coming both this quarter and next quarter,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey
Asia-Pacific was Caterpillar's only region to record a fall in revenue, and Nvidia cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars to just $2.2 billion. That added to a previous number that was already $700 million short of analysts' forecasts and was blamed chiefly on gaming revenue in China. 
""The negative forecasts from Caterpillar and Nvidia really point to those areas of concern with trade, global economic activity and the potential impact of a strong dollar,"" said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
There could be more pain in the coming days and weeks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, due to report Tuesday, gets about a third of its revenue from China, based on Refinitiv's data, while Apple's results also are due Tuesday.
Wynn Resorts Ltd, scheduled to report Wednesday, gets more than 70 percent of its revenue from China. Also due Wednesday are Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which derives roughly 13 percent of its revenue from China, and McDonald's Corp, with about 18 percent of its revenue from China.
The full-year earnings growth estimate for S&P 500 companies now stands at 5.6 percent versus 7.3 percent at the start of the month.
Technology's estimates have been among the hardest hit, and the sector's profit growth for 2019 is now estimated at just 1.5 percent, based on Refinitiv's data.
""Across the broad spectrum ranging from heavy equipment to semiconductors, business in China is slowing down,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""The question is what does the tariff controversy factor into the slowdown. You can't answer that question yet. There's no way to predict it.""

1053,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
Apple, Apple, Apple
The big event on Tuesday comes after the market when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports earnings for its fiscal first quarter.The Dow component and one of the biggest influencers on the Nasdaq 100 is expected to report earnings of $4.17 a share, up from $3.89 a year ago. But revenue and what it means for the future will be more important.
Apple warned after the Jan. 2 market close revenue would come in at about $84 billion, down from its own projection of $89 billion to $93 billion but 8.8% from a year ago. Just about all of the short-fall will come from China and, more specifically, disappointing sales of iPhones.
The announcement stunned investors and sent the Dow Jones industrials down 660 points the next day, although Apple's shares are now about flat on the year.
China has emerged as a huge challenge because of the Sino-U.S. trade wars that have slowed growth on the mainland and the competition with lower-priced smart phones from Huawei, Samsung (KS:005930) and others.
The report and CEO Tim Cook's presentation will also generate a lot of questions about iPhones sales outside China as well. Some reports have said U.S. sales are ""static.""
Hog Wild
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) reports before the open. The venerable motorcycle may report 28 cents a share in earnings, down from 45 cents a year. Revenue is seen falling 14.6% to $1.06 billion. Harley has been struggling in recent years in attracting younger buyers for its high-end pricey bikes. The stock has recovered from a nasty slid between October and Dec. 24.
Earnings Parade
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), before the open. The estimate for the pharma giant and Dow component is 64 cents a share, up slightly from a year ago. Sales of $13.96 billion would also be up slightly. Shares are off some 8% this month.
Defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) may report $4.40 a share for the fourth-quarter, up from $4.07 a year ago, a beneficiary of the Trump Administration's interesting in boosting defense spending. Shares are up around 15% this year. Shares are up more than 13% after a fourth-quarter swoon.
The estimate for telecom giant  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) is $1.09 a share for the fourth quarter, up from 88 cents a year ago, with revenue expected to rise 3.5% to $34.5 billion. Verizon has been doing some cutting of late, especially after writing down its investment in former Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) assets by some $4.6 billion. Verizon shares are down about 2% this month.
In economic news, look for the Conference Board's January report on Consumer Confidence, due at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT). It may shed some light on how consumers look at the partial shutdown of the federal government and recent market turmoil."
1054,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>",U.S. judge to allow controversial evidence in Roundup cancer trials,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A federal judge overseeing lawsuits alleging Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer causes cancer on Monday tentatively allowed pieces of controversial evidence that the company had hoped to exclude from upcoming trials.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria during a hearing in San Francisco federal court called his decision ""probably most disappointing for  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON),"" the Bayer unit that manufactures the world's most widely used herbicide.
The company denies allegations that glyphosate causes cancer and says decades of independent studies have shown the chemical to be safe for human use.
Chhabria on Monday said plaintiffs could introduce some evidence of Monsanto's alleged attempts to ghostwrite studies and influence the findings of scientists and regulators during the first phase of upcoming trials. He said documents which showed the company taking a position on the science or a study introduced during the first phase were ""super relevant.""
The company had hoped the judge would take a harder line on such evidence following a Jan. 3 order by Chhabria restricting evidence of corporate misconduct. At the time, that decision lifted Bayer's shares nearly 7 percent.
Monsanto had argued much of this evidence was a ""sideshow"" that would only distract jurors from the scientific evidence.
Plaintiffs' lawyers contended some evidence of corporate misconduct was inextricably linked to their scientific claims. 
The judge appeared to agree with them, saying it was difficult to draw the line between scientific evidence and allegations of corporate misconduct, and questioned whether it would be fair for the jury to not hear about the company's alleged attempts to influence scientists.
The parties did agree that other internal documents, including emails of Monsanto employees discussing lobbying efforts, do not belong in the initial trial phase.
Under Chhabria's order, that evidence would be allowed only if glyphosate was found to have caused plaintiff Edwin Hardeman's cancer and the trial proceeded to a second phase to determine Bayer's liability.
The order applies to Hardeman's case, which is scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 25, and two other upcoming cases. There are some 620 Roundup cases before Chhabria, out of more than 9,300 nationwide. 

Plaintiffs' lawyers believe corporate misconduct evidence was critical to a California state court jury's August decision to award $289 million in a similar case. The verdict sent Bayer shares tumbling at the time, though the award was later reduced to $78 million and is under appeal.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Monday after warnings from  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and Nvidia Corp added to concerns about a slowing Chinese economy and tariffs taking a bite out of U.S. corporate profits.
Shares of Caterpillar, the world's largest heavy equipment maker, fell 9.13 percent and had their worst day since 2011 after the company's quarterly profit widely missed Wall Street estimates, hit by softening demand in China and higher manufacturing and freight costs.
Caterpillar's drop accounted for nearly a third of the Dow's fall, and the S&P industrial index dropped 1.0 percent.
Nvidia tumbled 13.82 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars on weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales.
The Philadelphia semiconductor index slumped 2.09 percent, while the S&P technology index dropped 1.40 percent.
""People had some optimism last week on earnings when numbers were pretty good, and today it's clearly gone the other way. China is such a big part of so many companies' earnings picture,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Also hurting global investor sentiment, China data showed earnings at industrial companies shrank for a second straight month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid a protracted trade war with the United States.
As signs of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy become stark, investors are pinning their hopes for a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade when officials meet on Wednesday and Thursday.
""With the Chinese economy struggling the way it is and with companies feeling the impact, the U.S. is also starting to realize that there is enough motivation to get a deal done. It's just a question of when,"" said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.
Although earnings have largely surpassed Wall Street's expectations, helping the S&P 500 climb about 12 percent from its December lows, worries about slowing global growth have tempered expectations.
With Wall Street in the thick of quarterly results this week, 72.6 percent of companies that have already reported have exceeded profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Since the reporting season began two weeks ago, analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit growth have stayed steady at about 14 percent, but expectations for 2019 earnings growth have dropped to 5.6 percent from 6.3 percent. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.84 percent to end at 24,528.22 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.78 percent to 2,643.85.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.11 percent to 7,085.69.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sector indexes fell. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) each dropped nearly 2 percent, while Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined almost 1 percent, dragging down the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three are set to report later this week.
The S&P energy index dropped 1.03 percent as oil prices fell after U.S. companies added rigs for the first time this year, a signal that crude output may rise further. [O/R]
 Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) fell 3.43 percent, weighing the most on the Nasdaq Biotech index, after Evercore ISI downgraded its stock, citing heightened competition for its arthritis drug. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 29 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.3 billion shares, compared with the 7.7 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA's shares plunged on Monday, wiping out 71.34 billion reais ($18.96 billion) in market value, after a tailing dam collapse on Friday killed scores of people less than four years after a similar disaster.
Vale shares fell 24 percent on Monday to close at 42.65 reais, the steepest daily drop ever in percentage terms. Brazil's stock market was closed on Friday when the disaster occurred. Vale's ADR fell 8.1 percent on Friday and 18 percent on Monday, to close at $11.20, the lowest close since December 2017.
Prosecutors, politicians and victims' families called for punishment, as fears grew that the death toll from the disaster, already 60, could soar into the hundreds. Fines, lawsuits and a regulatory crackdown were expected. The company suspended dividend payments late on Sunday.
""The fact is that Vale's share drop was even steeper than some market participants expected,"" said Igor Lima, a fund manager and partner at Galt Capital in Rio de Janeiro.
""At the same time, the reaction of the government and other public agencies have been quite a bit stronger than in the Samarco accident,"" he said, referring to a 2015 mining dam burst involving a Vale joint venture. ""This reaction has brought quite a lot of uncertainty about the size of the financial punishment Vale will have to handle.""
Brazil's top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, said the company should be criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said.
HSBC and Jefferies already have cut their recommendation for the shares to hold from buy. Other analysts have held back, saying they are still trying to figure out potential damages.
""Billions of dollars in Vale's assets have already been frozen as we discussed this weekend,"" said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations LLC in Milwaukee, adding that the lost production from the affected mine could be made up elsewhere in Vale's system.
""There remains a fair chance that all of Vale's dams (which exceed 100 in count) will also be coming under great scrutiny going forward,"" said Underhill.
Vale bond prices also fell, with the yield on its August 2026 bonds jumping to 5.7 percent from 4.6 percent early on Friday before the dam bust, according to Market Axess Bondticker. 
Fitch downgraded the company's debt on Monday to BBB- and placed it on ratings watch negative. Late on Friday, Standard & Poor's put Vale's debt under review for possible downgrade.
So far, Brazilian courts have issued orders to freeze 11.8 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in Vale's accounts to cover rescue efforts and damages. The company had around 24 billion reais in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter. 

Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note to clients that they foresaw regulatory changes for tailings dams because this is the second disaster in less than four years, after the 2015 dam burst at Samarco Mineracao, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Group .

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>","General Electric stock buyers preach patience, eye progress","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who have scooped up decimated shares of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co are willing to wait years to reap a solid return but also hope the U.S. conglomerate will show progress in its turnaround plan and avoid more negative surprises.
GE shares, which traded above $32 at the end of 2016, sank to $6.66 late last year, and remain at levels not seen since the financial crisis a decade ago. The stock, an original component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was replaced in the blue-chip index last year. 
The dramatic plunge has lured investors who see worth in GE's jet-engine, healthcare equipment and power turbine businesses and are confident in new CEO Larry Culp, as shareholders seek to capitalize on the stock's steep slide. 
“Based on what we believed the business is worth, it is one of the best investment returns, even on a risk-adjusted basis, that we can find in the large-cap space,” said Gary Lenhoff, chief investment officer at Great Lakes Advisors in Chicago, which Lenhoff said was buying GE shares in the second half of last year and said his timeline was three years.
Even those with long-term investment horizons will keenly watch fourth-quarter results on Thursday. GE is trying to restore profitability at the power division, which manufactures and services turbines. The unit is expected to realize virtually no earnings this year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. 
""The actions that need to be taken in the power business – it’s not a quick fix, it’s not something that you can achieve in six months,"" said Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California. ""Usually a turnaround of that magnitude takes a year or two to be complete and you can then start seeing the fruit of it.”
Investors will also watch GE's moves to shore up the balance sheet and reduce debt, including updates on planned asset sales. They hope GE, which booked billions of dollars in charges last year, can avoid negative surprises.
Daniel Babkes, senior research analyst at Pzena Investment Management, said GE's stock price already accounts for some potential negative news, including prolonged struggles for the power business and dour assumptions for liabilities.
Pzena bought GE shares last year, the first time in the value investment firm's more than 20-year history that it has made a significant investment in the company's stock.
""We are in this period of peak uncertainty,"" Babkes said. ""What is particularly attractive about the investment is not just the fact that the path forward can look better, it’s that none of that is priced in.""
Graphic: Long road lower for GE shares - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Bar3SD
Several investors expressed enthusiasm for Culp, named GE's chief executive officer on Oct 1 with a compensation package linked to stock price performance. Culp is well-regarded for previously running industrial company Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR), whose shares soared during his tenure.
""I think people are probably buying Larry rather than buying GE at this point,"" said Graham Copley, industrials and materials analyst at SSR LLC. ""There is an expectation that he can make something better than lemonade out of this lemon.”
GE shares have rebounded more than 30 percent from their low in December. Yet many remain skeptical. GE is saddled with heavy debt, and income-driven investors have likely been chased away after Culp slashed GE's quarterly dividend to a penny a share to preserve cash. 
There are serious concerns about the GE Capital lending arm and the power division. GE posted a third-quarter loss of $22.8 billion, including a massive writedown of goodwill from the power business, mainly from its 2015 acquisition of assets from  Alstom  (PA:ALSO).
Granite Investment Advisors plans to play the long game, buying GE shares again after selling some at the end of 2018 for tax purposes, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer.

Granite believes ""fair valuation is about double where it is right now,” Schermerhorn said. “I just think if you own the stock right now and you just ignore it for two years, you’re going to be happy you have it two years from now.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.84%, the S&P 500 lost 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.11%.
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) tumbled after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that missed forecasts. The heavy equipment maker also guided full-year earnings below consensus estimates. Its share price fell 9% and dragged the Dow Jones Industrials lower by about 70 points.
Caterpillar's dour earnings and guidance triggered weakness in Boeing (NYSE:BA), Deere (NYSE:DE) and Cummins (NYSE:CMI), pressuring industrials to close more than 1% lower.
Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slashed its guidance for the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and reported data center revenue that missed estimates. It blamed declining macro conditions, particularly in China, which hurt growth and margins in its gaming and data center businesses. Its share price fell 14%.
""While we view the gaming issues as unsurprising, we think the incremental softness on gross margins suggests a continued pause in Data Center,"" RBC said. ""With this in mind, we think the next 3-to-4 months will remain challenging.""
The duo of negative reports comes ahead of the busiest week for corporate earnings, which will include reports from tech heavyweights Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Falling energy stocks also weighed on the broader market following a slump in oil prices as weak Chinese industrial production data flagged concerns about global growth that could hurt global oil demand growth.
The slowdown in China's economy has been exacerbated by its months-long trade dispute with the United States. But investors are hopeful the two nations can find a way to resolve their bitter trade dispute, with a new round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks set to get underway later in the week.

1096,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: Nvidia Nosedives, Dragging Semis South","Investing.com - Nvidia slumped on Monday, sending semis broader lower, after the chipmaker warned it would miss fourth-quarter revenue expectations blaming weaker-than-expected gaming and datacenter growth.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) cut its fourth-quarter revenue to $2.2 billion from $2.7 billion as slowdown in China hurt gaming and datacentre growth, sending tis share price more than 13% lower.
Gaming, which makes up the bulk of its overall revenues, was of particular concern, as demand for company's latest slate of graphics cards using Nvidia's Turing architecture was lower than expected.
“Sales of certain high-end GPUs using Nvidia’s new Turing architecture were lower than expected,” the company said.
Datacenter sales fell short of expectations as customers turned cautious and pulled out of deals that were expected to close in the last month of the quarter, the company said.
As well as declining gaming and datacenter growth, lower gross margin was cited as a headwind for the chipmaker.
""While we view the gaming issues as unsurprising, we think the incremental softness on gross margins suggests a continued pause in datacenter,"" RBC said. ""With this in mind, we think the next 3-to-4 months will remain challenging."" RBC said.
The slump in Nvidia weighed on semis as Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) came under pressure.
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 2.4%, erasing some of gains from last week following chipmaker Xilinix's blowout quarterly report."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Volvo Cars joint venture has won approval to begin hands-free testing of its software for self-driving cars on Swedish highways, partner Veoneer said on Monday.
Veoneer said the Zenuity joint venture's software for Level 4 autonomous driving - the second highest level - would be tested in a Volvo car by trained drivers with their hands off the steering wheel at a maximum speed of 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour).
The venture is striving to keep up with larger rivals in the race to develop self-driving vehicles. 
U.S. companies are leading the pack, with Google's Waymo last year winning the first approval to test cars without safety drivers on Californian public roads.
General Motors' Cruise has said it is ready to deploy a self-driving car with no manual controls, while Germany's BMW and Audi have also secured testing rights.
Securing permissions has got tougher after an accident involving a Volvo car that Uber was using to test its own self-driving software. Uber last month resumed limited testing on public roads.
Zenuity has been running tests in Sweden to collect data to develop autonomous functionalities and sensors, while Volvo has been carrying out separate tests to gather data to improve driver experience and study driver behavior. 
Veoneer Chief Technology Officer Nishant Batra said the approval to do real-life tests was ""essential for gathering important data and test functions"".
""It is a strong proof-point for the progress of Zenuity's self-driving capabilities,"" he said.
Veoneer spokesman Thomas Jonsson said it was too early to say when Zenuity could potentially test without a safety driver. 
Zenuity, formed by Volvo and Veoneer in 2017, is expected to have its first driver assistance products on sale by 2019 with autonomous driving technologies shortly afterwards. Volvo and its Chinese parent Geely are customers. 
Volvo has goals of delivering self-driving cars sometime after 2021 and deriving a third of its sales from fully autonomous cars by 2025.
Documents obtained from the Swedish Transport Authority showed Volvo in September secured the right to test self-driving cars at 80kph and the permit removed a previous condition that a driver has at least one hand on the steering wheel.
The cars Volvo was testing were ""for the development of fully autonomous vehicles"" and it was using outside parties and test drivers, a Volvo spokesman said.
A top Level 5 vehicle, or fully autonomous vehicle, will be able to navigate roads without any driver input in all conditions.
Volvo teamed up with Baidu last year to use the Chinese company's autonomous software to develop a Level 4 car.

Anti-riot police backed by a fleet of tow trucks took several hours to clear the vehicles from the capital's Paseo de la Castellana. Stoppages are expected elsewhere as the protest drags on. 
The city's taxi drivers started the protests last week against the private services, which offer rides that often undercut taxi prices and can be hailed via the internet rather than in the street. 
In September, Spain's government gave ride-hailing companies four years to comply with regulation granting them just one new license for every 30 taxi licenses. 
The cab drivers are demanding stricter regulations now.
""They (ride-hailing services) can't do the same services that a taxi does. They can't pick up people on the streets. That is illegal but nothing happens,"" said taxi driver Juan Mateos. 
Taxi drivers in Barcelona ended a strike last week after regional authorities proposed the ride-hailing services can only be booked a short time in advance and cannot be hailed in the street.
Negotiations there remain ongoing, and some ride-hailing platforms say they may be forced to leave Barcelona if the new rules take effect.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 11:45AM ET</span>",Volkswagen to cut staff in Slovakia for first time in a decade,"By Tatiana Jancarikova
BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Volkswagen's business in Slovakia, the country's biggest car plant and largest private sector employer, plans to reduce staff this year for the first time since the 2009 global downturn as part of an efficiency drive.
The business will return some 500 workers it had borrowed from the Hungarian unit of premium brand Audi in 2016, reduce the number of contractors and will not extend expiring fixed-term contracts, it said in a statement on Monday.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) employs around 14,000 people in Slovakia and the German automaker did not say what that figure would fall to. 
The Slovak business will also reduce the number of production shifts that make higher-end SUVs as well as cheaper small family cars including the Volkswagen e-up!, the only electric car currently made in Slovakia. 
There are no plans to place production of new electric vehicles at the Bratislava factory at the moment, it added.
There are no cuts in overall output projections, as reduced hours will be offset by an increase in the technical capacity of production lines, it said.
Volkswagen said the move was part of a drive to increase efficiencies by 30 percent by 2025, as it strives to fund a costly shift to electric and self-driving vehicles following a 2015 scandal over rigged emissions tests of diesel engines. 
In 2017, Volkswagen Slovakia saw its first-ever strike that ended after six days with a wage deal that gave workers the biggest pay rise among Slovakia's carmakers, although they still earn less than Volkswagen's employees in Germany.
Overall production at Slovakia's four car factories - the bedrock of the export-dependent euro zone member country's economy - rose to 1.08 million vehicles in 2018 and is expected to reach a 1.15 million this year, cementing its position as the world's biggest per-capita car producer, the country's car association said this month.
But a focus on traditional petrol and diesel cars and a low share of research and development activities could threaten Slovakia's business model in coming years, as the EU aims to reduce carbon emissions from vehicles.
Slovakia's smallest carmaker, a unit of Kia, will also reduce staff this year, the first time since launching in the country in 2006. 
It will cut 27 staff as of February due to a 35-percent slump in demand for diesel engines made at its factory outside Zilina, northern Slovakia, versus 2017, it said on Monday.
Its car production this year is expected to match last year's 333,000 vehicles. 
The auto industry accounts for 13 percent of Slovakia's gross domestic product, which is expected to grow 4.3 percent this year before slowing, and for 35 percent of its exports.

PSA Group and Jaguar Land Rover see their output rising this year in Slovakia.

The company also said co-founder Paul Marciano, who resigned from his executive chairman post in June, will remain as the chief creative officer, though his contract expires in Jan.

(Reuters) -  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) on Monday cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars because of weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales, sending its shares down 15 percent.
The warning adds to concerns that a slowdown in the world's No.2 economy, exacerbated by an ongoing trade war with the United States, will continue to squeeze sales and profits at technology companies. Nvidia's caution signaled more challenges for the micro chip industry after mixed quarterly results from major companies last week.
""Q4 was an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said.
The company forecast revenue of $2.20 billion for the quarter ended Jan. 27, down from its earlier forecast of $2.70 billion. Both numbers were plus or minus 2 percent.
Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $2.7 billion, according to Refinitiv data from IBES.
Shares of Nvidia were down 13.9 percent at $137.91 in morning trade.
Nvidia in November forecast holiday quarter sales $700 million below analyst expectations, hit by unsold chips piling up with distributors and retailers after the evaporation of the cryptocurrency mining boom.
""This incremental $500 million miss in addition to the original $700 million miss is quite underwhelming for investors,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group.
Data center revenue, which accounts for nearly a third of Nvidia's sales, fell short as a number of deals did not close in the last month of the quarter.
""Customers shifted to a more cautious approach,"" the company said.
That echoed sentiment from rival  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), which last week reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales and forecast a tepid current quarter. 
Nvidia said sales of its next generation Turing graphic chips, launched in August last year, were also below expectations as some customers delayed their purchases.
Turing chips technology helps game creators make real-time cinema-quality visuals by simulating the physical behavior of light. 
Nvidia expects gross margin of 55 percent, plus or minus 100 basis points, for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, its worst in at least three years.
""They probably have to clear out what's not selling, which hits margins,"" Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said. 

Nvidia will report its fourth quarter results on Feb. 14.

On Jan. 18, Musk announced thousands of job cuts and said the electric car maker was targeting a ""tiny profit"" in the first quarter ""with great difficulty, effort and some luck."" He also forecast a profit for the fourth quarter, albeit down from the third quarter's $311.5 million.
The analyst consensus on Jan. 21 turned to a loss for the first quarter and stands at $2.5 million. Analysts on average were expecting Tesla to post a profit of $62.80 million on a reported basis as of Jan. 17, according to Refinitiv data.
""One potential rationale for the company guiding to a loss in March is the timing of vehicles in transit to Europe and Asia,"" said Gene Munster from Loup Ventures in a note on Jan. 24. 
The company has said it would begin delivering Model 3s to Europe and China in February. 
Musk's dependency on ""luck"" to be barely profitable while selling its long-range Model 3 to Europe and China and the mid-range Model 3 in the U.S. calls into question the company's ability to make profits when it finally starts selling its long-promised $35,000 vehicle, analysts said. 
Since unveiling the Model 3 three years earlier, Tesla has faced hurdles ranging from production hassles to logistics problems along with a cash crunch and self-inflicted wounds by Musk's erratic behavior.
While the production of Model 3s are going steady at over 5,000 per week, analysts expect Tesla to face tougher competition from lower priced offerings from Jaguar and Audi, and a reduction of electric car tax credits. 
After the federal tax cut came into effect from Jan. 1, Tesla was forced to lower the price of Model 3s by as much as $2,000. That decision is likely to eat into Tesla's thin profit margins in the first quarter. 
At least six brokerages have cut their price targets and two have downgraded the stock to ""sell""' or equivalent this month, after Tesla's fourth-quarter Model 3 deliveries fell short of expectations.
Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 14 percent since the job cuts announcement on Jan. 18. They were down 3.1 percent at $287.85 on Monday. 

The company is set to report its fourth quarter results on Jan. 30.

LONDON (Reuters) - Aluminum users around the world will pay less for their material after the United States lifted sanctions on major producer Rusal, but U.S. tariffs on imports of the metal mean limited gains for the country's consumers.
The U.S. Treasury on Sunday lifted sanctions on the core empire of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, including aluminum giant Rusal and its parent En+, despite a Democrat-led push to maintain them.
That pushed aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange down 2 percent on Monday to near $1,880 a tonne. 
(Graphic: Aluminum prices - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TpTnaA)
Prices of the metal used widely in transport and packaging have dropped 30 percent since hitting a seven-year high of $2,718 a tonne in April, after the imposition of sanctions.
""Since the first time the deadline was extended, the market started to price in the idea that sanctions would be lifted eventually,"" Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.
The United States extended several times its deadline for U.S. consumers to wind down business with Rusal.
""U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports mean U.S. manufacturers will pay more than consumers in Europe,"" Menke said. ""But from a global supply perspective, U.S. tariffs don't matter so long as the motivation to ship exists."" 
(Graphic: Costs of aluminum for U.S. and European consumers - https://tmsnrt.rs/2B9WOv9)
Tariffs mean producers need a strong incentive to sell to U.S. consumers and this can be seen in the physical market premiums that are paid above LME aluminum prices.
The premium for shipping to the United States stands at around $0.19 a lb or $420 a tonne, double the $200 a tonne seen at the start of 2018 and about 20 percent above the levels at the time tariffs were announced in early March 2018.
(Graphic: U.S. aluminum premiums - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ba6B4n)
CANADA EXEMPT?
U.S. premium contracts show a decline to $350 a tonne by July 2020, a level producers say is needed to attract aluminum to the United States.
(Graphic: Future U.S. aluminum premiums - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Sb38vX)
The United States is a major consumer of aluminum. It is expected to account for 5 million to 6 million tonnes of demand this year in a market estimated at 68 million tonnes.
Rusal supplied only around 10 percent of the U.S. aluminum market in 2017. Canada, with a share of more than 50 percent, is the largest supplier.
If, as some expect, tariffs are lifted or Canada is exempted or gets quotas, premiums could fall much further.
""Any deal with Canada would allow 2.5 million tonnes of primary aluminum to enter the U.S. duty-free and significantly dilute the proportion of U.S. imports from duty-paid countries,"" Wood Mackenzie analysts said in a note.
For European consumers, premiums at $69 a tonne, down nearly 60 percent since early May, are expected to slide due to high stocks of aluminum held by traders in the region. 
(Graphic: European aluminum premiums - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Sbx6jA)
""Rusal will also have aluminum it couldn't sell that will start making its way to Europe,"" an aluminum producer said.
""We will probably also see a lot of aluminum in Europe heading for LME warrant.""
The LME on Monday lifted a temporary suspension on storing metal produced by Rusal in LME-approved warehouses with immediate effect, after the United States formally lifted sanctions against the Russian firm.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>","In the new lithium 'Great Game', Germany edges out China in Bolivia","By Mitra Taj
UYUNI, Bolivia (Reuters) - When Germany signed a deal last month to help Bolivia exploit its huge lithium reserves, it hailed the venture as a deepening of economic ties with the South American country. But it also gives Germany entry into the new ""Great Game"", in which big powers like China are jostling across the globe for access to the prized electric battery metal.
The signing of the deal in Berlin on Dec. 12 capped two years of intense lobbying by Germany as it sought to persuade President Evo Morales' government that a small German family-run company was a better bet than its Chinese rivals, according to Reuters interviews with German and Bolivian officials.
While the substance of the deal has been reported, how China, Bolivia's biggest non-institutional lender and close ideological ally, lost out to Germany has not.
China has been quietly cornering the global lithium market, making deals in Asia, Chile, and Argentina as it seeks to lock in access to a strategic resource that could power the next energy revolution.
China has invested $4.2 billion in South America in the past two years, surpassing the value of similar deals by Japanese and South Korean companies in the same period. Chinese entities now control nearly half of global lithium production and 60 percent of electric battery production capacity.
German officials told Reuters they championed the bid by ACI Systems GmbH because they saw an opportunity to lower Germany's reliance on Asian battery makers and help its carmakers catch up with Chinese and U.S. rivals in the race to make electric cars.
The German push included a series of visits by German government officials who talked up the benefits of picking a German company. Bolivian officials also toured German battery factories, Bolivia’s deputy minister of High Energy Technologies, Luis Alberto Echazu, told Reuters.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier wrote a letter to Morales, an environmental champion, emphasizing Germany's commitment to environment protection.
The lobbying effort was capped by a call last April between Altmaier and Morales, Bolivian, German and ACI officials said, without offering details of what was discussed.
German diplomats in La Paz also stressed high-level German government backing for the project, potential loan guarantees and the tantalizing prospect of supply agreements with German automakers, ACI and Bolivian officials told Reuters.
ACI's win means Germany now has a foothold in the final frontier of South America's so-called Lithium Triangle: the Uyuni salt flat in Bolivia, one of the world’s largest untapped deposits. The triangle comprises lithium deposits in an area that includes parts of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia.
""This partnership secures lithium supplies for us and breaks the Chinese monopoly,"" Wolfgang Tiefensee, economy minister of the German state of Thuringia, an automotive manufacturing hub, told Reuters during a visit to the Bolivian capital La Paz in October.
SOME RISKS
The venture in Bolivia is not without risk for ACI.
While Uyuni boasts at least 21 million tonnes of lithium, Morales has made nationalizing natural resources a key policy plank. Bolivian officials assured ACI that foreign investments in the Uyuni would be guaranteed should anything go awry, CEO Wolfgang Schmutz said in an interview.
In addition, unlike Chile’s sun-drenched Atacama salt flats, snow and rain slow the evaporation process needed to extract lithium from brine in Uyuni, and the landlocked nation will have to use a port in neighboring Chile or Peru to ship the metal out.
ACI, a family-run clean tech and machinery supplier, has no experience producing lithium. The company dismisses concerns from some lithium analysts about its ability to deliver, saying its small size gives it more flexibility to bring partners from different fields into the project.
Schmutz said the company has preliminary lithium supply deals with major German carmakers, but declined to provide details, citing non-disclosure agreements.
None of Germany’s top three carmakers - BMW, VW or Daimler - confirmed any agreement with ACI when contacted by Reuters.
BMW said it was in preliminary talks with ACI but had made no decision. VW said ensuring supplies and stable prices for raw materials was important, but noted lithium production in Bolivia was particularly demanding. Daimler board member Ola Kaellenius said: ""If it’s happening, we’re not part of it.""
ACI said the carmakers that it was in talks with would not be able to confirm anything publicly until final deals were made.
THE GREAT GAME - LITHIUM VERSION
The global battle for control of lithium has been likened to the ""Great Game,"" the term coined to describe the struggle between Russia and Britain for influence and territory in Central Asia in the 19th Century.
The Bolivian project includes plans to build a lithium hydroxide plant and a factory for producing electric car batteries in Bolivia. Once completed, the factory will help to fulfill Morales' ambition to break with Bolivia's historic role as a mere exporter of raw materials.
ACI has said it expects the lithium hydroxide plant to have an annual production capacity of 35,000-40,000 tonnes by the end of 2022, similar in output to plants operated by the world’s top lithium producers. Eighty percent of that would be exported to Germany.
ACI's willingness to build a battery plant in Bolivia, helped to seal the deal, said Echazu, the deputy minister.
The Chinese did not want to build a battery plant in Bolivia because they felt it made no economic sense to ship in materials to make the batteries only to re-import the final product to China, he said.
China’s embassy in La Paz declined to comment on the Uyuni project, but said the potential for future cooperation with Bolivia on lithium was “huge.”
Bolivia's state-owned lithium producer YLB will own 51 percent of the new joint venture. Control of the project was another key demand of the Bolivians, who have bitter memories of foreign powers meddling in the former Spanish colony to seize its natural resources.
Juan Carlos Montenegro, the head of YLB, said geopolitics was a factor for Bolivia in deciding which companies to work with.
""We don’t want a single country to set the rules, we want balance and other world powers must help create that balance,"" he said. ""So for Bolivia it’s important to have not just economic partners for markets, but geopolitical strategic partners.""

He stressed, however, that Bolivia had not been predisposed against China in deciding who had made the best offer. ""China-Bolivia relations are still good. China is present in every country in the world and impossible to avoid,"" he said.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 09:26AM ET</span>",Aramco's rating ambitions face Saudi economic curb,"By Davide Barbuscia and Rania El Gamal
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is pushing for a top credit rating ahead of its first international bond sale, but Saudi Arabia's sluggish economy may curb the state-owned oil firm's ambitions.
Aramco intends to issue its first U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, expected to be at least $10 billion, in the second quarter to help finance the acquisition of a stake in SABIC, the world's fourth-largest petrochemicals maker.
Chief Executive Amin Nasser said last week that Aramco was talking to credit rating agencies ahead of its debut on the international capital markets, which comes after it last year pulled what would have been the biggest ever stock flotation.
Credit ratings allow investors to compare and assess the credit quality of bond issuers and their debt securities and are important in determining how much borrowers have to pay.
As the world's top oil producer, Aramco expects to match the ratings of Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Shell (LON:RDSa), a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Exxon is rated triple-A by agency Moody's and AA+ by its rival S&P, putting it on par with the rating of the United States.
But this would put Aramco, which declined to comment, four to six ""notches"" above Saudi Arabia itself, creating an unprecedented gap between a state-owned firm and its government.
Bond market investors expect Aramco to have a similar, if not lower, rating than Saudi Arabia, meaning its bonds will have to offer a higher yield than government debt to attract buyers.
""We wouldn't buy Aramco's bonds if they were yielding lower than Saudi Arabia's sovereign bonds of similar maturity,"" Charles de Quinsonas, Co-Fund Manager, M&G (Lux) Emerging Markets Income Opportunities Fund, said.
Moody's and S&P declined to comment on Aramco, while a third agency Fitch did not respond to a request for comment.
SAUDI RATING
As a standalone business, Aramco could outweigh its international peers, but most of its assets are in Saudi Arabia and it is tightly linked to Saudi Arabia's economic policies. And national oil companies are generally rated at the same level as or slightly lower than their governments.
Several investors said they expect Aramco's rating to be in line with the country's sovereign rating as a result, even though its full-year accounts for 2016, seen by Reuters, show that cashflow from operations put it well above Exxon, the world's largest listed oil firm and Aramco's nearest rival.
""We would anticipate that the group as a whole, at face value, would have a credit rating equivalent or slightly below that of the sovereign,"" Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at MUFG, said.
Saudi Arabia is trying to diversify its revenues away from oil and stimulate a sluggish economy bruised by a price slump in the past few years. The Aramco IPO, which has been pushed back to 2021, was a cornerstone of its reform plans.
HIGHER YIELDS
When it comes to what Aramco will have to pay investors, the oil firm may have to offer higher yields than the government.
""One would expect Aramco, as an entity that is less core than the sovereign per se, to trade wider than sovereign bonds,"" MUFG's Khoman said.
While Aramco's revenue stream depends on hydrocarbon sales, which are cyclical and subject to international supply-demand fundamentals, the state has access to more diversified wealth buffers to meet its contractual obligations.
Almost 70 percent of state revenues are set to come from oil this year and Aramco is the sole holder of Saudi oil concessions and the country's most important source of foreign currency.
""There is not a clear fundamental advantage (to buy Aramco, rather than Saudi bonds), but the spread concession to the sovereign could make it the more attractive investment when considering the relative credit risk profile,"" Janelle Woodward, head of income at BMO Global Asset Management, said.

A spread differential of 20 to 30 basis points when comparing quasi-sovereign entities with their sovereigns was typical for highly-rated entities, Woodward said, adding that this would be the case with Aramco, which she expects will be rated at par with the kingdom.

The miss for one of Wall Street's stronger performing shares of recent times also knocked U.S. stock futures lower.
On its October earnings call, Caterpillar tried to ease investor worries about a slowdown in China and global demand, but since then a host of companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), have warned about the hit from a cooling Chinese economy. 
In the fourth quarter, Caterpillar said revenue increased across all of its regional businesses, with the largest increase in North America, its biggest market by value.
But sales in the construction business in Asia-Pacific declined due to lower demand in China. 
The International Monetary Fund last week cut its global growth outlook for the second time in three months while China confirmed that growth last year was the slowest in 28 years, as a bruising trade war with the United States hit manufacturers.
The company reported profit of $2.55 per share, well below analysts' average estimate of $2.99, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Tibor Szimacsek, a spokesman for the AHFSZ union that called out all 9,000 of its members from the Gyor plant on Thursday in a dispute over pay, said the union's ranks swelled by another 300 workers at the weekend. 
He added several rounds of negotiations had failed to bring the two sides closer to an agreement at the plant, which employs more than 13,000 people and is one of Audi's largest.
On Monday, there was a gathering of about 4,500 workers at the plant, Szimacsek said, to give support to an unusually powerful show of labor strength in Hungary, where large strikes are uncommon. Audi declined to comment on the turnout.
The strike has led to a shutdown at Audi's home plant in Ingolstadt, Germany, due to a lack of vital components from Hungary such as engines, a company spokesman said. Audi is a member of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group.
Audi spokeswoman Judit Mithay-Marko told Reuters the company continued to strive for an agreement, and had submitted its seventh wage proposal at the weekend.
Unions negotiators rejected that package on the spot on Saturday, Szimacsek said.
Audi has offered a total 20 percent wage increase for this year and next, but the union wants an immediate 18 percent increase, and more down the line to give its workers greater parity with Audi's Slovak employees, who the union says make 28 percent more, or its Polish staff, who earn 39 percent more. 
""We asked Audi in Ingolstadt to send a high-level executive for the talks,"" Szimacsek said, adding there would be a new round of talks on Monday afternoon. Audi declined to comment on that.
The Hungarian economy has grown by more than 4 percent in the last two years, and has become increasingly reliant on car manufacturers and their subcontractors.
Audi's Hungarian business contributes about 1.4 percent to the country's gross domestic product, according to one local economist. Its $8.3 billion net revenue in 2017 was about 12 percent of Audi's global intake, company data shows.

Daimler, Suzuki and General Motors (NYSE:GM) also have units in Hungary, and BMW committed to building a large new factory last year.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",Nissan says it's target of SEC inquiry after report of probe on exec pay,"By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Monday it was the target of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry, widening a scandal involving the Japanese firm and its ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn over his alleged financial misconduct. 
Ghosn, first arrested on Nov. 19 in Japan, has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional Nissan compensation for 2010-2018 that he had arranged to be paid later. Ghosn, swiftly dismissed as Nissan chairman after the arrest, has denied wrongdoing.
Nissan was also charged by Japanese prosecutors for under-reporting his pay, and has since pledged to overhaul its governance.
Bloomberg earlier reported that the U.S. regulator was investigating the company's disclosures on executive pay.
The report, citing sources, said the SEC is examining whether the company maintained adequate controls to prevent improper payments and whether lapses by Nissan violated U.S. securities law. 
Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC also sent a request for information to Ghosn. A representative for Ghosn could not immediately be reached for comment.
A Nissan spokesman confirmed the automaker received an inquiry from the U.S. regulator, without giving further details. The SEC was not immediately available to comment on the matter.
Such an SEC inquiry does not mean that regulators have found any wrongdoing, but can lead to civil cases against companies and their employees, or they can end with no charges, sometimes months or years later.
A three-year SEC investigation last year found that  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) failed to properly disclose around $3 million in perks for former CEO Andrew Liveries and the firm agreed to pay $1.75 million in settlement.
In 2004, industrial giant  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) settled with the regulator over its failure to disclose former CEO Jack Welch's lavish retirement package. 
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) also agreed that year to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million after it failed to properly disclose payments to its former senior chairman.
Nissan has American Depository Receipts traded on the U.S. over-the-counter market, giving the United States authority to investigate it for potential wrongdoing. Other Japanese companies have been the target of SEC inquiries before, including Toyota Motor Corp over its handling of safety problems.
The financial scandal involving Ghosn, one of the auto industry's most feted executives, has rocked the industry, clouded the future of Nissan and its alliance with French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) and raised questions about governance at Japan's second-largest automaker.
Nissan set up a committee to examine the root cause of Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct and propose corporate governance reforms.
The committee plans to make recommendations to Nissan's board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection.

Nissan shares slipped 0.8 percent on Monday in Tokyo, versus a 0.6 percent decline in the Nikkei average.

The planned bond issue would be QNB’s first public dollar bond transaction in more than two years and its first since a political dispute erupted in 2017 between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 07:36AM ET</span>","Amundi: return to EM, DM credit; but too early for EU equities","LONDON (Reuters) - Amundi Asset Management, Europe's largest fund manager, has recommended investors restart building exposure to emerging markets and developed market credit, assets which are often considered more risky, after last year's brutal sell-off.
According to the French asset manager's analysis, market participants priced in twice the slowdown risk that economic fundamentals justified. 
""We think that risk assets have now reset to more attractive levels and some ""entry points"" for long-term investors are materializing in emerging market (EM) assets and developed market (DM) credit,"" Amundi said in a research note by chief investment officer Pascal Blanque. 
Within EM, the asset manager believes equities are the most appealing, followed by bonds in local currencies and hard currency debt. Local currency debt is expected to deliver higher returns and higher volatility than hard currency debt.
That's a change from last year when Amundi was very cautious on EM debt in local currencies, believing pressure on currencies was too high.
In DM credit, more dovish central banks and decent economic fundamentals make it more appealing, but investors should be highly selective given the high leverage in the system, with corporate debt at record levels in the United States, Amundi said.
It's still too early to return to European equities due to uncertainties around the European elections in May and the UK's divorce from the European Union, but opportunities may appear later in the first half, it added.
""We believe more robust opportunities will materialize later in the year as the European elections in May (and Brexit) could continue to weigh on investor sentiment,"" the note said.
Amundi has 1.45 trillion euros ($1.65 trillion) of assets under management.
In general, though, Amundi reckons the market went too far in December, pricing in a recession, and ""while we think risks are skewed to the downside, we have a more balanced view,"" it said.
""Except in the case of an extreme shock, nothing leads us to bet on a recession in Europe or the United States for the next 18-24 months,"" it said. 
Amundi is more inclined to bet on convergence towards potential growth, with a second half of the year more favorable than the first.

Major European bourses fell in morning trade, mirroring a retreat for Asian peers as gloomy data on China's industrial profits outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the U.S. government shutdown late last week. 
At the start of a busy week, investors were focused on Sino-U.S. trade talks and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. 
Also in focus was a looming twist in Britain's exit from the European Union, with crucial votes due on Tuesday in the British parliament designed to break the Brexit deadlock.

In Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul had earlier all closed down, though MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat. 
Investors said stocks fell on worries over a second straight monthly fall in profits for China's industrial firms. 
The data suggested trouble ahead for Chinese manufacturers already struggling with falling orders, job layoffs and factory closures amid a protracted trade war with the United States. 
""A slowdown in the Chinese economy could be sometimes taken as an idiosyncratic event which would be dealt with by Beijing,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. 
""It's pretty clear that the current situation is more global, in terms of the tariff tension between the U.S. and China and the threat of that dispute spilling over more widely.""
Investors are now waiting for Chinese Vice Premier Liu He's visit to Washington on Jan. 30-31, for the next round of trade negotiations with the United States.
With the sides still far from resolving trade issues, the dollar stood firm as traders sought a safe haven as they await news from U.S.-China talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
The dollar index - a gauge of its value versus six major peers - was flat at 95.793.
""In this environment the dollar is holding up well,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a forex strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""I assume that this will continue to be the case, even as the conflict intensifies at the end of the week,"" she said, referring to the talks.
The dollar will also get a strong steer from this week's Fed meeting, where the central bank is expected to signal a pause in its tightening cycle and to acknowledge growing risks to the world's biggest economy.
Though the Fed has forecast two more interest rate hikes for 2019, a darkening global economic outlook and highly volatile stock markets have clouded the policy picture.
BREXIT VOTES
Elsewhere in currency markets, sterling drifted lower ahead of crucial votes in the British parliament aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.
The British currency lost 0.3 percent to $1.3164, as investors consolidated positions ahead of Tuesday's Brexit votes. 
Lawmakers earlier this month rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the EU, which included a nearly two-year transition period to help minimize economic disruption. That defeat set up a series of votes in parliament, through which lawmakers and the government will try to find a way forward.
Elsewhere, Germany's 10-year government bond yield was marginally lower at 0.194 percent, having fallen last week when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned that risks to the euro zone economy had eased.
Draghi is due to speak later on Monday at the European Parliament in Brussels. Investors said they will look for any further details on potential changes to monetary policy.
Brent crude futures were down 1.8 percent, at $60.56 a barrel.
The fall came as moves by U.S. firms to add rigs signaled that crude output may rise further, and worries grew over the signs of economic slowdown in China, the world's second-largest oil user. 
Gold was slightly down. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,300.56 per ounce, hovering just below a more than 7-month high of $1,304.40 reached earlier in the session.

The blue-chip Dow futures lost 100 points, or 0.40%, to 24,596.0 points by 6:46 AM ET (11:46 GMT), the S&P 500 futures fell 12 points, or 0.43%, to 2,652.00 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 37 points, or 0.55%, to 6,754.12 points.
After reopening the government on Friday, Trump told The Wall Street Journal over the weekend that he was dubious that lawmakers could avoid another government shutdown when the current extension to funding expires on Feb. 15.
Trump said that the chance of an agreement that includes $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the southern border was less than 50% and that another shutdown was “certainly an option”.
Rabobank strategists commented, “As things stand this morning, we have only 18 days left before we get another government shutdown, or a Wall. That should keep things interesting for markets.”
Investors were also cautious ahead of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He's visit the United States on Jan. 30-31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington.
The high-level talks in Washington will include discussions about China's currency practices, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. He has criticized the yuan's weakness in the past, but in recent days, positive sentiment toward the talks has lifted the yuan's value against the dollar.
“Although coming to an agreement is still tricky, both sides have little incentive to escalate tensions,” said Tai Hui, Hong Kong-based chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note. “Markets will at least expect an extension of the truce in tariff increases beyond early March, while more difficult issues are still being worked on by both sides.”
Earnings will also be in the spotlight this week as 124 of the S&P 500 companies report quarterly numbers.
The busy week will start off slow with Dow component  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) to report ahead of Monday’s opening bell. Results from Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) and AK Steel (NYSE:AKS) are due after the close.
Elsewhere, European stocks were lower, with most major bourses across the region in negative territory.
Earlier, markets in Asia closed mixed.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, inched up 0.05% to 95.51 by 6:49 AM ET (11:49 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury gained 0.9 basis points to 2.76%.
In commodities, gold futures edged forward 0.10% at $1,299.45 a troy ounce, while crude oil traded down 1.71% to $52.77 a barrel.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Investors look to ratings agencies to punish aggressive loan docs,"By David Brooke
LONDON (LPC) - Investors are calling on ratings agencies to downgrade leveraged loans with overly aggressive documentation, as weak lender protection continues to cause concern.
Moody’s European covenant quality indicator hit a record low in the fourth quarter of 3.83, which is the lowest figure since the ratings agency established the monitor in 2012. The statistic focuses on high-yield bonds but analysts say loans are in a similar state.
Covenant-lite loans, which offer little protection for lenders, have become established as the market norm. Several services, including Moody’s, Fitch-owned Covenant Review and Debt Explained have been established to analyze documentation and inform investors on individual deals.
Some investors would like to see ratings agencies go further in assessing the risks that flexible documentation poses to lenders and downgrade loans with offending documents, particularly loose restricted payment tests and the ability to take dividends from day one.
“I think the agencies have talked a bit about the impact of [covenant-lite] and what they think the recovery rates are. Our frustration is that they talk a good game, but you’re not seeing that reflected in the actual ratings,” a senior investor said.
Flexible document packages raise several unknowns around individual companies and the actions that their private equity owners could take in a range of scenarios, and is therefore not weighted heavily in the final rating.
“Our credit ratings are based on the analysis of issuers’ fundamentals, whereas the covenant scores focus purely on the details of a specific bond’s documentation,” said Lisa Gundy, chief covenant officer at Moody’s.
“Flexible covenants, allowing the ability to distribute cash, remove security protection or increase debt, can be a reflection of an aggressive financial policy.”
LOST IN TRANSLATION
Financial data company Refinitiv, the parent company of LPC, scored 4.77 on Moody’s indicator. It was the lowest ranked covenant package in the European market in 2018 and one of the biggest deals of the year.
The score was linked to cash leakage, flexibility on investments, leveraging and structural subordination. The company scored a B2/B/BB from ratings agencies and the dollar and euro loan tranches priced at 375bp and 450bp over Libor/Euribor respectively.
Private equity firms prioritize the flexibility in credit documentation highly. The freedom gives them options to reach high return targets and managed credits through a downturn.
Many have taken active buy and build strategies with acquisitions which see sponsors tapping the loan market regularly and investors and lenders are willing to give flexibility to sponsors on good credits.
For banks, repeated add-on financings provide a reliable revenue stream. But the frustration remains that looser restrictions are not being factored into ratings.
“If loans with weak documents are issued then they ought to be rated substantially below what a normal loan would be rated and I would hope to see more price distinction around that,” the senior investor said.
The lack of lender protection in covenant lite loans is expected to hit recovery rates. Recoveries in the leveraged market have averaged below 60% since 2015, according to Fitch, in roughly the same period that senior debt to Ebitda levels have risen to 4.5 times-5 times, reflecting the risk of weakening covenants in the last few years.
“On their own covenants are rarely enough to move issuer default ratings, which capture the relative default risk of credit based on business model, execution risk and cash flow and leverage metrics,” said Ed Eyerman, managing director at Fitch.
“Covenants can also impact recovery assumptions, especially if collateral value can be diluted or stripped out.”
While some would like to see covenants factored more heavily into individual ratings, ratings agencies' role in the market makes it difficult to curb risk.
“Rating agencies are paid by issuers, so they might be hesitant on that account, since they’re not paid for by investors. They’re not independent,” an analyst said.
A second investor said: “I do not think rating agencies are very useful when it comes to risk analysis. A rating is a probability of default and in my view loose docs reduce chances of defaults.”
BLOW UP
An influx of cash into separated managed accounts in addition to record issuance of CLO funds in 2018 – US$128bn in the US and US$27.29bn in Europe -- means that investors have very little room to be more selective about credits.
“Investors have lacked bargaining power over the past few years and they turn to ratings because they can have an impact on arranger distribution strategies,” said Eyerman.
Few see the trend of covenant-lite loans reversing. While the summer saw a number of deals flex on documentation, the hope for a bigger shift in market sentiment was short-lived.
But barring a blow up on an individual deal, many see market conditions continuing to favor sponsors for now, as investors are penalized for holding cash and have few opportunities to invest due to a thin pipeline in early 2019.
“Liquidity is chasing very few assets. But the more marginal credits will be found out and the banks will lose money. That will temper the banks’ behavior,” said one banker.

The goal of the initiative is to enable investors to hold securities, particularly shares, in their own name without paper documents, according to a consultation paper. 
Hong Kong law currently still requires the use of paper documents to show the owner of certain securities. 
The consultation paper was issued jointly by the Securities and Futures Commission, the city's securities regulator, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the stock exchange operator and the Federation of Share Registrars. 
The proposed changes would also make it ""more feasible to shorten the IPO settlement timetable"" in Hong Kong, the consultation paper said, by removing the current options of submitting IPO applications in paper form and paying subscription monies by cheque or cashier order. 
In Hong Kong it typically takes up to seven days before a company's shares begin trading after an IPO closes, in part because of the need to process paper based applications and payment. 
Bankers in Hong Kong have long seen the gap between pricing and trading as a major irritant and have lobbied the Hong Kong stock exchange to change the system. 
It is particularly problematic, they say, when markets are volatile, as sentiment can change significantly between when a deal prices and when the shares actually begin trading.

1462,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>","MarketPulse Europe - Miners Buck Gloomy Trend Ahead of Fed, Key Trade Talks","Investing.com -- Mining stocks were a rare bright spot in generally weak stock markets in Asia and Europe Monday, as traders priced in the risk that the world could be left short of iron ore if Brazil's authorities crack down on mining giant Vale (NYSE:VALE).
Markets were otherwise broadly on hold ahead of key economic and political events - notably the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting - due later this week. The STOXX 600 was down 0.4% at 356.48 at 06:05 AM ET (11:05 GMT).
Vale's biggest rivals,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) outperformed local markets in the U.K. Monday on speculation they would profit from higher prices if Vale's production plans are disrupted.
The world’s largest iron ore producer, Vale is the operator of a tailings dam in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais that burst last week, leaving at least 58 dead and hundreds more missing. Over the weekend, Standard & Poor's put its credit rating on review for a downgrade, while the Brazilian authorities froze $3 billion of its assets to cover potential penalties.
Vale’s ADRs in New York lost 8.1% on Friday and are set to open down another 7.5% on Monday.
Earlier, there was more gloom about the state of the global economy after research institute Ifo reported Germany’s exporters have sharply cut their expectations for 2019. It said the key auto, chemicals and engineering sectors were all downbeat about their prospects. Bayer (DE:BAYGN) fell 1.2%, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz, were down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>","New dam disaster puts Vale CEO, deals and dividends under scrutiny","By Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - When Fabio Schvartsman took the reins of Vale SA in 2017, he suggested a motto for the world's largest iron miner, turning the page on a tailings dam disaster that hit a small Brazilian town two years before: ""Mariana, never again.""
That and many of Schvartsman's other big promises look destined for the scrap heap.
Four years later and some 100 km (60 miles) from Mariana, a breached Vale tailings dam on Friday unleashed a torrent of mud on another small Brazilian community, Brumadinho, leaving hundreds missing and presumed dead.
While the company's focus so far has been on the human tragedy, analysts and shareholders have little doubt that Vale cannot continue on the track its CEO set.
Schvartsman, 63, who said recently he would stay on through 2020 after his current term expires in May, designed Vale's strategy around spending more than $10 billion in annual free cash flow as China gobbled up its high-grade iron ore.
Offering generous dividends, reinvesting in money-losing divisions and searching for mid-sized acquisitions – many of those plans may have to be abandoned as Vale braces for lawsuits that could grow into the tens of billions of dollars.
One executive at a pension fund that holds Vale shares, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said it would be hard to justify big shareholder payouts in coming quarters, adding that a full review of Vale's governance was needed.
Early on Sunday, Vale said in a response to a question over its dividend policy that the company was focused on helping the disaster victims and ""had not discussed the issue of dividends"". But in a late Sunday filing, it said its board had decided to suspend planned shareholder dividends, share buybacks and executive bonuses because of the disaster.
During a Sunday visit to the rescue efforts, Schvartsman pledged to renew Vale's focus on safety, going ""above and beyond any national or international standards.""
""We will create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again,"" he said.
One of Vale's top shareholders, public-sector pension fund Caixa de Previdencia, known as Previ, on Saturday took the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it will demand a thorough investigation of the accident and will ensure the company helps the families and communities affected. 
The fund did not reply to an additional request for comment. Another major shareholder, Bradespar SA, the investment company of Brazilian lender Banco Bradesco SA, declined to comment. 
PLUNGING SHARES
U.S.-listed Vale shares tumbled 8 percent on Friday after the disaster. Brazilian markets were closed for a holiday.
On Saturday, ratings agency Standard & Poor's put Vale's rating on credit watch negative, warning that it could cut the BBB- rating by several notches depending on fines and the possible loss of an operating license in the affected area.
Three court orders over the weekend have already frozen 11 billion reais ($2.9 billion) of Vale assets pending damages.
In a statement on Sunday, Vale said it agreed to deposit 1 billion reais, but argued that the court orders freezing the additional 10 billion reais were counterproductive because they could block resources need for relief support.
Vale had 24 billion reais of cash and equivalents on hand at the end of September.
Mining analysts at Jefferies said the disaster was ""likely to be an overhang on the Vale share price for an extended period"" in a note cutting their price target more than 20 percent and downgrading the stock from Buy to Hold.
""The overall impact of the dam failure is nearly impossible to quantify for now,"" wrote the analysts led by Christopher LaFemina. ""Stringent safety inspections could affect production from other mines in Brazil as well.""
Estimating the cost of a disaster on this scale is a challenge for analysts, who still steer clear of putting a final price on the 2015 dam collapse involving Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Group.
As part of an agreement to settle a lawsuit, Vale and BHP committed to spending 20 billion reais on a foundation set up in Mariana to assist victims and recover the local ecosystem. The Renova Foundation spent 2 billion reais in 2018 and expects to spend 11.3 billion reais through 2030, the companies said in a statement.
A federal prosecutor told Reuters in an interview on Saturday that Friday's disaster could upend talks to settle a far bigger Samarco lawsuit seeking 155 billion reais.
The renewed legal risks are also likely to delay talks with Samarco creditors that had been based on hopes it could reopen operations soon and start making debt payments. One person involved in the talks said they might now be suspended.
EXPANSION IN DOUBT
It is unclear if Schvartsman will be able to pour fresh resources into expanding operations as planned.
Vale laid out plans in December to pump $500 million into its struggling New Caledonia nickel mine after failing to sell it or find a partner, hoping to ride out a tumble in prices and cash in eventually on an expected surge in electric vehicle sales.
The miner has also been pursuing mid-sized acquisitions in its core iron ore business, after deciding not to pursue blockbuster deals with the surging cash flow provided by rising iron ore prices last year. 
In December, Vale announced the acquisition of iron miner Ferrous Resources Ltd from its controlling shareholder Icahn Enterprises for $550 million. The deal is expected to close this year.

1466,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Says Stocks, Credit Still Haven't Priced Fed Pivot","(Bloomberg) -- While U.S. stocks and corporate debt have rallied from their December lows, there’s scope for further gains from an official Federal Reserve confirmation that it’s pivoting away from monetary tightening for now, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
“While we share almost every reservation about limited upside when the Fed pauses late-cycle, we still think that stable policy for another several months isn’t fully in the price of markets outside of Treasuries,” John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, wrote in a Jan. 25 note.
The S&P 500 Index has climbed more than 13 percent from its Christmas Eve low, helped by a slew of comments from Fed officials that they are prepared to be patient with further interest-rate hikes. Investors will be eyeing whether the policy shift, seen in large part as prompted by the fourth-quarter sell-off across risk assets, will be cemented in the Federal Open Market Committee statement on Wednesday and Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference later that day.
There may be plenty of reason for caution with regard to stocks and credit -- the outlook for earnings is under a cloud thanks to continuing U.S.-China trade tensions, with no guarantee of a deal by the March 1 deadline for a pause in further tariff hikes. And President Donald Trump’s battle with Congress over building a Mexican border wall leaves funding for the federal government in coming months in question.
That backdrop might help explain why only Treasuries appear to have fully discounted a Fed pause, according to JPMorgan. Ten-year Treasury yields have tumbled about half a percentage point since early November, to around 2.75 percent. And futures trading suggests no change in the Fed’s policy rate is the most likely outcome through year-end.
“Entering this meeting, only the U.S. money market has front-loaded what typically happens when the Fed is on hold,” Normand wrote ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC gathering. Credit spreads typically tighten and equities always rally after policy pivots, “and there is no evidence that corporate markets have front-loaded this path just because the Fed rhetoric has been dovish for several weeks,” he concluded.
The S&P 500 remains about 9 percent lower than its September record, while investment-grade corporate debt yield premiums over Treasuries, at 1.32 percentage points, remain above last year’s low of 85 basis points, Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) data show.
“If the Fed ended this ambient tightening, some markets might retest their 2018 highs,” Normand said.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Sunday lifted sanctions on the core empire of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, including aluminum giant Rusal and its parent En+, despite a Democrat-led push to maintain them.
The move, which sent the Russian stock index to an all-time high, has watered down the toughest penalties imposed since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, following a lobbying campaign in the United States that lasted almost 10 months. 
Hong-Kong listed shares in Rusal, the world's largest aluminum producer outside China, hit their highest since April on Monday, rising 9 percent.
Aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) dropped as much as 1.4 percent after the open. The sanctions had sent London aluminum to a seven-year high when they were announced in April last year amid fears of a supply squeeze.
On Monday, the LME said it had lifted its suspension on storing Rusal-produced metal in LME-approved warehouses with immediate effect.
""Members may freely enter into contracts with Rusal and its affiliates,"" the LME said in a statement. 
DISPUTED DECISION
The decision to lift the sanctions, imposed by the U.S. Treasury in response to what it called Russia's ""malign activities"", defied a Democratic-led push in the U.S. Congress to maintain the restrictions.
Earlier this month, Democrats were joined by 11 of Trump's fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate in an effort to keep the sanctions on Rusal, En+ Group and power firm JSC EuroSibEnergo.
Advocates for keeping the sanctions had argued that Deripaska, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, retained too much control over the companies.
Some lawmakers, from both parties, also said it was inappropriate to ease the sanctions while Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigates whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Moscow, something the U.S. president denies. 
But in its statement on Sunday, the U.S. Treasury Department said the three companies had reduced Deripaska's direct and indirect shareholding stake and severed his control.
That action, it said, ensured that most directors on the En+ and Rusal boards would be independent, including Americans and Europeans who had no business, professional or family ties to Deripaska or any other person designated for sanctions.
It added that the companies had agreed to ""unprecedented transparency for the Treasury into their operations"" including extensive auditing, certification and reporting requirements.
Deripaska himself remains subject to U.S. sanctions.
CHANGES IN RUSAL, EN+ 
After the Treasury announcement, Rusal said its chairman, Jean-Pierre Thomas, had resigned as part of the deal to lift the U.S. sanctions. 
Its parent company, En+ Group, also announced the resignation of several of its board members and the appointment of new directors, a move intended to satisfy U.S. Treasury demands that the boards of both Rusal and En+ Group be made up of independent directors.
""The new board of directors will take additional actions ... to demonstrate the board's absolute commitment to transparency, accountability and good corporate governance,"" En+'s board chairman Greg Barker said in a statement. 
These will include the establishment of a separate board committee for compliance and the retention of an independent expert counsel to advise the board, Barker said.
In addition, En+ announced that Swiss company  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) would swap shares in Rusal for a direct ownership interest in En+.
Trump administration officials, and many Republicans who had supported lifting the sanctions, had said they were worried about the effect on the global aluminum industry. Rusal is the world's largest aluminum producer after China's Hongqiao.
They also said Deripaska's decision to lower his stakes in the companies so that he no longer controlled them showed that the sanctions had worked.

Moscow has denied seeking to influence the U.S. election. Deripaska had ties with Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager. Manafort pleaded guilty in September 2018 to attempted witness tampering and conspiring against the United States.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Vale SA's deadly mine disaster in Brazil has created uncertainty for China's iron ore market at a time when demand for supply from the South American country is rising, multiple Chinese ore traders said on Monday.
A dam holding mine waste at Vale's Corrego do Feijao mine collapsed on Friday, burying mining facilities and nearby homes in the town of Brumadinho, killing dozens and leaving the community in shock as hundreds remain missing. 
The Corrego disaster is the second deadly collapse at a Vale-owned mine since 2015, when a dam holding tailings, or mine waste left after ore extraction, was breached at a mine owned by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture of BHP Group and Vale.
The Corrego mine accounts for 1.5 percent of output for Vale, the world's largest iron ore miner, said Helen Lau, analyst at Argonaut Securities. However, four Chinese iron ore traders said they were concerned that supplies of high-grade Brazilian ore could tighten if the government orders other Vale mines shut to probe for additional safety issues.
""We're worried that the mine accident might lead to higher premiums on low-aluminium iron ore,"" said an iron ore trader with Zheshang Development Group. He declined to be identified due to company policy.
Vale is the world's top supplier of low-aluminium iron ore, preferred by Chinese mills for its low impurity level.
(Graphic: Iron ore inventory at Chinese ports - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hy91j2)
The Samarco site remains closed after the 2015 incident, though Vale Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schvartsman said on Friday the site could resume one-third of its output in 2020.
Vale did carry out safety tests at its other mines in Brazil after the Samarco disaster and its main export port in the region, Tubarao, was closed for four days in 2016 to fix environmental issues.
""(Samarco) led to a long halt in operations and we don't know if this one will cause even longer and broader disruption for mining activities at Vale,"" said an iron-ore trader based in Qingdao.
He declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to media.
China's demand for higher grade ore is returning as profit margins at steel mills have risen in recent weeks because of increasing steel demand. 
(Graphic: China crude steel production vs rebar & hot-rolled coil margins - https://tmsnrt.rs/2S2A2yQ)
If margins remain high, mills will increase high grade iron ore consumption to boost output, said the Qingdao trader.
The most-active iron ore futures on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange soared nearly 6 percent on Monday trade to 567.5 yuan ($84.31) a tonne, their highest in 16 months.

1471,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>","Treasury Lifts Rusal, En+ Sanctions; Glencore Shuffles Stake","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury Department lifted sanctions on three firms tied to Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, including United Co. Rusal, a move that will provide relief to the global aluminum market. The metal fell in London.
Deripaska, an ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, will remain under U.S. sanctions, and his property will remain blocked. But the Treasury Department is removing restrictions on Rusal, En+ Group Plc and EuroSibEnergo JSC.
“The companies have also agreed to unprecedented transparency for Treasury into their operations by undertaking extensive, ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting requirements. All sanctions on Deripaska continue in force,” the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a release.
In a separate statement, En+ announced the addition of seven independent directors to its board, as well as a securities swap with Ivan Glasenberg’s  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc. Under the deal, the London-listed commodity trader will get global depositary receipts representing 10.55 percent of En+’s enlarged share capital in exchange for its existing 8.75 percent stake in Rusal.
Rusal said that Chairman Jean-Pierre Thomas had resigned as a director after an “imperative request” from OFAC as a condition for lifting the sanctions. He became chairman in December, replacing Matthias Warnig, a former East German Stasi agent who has known President Putin since at least 1991. Thomas’ appointment drew criticism from American media and some lawmakers during debates in Congress in January because of his calls for investment in the Crimea peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, leading to the first round of sanctions. His departure was effective from Jan. 26.
Rusal’s shares rose as much as 6.7 percent in Hong Kong on Monday, gaining for an eighth straight day.
At En+, new independent directors include Christopher Burnham, the chairman of Cambridge Global Capital LLC, who was a member of Donald Trump’s transition team at the State Department.
Congressional Democrats have tried to block Treasury’s action, citing concerns about the Trump administration’s motives at a time when Special Counsel Robert Mueller is continuing his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible connections to the Trump campaign.
“This represents just one more step in undermining the sanctions law, which President Trump has obstructed at every opportunity, while Russian aggression remains unabated,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat.

Aluminum Market
Sanctions relief for Rusal, the world’s second-largest aluminum producer, will remove a source of uncertainty from the market. Aluminum surged in April when Treasury announced the financial restrictions, but tumbled in recent months on speculation that the sanctions would be lifted. The price fell on Monday, losing as much as 1.6 percent on the London Metal Exchange.
Deripaska’s agreement with Treasury, negotiated over eight months, includes cutting his direct and indirect share ownership below 50 percent in each company, overhauling the boards of En+ and Rusal, and providing extensive disclosures, the department said in December when announcing its plans to remove the sanctions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - State-owned Saudi Aramco plans to invest up to $1.6 billion for a nearly 20 percent stake in South Korean refiner Hyundai Oilbank, expanding its foothold in one of its biggest Asian buyers of crude oil. 
Saudi Aramco is already the biggest shareholder in South Korea's No.3 refiner, S-Oil Corp, with a 63.41 percent stake, and the latest deal should help Aramco boost crude oil sales to Hyundai Oilbank, the South's smallest refiner by capacity. 
Saudi Aramco's chief executive told Reuters in November that it planned to expand its market share in Asia - including China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia - and Africa. 
Saudi Aramco plans to pay 1.8 trillion won for a stake of up to 19.9 percent of Hyundai Oilbank from Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings, which now owns 91.13 percent of Hyundai Oilbank. 
""Saudi Aramco seems to be boosting investments in downstream projects ahead of an initial public offering,"" said Lee Dong-wook, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities. 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in early January that the state oil giant will be listed by 2021.
Saudi Arabia is the top crude oil supplier to South Korea, the world's fifth-biggest importer.
In 2018, South Korea imported 323.17 million barrels of crude from the kingdom, or 885,408 barrels per day (bpd), according to data from Korea National Oil Corp. 
Aramco, the world's largest crude producer, plans to increase investment in refining and petrochemicals in a bid to cut its reliance on crude as demand for oil slows. 
Hyundai Oilbank has a total of 650,000 barrels per day of refining capacity in the southwestern city of Daesan and also aims to expand its petrochemical business. 
In May last year, it announced plans to build a 2.7 trillion won petrochemical plant with South Korea's Lotte Chemical.
""RECONSIDER"" HYUNDAI OILBANK IPO 
The firm's holding company, which also includes shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries, said it would use the funds from the Oilbank deal to invest in new businesses and improve its financial structure, including cutting its debt-to-equity ratio.
Saudi Aramco plans to value Hyundai Oilbank at 10 trillion won, or 36,000 won per share, Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings said in a statement. 
A person familiar with the matter said the company plans to offer a discount of 10 percent to Saudi Aramco in a block deal that will require board approval from both firms next month. 
Shares of the parent company ended up 3.8 percent after rising as much 6.6 percent. Shares of the country's shipbuilders rallied across the board after Qatar said it plans to order 60 new LNG carriers from unidentified firms, speaking at a summit with South Korea.
Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings said it planned to ""reconsider"" the stock market listing of the refinery arm after completing the stake sale, possibly this year. 
Hyundai Oilbank, which had aimed to list on South Korea's stock exchange in 2018, delayed the plan until this year due to regulatory scrutiny of its balance sheet. 
The company said on Monday that its operating profit skidded 42 percent to 661 billion won last year, hurt by falling refining margins. S-Oil also saw its operating profit halve to 680 billion won in 2018. 
Hyundai Heavy is part of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco and others to build a shipyard on Saudi Arabia's eastern coast.

1478,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>","Ghosn Jail Time Is `Too Long, Too Hard,' Macron Tells Japan","(Bloomberg) -- French President Emmanuel Macron told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he’s worried about Carlos Ghosn’s conditions in jail, making his strongest comments yet on the fallen car titan and the scandal that has rocked  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s decades-old alliance with Nissan Motor Co.
“All I’ll say is that I felt the detention was too long and too hard, and I told Abe that,” Macron told reporters in Cairo, referring to a telephone conversation with Abe on Friday. “I’m just concerned that the case of a French citizen should respect basic decency.”
Macron’s views follow days after Ghosn stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of France’s largest carmaker and two months after Nissan booted him out, with the attention shifting to the future of the partnership. While Renault named  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO Jean-Dominique Senard as its chairman last week, the French leader has reportedly suggested the executive be made Nissan’s chairman as well to help manage the alliance.
With his public remarks on the case, Macron risks being seen as meddling in Japan’s justice system. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Monday that due process is being followed in Ghosn’s detention and investigation.
“It is being carried out by highly independent investigative authorities, based on appropriate procedures and strict legal judgment, including the orders of the court,” Suga said. He also said the two carmakers should decide on who becomes Nissan’s chairman, pushing back on the idea of governments getting involved in the talks.
Ghosn has been in custody since his Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo, indicted for allegedly understating his income at Nissan and transferring personal trading losses to the carmaker. He’s been denied bail repeatedly after prosecutors argued he’s a flight risk, while his lawyers say he could stay in custody until a trial that may be six months away. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing.
Macron’s involvement in the affairs of the two companies is mainly because of the power the French state wields over Renault. The government owns 15 percent of Renault with extra voting rights, while the latter holds about 43 percent of Nissan with voting rights, giving French leaders indirect say in decisions that sometimes affect the Japanese carmaker.
Nissan has a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault, which also appointed Thierry Bollore as its CEO.
While both companies have repeatedly said they are committed to the partnership, Nissan has long been unhappy about what it considers an out-sized French role in the alliance, whose third member is Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
“We will be diligent to ensure the stability of the group,” Macron said.
Renault-Nissan alliance executives will meet this week in Amsterdam, where the company that manages the partnership is based, people familiar with the matter said. The meeting would be the first since Ghosn quit.
In an unexpected twist, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, a former protege of Ghosn who led the campaign against his ex-boss, said he too intends to step down in coming months after reforming the poor governance he says weakened the Japanese carmaker. Nissan has also been indicted by prosecutors.
Macron also has a history with Renault. On Sunday, he defended an increase in the French stake in 2015 on his watch as economy minister. It was a move that had rattled Nissan.
“I was happy I intervened, because I felt that Ghosn had gone too far in the ‘Nipponization’ of the group,” he said.

Traders will be watching for any hints of progress as the two sides try to agree on a deal before a deadline on March 1. If a deal is not reached by then, the U.S. could raise the tariff rates on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%.
Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries were “making a lot of progress” in the trade front. Contradicting Mnuchin’s comments, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC that the U.S. was ""miles and miles"" from reaching a trade deal with China.

In other news, the World Trade Organization is considering starting an investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods, according to Bloomberg.
“This WTO case is especially significant because it deals with the central international legal issue in the U.S. conduct of its trade war with China -- whether the U.S. can impose trade restrictions on China in response to alleged Chinese WTO violations without first seeking dispute settlement in the WTO,” James Bacchus, a former Democratic congressman and onetime head of the WTO’s appellate body, said in an email that was cited by Bloomberg.
“I believe these U.S. tariffs are inconsistent with WTO obligations, but it will be left to my successors on the WTO appellate body to decide.”

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known also as Foxconn, said over the weekend it’s investing more than $200 million in India and Vietnam. Smaller rival Pegatron Corp. said Sunday it’s moved to Indonesia some manufacturing of networking gear hit by rising U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, and is now exploring bases in Vietnam and India as well.
While neither explicitly said they’re shifting production of Apple products, the twin announcements underscore the extent to which the Taiwanese companies that make most of the world’s electronics are reconsidering a reliance on the world’s second-largest economy. From iPhone assemblers like Foxconn and Pegatron to laptop maker Compal Electronics Inc., they’re bracing for a fundamental shift in an arrangement that’s served them well since the 1980s.
“We have begun shipping from Batam island, Indonesia, in January,” Pegatron Chief Executive Officer Liao Syh-jang told reporters on Sunday. “Whether the U.S. will decide to go ahead with new tariffs on March 1 will be a key impact on the speed of the company’s further diversification.”
Taiwan’s largest corporations form a crucial link in the global tech supply chain, assembling devices from sprawling Chinese production bases that the likes of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). and Dell then slap their labels on. That may start to change if tariffs escalate, an outcome now in the balance as Washington and Beijing begin thorny negotiations on a trade deal.
Pegatron rose as much as 2.2 percent in Taipei Monday, while Hon Hai’s shares were mostly unchanged.Liao said it’s unlikely that Pegatron will be able to churn out gadgets in Vietnam and India in 2019 since it will take two years to set up new plants. But the company has also already moved some production lines back to the northern Taiwanese cities of Taoyuan and Taipei, he said.
On Saturday, Hon Hai said via a series of filings that it had injected some $213.5 million into an Indian unit, and paid for rights to use 250,000 square meters of land in an industrial park in Vietnam’s northeastern Bac Giang Province for operations and sales.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd on Monday said customers were requesting in-flight innovations such as exercise bikes and virtual reality relaxation to pass the time on proposed 20-hour non-stop flights from Sydney to London.
The airline expects to order Airbus SE A350 or Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 777X jets capable of flying the world's longest-ever commercial route later this year, with the first services starting in 2022.
Focus group research as well as customer surveys of those who have flown on its 17-hour non-stop route from Perth to London have found health and wellness are the top trends, Qantas said in a statement.
Passenger suggestions include spaces for gentle exercise, providing wireless noise-cancelling headsets and installing an in-flight cafe with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and snacks, the airline said.
""Customers are sharing some incredibly imaginative ideas, which is an exciting challenge and helps us to think outside of the box to redefine the ultra-long haul experience,"" Qantas Industrial Designer David Caon said.
For its Perth-London flights, which began last year, Qantas offers 15-minute stretch classes at its Perth transit lounge prior to and following the flight, with the airline reporting a take-up rate of 80 percent. The flight menu and cabin lighting are also designed to aid the body clock.
Rival Singapore Airlines Ltd hired wellness brand Canyon Ranch to design healthy meals and guided stretching exercises through its in-flight entertainment system when it resumed near-19 hour flights from Singapore to New York last year after a five-year hiatus.
But neither carrier has set aside dedicated cabin space for exercise or lounging on its current ultra-long haul flights.

Qantas International Chief Executive Alison Webster said the airline would examine customer requests for Sydney-London services and design the cabin in a way that made it ""both affordable for customers and commercially viable for the airline"".

Latin America, the Middle East and Africa will be impacted more by lower credit scores because of the high share of their foreign-currency debt, said James McCormack, Hong Kong-based global head of sovereign and supranational group at Fitch.
Emerging Europe will probably have more positive ratings as the area benefits from growth in Germany, while Asia will see stable ratings, he said.
“The countries that have borrowed in dollars are the countries that are most exposed,” McCormack said in an interview in Singapore. “We’re already seeing that U.S. interest rates are moving higher, the dollar has been strengthening.”
*NOTE: Costa Rica was lowered to B+ on Jan. 15, 2019
The depreciation in emerging-market currencies last year alone raises the burden on governments who borrowed in foreign currencies, McCormack said.
Argentina, whose peso was the worst-performing emerging-market currency last year, has 83 percent of its government debt in foreign currency, according to Fitch. Turkey, whose lira fell more than 28 percent last year, has 47 percent of the total in non local debt.
Below are some of Fitch’s views on the global economy for 2019 and emerging markets:

Up to 15,000 jobs could be put at risk by the changes, which are likely to affect the majority of Tesco's 732 larger stores, the report said, adding that details are expected to be announced this week.
A spokesman for Tesco declined to comment on the details of the report.
""We're always looking at ways to run our business more simply and efficiently,"" he said. 
""Whenever we make changes in our business, colleagues are always the first to know.""
The company will close some fresh food counters and scale back the opening hours of others, the newspaper said. 
It was also considering changes to its in-store bakeries, such as using frozen instead of fresh dough, the report added.
Tesco set out a plan in October 2016 to reduce its operating costs by 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) over three years by making its stores and its distribution network more efficient.
In the last two years it has cut 1,200 jobs at its head office and 1,100 jobs in Cardiff with the closure of a customer service center. Management has also been culled at its convenience stores.

The group, which needs to make the savings to help achieve its profit margin target by its 2019-2020 financial year, fared better than rivals in the important festive trading period.

Renault, which this week appointed a chairman and chief executive tandem to replace Ghosn, has yet to finalize its former boss' severance package, a potentially explosive issue in France where the government is facing protests over low pay and inequality.
""No one would understand if the severance pay of Carlos Ghosn were exorbitant,"" Bruno Le Maire told France Inter radio.
""We are going to be extremely vigilant.""
The French state is Renault's largest shareholder, with a stake of around 15 percent, and holds two board seats.
Ghosn resigned from his Renault role last week under pressure from the French government following his arrest in Japan in November and indictment there for financial misconduct. He denies any wrongdoing.
The scandal has strained Renault's alliance with Japan's Nissan, an industrial partnership Ghosn built into a global carmaking giant over two decades. 
France's CGT union has estimated Ghosn's severance package is worth 25-28 million euros ($28-32 million), in addition to an annual pension of 800,000 euros.
Le Maire declined to say what he thought would be an acceptable pay-off for Ghosn, but said the government had previously succeeded in getting Ghosn's 2018 pay package reduced by 30 percent from his 2017 total of 7.4 million euros.
The finance minister also said he would propose in the coming months legislation to require bosses of large companies based in France to make the country their tax domicile. 
The changes would target in particular big firms listed on the CAC-40 and SBF-120 indexes on the Paris stock market, along with groups in which the state has a holding, Le Maire said.

The legislation would include sanctions for company chiefs that breached the rule, he added.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 03:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil prosecutor says Vale dam burst may scramble Samarco talks,"By Marta Nogueira
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The Brazilian prosecutor running talks to settle a lawsuit over a 2015 tailings dam rupture at the Samarco mine told Reuters on Saturday that a deadly dam burst on Friday at a mine run by Vale SA (SA:VALE3) could scramble those sensitive negotiations.
Federal prosecutor Jose Adercio Sampaio said that depending on Vale's culpability in the new disaster, it may change how his task force handles a 155 billion reais ($41 billion) case against Samarco Mineracao SA, a Vale joint venture with BHP Group (AX:BHP). That case is currently suspended amid negotiations for a potential settlement.
""Now an intervening fact has appeared and that may completely change the course of those talks,"" Sampaio said in a telephone interview.
On Friday, a burst tailings dam at a Vale mine in the town of Brumadinho, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of the Samarco complex, sent a torrent of mud tearing through the miner's facilities and left hundreds missing.
""We need to investigate what caused this new rupture, if there were the same causes as the Samarco case: a lack of monitoring, incomplete information, neglect,"" Sampaio said.
Vale, BHP and Samarco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The new disaster at the Vale mine drew immediate parallels to the Samarco disaster, which involved the collapse of a larger dam that killed 19 people, buried a village and poured toxic waste into a major river near the town of Mariana.
Sampaio said state and federal authorities have also failed to apply more stringent regulation to the hundreds of tailings dams around the country.
""When it comes to the safety policy for these dams, nothing – absolutely nothing – has changed,"" Sampaio said. ""We're going to see one tragedy after the other."" 

Sampaio said he has contributed to prosecutors' work so far on the new disaster, and over the weekend prosecutors will decide whether to create a new task force or expand the scope of the Samarco team.

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Teams of rescuers were preparing to dig through thick mud on Saturday in a search for survivors of a dam burst at a Brazilian iron ore mine owned by Vale SA (SA:VALE3) that left hundreds missing and halted operations.
Firefighters focused their hopes on a bus, a train, mining offices and nearby homes that were buried on Friday when a torrent of mud was unleashed by the dam break at Vale's Corrego do Feijao facility in Minas Gerais state.
More than a dozen helicopters flew over the area on Saturday to survey the disaster and aid the rescue teams.
The state fire department said in a statement that only 10 bodies had been found so far. In a separate statement, the department reduced the number of missing to roughly 300 people, after 46 were found alive.
""Unfortunately, at this point, the chances of finding survivors are minimal. We're likely to just be recovering bodies,"" Romeu Zema, governor of Minas Gerais, told local media. 
During a press conference, Zema said the mining complex had all its permits in order and it was unclear what caused the collapse of the dam, which had been inactive for years.
The National Mining Agency ordered Vale, the largest producer of iron ore in the world, to halt operations at the Corrego do Feijao mine, located near the town of Brumadinho in mining-focused Minas Gerais, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
State prosecutors have requested that 5 billion reais ($1.33 billion) in Vale's accounts be frozen to be directed toward efforts to pay for damages, Antonio Sergio Tonet, a prosecutor with the Minas Gerais Justice Department, told reporters, saying he expected more assets to be frozen.
Earlier, a state judge ordered Vale to freeze 1 billion reais in its accounts.
'IN THE MUD'
The death toll was expected to rise sharply, according to Avimar de Melo Barcelos, the mayor of Brumadinho.
Israel has offered to send search equipment that could be used to find victims in up to 10 meters (33 feet) of mud, Zema said. Search dogs were being flown in from Rio de Janeiro to aid in the rescue efforts.
All of those missing are Vale employees or contractors, a police spokesman said.
""I know a lot of the affected people: Two sisters-in-law, a cousin, many friends there in the community. They're in the mud,"" local resident Carlos Jose dos Santos told Reuters.
Minas Gerais is still recovering from the 2015 collapse of a larger dam that killed 19 people in Brazil's worst environmental disaster. That dam, owned by the Samarco Mineracao SA joint venture between Vale and BHP Group Ltd (AX:BHP), buried a village and poured toxic waste into a major river.
New Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited Minas Gerais and flew over the disaster area Saturday morning. He dispatched three ministers to the area, who addressed reporters after Zema.
Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said the dam that burst on Friday was being decommissioned and its capacity was about a fifth of the total waste spilled at Samarco. He said equipment had shown the dam was stable on Jan. 10 and it was too soon to say why it collapsed.
The Corrego do Feijao mine is one of four in Vale's Paraoeba complex, which includes two processing plants. The complex produced 26 million tonnes of iron ore in 2017, or about 7 percent of Vale's output, with Corrego do Feijao accounting for 7.8 million tonnes, according to the company's website.

Operations at Samarco remain halted over new licensing, while the companies have worked to pay damages out of court, including an agreement that quashed a 20 billion reais ($5.31 billion) civil lawsuit last year. Federal prosecutors suspended but have not closed an even larger lawsuit.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China has appointed banking veteran Yi Huiman to head the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), putting governance of the nation's stock markets in his hands at a time when investor confidence has been hit by a slowing economy and U.S. tariffs. 
Yi, 54, currently chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), will take over from Liu Shiyu as the CSRC's party secretary and chairman, state news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday. 
Yi is an ICBC stalwart and has been working at the state bank for more than three decades. He originally joined ICBC as a junior loan officer at a branch in Zhejiang province in 1985. 
He was promoted to president of ICBC in 2013, overseeing the bank's overall operations. Three years later, at the age of 51, he succeeded retiring chairman Jiang Jianqing to take the helm of the world's largest lender by assets. 
He's ""pragmatic and knows how to run giant ICBC,"" said a Beijing-based ICBC banker who works under Yi and is familiar with his management style. He declined to be named as he is not permitted by his employer to speak to the media. 
Yi, however, does not have a background in regulatory work, other sources said. Prior to joining ICBC, he spent a year working at the Hangzhou city bureau of the Chinese central bank. 
ICBC and the CSRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
BIG CHALLENGES
Yi faces the challenge of reviving global and domestic investor interest in Chinese equities, which have lost a quarter of their value from a year ago amid slowing economic growth and friction between Beijing and Washington over trade issues. 
Trust in the CSRC has also been hit following a spate of violations in which companies had paid officials to gain regulatory approvals. 
Domestic media and industry participants usually describe the position of the CSRC chief as ""sitting by a volcano crater"" to illustrate the difficulty of leading the agency and overseeing China's volatile financial markets. 
In the short term, Yi will have to handle the imminent launch of a planned Nasdaq-style technology board in Shanghai, while the integration of China's capital markets into the global system will also likely be at the top of his agenda. 
Two projects aimed at internationalizing China's stock market, including the Shanghai-London stock connect, were delayed last year. Foreign investors still only account for 3 percent of the country's total market capitalization. 
TOUGH TENURE 
Liu, who served in CSRC's top post for three years, has been given another appointment, Xinhua reported. 
The state-run Securities Times newspaper reported on Saturday that Liu would become the deputy party chief of the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, a ministerial-level government body under the State Council. 
Liu took over the leadership of CSRC in 2016 following a turbulent period in the country's stock markets. His tenure has been controversial among investors, with some praising his crackdown on speculative activities and others blaming him for sapping market vigor. 
During the latest market crisis, he urged securities firms and mutual fund companies to inject liquidity into cash-strapped listings to ease margin call pressures. He also loosened rules on acquisitions and back-door listings.
""Liu did a good job of promoting value investment, and addressing market misbehaviors such as reckless acquisitions and fundraising,"" said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at LC Securities.

But ""it's hard to lift a stock market when the economy is bad and companies are suffering. Liu is just unlucky.""

1494,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 04:05AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Home Improvement Sector in a Fix
There's about a month to go until home improvement titans  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) deliver results, but data this week may have given investors a reason to shun the stocks before their numbers hit the tape.
To start, there’s Stanley Black & Decker's (NYSE:SWK) lackluster fourth-quarter results and full-year guidance.
The toolmaker said its full-year revenue would fall short of analysts' estimates, blaming weaknesses in the auto and residential construction sectors.
The ominous outlook from Stanley hit shares of Lowe's and Home Depot, as the toolmaker's report is used as a proxy for the underlying health of the housing sector.
Whatever optimism may have remained in the wake Stanley's dour report was hammered hours later. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell to their lowest level in more than three years.
Loop Capital analyst Laura Champine downgraded Lowe's to hold earlier this week and lowered her price target for the shares to $99 from $125 on expectations for industry demand to moderate this year.
Champine said Lowe's will need to ramp up promotional activity to achieve expectations for 3% sales growth, but this could also compress margins at a time when input costs continue to rise owing to labor shortages and the U.S.-China trade dispute.
2. Gender Pay Gap Barely Budges
The gender pay gap remained around 20% in the latest quarter, showing no appreciable change since 2010, leaving public companies with plenty of work to do in addressing the issue.
Women earned 80.3% of what men earned in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Women earned a seasonally-adjusted median weekly salary of $796, compared with $991 for men.
In constant 1982-1984 dollars, women earned about 80.4% of what men took home.
The gap is slightly wider than the third quarter, where women earned 80.9% of what men did.
Going back to the start of the decade, the gap is just slightly down from the first quarter of 2010, when women earned 79.2% that of what men earned.
Pressure will continue on companies to give opportunities to women in higher-paying positions, as well as ensuring equal pay for equal work. The banking sector in particular is in the spotlight for its disparity in wages.
Last week  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) revealed its gender pay gap is at 29% for women, well above the U.S. average.
“We know we need a comprehensive approach to our diversity initiatives to make the progress we want to see,” Citi Global Head of Human Resources Sarah Wechter wrote in a blog post.
“We should obviously be at 100% parity, and that’s what we’re striving for,” Wechter said, according to Bloomberg.
Earlier this month HSBC announced its pay gap widened to a whopping 61% from 59% the year ago, as it remained the major bank with the biggest gender pay disparity.
3. Getting Granular on Video Games
Investors seemingly hit pause on video game stocks this week. Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) slipped to a weekly defeat, while Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) snapped its four-week winning streak.
But for those watching carefully, data showed there's still plenty left to play for. The hours of button smashing keep piling up and video game spending has never looked this good.
Video game revenue reached a new high in the U.S. last year, jumping 18% to $43.4 billion from a year ago, according to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and The NPD Group.
Revenue has been bolstered by a recent wave of smash-hit games.
“Red Dead Redemption 2” was red hot as it notched record sales in the U.S. last year. And Activision's latest addition to the Call of Duty Franchise, “Black Ops 4,” was No. 2 on the best-seller list.
On the periphery, Logitech's (NASDAQ:LOGI) results also cut short any notion that we're approaching game over. While many know Logitech for its computer mice, its gaming accessories make up a quarter of the total revenue. And sales from its gaming divisions soared 23% in its fiscal third quarter.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) also delivered its maiden verdict on the big three video game stocks. It wasn't buy, buy, buy. But it was mostly positive.
Deutsche liked Take-Two the best, initiating coverage with a buy rating and $130 price target on the stock. Take-Two should outpace its rivals, supported by possible blockbuster releases over the next three years, including Bioshock and Grand Theft Auto 6, Briefing.com reported.
Electronic Arts received a hold rating and a $100 price target. Deutsche said strength included the company's sports video game franchises, but did express concerns about other game titles like Star Wars.
Deutsche Bank rated Activision a hold with a price target of $54, highlighting many transitions the company is going through.
As it stands, video gaming stocks remain in vogue, so is this week's slip a sign of more red to come or does redemption beckon?"
1495,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 03:05AM ET</span>",Malaysia probing audit firms' conduct in 1MDB scandal,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's securities regulator said on Saturday it was looking into the conduct of auditors of 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), a state fund that was wound up after losing billions of dollars in a scandal that erupted under the country's previous government.
""The Securities Commission's review of the conduct of auditors in relation to 1MDB audits is still on-going,"" the regulator said in an emailed statement to Reuters, without identifying the firms involved.
The statement was issued following a South China Morning Post report on Friday that cited sources saying that the regulator was reviewing the work carried out by international auditors KPMG and Deloitte to see if they were ""were aiding and abetting in this scandal, or merely negligent."" 
KPMG and Deloitte did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
Once the review is completed, the Securities Commission and its Audit Oversight Board ""will assess the findings and consider the appropriate next course of action,"" the regulator said. 
1MDB is the subject of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including the United States and Malaysia. The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged that over $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB by top officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014.
Deloitte audited 1MDB's financial statements for 2013 and 2014, before it resigned as the fund's auditor in early 2016.
It had taken over after 1MDB fired its earlier auditors, KPMG and Ernst & Young, authorities have said.
After the Justice Department filed civil lawsuits in 2016 over 1MDB, Deloitte said the 1MDB finance statements it had audited should no longer be relied upon. 
In June last year, 1MDB said KPMG had informed the fund that 1MDB's financial statements for the financial years ending March 2010, 2011 and 2012 audited by KPMG did not provide a true and fair assessment of the company.
Investigations into 1MDB were reopened in Malaysia after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad unexpectedly won a general election in May. 
The 1MDB scandal was a major reason for former premier Najib Razak's shock election loss. Najib has since been charged with graft over 1MDB, the fund he founded in 2009. He has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing. 

Goldman Sachs (N:GS), which helped sell 1MDB bonds, is also facing criminal charges in Malaysia.

Shell spokesman Ray Fisher declined to discuss specifics about negotiations. 
""We look forward to the bargaining process working through to its completion and a conclusion that can be satisfactory with all parties,"" Fisher said.
Shell, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa), is the lead negotiator for refinery, petrochemical and pipeline companies in talks to replace the current contract that expires on Feb. 1.
The sources said talks between the two sides have become heated over a USW proposal to replace non-union contract workers, who perform much of the maintenance and overhaul of equipment in refineries, with union members.
The union has warned Shell there will be no extension of talks past the expiration date, as was done in contract talks prior to 2015 when failure to reach an agreement led more 7,000 workers at 12 refineries and three chemical plants to walk off their jobs. 
Most of the strikes in 2015 ended within two months but continued at some locations for nearly six months. 
In addition to an 8-percent-per-year wage increase for hourly workers, the union also wants the new three-year pact to provide for the replacement of 10-percent-a-year of non-union contractors with USW members.
Contract workers at refineries are employed by companies hired by the plant owners to do the maintenance work.
Negotiations for the new contract began on Jan. 16.USW-represented refinery workers make about $40 an hour after four years on the job.

USW members have granted authority to union officials to call a strike if negotiations are unsuccessful.

Mastercard ""continues to make every effort to secure the requisite license to be able to access China's domestic market,"" it said in a statement posted on its website. 
The company ""hopes to be able to present another application for the bankcard clearing license in the very near future.""

Mastercard did not immediately respond to an emailed request from Reuters on Saturday for further comment. 
 American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) in November won approval to clear card payments in China, becoming the first U.S. card network to gain direct access to what is set to be the biggest bank card market by 2020. 
Previously, foreign card companies have had to partner with China's UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that enjoyed a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country, for access to the country's payments network. 
UnionPay counts Mastercard,  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) among its partners for payment services in China.

Mastercard ""continues to make every effort to secure the requisite license to be able to access China's domestic market,"" it said in a statement posted on its website.
The company ""hopes to be able to present another application for the bankcard clearing license in the very near future.""
State newspaper Beijing News reported on Friday that Mastercard had submitted application materials in 2017 but voluntarily withdrew its application in June 2018, citing an unnamed source at China's central bank.
Mastercard did not immediately respond to an emailed request from Reuters on Saturday for further comment.
 American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) in November won approval to clear card payments in China, becoming the first U.S. card network to gain direct access to what is set to be the biggest bank card market by 2020.
Previously, foreign card companies have had to partner with China's UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that enjoyed a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country, for access to the country's payments network.
UnionPay counts Mastercard,  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) among its partners for payment services in China.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo CEO defends his stewardship, in response to Sen. Warren: CNBC","(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan, in a CNBC interview on Friday, said he is the right person to run the company, in response to Senator Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for him to be fired after a 2016 scandal.
Sloan told Jim Cramer on ""Mad Money"" that Warren could have her opinion but he would not be in his present role if he thought he was not doing his job.
""I think I'm the right person to run this company today,"" he told Cramer.
Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers' names without their permission. 
The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.
Warren, a progressive Democrat who announced in December that she had formed an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020, has called for Sloan's removal in the past, but she could not compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step.
In October, she wrote a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell urging him to not allow the bank to grow in size until it replaced Sloan.
Sloan said in the Friday interview that he has ""taken responsibility"" and should not be criticized for doing so. ""Judge me on what I said we would do and what we've done,"" he said.
Sloan said last week that Wells is planning to operate under the Fed-ordered asset cap through the end of 2019, as the fourth-largest U.S. lender's loan book shrank and revenue fell across all its major businesses last quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mark Mitchell, the co-founder of Starboard Value LP who helped turn it into one of Wall Street's most high-profile activist hedge funds, retired from the New York-based firm earlier this month, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Mitchell retired from Starboard effective Jan. 15, according to an automated response received by Reuters following a request for comment emailed to him. A Starboard spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. 
Mitchell co-founded Starboard in 2002 with Jeffrey Smith as an activist strategy inside investment firm Ramius LLC. They spun Starboard out into an independent firm in 2011. Smith is the firm's chief executive officer and chief investment officer.
Starboard now manages roughly $5 billion in assets and has cemented its reputation for taking a hands-on role in improving operations at companies such as Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI), where it succeeded in ousting the entire board in 2014.
On Wall Street the firm is known for its success in winning board seats. Last year it received 29 seats on public company boards, more than any other activist, and all through negotiated settlements, data from Lazard show. 
More recently, Starboard has taken positions in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR). 
Prior to joining Ramius in July 1999, Mitchell was a managing director at BT Alex Brown Inc, where he was responsible for proprietary equity arbitrage trading in New York. 
At Starboard, Mitchell's title was managing member, portfolio manager and head of risk management and trading.

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 06:58PM ET</span>",Canada union calls for boycott of GM Mexico-made vehicles,"By Susan Taylor
TORONTO (Reuters) - The union representing autoworkers at General Motors' Oshawa, Ontario plant called on Canadian and U.S. consumers on Friday to stop buying GM cars made in Mexico, the latest tactic in its campaign to get the automaker back to the bargaining table.
GM has said it will close Oshawa by the end of this year, but Unifor wants GM to continue production until September 2020, when the current contract expires, hoping that provides enough time to secure the plant's future.
The closure, which GM said will affect 2,973 assembly-line jobs in Oshawa, is part of a broad restructuring aimed at cutting the automaker's costs as investments increase in electric and self-driving vehicles.
Between 600,000 and 650,000 GM vehicles produced annually in Mexico are shipped to Canada and the United States, representing approximately $20 billion in sales, Unifor President Jerry Dias said in an interview. 
GM Canada said it imports just 3 models from Mexico, of the 47 it sells in Canada, about 37,000 vehicles annually.
Dias stopped short of calling for a total boycott of GM vehicles because Unifor also represents GM workers in Ontario who assemble the Chevrolet Equinox and work at a propulsion plant.
""Buyers will need to know which particular models to avoid. Only a few versions of the GMC Sierra, Chevrolet Silverado, and Chevrolet Cruze are sourced from Mexico,"" said AutoForecast Solutions vice president Sam Fiorani. ""The majority of them come from plants in the U.S. or Canada."" 
If the boycott does not result in negotiations with GM, Unifor would consider a strike, Dias said, adding that job action is not currently planned.
""The only way to get General Motors' attention is if we fight back,"" Dias said at a press conference, adding that any vehicle with a vehicle identification number, or VIN, that starts with a 3 is Mexican made.
The move could mean ""collateral damage"" for the 60-plus Ontario-based auto parts companies that support production in Mexico, GM Canada said.
Dias said the boycott may hurt such Canadian auto parts suppliers as Magna, Linamar and Martinrea, with operations in Mexico, but will have minimal impact on Canadian parts workers.
The companies could not be reached for comment.

Dias plans to discuss the boycott with the United Auto Workers in early February. The union, which a spokesman said has no position currently, encourages members to buy UAW-made products.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 06:46PM ET</span>","Zuckerberg to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger: NYT","(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is planning to unify the underlying messaging infrastructure of the WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger services and incorporate end-to-end encryption into these apps, the New York Times reported on Friday.
The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report said, citing four people involved in the effort.
Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks.
""There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,"" a spokesperson said.
After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report.
Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
""If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,"" Weinstein said.
But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an ""extreme remedy"" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration.
MAJOR TRADEOFFS
Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption.
""I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,"" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. ""My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.""
However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared.
Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other.
Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. 
Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said.
Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children.
Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them.
Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details.

""It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,"" Stamos said.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>","Exclusive: MoneyGram exploring options, including potential sale - sources","By Mike Spector and David French
(Reuters) - MoneyGram International Inc is exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale of the money transfer company, a year after a U.S. government panel nixed its $1.2 billion sale to China's Ant Financial, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The Dallas-based company's shares have lost 83 percent of their value since the deal with Ant Financial collapsed in January 2018. In November, the company had to grapple with a $125 million financial penalty from U.S. regulators for failing to crack down on fraudulent money transfers. 
MoneyGram shares closed up 10.6 percent at $2.29 on Friday, for a market capitalization of $127.4 million, after Reuters reported on MoneyGram's exploration of a potential sale.
MoneyGram is also working to restructure its debt pile, which totaled $902.8 million as of the end of September and comes due next year, the sources said. The company has more than $80 million available from an undrawn credit line. 
The company, whose largest shareholder is private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and which employs more than 2,900 people globally, had about $200 million in cash at the end of September.
MoneyGram's debt restructuring efforts are initially focused on addressing a covenant tied to its credit line, the sources said. The company is seeking more time to meet the terms of that covenant, by pushing out a March deadline it faces, the sources added.
In addition, the company hopes to extend the maturity on its roughly $900 million loan, the sources said. Without any action, that debt would soon become ""current"" for accounting purposes and potentially trigger jitters among MoneyGram's creditors and shareholders, the sources said.
A spokeswoman for MoneyGram, which has agents at roughly 350,000 outlets in more than 200 countries and territories, declined to comment on the company's sale process, while reiterating that the firm is focused on refinancing its debt.
The sources cautioned that a sale of the company is not certain and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. 
Wall Street restructuring advisers have contacted MoneyGram's chairman and chief executive, Alex Holmes, to offer advice, but their calls have for now gone unanswered, the sources said.
In November, Holmes said, ""We always entertain discussions,"" in response to an analyst's question about whether MoneyGram was seeking a buyer.
MoneyGram, which has to contend with ""junk"" credit ratings, is also exploring raising additional money in the form of preferred equity that would sit above shareholders and below lenders for the purposes of repayment in a restructuring, the sources added. 
An agreement in November with the U.S. Justice Department on extending a deferred prosecution agreement related to MoneyGram's anti-fraud failures allowed the company to begin focusing on refinancing its debt, Holmes said during the company's third-quarter earnings call.
Among MoneyGram's most significant setbacks over the past two years was its failed merger with Ant Financial, in a deal to be acquired for $18 per share. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States blocked the deal on national security grounds.
ROLLING OUT A MOBILE APP
Money-transfer companies have traditionally endeavored to operate outlets in as many locations as possible to allow customers to wire cash anywhere in the world. Customers are often workers sending remittances to families living far away. 
That business model, though, faces challenges from new technology, in particular mobile banking services. 
MoneyGram is currently rolling out a mobile app and transaction alerts through text messages and emails to give customers options beyond brick-and-mortar locations. 

In addition, the company has started spending more money on spotting suspicious wire transfers, which includes collecting identification from customers on nearly every transaction as opposed to just larger ones. The higher standard has helped eliminate fraud but also resulted in lost revenue.

1509,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Logs Triple-Digit Gains as Shutdown Ends,"Investing.com - Wall Street wrapped up Friday with a weekly win as the U.S. government was set to open and consumer discretionary stocks rallied, led by Starbucks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.75%, the S&P 500 gained 0.85%, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.29%.
The U.S. partial government shutdown was brought to end, albeit temporarily, after President Donald Trump reached a resolution deal with Congress to fund the government until Feb. 15.
The bill that will open large swaths of the federal government is expected to pass both houses of Congress on Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
It'll then make its way to the president's desk to be signed, marking an end to the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The shutdown had threatened to wipe as much as 0.1% every week from economic growth, CNBC reported last week, citing a Trump administration official.
Beyond the shutdown debacle, corporate earnings dominated direction, underscored by a rally in Starbucks after the coffee giants' results and guidance topped forecasts.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported late Thursday fiscal first-quarter revenue and earnings that topped analysts' expectations.
The coffee chain also said it expects fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share to come in the range of $2.68 to $2.73, above market forecasts of $2.65. Its share price gained 3.6%, underpinning gains in the consumer discretionary sector.
Technology shrugged off downbeat earnings from chipmaker Intel to close higher for the day.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 5.5% after it reported lower-than-expected revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter and soft guidance.
Intel's revenue of $18.66 billion missed estimates of $19.02 billion. Guidance for first-quarter profit and revenue of 87 cents $16 billion in revenue, respectively, fell short of estimates for earnings of $1.01 a share on $17.35 billion in revenue.
The rally on Wall Street was also propped up by expectations for a more dovish tone from the Federal Reserve, when it meets next week, following a report from The Wall Street Journal that the Fed is closer than expected to ending its balance sheet unwind.
On the U.S.-China trade front, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin touted optimism on trade, saying both sides were ""making a lot of progress"" in the talks, Reuters reported.
Still, investor confidence that a comprehensive deal would be announce sooner rather than later remains murky as best following mixed messages from the White House this week.
In an interview with CNBC, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross shook investor sentiment on trade Thursday, saying that the U.S. was still ""miles and miles"" from a trade deal with China. That came a day after Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied that the U.S. had canceled a trade meeting with Chinese officials that was slated for this week.
China's Vice Premier Liu He will return to the U.S. next week to resume the next round of trade talks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street gained ground on Friday in a broad-based rally as investors were heartened by news that Washington would move to temporarily end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.
All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq eking out their fifth straight weekly gains. But the S&P 500 posted its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run.
The indexes backed off their highs after President Donald Trump confirmed he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government.
Investor sentiment had faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat. 
""As some of these uncertainties in the market start to diminish we'll get a clearer picture as to where things are headed,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis. ""And today's news of the ending of the government shutdown certainly alleviates some of that overhang.""
""But most likely some uncertainty will linger as this is only a temporary measure to fund the government for now,"" Ripley added. 
Among these uncertainties, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China continues to worry investors. 
With the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, nearing its conclusion, business leaders have expressed worries over the tariff battles, saying they are ""fed up"" with Trump's policies.
An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war would sharpen the global economic slowdown already under way, according to a Reuters poll of hundreds of economists worldwide.
Fourth-quarter corporate earnings season is in high gear, with more than 22 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported. Of those, 72.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations.
Earnings on Friday were a mixed bag. 
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) also surpassed Wall Street consensus, reporting better-than-anticipated quarterly sales. The coffee chain's shares advanced 3.6 percent.
Consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Co reported fourth-quarter revenue that surprised to the upside but said it expects profit to decline in 2019. Its stock edged down 0.6 percent. 
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) shares dropped 5.5 percent following the chipmaker's disappointing fourth-quarter sales and current-quarter forecasts.
Still, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index ended the session up 2.2 percent in the wake of a spate of positive earnings from other chipmakers. 
DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) Inc's quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations, underscoring persistent weakness in the U.S. housing market. The homebuilder's shares fell 2.6 percent. 
 Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) also disappointed, but its closed 7.5 percent higher after providing an upbeat forecast and saying it was committed to paying dividends.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 183.96 points, or 0.75 percent, to 24,737.2, the S&P 500 gained 22.43 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,664.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 91.40 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,164.86.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.56-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 20 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.55 billion shares, compared to the 7.79 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers are continuing their retreat from consumer-related stocks and increasing their defensive bets out of concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing even though government leaders had reached agreement to end the longest shutdown ever. 
While the S&P 500 index is up more than 5 percent since the start of January, money managers including Federated Investors, Baron Funds and Hodges Capital Management are bracing for a powerful knock-on effect on the consumer. The shutdown left roughly 800,000 federal workers without pay for 35 days, and U.S. consumer confidence fell in December by its largest amount in three years. 
President Donald Trump said on Friday afternoon that he had reached a deal with Congress to end the partial shutdown and restore government funding for three weeks while talks continue on funding a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, one of Trump's signature campaign promises.
Trump said that the government may shut down again on Feb. 15 or he will declare a national emergency if Congress does not appropriate money for a border wall. 
""The market right now is treating this like a hurricane, where you know there will be an economic impact but you tend to discount any hit to the data because you know there will be some catch up,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ""But here's what's dangerous about that approach: the sample size is zero for shutdowns this long.""
As a result, Chiavarone said he is becoming more cautious on consumer stocks. He noted that these probably saw revenue declines as government employees cut back and as that affected spending by owners or employees of restaurants, hotels, and retailers that depend on their business. 
Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC's chief investment officer, said he expected consumer stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and dollar-store chains like  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) to benefit as furloughed workers ""trade down"" into more value-oriented chains, leaving higher-end department stores and travel companies ripe for a slowdown.
""There's no question that life is about cash flow. Even if you are highly confident that you will eventually get paid, people will pull in their horns and hunker down,"" he said.
PAST SHUTDOWNS
The benchmark S&P 500 has been little changed during past government shutdowns, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of U.S. equity strategy at New York-based CFRA.
Each of the more than 20 government shutdowns since the 1970s has lasted a week on average and left the S&P 500 essentially flat, he said. The longest, a 21-day shutdown from December 1995 to January 1996, saw the S&P 500 rise 0.1 percent during the shutdown itself and gain 4 percent in the month after it finished. 
Michael Lippert, a portfolio manager at Baron Funds, said the shutdown is not likely to leave a lasting impact on portfolio holdings such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that are still grabbing market share. Still, it could curtail investor enthusiasm for initial public offerings, he said. 
""Sentiment affects stock prices in the short term and my bigger worry is what dysfunction in D.C. will do to market confidence,"" he said. ""Could we see a pullback on the magnitude of what we saw in December? It's certainly possible.""
Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, said the firm is underweight restaurant stocks in part because of the government shutdown and concerns about slowing economic growth.
Marshall expects to see more companies lowering guidance as they report earnings over the coming weeks. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to grow by 5.9 percent in 2019, compared to October estimates that earnings would grow by 10.2 percent, according to data from Refinitiv. 

""You're going to start seeing over the next couple of weeks whether companies factor the shutdown into their guidance, and whether it's going to start to have some negative momentum in the economy,"" he said.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 03:43PM ET</span>","Exclusive: CVS to cover migraine drugs from Teva, Lilly; excludes Amgen","By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley
NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), a top U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits, has added new migraine drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co to its list of covered drugs, excluding a rival treatment from  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), a CVS spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday. 
CVS's decision represents a setback for sales of Amgen's Aimovig, as many patients who rely on the coverage list will now have easier access to the rival Teva and Lilly drugs. Inclusion on the preferred drugs lists by the largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers is seen as critically important for sales of new medicines.
About 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, and global migraine drug sales could reach $8.7 billion by 2026, according to analytics firm GlobalData.
Shares of Amgen fell 1.3 percent to $198.27. Teva shares traded in New York were up 1.3 percent at $19.60, while Lilly was off 0.5 percent at $114.36.
An Amgen spokeswoman said the company was disappointed by the CVS decision and that it would work toward Aimovig being a preferred brand on CVS coverage lists.
The move by CVS is a positive development for Teva, whose drug was initially excluded from the list of covered drugs by Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), another large U.S. PBM. Its status recently changed and it may appear on some coverage lists, but likely with a higher out-of-pocket cost, Express Scripts said on Friday.
Teva's Ajovy and Lilly's Emgality will be available to members who have tried and failed to be helped by other preventive migraine treatments, CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer said in an emailed statement.
The treatments belong to a class of drugs called CGRP inhibitors that have proven effective in helping to prevent migraines, and whose prices were backed as cost effective by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Cramer said. ICER is a non-partisan research organization that reviews the clinical and economic value of medicines.
Cramer did not provide a reason for why the company had excluded Amgen. 
PBMs typically extract discounts from drugmakers in return for favorable placement on their list of covered drugs, such as through a low co-payment, or coinsurance payment, for their members. 
A Teva spokeswoman said in a statement that 60 percent of commercial patients now have access to Ajovy through covered drug lists and that discussions are continuing with other national and regional payers.
All three migraine drugs have a list price of $575 a month, or $6,900 a year. Those prices do not reflect rebates and discounts drugmakers typically provide to PBMs, who design and negotiate benefits for employers and insurers.
All three companies have said that they are providing a limited duration supply of these drugs at no cost directly to patients in addition to other assistance programs.
Amgen was the first of the three companies to launch a drug in the new class. The rival drugs from Teva and Lilly, which work in a similar manner, came on the market soon after.
CVS' policy is similar to that of Express Scripts, which requires patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs used to treat acute migraine. Express is now part of  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI).

Lilly did not respond to a request for comment.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland on Friday received five bids to replace its aging fighter fleet, from European aerospace group Airbus, France's Dassault and Sweden's Saab, as well as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) from the United States.
Switzerland's stable of Boeing McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C and D Hornets and Northrop F-5 Tigers is scheduled to be retired in the coming years, prompting it to seek new planes as part of its Air2030 program including aircraft and ground-based air defenses worth up to 8 billion Swiss francs ($8.06 billion).
It will now consider Airbus's Eurofighter, Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault's Rafale, F-35As made by Lockheed-Martin and Saab's Gripen E.
""The phase of analysis and testing starts,"" the Swiss Defence Department said. ""From February to March 2019, specialists from (Swiss defense procurement agency) armasuisse and the Swiss Air Force will test the aircraft in simulators"" at facilities of the planes' manufacturers.
Between April and July, the planes will be in Switzerland for aerial and ground tests, with public viewing opportunities. Assessments will continue through 2020 before a decision is made. 
Switzerland wants new planes to be delivered by 2025.
Armasuisse had asked the planemakers to submit pricing for 30 or 40 planes, including logistics and guided missiles, among other criteria for the bids.
Switzerland, which last fought a short war in 1847, has struggled to convince its citizens to back a deal for new planes. 
In 2014, around 52 percent voted against a 3.5 billion franc government proposal to buy 22 Gripen fighter jets from Saab. (https://reut.rs/2S6tTBS)
A renewed vote on the new program is also expected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government shutdown has handed banks a rare opportunity to tout their nicer side as they prepare for rough treatment under a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.
Sparked by a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over President Donald Trump's demand for a wall on the Mexico border, the partial shutdown is the longest ever, entering its 35th day on Friday. 
The president announced on Friday he would back a bill to reopen the government for three weeks as a temporary reprieve, but the financial repercussions from the shutdown could last weeks.
With around 800,000 federal workers missing a second paycheck on Friday, lenders including  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as well as their Washington lobby groups, have been quick to trumpet their efforts to waive fees, delay debt repayments and give a helping hand to federal workers.
""It is a big opportunity,"" said Brian Hart, founder of Flackable, a Philadelphia-based public relations and marketing agency for financial services companies. ""But you need to be delicate and sensitive about how to approach it."" 
Still tainted by the 2007-09 financial crisis, the industry has been searching for ways to repair its image in Washington, where bank bashing is a competitive sport among liberal Democrats. 
That hostility is set to intensify with progressive firebrand Maxine Waters taking over as chair of the House Financial Services Committee and Wall Street critic Senator Elizabeth Warren exploring a bid for the 2020 presidential race. 
Warren and Waters have urged lenders to go easy on cash-strapped federal workers, but on this occasion the industry – spying a rare public relations opportunity – has been one step ahead of their Capitol Hill critics. 
Earlier this month, Bank of America launched a program to help affected customers and pledged $10,000 to an emergency fund to provide assistance to furloughed workers. 
Wells Fargo, which is struggling to scrub its image following a series of scandals, has given $250,000 in charitable assistance and so far waived around $3 million in fees, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan, who condemned the government shutdown as ""completely embarrassing"" in comments to ""CBS This Morning"" on Friday. 
Not to be outdone, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday said in a memo that the bank was donating $1 million to charities providing assistance to federal workers. 
In Washington, industry groups such as the American Bankers Association (ABA) have been quick to create websites showcasing such efforts, which they have also enthusiastically flagged to lawmakers. 
""A furloughed federal employee was so appreciative of receiving an unsecured loan from a bank to help him make ends meet that he offered to move his other accounts when the shutdown ends,"" ABA CEO Rob Nichols wrote to Waters this week. 
Even Warren, the industry's leading adversary, coughed up some praise for lenders in letters sent to bank chiefs this month seeking details on their assistance programs. 

""I ... was pleased to see many credit unions and banks that serve federal employees act quickly to help them,"" she wrote.

Treasuries yields rose and the dollar weakened against most of its major peers.
The rally in emerging-market assets picked up steam on speculation the arrival of a senior Chinese delegation in Washington next week may help pave the way for a U.S.-China trade deal. Adding to optimism were reports that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is weighing ending the central bank’s program of reducing its balance sheet sooner than previously expected, a move that could ease measures of financial conditions.
“My sense is there’s potential for the risk taking channel to kick in,” said Tim Alt, a portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
With Friday’s gains, global equities are now poised for their fifth straight weekly increase. Investors had begun earlier in the week to question the scope of the post-Christmas rally as the earnings season rolls on.
Pressure on Trump and lawmakers to end the shutdown escalated Friday as the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily halted flights into New York’s LaGuardia Airport because of a shortage of air-traffic control staff.
“That’s the Achilles heel,” said Bob Phillips, managing principal at Spectrum Management Group in Indianapolis.
Elsewhere, Venezuela’s defaulted 2027 dollar bonds climbed to 30.9 percent of face value as the European Union appeared to be moving toward pushing for an immediate election. West Texas oil futures was higher as traders weighed the Venezuelan crisis and its possible effect on production with the outlook of a market that’s otherwise comfortably supplied.

The expected reallocation into fixed income from equities was far below the estimated $65 billion that occurred in late December, the analysts said in a research note.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 01:54PM ET</span>","Emerging markets brought the bears, now they have the bulls","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - This weekend marks a year since the start of one of most comprehensive global bear markets on record, but just as the developing world's equity indexes were first to fold last year, now they are leading the charge back up.
Although there are a few subtleties this time, it largely fits with a pattern that stretches back decades. 
During the global financial crisis, emerging market stocks dropped the 20 percent that defines a 'bear' market three weeks sooner than the main global indexes and started to bounce back four months earlier.
It was a similar story in 2016 and when the dot-com bubble deflated in 2000. Back then EM also started to fall three weeks earlier, took less than a third of the time to reach bear territory and bottomed out 11 months sooner.
""You just have more volatility and a faster moving investor base in emerging markets,"" said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer at Pictet Asset Management. ""So when fear tends to take over the market that can be a really interesting buying opportunity.""
Last year's rout saw EM and global indexes actually start their slides within hours of each other. But there were still plenty of familiar patterns to observe.
China's heavy falls and even bigger hits for the likes of Turkey meant MSCI's EM index was a bear market by September, whereas the all world index held out until Christmas.
U.S. tech bulls were still pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs up until late September and early October. At that point China was down 30 percent, EM overall had lost 23 percent and Turkey and Argentina had already troughed.
(Graphic: Timeline of when markets entered 'bear' territory - https://tmsnrt.rs/2B39pjO)
But EM has led the rebound too. MSCI EM began to claw up at the end of October, two months earlier than the world index. 
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) reckon funds have been putting money into EM stocks for the last 15 weeks and this month the index is up 7 percent, which is nearly as much as it surged last January before buckling so badly.
""We have seen more interest in EM assets for several months,"" said Aberdeen Standard's head of global strategy, Andrew Milligan. 
Another remarkable symmetry is that almost a year to the day since the bears first attacked, Turkish stocks have came full circle and achieved 'bull market' status - 20 percent up from their lows.
It has been Brazil that has really set pace in that respect though.
Its main stock market started to rebound from a 20 percent drop in June and was already a bull market by the time far-right but reform-focused Jair Bolsonaro won the first round of presidential elections in early October. Brazilian stocks are now up 40 percent from their lows and at an all-time high.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors' head of multi-asset funds, Sunil Krishnan, started buying up more EM assets back in November.
""If we are right that U.S. macro is in reasonable shape and at least in some areas trade dialogue between the U.S. and China will improve and Chinese authorities will be more aggressive with stimulus... then it should be a constructive year for EM.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Siemens and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) on Friday beefed up concessions aimed at allaying EU antitrust concerns about their rail merger deal, a person familiar with the matter said, in a belated and possibly futile move to stave off an EU veto against the deal.
German company Siemens and French peer Alstom have said their deal aims to help them better deal with China's state-owned CRRC Corp Ltd, an assertion dismissed by the European Commission.
The companies, which offered to license parts of Siemens's high-speed train business and sell parts of their signaling operations, are now prepared to share Siemens' high-speed train technology for 10 years instead of five in Europe, the source said.
They are also willing to extend non-exclusive licensing outside Europe but excluding China, Japan and South Korea, and sell more signaling assets, the person said.
Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said that the enforcer's investigation was ongoing. Bloomberg first reported the new concessions.
To convince EU regulators at this late stage of the process, concessions must fully and unambiguously resolve competition concerns, according to EU merger rules.
People familiar with the matter said last week that the EU competition watchdog will block the deal, with a decision likely on Feb. 6 ahead of the Feb. 18 deadline.
Competition agencies in Germany, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium have warned against the deal, saying that the first set of concessions fell short. Alstom unions have also criticized the deal. 

The Commission will brief national regulators on Jan. 31.

The report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said on the whole the prospects of loan repayment appeared to improve due to a strong economy.
""Federal banking agencies find that risk in the portfolio of large syndicated bank loans has declined, due to improving conditions in most sectors,"" the agencies said in a joint statement accompanying a regular review of big loans made twice per year.
At the same time, the agencies said a larger share of total loans were rated as ""below pass"" relative to prior economic cycles. 
Loans rated below pass are usually flagged by creditors because the borrowers have higher than average leverage levels or other reasons to doubt their ability to repay.
""Risks associated with leveraged lending activities are building in contrast to the portfolio overall,"" according to the report.

(Reuters) - Payday lenders' stocks have emerged as big winners during the record-long U.S. government shutdown, though the updraft could prove short-lived.
Shares of pawn brokers, payday lenders and other subprime consumer finance companies have rallied and outperformed the broader market since Dec 22, when 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or left working without pay.
Pawn broker chains EZCorp and FirstCash have jumped over 18 percent since that date, with no resolution in sight over congressional Democrats refusal to approve Republican President Donald Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in partial funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Companies that provide payday loans and other kinds of subprime consumer credit have also rallied. Enova International, Curo Group Holding and OneMain Holdings have each surged 23 percent.
(Graphic: Shutdown stocks - https://tmsnrt.rs/2B2EX9A)
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and other banks have helped with mortgage payments, overdraft fees and credit card costs to government workers, including employees from the Coast Guard, Transport Security Agency and other government workers struggling to make ends meet. 
But with federal workers on Friday missing their second consecutive paychecks, some are likely turning to subprime consumer lenders. Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring this week warned https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/1370-january-22-2019-herring-warns-virginians-about-scams-related-to-government-shut-down people to be wary of the risks associated with high-interest payday and online loans.
On Thursday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday urged furloughed federal workers facing a second missed paycheck to seek loans to pay their bills.
Investors should be also be careful, warned Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Barker, who said any potential increase in business for payday lenders and credit card companies is likely to disappear when the shutdown ends.
""These people are going to get their paychecks eventually. The market is not going to look at this as a long-term, sustainable uplift,"" said Barker, who has an ""overweight"" rating on OneMain Holdings. 
The shutdown has created uncertainty about consumer confidence, retail spending and the economy at large. Restaurants and other businesses in Washington that cater to federal employees have already taken a hit. But Wall Street has mostly shrugged off the shutdown, at least so far, even as it extends its lead as the longest in history. 
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG), go-to retail stocks for investors expecting economic downturns and weak consumer spending, have both gained about 13 percent since the shutdown began, better than the gain of more than 9 percent in the S&P 500, but in line with other U.S. retailers.
""I don't think the market has priced in that this government shutdown is going to last much longer to where it is really going to impact GDP,"" said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. ""Because it has never happened this long, nobody knows exactly how to discount it."" 

Meta Financial Group is set to report quarterly results on Monday. EzCorp is expected on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv, followed by FirstCash on Wednesday and World Acceptance on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Vodafone  (LON:VOD), the world's second largest mobile operator, said it was ""pausing"" the deployment of Huawei equipment in its core networks until Western governments give the Chinese firm full security clearance.
The United States and some allies, including Australia and New Zealand, have banned Huawei from 5G networks because of alleged ties to the Chinese government, while the firm has denied that its technology could be used by Beijing for spying. 
Vodafone's Chief Executive Nick Read said on Friday after reporting third-quarter results that the debate was playing out at a ""too simplistic level"", adding that Huawei was an important player in an equipment market which it dominates along with Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) Sweden's Ericsson and Nokia (HE:NOKIA). 
""We have decided to pause further Huawei in our core whilst we engage with the various agencies and governments and Huawei just to finalize the situation, of which I feel Huawei is really open and working hard,"" Read said.
Poland is set to exclude Huawei from 5G after it arrested a Huawei executive earlier this month on spying allegations. Huawei fired the man, who has denied wrongdoing.
Europe's mobile industry would face higher costs and delays to faster networks if authorities imposed a blanket ban on Huawei equipment, particularly the radio technology deployed on mobile towers, Vodafone's Read said.
Operators in Europe such as BT and Orange, have already removed Huawei's equipment or taken steps to limit its future use.
Read said Huawei's equipment was used in Vodafone's core - which he described as the intelligent part of the network - in Spain and some other smaller markets.
European governments and security agencies had not pressurized Vodafone into taking the step, but the ""noise level"" had increased, and the debate now needed more facts, Read said, adding that governments in Africa and the Middle East, where Vodafone also uses Huawei, had not raised concerns.
A spokesman for Huawei, which become the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker earlier this decade despite being shut out of the U.S. market, said it had been a long-term strategic partner to Vodafone since 2007.
""Huawei is focused on supporting Vodafone's 5G network rollouts, of which the core is a small proportion. We are grateful to Vodafone for its support of Huawei and we will endeavor to live up to the trust placed in us,"" he said.
However, Read said that Vodafone had already agreed terms with a range of 5G suppliers, so moving away from Huawei in parts of the roll-out would not incur additional costs.
TOUGH END TO YEAR
Shares in Vodafone fell after it reported a deterioration in its key revenue measure in the third quarter, down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 0.1 percent, reflecting price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa.
Analysts had expected growth of 0.3 percent and the stock fell to its lowest level since July 2010 after the update, trading down 2.9 percent at 140 pence at 1245 GMT. 
Vodafone said, however, that competition in the Spanish and Italian markets had moderated through the quarter and it improved its level of churn, or the number of customers leaving, by two percentage points year-on-year.
The company's Chief Financial Officer Margherita Della Valle said the performance improvements would start to show in the top line after the current quarter.
""We expect as we enter into the next fiscal year to start seeing the benefits in terms of revenue growth,"" she said.
Analysts at UBS said Vodafone performed well in net adds and churn across Europe, but they expected fourth quarter service revenue to drop to –0.5 percent, driven by weakness in Spain and tougher comparatives in Britain. 
""This is disappointing relative to prior comments that service revenues would be similar to the +0.5 percent seen in Q2,"" they said. 

Vodafone's reiterated its guidance for this year of around 3 percent growth in underlying adjusted core earnings, with free cash flow before spectrum costs of about 5.4 billion euros.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) also helped the broader market as it beat forecasts on profit, sales and comparable sales. Shares rose 2.9%.
Three-fourths of the 97 S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
But the earnings growth estimates for last quarter have dropped to 14.2% from 20.1% at the start of October, while 2019 profit growth estimates have come down to 5.8%, from 10.2% in the same period.
In Washington, there was some optimism that Democrats and Republicans could still make a deal to end the shutdown following a defeat in the Senate Thursday of two opposing plans to reopen the federal government.
But expect lots of headlines about what the arrest of former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone means for the White House.
According to The Guardian, the indictment against Stone alleges he made repeated attempts to contact WikiLeaks through an intermediary about documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, and passed on information about the documents to Trump’s election campaign team.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>","GE urges speedy fix for power turbine blades, says blade broke in 2015: sources","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is advising some buyers of its big power turbines to switch out faulty blades sooner than expected and has disclosed that a blade broke in 2015, according to a presentation reviewed by Reuters and people briefed on the matter.
The second blade break, which has not been previously reported, involved an earlier turbine model and was similar to a break last September that severely damaged a turbine in Texas and shut it down for two months of repairs. 
The defective blade issue affects GE's newest turbine technology, which cost billions of dollars to develop, and is among the challenges facing new Chief Executive Larry Culp as he tries to revive the profits and share price of the 127-year-old conglomerate.
GE's advice for fixing the problem can curb turbine use by utilities, according to the sources and utilities that use GE turbines, potentially threatening the revenue streams at the power plants.
At private meetings in Florida and London last month, GE executives said the company is offering extended warranty coverage and making spare parts available to ease concerns of insurers, lenders and utilities interested in buying turbines, according to a GE executive's slideshow presentation and three people who attended the meetings. Some said they signed non-disclosure agreements.
GE told participants that turbines with at-risk blades should run for fewer than about 7,000 hours depending on individual plant circumstances, before shutting down for blade replacement, according to two people who attended the meetings. GE said it had advised customers of the change. GE's previous guidance for blades was after 25,000 hours.
The executives also said in the meetings that the blade that broke in 2015 at an undisclosed power plant was in a GE 9FB turbine, which has similar technology to the HA turbine that broke in Texas. The 2015 break prompted GE to work on new protective coatings and alter a heat treatment process for the parts, a second presentation showed.
(GE turbine outage data: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rs5mU3) 
GE told Reuters that after the blade broke in 2015, GE did not know at first that the problem would also afflict its HA models.
""The HA components were in development before the initial 9FB issue occurred, and the HA units began to ship while the root-cause analysis was in process and before it was determined that it was a component issue that impacted the 9FB fleet and the HA,"" GE said in a statement to Reuters.
GE declined to provide more detail about the 2015 blade break or usage restrictions, saying some of the information is proprietary.
""We are executing the plan we laid out to fix the (blade) issue,"" GE said in a statement to Reuters. ""The feedback from customers has been positive, and they continue to choose the HA, which remains the fastest-growing fleet of advanced technology turbines in the world today.""
The details from GE's meetings come as GE is installing new blades in about 50 9FB and 52 HA turbines, according to a person familiar with the matter, fewer than the 130 estimated after the blade break in Texas prompted it to warn that other turbines are at risk for blade failure.
Reuters previously reported that GE found an oxidation problem, not a break, in 2015 and developed a fix before the failure in Texas.
Scaling back use of GE turbines reduces how much electricity they produce, a threat to revenues and profits for  Exelon Corp  (NYSE:EXC), PSEG Power LLC, Chubu Electric Power Co Inc and others with the 400-ton GE machines that form the core of modern gas-fired power plants, according to utilities and industry experts.
Japan's Chubu Electric said it learned about the blade problem with its six new GE turbines last October. It is restricting operation time at one of the two plants that use GE's HA turbines, but expects to have ""enough reserve capacity to generate sufficient electricity to meet demand during this winter,"" a spokesman told Reuters. He said Chubu will tally the financial impact ""depending on how long the plants would be shut down"" to replace blades. It expects repairs to be completed by the end of February.
PSEG Power and Exelon, based in the United States, declined to comment on how restrictions would affect them.
GE is continuing to sell turbines in a slumping market for big power plants, where it has lost share to rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn). GE has said it booked orders for three large turbines last month.
GE's share price fell after GE revealed a blade issue in Texas on September 19, saying such ""teething problems"" are not uncommon with new technology and would require ""minor adjustments"" to fix. GE has said it would set aside $480 million for repairs and warranty claims.
Three days after the break in Texas became known, Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF) shut down its HA turbine to replace blades. EDF did not respond to requests for comment.
At the London meeting, about 100 insurance industry people gathered in the oak-paneled Old Library room of Lloyd's of London on December 13, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information.
GE power executives Marcus Scholz and Tom Dreisbach gave presentations about GE's turbine technology. In its turbine documentation, GE has advised its power customers to inspect turbines with so-called ""Generation 1"" blades after 25,000 hours of use. GE said its improved blades, known as ""Generation 2,"" are designed to last 25,000 hours or more before being replaced.
According to page 11 of his presentation, Dreisbach said the Generation 1 blade that broke in 2015 failed after 22,000 hours. New parts treated with a special coating were inspected by technicians after about 12,000 and 16,000 hours and ""cracking (was) still observed,"" the presentation said.

GE inspected other turbines at about 7,000 hours and ""early stages of cracking (were) observed,"" the presentation said.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Europe tops buyers for U.S. LNG with winter cargo influx,"By Ekaterina Kravtsova and Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Energy companies are flooding Europe with U.S. natural gas, establishing a foothold in a market dominated by Russia and seen as a key battleground in Washington's efforts to curb Moscow's energy influence.
Europe is now the top buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) after a near fivefold spike in U.S. LNG sales to the continent this winter, overtaking South Korea and Mexico, a Reuters analysis showed. Profit rather than politics is driving the increase, despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for Europe to wean itself off Russian gas.
(Graphic: Total U.S. LNG exports by destination- https://tmsnrt.rs/2S34mcL)
Energy companies have switched sales to Europe after prices in Asia fell sharply on lower-than-expected demand. Prices in Europe, traditionally seen as a market of last resort, have held firm.
""It’s all about commercial reasons,"" said James Henderson, director of the natural gas research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ""U.S. LNG will go where there is the biggest margin.""
""There is no political motive here.""
U.S. LNG shipments to Europe totaled 3.23 million tonnes, or 48 cargoes, in October to January, compared to 0.7 million tonnes, or nine cargoes, a year ago. The United States is currently second only to Qatar, the world's largest LNG producer, as an LNG supplier to Europe, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The figures have not previously been reported.
(Graphic: Total European LNG imports by source - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RUgIEb)
LNG is natural gas frozen to a liquid state so that it can be transported in tankers. The industry is burgeoning, buoyed by demand from China, where the government is pushing to cut carbon emissions, partly by swapping from coal-generated power to gas.
Traders had expected Chinese demand to soar again this winter but Beijing had bought cargoes well in advance and so far, a mild winter has kept stocks high. A 10 percent tariff imposed by Beijing on U.S. LNG imports during a trade war also hurt.
Awash in supply, sellers of U.S. LNG have pivoted to Europe, where pipeline gas from Russia dominates.
Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) pumps 190 billion cubic meters, or the equivalent of 145 million tonnes a year (mtpa) to Europe, four times the current capacity of all U.S. LNG export terminals. A new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, will allow Russia to export even more gas to Germany, the largest consumer, although Washington is trying to halt work on the project.
LNG offers countries an alternative to piped gas and forces Russia to compete on price.
In response, Russia has joined the European LNG market through the Arctic Yamal production plant led by Novatek and is poised to become the world’s fifth largest LNG producer in 2019, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Since December, however, U.S. LNG has outgunned supply from Yamal into Europe, the Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
(Graphic: Russian Yamal vs U.S. LNG exports to Europe - https://tmsnrt.rs/2S4oYRS)
IT'S THE PRICE
Technological developments have enabled the United States to unlock cheap, abundant shale gas supplies and, after starting from scratch in 2016, it is expected to have enough capacity by the end of this year to make it the world's third largest LNG exporter behind Australia and Qatar.
Cheniere Energy, the top operator of U.S. terminals, added a fifth production line, or train, to its Louisiana Sabine Pass terminal in November, increasing capacity to 26 mtpa and commissioned a new 5.0 mtpa facility in Texas. 
Dominion Energy's 5.8 mtpa Cove Point plant opened last March. Up to 14 new facilities are expected to start up this year at three new terminals and one existing one.
A flourishing export business helps Washington's goal of reducing Europe's dependence on Russian gas.
Last year, Trump used trade negotiations to pressure the European Union to buy more U.S. gas. But with the exception of Poland and Lithuania, which have linked their purchases of LNG explicitly to national security, market forces are the biggest factor in sales.
In December and January, the Dutch gas price, which is used as a benchmark for LNG delivered to continental Europe, had been at the highest level since the winter of 2013-2014 at around $7.7 per million British thermal units (MmBtu), compared to previous winter seasons. Rising coal and carbon prices as well as expectations of cold weather have driven them up. 
In contrast, Asian spot prices for LNG dropped in December and January to their lowest level since the winter of 2015-16, averaging $8.8 MmBtu as the anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize. That cut the premium on sales to Asia over Europe to just above $1 MmBtu from close to $4 MmBtu last winter, insufficient to cover shipping costs.

Europe may not remain the top market for U.S. LNG, particularly if gas consumption in Asia spikes over the summer due to demand for air conditioning. 
In addition to Russia, Europe is also well supplied with gas from Norway, the Netherlands and Algeria and its use of coal, nuclear and wind to generate power means its demand for gas, used in some types of power stations, can be extremely flexible.
Still, many European utilities have long-term agreements with U.S. producers Cheniere, Dominion and  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) whose Cameron LNG plant is due to start this year. 
Britain's  Centrica  (LON:CNA) will start taking LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass in September and the company confirmed to Reuters that it had been buying U.S. cargos this winter. 
Spain's Naturgy,  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and Endesa also have contracts with Cheniere starting this year. 
""Much of the American LNG is looking for alternative markets aside from the Asian continent and, thanks to lower transport costs, Europe is the market that has benefited most,"" said Jose Simón, senior vice president of Global Gas at Iberdrola.
A spokesman for Endesa said U.S. gas had become more competitive. Naturgy, an early buyer from Cheniere, confirmed it has been selling U.S. cargoes into Europe this winter.
France's Total and EDF (PA:EDF) and Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) have U.S. contracts too. They did not respond to requests for comment.
And if Asian demand fails to materialize this summer, Europe is always an option.

""Because of the amount of available capacity into Europe and the fact that it's a price-sensitive, demand-elastic kind of market, if you can't find a better market ... into China, Korea, the assumption is you can always push it into Europe,"" said Jason Freer, Global Head of Business Intelligence at Poten & Partners, an energy and shipping consultancy.

Toyota sold 1.47 million vehicles in China last year, up 14.3 percent from 2017.
Toyota's forecast comes at a time when automakers in China in general are bracing for a tough year after weakness in sales emerged last year. 
China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) this month said it expects sales to show no growth, forecasting flat sales of 28.1 million vehicles for 2019. Other government and industry bodies see a 0-2 percent growth in overall demand. 
China’s automotive market last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s.
Despite the slowdown in the overall market, sales by Japanese companies especially Toyota remain strong.
Last year China and Japan pledged to forge closer ties during a three-day visit in October to Beijing by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, signing a broad range of agreements including a $30 billion currency swap pact, amid rising trade tensions with Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday, as strong earnings helped to underpin investor sentiment in the face of growing signs that the global economy is slowing and a still unresolved trade dispute between the United States and China.
The euro rebounded against the dollar after falling to its lowest in six weeks following Thursday's European Central Bank meeting.
European markets opened firmer, with the automakers and tech sector indices rising 1.5 percent and 1 percent respectively. The pan-European STOXX index hit its highest since Dec. 4, last up 0.7 percent on the day. (EU)
The gains came as stocks rose overnight in Asia and the United States on the back of strong earnings from U.S. tech firms. 
MSCI's All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day. But the gauge was set to break a four-week streak of gains as weak economic data and cautious soundings from central banks pulled the index half a percent down on the week.
Data at the start of the week showed China's economy grew at its slowest in 28 years in 2018, while purchasing manager indexes in Germany and the euro zone indicated stagnation in the bloc. On Thursday, the European Central Bank alluded to downside risks to growth for the first time in its statement since April 2017, while Germany cut its economic growth forecast for 2019.
SLOWDOWN
Somber news continued to trickle in on Friday, with German business morale falling for the fifth month in a row in January according to the Ifo business climate index.
For an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2B4fP26.
According to the latest Reuters polls of hundreds of economists from around the world, a synchronized global economic slowdown is underway and any escalation in the U.S.-China trade war would trigger a sharper downturn.
Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors said investors were taking some relief from the responses of policymakers.
""What they (investors) were not seeing last year was that activity was slowing but there was no reaction from central banks. They are seeing that now - we saw that from the ECB and the Fed has said it's not on a pre-set path."" 
That along with a rebound from poor liquidity in December explains why the risk tone in markets has been a bit better, he said.
In a note to clients, UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer Mark Haefele said that rhetoric on U.S.-China trade has become more positive, and that Beijing has taken steps to stimulate its economy.
""While economic and earnings growth is slowing, we believe it is unlikely that growth will drop far below trend,"" he said.
""At the same time, there are reasons to be cautious about policymakers' ability to follow through on their rhetoric.""
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington.
The two sides are ""miles and miles"" from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance they will get a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday.
In currencies, the dollar fell 0.3 percent against a basket of peers to 96.422. (DXY)
The euro (EUR=) was up 0.4 percent at $1.13490, bouncing back from a six-week low hit in the wake of ECB President Mario Draghi's downbeat comments on Thursday.
The ECB's post-meeting statement for the first time since April 2017 alluded to downside risks to growth.
The British pound was up 0.3 percent at $1.3076  after brushing a two-month high of $1.3140, lifted after The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday that Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has privately decided to back May's Brexit deal next week if it includes a clear time limit to the Irish backstop.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 07:18AM ET</span>",Hyundai Motor to cut China jobs after sales slump,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Yilei Sun
SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor said its Chinese joint venture (JV) is accepting voluntary retirements and reviewing various ""optimization plans"" at its factories following a slump in car sales in the key market.
China saw its first auto sales contraction in more than two decades in 2018 as pressure from a crippling trade war with the United States and the phasing out of tax cuts on smaller cars pummeled business in the world's biggest car market. 
A bleak outlook as China's economy slows has prompted many automakers, such as Nissan, to cut production in the country or, as with Suzuki Motor, even exit it.
For Hyundai, troubles have been exacerbated as it is also just recovering from a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing that had slammed demand for South Korean products in China. 
Hyundai, which with its affiliate Kia Motors was the No.3 automaker in China until 2016, turned in sales that were only half of its total production capacity last year.
""Hyundai Motor is reviewing various optimization plans to enhance facility efficiency around the Chinese New Year holidays,"" it said in a statement on Friday.
Chinese financial magazine Caixin reported that Hyundai's local joint venture expects 1,500 spare working roles in the first quarter, and has asked staff to choose to stay or leave, citing an internal document.
A spokeswoman for Hyundai said no decision had been made on the number of voluntary retirements.
Hyundai's China sales sank 23 percent in the fourth quarter amid a lack of attractive models and strong branding in the face of competition from both Chinese and global car makers. 
For the year, Hyundai's sales stayed nearly flat at 790,000 vehicles in China from a year earlier, compared with its total capacity of 1.65 million vehicles. 
IDLING
Hyundai has idled Chinese factories for a number of days since November because of rising inventories, a source familiar with the automaker's operations in the country said. 
Late last year, its factory utilization rates hovered below 50 percent, except for at its Beijing Hyundai Motor Company Plant 3, he added.
""We are agonizing over how to improve our competitiveness in China. It is a very tough situation, but we are trying to turn around China operations next year,"" another source with direct knowledge of Hyundai's China operations told Reuters. 
The weaker demand in China, as the economy grows at its slowest pace in about three decades, has also hurt other foreign players. In September, Suzuki Motor said it would exit the Chinese market, while, a source says, Nissan plans to produce fewer vehicles in the country in the months ahead.
At Hyundai's China JV, two workers said they were told in a briefing the plant was not being shut down, but being turned into a production line for new energy vehicles (NEVs).
The Hyundai spokeswoman declined to comment on NEV plans.

Hyundai has offered to move employees from its Beijing No.1 factory to Cangzhou, Chongqing - where it has one plant each - and to its two other plants in Beijing, three people briefed on the matter told Reuters.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 07:17AM ET</span>",Guns and corsets: Firearms industry strikes gold marketing to women,"By Daniel Trotta
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Entrepreneur and fashion designer Anna Taylor is trying to bring back the corset -- not to revive Victorian lingerie but to give women a place to carry their handguns.
""I don't know that the corset's ever been out of fashion, but it's never been so useful,"" Taylor said in Las Vegas at this year's SHOT Show, the largest trade show for the firearms industry. 
After overlooking the women's market for years, the firearms industry now sees women as the drivers of growth. Gun sales have declined since peaking in 2016, with companies like Remington Outdoor Company Inc going through bankruptcy reorganization last year, but the women's share of the market has been growing. 
Women have led the change, both as consumers and as entrepreneurs in the world of accessories, forcing gun-makers to follow their lead.
Retailers estimate women accounted for 23 percent of the $44 billion retail market for firearms and accessories in 2016, up 7 percentage points from 2010, according to data from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which runs the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show.
U.S. firearms sales peaked at 15.7 million in 2016, according to NSSF data. Sales fell to 14 million in 2017 and are on pace to dip again in 2018. The trend reflects politics, with sales driven by fears that a Democratic president will limit gun rights. 
CORSETS AND YOGA PANTS
Taylor created her own company, Dene Adams, in 2013 upon growing frustrated over the lack of holsters for women. 
She sewed a neoprene mouse pad into one of her corsets for her first prototype, and now has a lineup of 13 holsters for Dene Adams. Sales reached $250,000 in 2014 and grew to $1 million in 2018, she said. 
Among the hot items this year are yoga pants with enough support in the waistband to carry the weight of a gun. Taylor also pulled up the hem of her skirt, showing off her compression shorts with a built-in thigh holster that allows a woman to pack a piece whether she is dressed for a night on the town or Monday morning at the office.
Men's holsters have traditionally been designed around the belt, but because women wear a variety of outfits they need options in the bra, waist, belly, underarm, thigh, ankle and purse. That also means women need to practice their draw from multiple angles.
Firearms companies once engaged in what is derisively called ""pink it and shrink it,"" offering traditional guns in feminine colors and promoting smaller guns to fit a woman's hand, which is not necessarily a solution as lighter guns have more recoil. 
Carrie Lightfoot created the Well-Armed Woman in 2012 to give women easier access to information and products and now has 400 chapters across the United States. 
Lightfoot said gun makers such as Glock Inc, Sturm Ruger & Company Inc and Walther have since developed more sophisticated products and design changes.
Paul Spitale, a senior vice president at Colt's Manufacturing Company, said the company made famous by the .45-caliber handgun offers a wider range of 9-millimeter options, in part because the 9 mm is by far the most popular choice for women.
The female dollar has also affected the traditionally macho culture of guns and hunting. Major gun and ammunition makers now sponsor female competitive shooters.
SHOT Shows used to feature gun-toting models in high heels and push-up bras but exhibition booths now are staffed by knowledgeable women dressed in polo shirts and tactical gear.
""When I walked into my first SHOT Show in 2009, I was stunned"" at what she called the ""booth babes,"" said Claudia Chisholm, owner of Gun Tote'n Mamas, a company that makes purses for carrying handguns. ""It hasn't caught up yet with the rest of society, but it's a lot better. Thank God.""
Sales of her handbags, designed to enable women to draw within two seconds, have grown 1,000 percent in the past five years, Chisholm said. 
While the U.S. gun rights debate rages, women see their weapons as empowering. At a time when the #MeToo movement has raised awareness of sexual assault, firearms are ""the great equalizer,"" said Dianna Muller, a retired police officer from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who is now a full-time professional shooter. 

""Growing up, my generation of women have been told we can do anything that we want,"" she said.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank board members not pushing for Commerzbank tie-up: union,"By Holger Hansen
BERLIN (Reuters) - There is no desire among Deutsche Bank's supervisory board members for a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in the near-term, a Deutsche board member said.
""At the moment conditions are definitely not ripe,"" Frank Bsirske, a member of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board and chairman of Germany's Verdi trade union, said.
Merger speculation has heated up under Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken out in favor of strong banks in Germany and whose team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche, Commerzbank and major shareholders. 
""There is currently no one on Deutsche Bank's Supervisory Board who would want to merge with Commerzbank in the short term,"" Bsirske told journalists in Berlin late on Thursday.
Bsirske's comments are the most vocal yet from a member of the board that would eventually have to sign off on any merger.
Verdi fears massive job cuts would result if the two banks were to go ahead with a deal, following intense speculation of a possible tie-up between the two. 
The banks and the Finance Ministry declined to comment.
A merger may make sense in a few years' time but for now both banks have to focus on putting their own houses in order, Bsirske said, pointing to improving the investment bank, reducing complexity and enhancing infrastructure.
Asked about the possibility of a cross-border merger of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) with a foreign financial firm, Bsirske said it would be a good thing if they complemented one another.
But given Deutsche Bank's low share price, the German bank would enter into any partnership as a minority partner. ""And that's certainly not the way to go at the moment,"" he said.
""The CEO of Deutsche Bank, whom I think is a very good person for the role, has left no doubt about that. And this position is widely shared,"" Bsirske said.
Asked if Scholz were pushing for a merger, Bsirske said he was pretty sure that the finance minister was holding talks to get an assessment of the situation. 

""But I am also pretty sure that he is not trying to exert undue influence over business rationale and priorities that are currently being set in the banks. That would be completely counterproductive,"" he said.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hindu group RSS urges India's Modi to resist U.S. push to ease e-commerce curbs,"By Aditya Kalra and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A Hindu nationalist group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has urged him to resist pressure from the United States and not defer new regulations for the e-commerce sector, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The economic wing of the group, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is the fountainhead of the ruling party, has written to Modi saying that changing the policy implementation date, under pressure from Washington, will hurt 130 million small Indian entrepreneurs.
""There is no need to buckle under these pressures. India must continue to chart the way best for itself and the entrepreneurs,"" the Swadeshi Jagran Manch said in its letter, which was reviewed by Reuters.
The new rules, to be implemented from Feb. 1, will deal a blow to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's ambitions in the country. They mandate that e-commerce companies will not be allowed to sell products from firms in which they have an equity interest.
Reuters reported on Thursday the United States government had told Indian officials the new rules will hinder the investment plans of the two companies.
The rules, which will force the companies to change their business structures and raise operational costs, have sparked an extensive lobbying effort from both Amazon and Walmart, which last year invested $16 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart.
Both Amazon and Walmart have sought an extension of the Feb. 1 deadline, but government sources have said that was unlikely to happen as Modi needs millions of traders by his side in an upcoming national election due by May.
On Friday, the Confederation of All India Traders, which has supported tougher scrutiny of large e-commerce players, said ""the entire trading community will vote against the government if they extend the deadline"".
The e-commerce spat is the latest in a number of disputes over trade and investment relations between India and the United States. 
Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt told Reuters this week the company had ""engaged the (United States) administration on this issue"". 
The RSS has long advocated self-reliance and opposed the opening up of the Indian economy to foreign players. 
Small Indian retailers have alleged that e-commerce companies use their control over inventory from their affiliates to create an unfair marketplace that allows them to sell some products at lower prices, which hurts the businesses of brick-and-mortar retailers. Such arrangements would be barred under the new policy.

In front-page advertisements in newspapers last week, Walmart-owned Flipkart highlighted how the platform had helped transform local struggling businesses selling badminton racquets and sarees, a traditional dress.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Market rout overshadows business growth for U.S. life insurers,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - U.S. life insurers are expected to report messy fourth-quarter results starting next week, with their massive investment portfolios getting hit by tumultuous markets.
The market mayhem has already prompted analysts to knock down earnings estimates for major life insurers including Ameriprise Financial Inc (NYSE:AMP), Lincoln National Corp (NYSE:LNC) and Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), since late October.
Analysts have lowered Prudential's mean earnings-per-share estimate from $2.98 to $2.81, Lincoln National Corp from $2.24 to $2.12, and Ameriprise from $3.85 to $3.66, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv. 
""Even though these are annuity or retirement businesses, they are businesses that are driven by the assets they manage,"" said Sandler O'Neill analyst John Barnidge. 
Life insurers make money by investing premiums they receive for coverage, hoping to earn more than what they pay in claims, and also investing lump sums consumers hand over when buying annuities. 
But during the fourth quarter, stock and bond markets went into a spiral. 
The S&P 500 index fell 13.7 percent during the final three months of 2018, marking the worst performance for stocks in more than seven years. Global indices also felt the pain. For example, the MSCI All-World Index fell 13 percent, its worst quarterly performance since the 2011 third quarter. 
Life insurers have amped up risk taking in recent years, moving away from safer investments like Treasury bonds, as interest rates remained near rock-bottom levels. 
But during the fourth quarter investors sharply retreated from such investments, globally. Investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds lost the most value in single quarter relative to Treasury notes in more than seven years, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) Bank of America/Merrill Lynch fixed income index data. 
""It’s kind of the double whammy - you saw interest rates going down and the S&P going down. Both will have an impact here,"" said Elyse Greenspan, a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities LLC analyst. 
Other big financial companies whose earnings are highly exposed markets — including banks, hedge fund firms and big asset managers — also found the fourth quarter challenging. 
On Jan. 16, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest fund manager, reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday due to financial market turmoil. BlackRock's stock is down nearly a third from an all-time high near $600 per share last year, declining more than 21 percent in 2018.
""It should be a messier quarter for the group ... but we believe most of the focus will be the 2019 outlooks,"" Greenspan said in a Jan. 18 note. 
Despite the challenges, analysts pointed to positive signs in underlying life insurance businesses. For instance, strong sales of fixed annuities, for which consumers give a cash lump sum to an insurance company, guaranteeing they will not lose their principal while paying a fixed interest rate. 

""People are more likely to buy a fixed annuity when markets are volatile,"" Barnidge said.

The rally overshadowed the Senate’s failure Thursday to end the partial shutdown of the federal government, as well as comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross downplaying the chance of a major breakthrough on trade in discussions with Chinese officials next week.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>","Alibaba slams U.S. treatment of Huawei, efforts to curb China's rise","By Anne Marie Roantree and Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A senior  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) executive slammed the United States' treatment of China's Huawei Technologies as ""extremely unfair"", saying measures by the country to curb the firm's access to their markets was ""very politically motivated"". 
Joe Tsai, the e-commerce giant's executive vice-chairman, also sharply criticized what he called an attempt by the U.S. government to curb China's rise via a trade war.
He struck an optimistic note about China's economy, saying it remained fundamentally strong despite a slowdown, and added that stimulus such as tax cuts needed to be imposed to prop it up even as it battles U.S. efforts to dent its businesses.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has not only slapped crippling tariffs on Chinese imports, it has also stepped up scrutiny of Chinese investments in the country and torpedoed many deals citing national security concerns.
Huawei, the world's biggest network equipment maker, has been caught up in the crosshairs, with the United States alleging its products could be used by Beijing for espionage. 
Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegation.
""I think what the American government and together with the Five Eyes Alliance – what they're trying to do with Huawei - is a bit unfair, there's definitely a political agenda behind it,"" Tsai said at a Reuters BreakingViews event in Hong Kong.
The United States and its allies, Australia and New Zealand, have restricted Huawei's access to their markers, while Canada and the United Kingdom are reviewing whether to curb access. 
Last month, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's finance chief, was arrested in Canada, sparking a diplomatic row between Canada and China. She faces extradition to the United States.
Tsai, a Canadian passport holder, said he hoped the relationship between Canada and China would improve.
""I love Canadians, they're great,"" Tsai joked when asked about Meng's arrest, calling it a politically charged question.
""ANTI-CHINA PROBLEM"" 
Relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated rapidly amid a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs that has roiled financial markets and raised fears over the impact on global supply chains and investment plans.
""President Trump may have started it focusing on the trade deficit itself ... but over the course of the last nine months it was blown into a bigger anti-China problem,"" Tsai said, adding the trade war has spurred anti-China sentiment.
""It worries everybody.""
Alibaba has been previously critical of the trade war as well, with founder Jack Ma calling the spat the ""most stupid thing in the world.""
The company, which promised in 2017 to create a million U.S. jobs, backed out last year, blaming the trade war.
Tsai said U.S. regulators had made it very difficult for Alibaba to make investments in the country, adding that the company would look at other parts of the world for investment.
Just last year, a U.S. government panel rejected a bid by Ant Financial, which Ma owns together with Alibaba executives, to buy U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc on national security concerns.
Among the most high-profile Chinese deals to be scuttled under the Trump administration, the $1.2 billion deal's failure was a major blow for Ma, who was looking to expand Ant's footprint amid fierce competition back home from rival Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat.
CHINA OPTIMISM
Brushing aside the pains of the trade war, Tsai said people were over worried about China's economy. Chinese consumers are still fundamentally very strong and consumption in China is going to grow over the next 5-10 years, he said.
Comments from Tsai come at a time when China's economic growth has slowed to its weakest pace in nearly three decades amid faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs. 
Growth is expected to ease further this year.
Tsai said Alibaba will continue to invest aggressively despite the uncertain business environment.

Asia's second most valuable public company has been investing heavily in offline retail and rural e-commerce to win new customers as China's urban market shows signs of saturation.

1582,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Is Climate Change Drying Up German Rivers — and Growth?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Greg Fuzesi, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), has estimated that the low level of the Rhine and other important German rivers shaved off 0.7 percentage points of economic growth in 2018. The phenomenon, caused by a year of extraordinarily warm and dry weather, was almost certainly related to human-driven climate change.
The damage to the economy makes it even more urgent for Germany and other countries to start figuring out what weather anomalies will be more frequent because of climate change. While it was next to impossible until recently to determine whether a certain event was due to global warming, there now are methods that make such attribution possible.
The German economy only grew 1.5 percent in 2018. If Fuzesi is right, growth wouldn’t have dropped from the 2017 level of 2.2 percent had major waterways not dried up. According to his calculations, the drought was the second biggest slowdown factor for Germany after new emissions regulations that undercut car sales. 
Rivers, especially the Rhine, play a central role in moving fuel, raw and construction materials in Germany. According to official statistics, inland waterways carry about 5 percent of all cargo in Germany, almost two-thirds as much as the railroads. In January through September 2018, the rivers carried 156.7 million tons of cargo. That’s 6.1 percent less than the previous year, but the available data don’t cover the full extent of the decline, which was especially pronounced in the fall. Water in the Rhine is still considerably lower than average, and, according to a recent report from the broker Riverlake Barging, a standard 2,500-ton fuel barge traveling down the river can only be loaded to about 80 percent of capacity.
Germany has certainly experienced a weather anomaly: 2018 was the warmest and sunniest year since records began. And between February and November, the country was hit by an extraordinary drought, with only 75 percent of the average precipitation for the year. Not all the news was bad, however. The elevated temperatures probably contributed to making 2018 the ninth consecutive record year for the country’s tourist industry, and helped the beer industry register some growth after a considerable drop in 2017. There’s a higher than usual grape harvest, too. On the other hand, grain farmers were hard hit by the drought and called for government support.
Given the relatively slow growth of Germany’s mature economy, with its high capacity utilization, low unemployment and a population that’s barely increasing, extreme weather can wreak havoc with forecasts. It can even turn growth into decline: A few months of lightly loaded fuel barges on the Rhine can mean the difference between market pessimism and optimism about the state of the economy.
Climate scientists predict that extreme weather events will be more frequent with climate change. No country can fight this alone, and it’s probably impossible to prevent more economically damaging weather anomalies. So policy makers and businesses need to at least figure out what to expect.
For that, they must determine to what extent a particular weather anomaly can be attributed to climate change. As Paul Becker, vice president of the German Weather Service, put it, “Only with this knowledge is it possible to see which extreme events will change their frequency and intensity in the future and develop the measures necessary to adapt to it.” 
Recently developed methods allow this kind of attribution for specific events. Friederike Otto, a climate modeler at the University of Oxford, found that last year’s summer heat wave in northern Europe was twice as probable under current conditions than if human activities hadn’t affected climate.
The German weather service plans in the near future to start using similar methods and reporting the climate change component in extreme weather events. Hopefully, though, this won’t just serve to increase Germany’s preparedness for more droughts, heat waves and other unusual phenomena. Collective action is needed to mitigate climate change; adapting to it can only be a half-measure – and if the change accelerates, it may turn out to be a hopeless race."

1584,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>","Carney Says Jail for Bankers a Bluff, Hitting Pay Is Better","(Bloomberg) -- Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said threats of jail for bankers are just a bluff and the real weapon to improve behavior is hitting pay packets.
Carney was discussing the U.K.’s Senior Managers’ Regime, a response to the “relatively limited consequences” for senior bankers in the wake of the financial crisis. It works on the basis that ignorance is no defense, and makes managers responsible for anything that happens on their watch.
“If you have people doing the wrong thing and they’re not being overseen, they haven’t been trained, no remedial action, it will have consequences for compensation. And of course if it’s more serious, then it will be broader,” Carney, who is a former chair of the global Financial Stability Board, said on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Asked if the jail threat is real and will stop bankers being bankers, he said: “It’s a total bluff,” though he added that it may still happen to a few “on the margin.”
“Where it really hits is on deferred compensation and the ability for it to be clawed back,” he said. “Retaining that attitude and application over time as the memory of the crisis fades, that will be one of the big tests of the political reaction to this.”
Carney is due to leave the BOE next year. In an interview in Davos Friday, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the government is open to hiring another foreigner to replace him.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.6 percent by 0842 GMT, on track for its fourth straight weekly gain.
Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer, while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed.
The technology sector hit its highest level since Nov. 11 as investors drew comfort from better-than-expected earnings overnight from U.S. chipmakers. They shrugged off a profit and sales warning and fourth-quarter sales miss from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after the closing bell. 
 Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) and  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) reported quarterly results that beat analyst expectations, while Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc posted better-than-expected profits.
Those results helped soothe fears of stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. 
Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were the strongest performers, hitting Dec. 3 highs. Mining and oil stocks also gained.
Telecoms were the only sector in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. 
Vodafone was down 1.2 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. 
The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results.
Telia was down 4 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results, while Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) rose 2.6 percent after the mobile telecoms equipment company beat fourth-quarter forecasts and highlighted thanks to growing demand for next-generation 5G gear.
The news will likely underscore expectations the Swedish company could be well placed to benefit from current turmoil surrounding market leader Huawei.
Fragrance and flavor maker Givaudan was not far behind, falling 3.5 percent after it said its weaker-than-expected net income in 2018 was hit by higher financing costs and foreign currency losses.

Group revenue fell to 11.0 billion euros on a mixture of disposals, foreign exchange effects and a change in accounting standards. Earnings per share weren't disclosed.
The U.K. telecoms giant said the quarter had been in line with its expectations, and that it still expects its basic underlying earnings to rise by about 3% in the fiscal year ending in March. However, it continued to struggle in key European markets such as Italy and Spain, and a slowdown in its South African unit Vodacom (JO:VODJ) hit its non-European business.
""Overall, this performance underpins our confidence in our full year guidance,"" Chief Executive Nick Read said.
Vodafone's shares fell 0.8% in early trading in London to their lowest in over eight years.
The company repeated it expects to generate 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion) in free cash flow for the 2019 fiscal year, which will more than cover the dividend. Vodafone shares were yielding just under 8.9% at Thursday's close, reflecting fears that it isn't able to sustain its current payout ratio.
Vodafone’s shares in London had fallen 3.5% on Thursday after Vodacom reported a surprising drop in revenue in the quarter due to an unsuccessful promotion campaign. However, Vodafone said strong growth across the rest of its African business in the quarter offset that. Revenue from its non-European operations rose 4.9% in the period, down from 7.7% in the previous quarter.
It also reported a 2 percentage point drop in its churn rate among mobile customers, an improvement that Vodafone said wasn't yet reflected in its revenue numbers.

The firm added that it does not pose any security risk to the United States.
Earlier this month, the company said it had pleaded not guilty to U.S government charges that it stole trade secrets. 
The U.S Justice Department had last year launched an indictment against Fujian Jinhua and United Microelectronics Corp (TW:2303), alleging they attempted to steal trade secrets from memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc (O:MU).
The U.S. Commerce Department had put Fujian Jinhua on a list of entities that cannot buy components, software and technology goods from U.S. firms.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 10:52PM ET</span>",Tencent shares jump 3 percent after Chinese regulators approve new games,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd saw its shares jump more than 3 percent on Friday as investors cheered Chinese regulators' approval of mobile games published by the industry leader for the first time since a freeze on approvals imposed in March.
The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television on Thursday approved 95 games in its fourth list since December, with two mobile games from Tencent and a first from NetEase Inc.
Tencent, Asia's biggest listed firm by market value, has been reeling from increased scrutiny of online gaming amid calls to tackle child addiction in the world's largest gaming market.
Shares of the firm have lost roughly 20 percent of their market value since March. They were up as much as 3.2 percent early on Friday, beating a 1.3 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index and a 2.7 percent gain in Hang Seng sub-index tracking information technology firms.
China started resuming gaming approvals in December, though Tencent's games had been absent from the three batches approved until Thursday, unnerving investors.
The impact of online games on the country's youth has attracted scrutiny from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who last year urged all levels of government to implement effective schemes to prevent and treat the high incidence of myopia that authorities suspect is linked to game addiction.
China's largest gaming and social media firm has imposed a playtime restriction since July, allowing a maximum of one hour a day for children 12 years old and under, and a maximum of two hours for those aged 13 to 18.
Founded in 1998, Shenzhen-based Tencent enjoyed uninterrupted growth from when it went public in 2004 until last year when it saw more than $200 billion wiped off its market value from a peak hit in January.

Last week, Tencent released a test version of a third-party developed smartphone game in China based on U.S. hit television show Games of Thrones, bolstering its pipeline.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 09:35PM ET</span>","Ford CEO tells employees: 'Time to bury' 2018, focus on doubling profit","By David Shepardson and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Chief Executive Jim Hackett told employees late on Thursday the No. 2 U.S. automaker would not accept last year's ""mediocre"" results and said the company was aiming to nearly double its annual operating profit.
Hackett made his comments in an email to employees that was seen by Reuters.
Ford is restructuring its global operations, including recent plans to make cuts in Europe. It also has announced an alliance in commercial vehicles with Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), with plans to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, in moves meant to save billions of dollars.
Ford announced its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, reporting a 2018 operating profit of $7 billion with a profit margin of 4.4 percent, down from 6.1 percent in 2017. Ford said last week that its target for operating margin was more than 8 percent.
""2018 was mediocre by any standard,"" Hackett said in the email. ""Yes, we made $7 billion last year. But think of it this way: this represents a 4.4 percent operating margin, about half what we believe is an appropriate margin. So we are aiming for much closer to $14 billion.""
Hackett did not give a timetable for hitting the $14 billion target. A Ford spokesman said Hackett was simply doing the math to show employees how the margin target translated to overall profit.
Hackett, who has been on the job for 20 months, also said that it was ""time to bury the year (2018) in a deep grave, grieve over what might have been and become super focused on meeting, and, in fact, exceeding this year's plan.""
Ford did not provide Wall Street with a specific financial forecast for 2019. It simply said it had the potential to improve earnings and revenue. 
That was in contrast to Ford's larger U.S. rival, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which on Jan. 11 forecast higher 2019 earnings that far surpassed analysts' estimates. 
Hackett also said in looking at Ford's 2018 results: ""I become mad for a short time. Likely mad at myself, but also because I know we are better than that. ... I know that our competition hasn’t been better than us by magic.""  

He said Ford had been considering moving up its time frame to electrify its product portfolio since he took over and asked how the company could learn from the trends it missed in China, the world's largest auto market, where it is losing money.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 09:34PM ET</span>","Subaru probe finds 3,400 staff were not paid for overtime work","TOKYO (Reuters) - Subaru Corp on Friday said it did not pay overtime wages over a two-year period to some 3,400 employees who under-reported their hours, a revelation that surfaced in an internal probe following the 2016 suicide of an overworked employee.
The Japanese automaker, known for its Legacy and Forester cars, said the outstanding wages - from mid-2015 to mid-2017 and totaling 776 million yen ($7.08 million) - were paid retroactively to 3,421 workers last March.
The news was first reported in Japanese media on Friday after representatives of the deceased worker's family disclosed some of the findings this week.
In 2016, a 46-year-old white-collar worker jumped to his death from the roof of a Subaru factory in what authorities ruled as 'karoshi', or death from overwork. At the time, Subaru was enjoying bumper sales and profit due to the popularity of its cars in the United States, its main market.
In its probe, Subaru found the majority of workers it surveyed said they under-reported overtime hours ""so as not to exceed the limit for the budget for overtime work"".
It said it has since taken steps to make sure workers are unable to falsely report their actual work hours.
The automaker also said it owed the deceased worker 4.08 million yen in overtime pay, and that it remained in settlement talks with his family.

The pay issue comes after the revelation of governance lapses at the automaker since 2017 involving flawed vehicle inspections. That has led to the recall of hundreds of thousands of cars, pulling down Subaru's profit.

Speaking to Chinese-language media in a Toronto suburb on Tuesday, McCallum said Meng had ""good arguments on her side"" in her case.
""I regret that my comments with respect to the legal proceedings of Ms. Meng have created confusion. I misspoke. These comments do not accurately represent my position on this issue,"" McCallum's statement said. 
Meng's arrest in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the behest of the United States enraged China, which has called for the extradition case to be dropped. The United States has until Jan. 30 to formally request her extradition over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran. 
Canada's government has emphasized that it follows the ""rule of law"" and cautioned against politicizing the case after U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters last month he would intervene if it served U.S. trade or national security interests.
In his Tuesday remarks, McCallum said Trump's comments and the fact that Canada had not applied the same sanctions against Iran as the United States made for ""strong arguments"" Meng could make before a judge. She next appears in court on Feb. 6.
Meng has been released on bail and is living in one of her two multi-million Vancouver homes, wearing a GPS ankle bracelet and watched by security guards when she leaves the house.
The case has made for tense Canada-China relations. Two Canadians were detained in China following Meng's arrest, and a third was sentenced to death on drug charges.
Neither Canada nor China has explicitly tied these actions to Meng's arrest but some former diplomats have suggested this is a ""tit-for-tat"" issue.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Wednesday that he is focused on getting detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor out of China and recalling McCallum would not help their case.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a ruling that resurrected a billion-dollar copyright case brought by  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) that dates to 2010.
Google urged the high court to rule its copying of Oracle's Java programming language to create the Android operating system was permissible under U.S. copyright law.
A jury cleared Google in 2016, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed that verdict in March 2018 and set the stage for a jury trial to determine monetary damages.
Google said the Federal Circuit's ruling in favor of Oracle was a ""devastating one-two punch at the software industry"" that would chill innovation.
Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley said in a statement that Google is rehashing arguments that have already been discredited.
""The fabricated concern about innovation hides Google's true concern: that it be allowed the unfettered ability to copy the original and valuable work of others for substantial financial gain,"" Daley said.
The litigation involves how much copyright protection should extend to Oracle's Java programming language, which Google used to design the Android operating system that runs most of the world's smartphones.
Oracle is seeking royalties for Google’s unauthorized use of portions of the Java language known as application programming interfaces (APIs), which are tools that allow different computer programs to talk to each other. 
Google has said copyright protection should not extend to APIs because they are essential tools for creating software.
Google has also argued that its copying of them is permissible under the fair-use defense, which allows unlicensed use of copyrighted works for purposes such as research.
The litigation has already produced several reversals of fortune.
Following a deadlocked jury verdict in 2012, a federal judge in San Francisco sided with Google and said the APIs were not copyrightable.
The Federal Circuit disagreed in 2014, leading to a second jury trial in 2016 on whether Google was shielded by the fair use defense.
Oracle argued during the 2016 trial that Google copied Java because it was desperate to enter the smartphone market and that internal emails showed company representatives believed they needed to pay for a license.
Google countered that the APIs were written for personal computers and it transformed them for use in smartphones in a manner that caused no economic harm to Oracle.
The jury sided with Google, denying Oracle's bid for about $9 billion in damages.

The Federal Circuit said in its 2018 decision that Google could not invoke the fair use defense because it copied the Java APIs verbatim and ""for an identical function and purpose.""

In an interview on CNBC on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said while he acknowledged there is a “fair chance” of a trade deal, and that he thinks both China and the U.S. are eager to end their trade war, he is concerned that the two nations remain far apart on trade.
“Trade is very complicated. There are lots and lots of issues,” he said.
Ross added that the two sides have been making progress on “easier” issues like how much of certain American products the Chinese will agree to buy, such as soybeans and liquefied natural gas.
On the other hand, contradicting Ross’s comments, White House Economic Adviser Lawrence Kudlow later said President Donald Trump is optimistic about trade talks, adding that he expected the January jobs report would be up a significant amount.

It’s seemed like a case of the Mondays all week. The world’s three biggest economies are in a funk, helping to kill the mood in Davos on top of all the trade-war jitters.
Here’s our weekly wrap of what’s going on in the world economy.
A Cold Sweat
The limelight on China’s economic slowdown got even more intense this week, and it’s all making President Xi Jinping sweat enough to make an unusual address to party leaders about the dangers of a downturn. Trade and investment are taking a real hit, and retail and real estate are declining especially swiftly, while corporate America worries about flailing Chinese consumption. The weakest-since-Mao birth tally isn’t helping things, and the worst is yet to come, Bloomberg Economics analysis shows. Over in Japan, manufacturing stalled, and the situation in Europe is similarly dire. Unsurprisingly, the mood on the outlook was morose in Davos, with the IMF charting the weakest world growth in three years.

(Trade) Talk is Cheap
Markets are still taking a wild ride while keeping up hopes of a U.S.-China breakthrough by the March 1 deadline, but the talks are falling short on the critical intellectual property issues. Each side added stresses this week, with a bit of taunting from President Donald Trump and the top White House economic adviser saying a deal hinges on enforcement and structural changes. China called a U.S. warning to Israel about Chinese investment “ridiculous” and the vice president rebutted Trump in Davos, though not by name.
While the he-said-she-said game is a bit murky, the data are decidedly downbeat, with two of the 10 global trade gauges we’re watching falling into the danger zone. South Korea, Taiwan and Japan shouldered particularly bad exports reports this week.

Patience: Pause or Put?
Central banks are fast losing their chance to tighten before the next downturn in the cycle, though it’s still unclear what the Federal Reserve’s “patience” means for interest-rate hikes this year. Ray Dalio’s leading a crowd calling for a rethink on policy tightening amid all the weak growth signs. The Bank of Japan never threatened on that front, holding policy in an expected decision while the cut to its inflation outlook reveals a bitter reality. In the euro area, Mario Draghi downgraded his assessment of economics risk, but hasn’t yet signaled any rate hikes will be delayed.

Shutdown Economics
Meanwhile, the world’s biggest economy endures a shutdown that’s a month old and counting, and the White House says a zero-growth quarter is possible if this carries on through March.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Weak Intel outlook stokes fears of a chip slowdown,"By Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below analysts' estimates and missed fourth-quarter sales estimates on Thursday, hit by a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips. 
The company's shares fell 6.7 percent in extended trading as the news further stoked fears of an industry slowdown after sales warnings from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy.
Those fears had lifted briefly earlier this week with better-than-expected quarterly results from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc,  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) and  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX). But after Intel's report on Thursday, shares of smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which reports results next Tuesday and Nvidia Corp fell.
Intel said weaker demand from China hurt the company's data center chip business, which has driven growth in recent years as PC sales have slowed and cloud-based services have become more popular.
In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time ""digesting"" the chips as they build out their centers.
Sales in China fell because some buyers there - especially cloud computing vendors - seem to have bought chips earlier than usual last year because of fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, Swan said. U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added.
""I do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,"" Swan said. ""But overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they've ever been. We're just in a digesting period.""
That digestion period could last until the second half this year, when Intel's management said it expects data center growth to pick up again. ""We see the cloud companies as focusing on optimizing the data centers that have been deployed,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. 
For years, Intel had been insulated from swings in Apple's iPhone supply chain because it was not a major supplier. But it was the sole provider in 2018 of iPhone modems, which connect phones to wireless data networks, and earlier this month, Apple cut its revenue forecast, citing weak demand in China.
Swan said Intel's modem business grew by 60 percent over last year but still came in about $200 million below target. The modem unit had ""fantastic growth, but weaker than we expected, and as a result that impacted our revenues for the quarter,"" Swan said.
Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $17.35 billion and a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""The macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group.
Intel's search for a permanent CEO has lasted six months. Last June, then-CEO Brian Krzanich resigned after a probe of a relationship with another Intel employee.
""I am convinced the board will close on a new CEO in the near future, and I believe the management team, myself and the 107,000 employees will rally behind him or her to take this company as a whole new level,"" Swan said on a conference call with investors. ""In the meantime, we will not be distracted by the void.""
Fourth-quarter revenue in the higher-margin data center business came in at $6.07 billion, below expectations of $6.35 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
Revenue in the client computing business, which includes sales to PC makers was $9.82 billion, missing FactSet estimates of $10.01 billion.
Intel reported https:// net income of $5.20 billion, or $1.12 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 29, compared with a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.
Net revenue rose to $18.66 billion from $17.05 billion, but missed estimates of $19.01 billion.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.28 per share, above expectations of $1.22.

1600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 07:00PM ET</span>",Starbucks Is Basically a China Stock Now,"(Bloomberg) -- As China goes, so goes Starbucks.
The chain, which helped introduce Americans to European coffee culture, is under pressure from Wall Street to do the same in China. It’s opening stores at a rate of nearly 600 a year, but an economic slowdown there, exacerbated by the trade war with the U.S., have curbed its previously breakneck sales growth.
The coffee giant’s same-store sales in the country were up just 1 percent last quarter -- better than the surprise drop reported early last summer but a far cry from the 8 percent growth it was logging just a few quarter prior. Transactions in China, where Starbucks has about 3,700 stores and is opening a new one roughly every 15 hours, were down 2 percent, meaning higher prices -- not more foot traffic -- are propping up results.
Its shares rose about 2 percent in late trading, suggesting the results were good enough -- for now. It helped that global sales and earnings beat analysts’ estimates for the quarter. But investors are eventually going to want more out of China, especially as new locations draw customers away from older ones.
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). is betting on a massive expansion in the country to drive growth amid concerns it’s already saturated the U.S. The China push comes at a challenging time. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). spooked the market earlier this month by warning Chinese demand was waning, and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. is reportedly cutting its spending on travel and postponing some new hiring as China’s largest e-commerce company braces for a slowing economy.
Meanwhile, coffee competition is heating up, as Chinese startup Luckin Coffee spends millions of dollars a year opening outlets to unseat Starbucks.
The company’s banking on its ability to “continue to navigate a rapidly changing consumer, economic and competitive environment” in China, John Culver, who runs the Seattle-based company’s international unit, said in an interview after results were released Thursday.
Starbucks -- which celebrated its 20th anniversary in China this month -- is on its way to having 6,000 sites there by 2023. It’s counting on delivery to help it crack the market, and it’s now offering the service at 2,000 of its locations in the country.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 06:55PM ET</span>",Starbucks top sales forecasts as holiday drinks make comeback,"By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) exceeded Wall Street forecasts for quarterly sales on Thursday, led by the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States, where its growth has been cooling in an increasingly crowded market for coffee houses.
The world's largest coffee chain said it listened to customers and brought back its much loved red-colored cups and holiday favorites such as Peppermint Mochas and Gingerbread Lattes during the final three months of 2018.
""This comprehensive, insight-driven approach delivered results and importantly, created momentum that provides a solid foundation for future quarters,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said on a conference call with analysts.
The Seattle-headquartered company, which is battling high-end coffee houses and smaller upstarts in the United States, has rolled out promotions, especially during slow afternoons to pull in more customers.
Iced beverages and its Draft Nitro cold brew which aims to create a beer-like experience have been particularly successful, and the company said its morning and afternoon sales in the December-quarter was the best in five quarters.
Partnerships with food-delivery companies and an increased focus on customer service through its mobile app are also helping boost sales, Starbucks executives said.
Globally, the company's same-restaurant sales rose 4 percent during the December-quarter, topping analysts' average estimate of a 2.8 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Overall, we believe it was a solid quarter and this is another quarter that reinforces our view that the turnaround is showing progress and gaining some steam,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.
Sales from Starbucks' Americas and U.S. business reached a record $4.6 billion in the three months ended Dec. 30, while same-restaurant sales in China, its second biggest market, also showed an increase.
In China, where the company competes with local brands like Luckin Coffee, sales at established Starbucks cafes beat estimates, driven mainly by new store openings and its delivery program that now supports 2,000 stores across 30 Chinese cities.

Starbucks shares were last higher by 1.5 percent at $65.75 in after-hours trading on Thursday, easing from a 4 percent advance earlier.
The company's quarterly net revenue climbed 9.2 percent to $6.63 billion, beating analysts' forecasts of $6.49 billion.
Net earnings attributable to Starbucks fell to $760.6 million from $2.25 billion a year earlier, reflecting nearly $1.8 billion in gains last year from acquisitions and the sale of some businesses.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned 68 cents per share, beating estimates by 3 cents.

1602,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 06:50PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Intel Slumps, Starbucks Edges Higher
Chips giveth and chips taketh away.
The semiconductor stocks pushed an otherwise sluggish broader market into the green today with some large moves on stellar numbers.
But Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) report after the bell today is likely to rain on that parade tomorrow.
Intel’s revenue and guidance came in below expectations, sending shares down 7% after hours.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) could provide a little lift to the market at tomorrow’s open if it can hold onto its small postmarket gain of 1%.
Starbucks beat on the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter and also beat comparable sales estimates. But it lowered the top range of its full-year comparable sales guidance.
2. Colgate-Palmolive Weights In
As usual, Friday’s are slower for earnings, but consumer products giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) will report numbers.
On average, analysts expect that Colgate earned 73 cents per share in its most recent quarter on sales of about $3.8 billion.
Colgate stock has been volatile and is down over the last three months.
Shares took a tumble with the rest of the market in December, but have risen in 2019, helped by an upgrade earlier this month by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to buy from neutral the expressed optimism on the company’s organic sales.
3. Oil Ignoring the Numbers?
Looking at the data, oil prices should’ve ended lower today. But geopolitics overshadowed a huge and unexpected rise in U.S. oil inventories and a sharp build in gasoline stockpiles.
So, while tomorrow brings the weekly Baker Hughes rig count, traders may be more interested in the comments from world leaders about Venezuela.
The U.S. has drafted a slate of potential restrictions on Venezuelan crude exports, but hasn’t decided whether to deploy them, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. It added that the crisis in Caracas could expedite OPEC’s goals of balancing the supply-demand in oil and boosting crude prices or risk market havoc.
The U.S. has called for a meeting at the UN Security Council on Saturday to discuss the crisis in that country.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>",Mercedes-Benz to ramp up business with China auto suppliers,"STUTTGART (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) will deepen partnerships with Chinese auto suppliers since they often lead United States and European rivals in key technologies for electric cars and connected vehicles, Mercedes-Benz executive Wilko Stark said on Thursday. 
Stark, who is currently head of Procurement and Supplier Quality at Mercedes-Benz said the shift toward electric and connected cars has made it more dependent on battery cell chemistry and connected vehicles expertise from outside the company.
""We will think about partnerships in some areas. The role of partnerships as a whole will gain in importance,"" Stark said during a news conference in Stuttgart to discuss the German carmaker's procurement strategy.
Mercedes-Benz will rely more on its suppliers to take a leading role in the area of research and development as well as to identify cost-cutting potential through process optimization, Stark said.
""We will intensify scouting of Chinese suppliers. China is more advanced than the United States in many areas of digital innovation,"" Stark said on Thursday. 
""China will dramatically increase in importance,"" Stark said referring to the raft of suppliers that Mercedes-Benz does business with. 
China, a market where the luxury passenger car brand sold 674,125 cars last year, is setting the pace in terms of rolling out electric mobility and digital services like mobile phone-based payment systems, giving local suppliers an edge over European and United States competitors, Stark said.
""In the area of connectivity services, the Chinese are ahead of the Americans; we have no choice but to deepen our relationship with these suppliers,"" he said, naming China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent as leading players.
Daimler is also thinking about a broader alliance on batteries in view of the challenge of trying to police potential ethical or human rights violations in mining of rare earth minerals - such as cobalt, which is often found in conflict zones, but is needed for electric car batteries.
""But there are no formal decisions in this area,"" Stark added.
Mercedes is also scouting suppliers for innovations to see whether the German carmaker could make use of a more compact, lighter electric vehicle battery.
Stark noted that denser, cheaper batteries with shorter recharging times could also allow Mercedes to bring down the cost of electric cars closer to their equivalent combustion-engined variants.
""Overall volume and weight are as important as energy density,"" Stark said, referring to battery cells. 
By bundling orders for components for conventional and electric vehicles with the same supplier, Mercedes-Benz hopes to help its supplier base manage the transition between electric and non-electric cars.
Separately, Stark said the replacement of Carlos Ghosn as  Renault  (PA:RENA) chairman will have no impact on an alliance between Renault and Mercedes.
""We have a relatively stable cooperation and supply agreement with Renault-Nissan. This supply relationship is stable and will remain unchanged,"" Stark said.

Renault on Thursday appointed  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard as its new chairman after Carlos Ghosn was forced to resign in the wake of a financial scandal that has rocked the French carmaker and its partner Nissan.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A well-timed trade in the options on PG&E Corp reaped a massive paper profit on Thursday after the electric utility's shares soared following a state regulator clearing the company from any responsibilities related to the 2017 Tubbs wildfire.
PG&E shares soared 75 percent after the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) on Thursday cleared the company of the Tubbs Fire in 2017, saying the blaze was caused by a private electrical system close to a residential structure.
Minutes before the shares jumped, an unnamed trader paid $200,000 for 10,000 call contracts betting on the shares rising above $12 by Feb. 8. PG&E Corp shares were at $7.34 at that time.
Buying a call conveys the right to purchase shares at a fixed price in the future. 
With the shares jumping to $13.95, the value of these contracts on paper rocketed to $3.7 million.
The trades took place at 2:39 p.m. EST, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. The news release on the Tubbs fire was issued at about 3:10 p.m. EST, according to CAL FIRE spokesman Scott McLean.
""Even if it was just a lotto ticket trade, it's an extreme case of leverage paying off,"" said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert in New York.
On Wednesday, another 10,000 call contracts betting on PG&E Corp shares rising above $10 by Feb. 1 were bought for $300,000. By the close of trading on Thursday, on paper these contracts were worth $4.7 million.
The two trades are likely to have been made by the same trader, Schwartz said, adding that they are likely to invite regulators' scrutiny.

Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals and other news that tends to move stock prices, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Three major U.S. airlines said on Thursday the U.S. government partial shutdown had not yet had a major financial impact but a tipping point might be near.
The carriers expressed their concerns after reporting quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations thanks to healthy passenger demand. 
""It is maddening ... No one can predict what impact it will have as it continues,"" Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co Chief Executive Gary Kelly said of the shutdown.
A Reuters poll of economists showed that U.S. economic growth will take a hit this quarter from the government shutdown, in its 34th day and the longest in U.S. history. Airlines in turn will feel the impact because their fortunes are tied closely to the health of the economy. 
As a result of the shutdown, airport security workers and air traffic controllers continued to go without pay, stretching staffing and creating long lines at some airports and flight delays.
The Transportation Security Administration said 7.5 percent of the nation's 51,000 airport security officers were absent on Wednesday, down from a recent high of 10 percent on Sunday. 
Federal workers who oversee route authorizations and aircraft certifications were also furloughed because of the shutdown, delaying Southwest's plans to launch service to Hawaii early this year. 
Two measures to end the partial U.S. government shutdown - one backed by Republicans and one by Democrats - failed in the Senate on Thursday.
Most airlines said the financial impact of the shutdown thus far had been limited, but JetBlue Airways Corp Chief Executive Robin Hayes warned that the U.S. aviation system is nearing a ""tipping point.""
""And the longer this goes on, the longer it will take for the air travel infrastructure to rebound,"" Hayes said. 
No. 1 U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said the shutdown caused ""a bit of softness"" for flights in the next 14 days. 
""We encourage the government to get reopened,"" American Chief Executive Doug Parker said.
STRONG DEMAND
All three airlines that reported earnings before the markets closed on Thursday beat Wall Street expectations -- American, Southwest and JetBlue. 
The profit beats, which mirrored solid results from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines earlier this month, boosted shares and eased concerns about the impact of slower global economic growth. 
Shares of American and Southwest each closed 6 percent higher while those of JetBlue ended up 5 percent, lifting the broader Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index.
American said overall demand, including for corporate travel, remained strong, and forecast $1 billion of additional revenue in 2019 as it continues to expand its Premium Economy product and adds gates at its Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs.
The company, based in Fort Worth, Texas, forecast an increase in full-year earnings per share of 21 percent to 65 percent, compared with the 30 percent expected by analysts on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It said net income, excluding special items, rose 8.3 percent to $481 million, or $1.04 per share, in the fourth quarter. That beat analysts' estimate of $1.01 per share.
Total operating revenue rose 3.1 percent to $10.94 billion.
Southwest, the fourth-largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said revenue per available seat mile would rise in the 4 percent to 5 percent range in the first quarter after a 1.8 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
Net income at Southwest, a low-cost carrier, fell 63 percent to $654 million, or $1.17 per share, in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier, when it recorded a big tax benefit. EPS beat analysts' average estimate of $1.07, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

New York-based JetBlue, the sixth-largest U.S. airline, also posted a fourth-quarter profit on Thursday above Wall Street estimates.

But disappointing revenue and guidance sent shares slumping after hours. The shares were down 7.1% to $46.23. The shares were up $1.82, or 3.8%, in regular trading.
The chipmaker reported earnings per share of $1.28 on revenue of $18.66 billion, up 9.4% Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $1.22 on revenue of $19.02 billion. That compared to EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $17.05 billion in the year ago quarter.
Investors were disappointed that first-quarter guidance came in at 81 cents a share. The S&P Capital IQ estimate was $1.01. First-quarter revenue was projected at $16 billion, while the estimate was $17.4 billion. Earnings guidance for the year was a bit better: $4.60 a share. The Street expects $4.54. But revenue, projected at $71.5 billion, was lower than the Street estimate of $73.22.
Fourth-quarter revenue was was held back by weaker modem demand, economic slowing in China, cloud customers able to absorb demand and weakening demand for NAND chips.
""The macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group.
Intel has turned to the server chips it supplies data center operators for growth in recent years. However, fourth-quarter revenue in that higher-margin business came in at $6.07 billion, below expectations of $6.35 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
Intel said the data center business missed expectations on softer demand from China and slower cloud sales.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",Hedge fund prepares proxy fight to oust embattled PG&E's board,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - PG&E Corp shareholder BlueMountain Capital Management LLC said on Thursday it is preparing a challenge to the embattled utility owner's board, arguing its plan to file for bankruptcy in the wake of catastrophic wildfires in California is harming investors.
The hedge fund, which owns about 2 percent of PG&E, said it is trying to rally support from other shareholders to replace all 10 of the company's board members at this year's annual meeting expected in May.
BlueMountain's chances of success are remote, given that PG&E has said its bankruptcy filing may come as early Jan. 29. However, the maneuvering could end up giving BlueMountain a bigger role in any bankruptcy negotiations.
""As we noted in our letter today, shareholders retain their corporate governance rights in bankruptcy,"" a BlueMountain spokesman said.
The hedge fund and other shareholders could potentially be in line to sit on a so-called equity committee that a bankruptcy judge would be empowered to appoint as part of PG&E's court proceedings.
Such a committee would have the ability to litigate during PG&E's bankruptcy case and gain leverage to improve financial recoveries as the company develops a reorganization plan.
""We expect to announce the new slate no later than February, 21, 2019,"" BlueMountain said in an open letter https://www.bluemountaincapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BlueMountain-letter-to-PGE-Shareholders-dated-1.24.19.pdf to PG&E shareholders on Thursday. 
""In order to rebuild essential relationships and restore trust, the company needs an entirely new board,"" the letter said. This is the second time the hedge fund has run a proxy contest and it did not identify its intended nominees in the letter.
PG&E is reeling from potentially crushing liabilities associated with deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that ripped through California communities, killing dozens of people and destroying homes.
The company forecasts its liabilities from the blazes could exceed $30 billion. The utility owner is facing scrutiny over the role of its equipment in the fires. 
With a new board and fresh oversight, the hedge fund forecast that the company's share price could trade at $50 in the future. PG&E shares were down 1 percent at $7.91 in morning trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $4.2 billion. 
""When sound governance is restored, and structural issues addressed, the company will resolve its financial issues,"" the hedge fund wrote.
BlueMountain's move, while a potential distraction for PG&E during its expected debt restructuring, would need additional support from other shareholders, like hedge funds Baupost Group, D.E. Shaw and Hound Partners, among others, to succeed. 
PG&E, the biggest U.S. power utility by customers, provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California.
'UNNECESSARY BANKRUPTCY'
BlueMountain has publicly challenged PG&E Corp's plan to file for bankruptcy protection as early as next week, which the company revealed to employees earlier this month in part due to a California law requiring such notification.
The board's ""intention to file a voluntary, costly, and unnecessary bankruptcy ... in our view, violates their fiduciary duties to the company and to you,"" the hedge fund said in its letter.
Board members failed to roll up their sleeves and are ready ""to concede defeat and pass the buck to a bankruptcy judge,"" the hedge fund wrote.
PG&E said in a securities filing it could potentially raise more money and avoid seeking bankruptcy protection, but argued such a move would be complex, uncertain and expensive. 
PG&E's chief executive recently resigned and Chairman Richard Kelly said the company is committed to ""further change"" and searching for a new leader with ""extensive operational and safety expertise"" while its general counsel helms operations on an interim basis.

Most companies filing for bankruptcy protection have nearly worthless stocks that result in shareholders being wiped out while creditors seek to recover as much as possible from a financially-strapped firm.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government's partial shutdown might be enough to tip America's economy into recession if it runs longer than another month, a former White House aide said on Thursday.
SkyBridge founder and co-managing partner Anthony Scaramucci, who was the president’s communications chief for 10 days in 2017, said in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum that the disruption now in its 34th day, also weighed on the president's prospects for re-election in two years.
Economist at J.P. Morgan on Thursday reduced their estimate of first quarter U.S. economic growth to 1.75 percent from 2 percent because of the shutdown.
The following are excerpts from the LiveChat at the World Economic Forum in Davos with Scaramucci:
Question: Do you see economic fallout from the shutdown. Is it enough to push the U.S. economy into recession?
Answer: (The government disruption) will lead to slower growth this year globally. It is not significant enough but, if it lasts longer than another month, it will be.
Q: If the dispute between the Democrats and the president is resolved soon, what are your expectations for the U.S. economy?
A: Low risk of recession (during) 2019, but goes up in mid-2020.
Q: Are you making any changes in your portfolios at Skybridge because of the prospects of recession?
A: No change to our portfolio.
Q: Politically speaking, is the shutdown a political plus or minus for the president?
A: A-minus ... They are in a Gordian knot with both sides having no face-saving way out.
Q: What are the odds of the president being re-elected?
A: 60/40. 60 to get re-elected.
Q: Do you have any contact with the president these days? Do you have any informal role?

A: Speak to him once a month. No formal role.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallied 6%, led by chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) as its above-consensus earnings and guidance sent its share price soaring more than 18%.
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) also delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines, while Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) results were mixed.
The sunny spell for semis helped offset fresh concerns over U.S.-China trade.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross offered an update on the progress of U.S.-China trade talks, admitting in an interview with CNBC, that both parties were still ""miles and miles"" from resolving their differences on trade.
The latest update on trade arrived just days after President Donald Trump touted optimism, insisting that ""we're doing very well in our negotiations with China.""
Time is running out for both sides to reach an agreement before March 1, after which, in the absence of an agreement, the U.S. could raise duties on imports from China to 25% from 10%.
The months-long trade war has weighed on risk sentiment, with many U.S. businesses flagging the tariffs on imported Chinese goods as a key driver of increased costs, which have compressed margins.
On the domestic front, the partial government shutdown looks set to continue after the Senate rejected rival bills to end the shutdown.

The energy sector rebounded from a slide a day earlier, thanks to rising U.S. oil prices as a surge in domestic crude inventories was offset by hopes U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's crude exports could curb global supplies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The partial U.S. government shutdown is threatening to delay the roll-out of new vehicle models in the United States by stalling required certifications from the Environmental Protection Agency, automakers said.
The shutdown, at 34 days the longest in history, has left over 800,000 federal agency workers without pay and had an impact on everything from access to national parks to airline security screening to the release of economic data.
Some 95 percent of EPA staff has been furloughed, including those at the lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan, responsible for verifying emissions data for new automotive models to ensure they comply with clean air laws.
GM (N:GM) has not yet had any vehicle launch delays but ""like other automakers, we are currently awaiting decisions in the certification process for a few model year 2019 and 2020 vehicles,"" spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said.
Fiat Chrysler (N:FCAU) Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said at the Detroit Auto Show last week that the shutdown had delayed final certification of FCA's new RAM 3500 heavy-duty pickup truck, one of its most profitable segments.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) officials said some vehicles could be delayed if the government shutdown goes another 30 days. 
""As the shutdown continues, these certification delays will affect U.S. vehicle production. Consumers will also not have access to the latest technologies and sales could decline as a result,"" industry trade group Global Automakers told Reuters.
The EPA declined to comment.
Former acting administrator of the EPA, Stanley Meiburg, noted the agency's certification process was central to discovering Volkswagen's past efforts to cheat on emissions.
Automakers tend to seek certifications well in advance of releasing them to the market - meaning a delayed certification does not always impact the roll-out schedule. But the issue could become more serious if the shutdown lingers for much longer, Meiburg said. 
""Any disruptions to this part of the process will disrupt the entire supply chain,"" he said.
Republican President Donald Trump has refused to sign any legislation to fund an array of government agencies unless it includes $5.7 billion for his proposed wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. 

Democrats argue that a wall is costly, and there are better ways to shore up national security and curb illegal immigration.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow edged lower on Thursday as lingering anxieties about slowing global growth and unresolved trade disputes kept buyers at bay, but chipmakers rallied to push the Nasdaq into the black.
While fourth-quarter earnings continued to be generally upbeat, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' comments that the United States and China were ""miles and miles"" from reaching a trade agreement curbed investor enthusiasm. 
Chipmakers led the Nasdaq's rise, as  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) and  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) reported quarterly results that beat analyst expectations. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc, while posting better-than-expected profit, disappointed on revenue. 
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index, under pressure in recent months after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned of waning smartphone demand, was on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since Dec. 26, advancing 5.5 percent. 
Still, even in the face of upbeat corporate results, fears surrounding tariffs and the longest federal government shutdown in history weighed on investors.
""It's a tale of two cities. It's still a lot of uncertainty on the tariff front and the government shutdown front and yet some pretty good earnings coming out of corporate America,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
""There's a lot of money on the sidelines. Everybody's fearful of a negative tweet,"" Ghriskey added. ""(The market is) very tenuous and very subject to day-to-day events.
Commercial air carriers American Airlines Group Inc , Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and JetBlue Airways Corp all reported quarterly earnings that surpassed consensus estimates amid growing pressures related to the government shutdown.
The S&P 500 Airlines index gained 2.8 percent.
 Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) also reported earnings that surprised to the upside. The railroad operator, along with airlines and other companies, is a constituent of the closely watched Dow Jones Transportation index, which was up 0.7 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 81.35 points, or 0.33 percent, to 24,494.27, the S&P 500 lost 3.91 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,634.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.79 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,053.56.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 six were in the red, with the biggest percentage declines in consumer staples, healthcare and materials
Fourth-quarter reporting season is in full-swing. With nearly one-fifth of S&P 500 companies having reported, 75.3 percent have surpassed Street estimates. Analysts now see S&P profit growth of 14.2 percent for the quarter.
Shares of  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) jumped 6.3 percent after beating analyst profit estimates and forecast better-than-expected 2019 profit.
Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Inc slid 10.9 percent after missing fourth-quarter profit expectations due to falling copper prices. 
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alaska Air Group Inc are expected to report after the markets close. 
On the economic front, Americans applying for unemployment insurance fell to more than a 49-year low last week. So far, the government shutdown appears to have had a limited effect on initial jobless claims data. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) surged 15% after its third-quarter results crushed analysts' estimates as it benefited from the expansion of 5G wireless networks in South Korea. The company also guided revenue well above expectations.
The chipmaker reported third-quarter earnings of 93 cents a share, on $800 million in revenue, topping estimates for 85 cents a share on $770 million in revenue.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided revenue in the range of $815 million to $835 million, well above consensus of $776.2 million.
Chip-equipment maker Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) also topped earnings and revenue estimates, sending its share price soaring 14%, despite analysts trimming their outlook on the company's stock.
The company reported earnings of $3.87 a share, on $2.52 billion in revenue, above estimates for $3.66 a share on $2.50 million in revenue.
Lam's upbeat report, however, didn’t gain favor with Wall Street as Cowen cut its price target on the company’s stock to $185 from $210. Mizuho also cut its price target to $160 from $165.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), meanwhile, shrugged off mixed results as its share price rose 6%.
The chipmaker's fourth-quarter earnings of $1.27 a share were in line, but revenue of $3.72 billion was below estimates.
The revenue miss was attributed to a 12% plunge in embedded processing growth, while smartphone weakness and trade tensions also kept a lid on performance.
""Although we remain cautious about demand in the personal electronics space, largely reflecting smartphone softness, we are optimistic about content opportunities in the industrial and automotive markets,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
The move higher in semis comes ahead of results from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) due after the close, which some have said would be key in determining whether this rally will continue or grind to halt.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The city of Brussels could be taken to court over its strict home sharing rules after the European Commission on Thursday said such rules are disproportionate, in a move hailed by U.S. home-renting company Airbnb.
Cities around the world have taken steps to regulate short-term lettings and sites such as Airbnb to discourage landlords from withdrawing their properties from the long-term market in favor of short-term stays.
Regulators on the other hand want to strike a balance between promoting the collaborative economy and keeping the integrity of local communities.
The rules imposed by the Belgian capital do not differentiate between professional or private rentals, large hotels, small bed & breakfasts and the private rental of rooms, the EU executive said.
""The Belgian regulatory framework imposes disproportionate requirements that are not compatible with the Services Directive,"" the Commission said. It said a simple central online registration system for accommodation providers would have sufficed.
It sent a letter of formal notice to Belgian authorities, the first step in a procedure that could lead to court action and fines. 
Airbnb, which has more than 1,000 listings in Brussels, said the city should follow other regions in Belgium with clear rules.

""While both Flanders and Wallonia have adopted progressive and simple rules for home sharing, Airbnb hosts in Brussels currently face a confusing and burdensome administrative process, that doesn't fit with how people share their homes in modern Brussels,"" it said.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","Party is over for dirt-cheap solar panels, says China executive","By Mark Bendeich
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The global solar power industry is about to lose a major competitive windfall as prices of Chinese-made solar panels begin to recover after a collapse last year, the leader of one of the world's top manufacturers said on Thursday.
""The party if definitely over,"" said Eric Luo, president of China's GCL System Integration Technology Co, a top-10 maker of solar panels, feeding the fastest-growing renewable power sector.
Solar panel prices tumbled around 30 percent last year after China, the world's largest producer, cut subsidies to shrink its bloated solar industry, pushing smaller manufacturers to the brink of collapse.
To raise cash and stay afloat, manufacturers cleared inventory and diverted sales offshore, sending prices into a downward spiral - offering up a windfall for solar power generators and investors in solar farms.
Luo, speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week, said GCL's vertically integrated business model cushioned it from the downturn in prices as its solar farms benefited from cheaper panels.
The pain will mostly be felt by smaller Chinese producers, which lack international supply chains, triggering industry consolidation or forcing them to close, he added.
Luo said solar panel prices were already stabilizing and he expected them to rebound by 10 to 15 percent as the Chinese industry consolidates over the next year or two.
Given panels represent close to half of a solar farm's installation costs, that threatens to eat into the returns of investors.
China is home to almost a third of the world's cumulative installed solar capacity and its manufacturers dominate the industry, despite being slapped with anti-dumping tariffs and getting caught up more recently in the U.S.-China trade war.
In September, the European Union ended restrictions on the sale of Chinese solar panels but Washington continues to impose an anti-dumping duty. They are also subject to President Donald Trump's more recent hike to general tariffs on Chinese imports.
GCL still counts the United States as a major market but is expanding rapidly in other markets, following in the wake of Beijing's huge Belt and Road international development program, Luo said, adding that overseas business would account for 75 percent of GCL's solar panel shipments this year.
At home, Luo said China was rapidly nearing the point where the solar industry could operate without any form of subsidy. He said northwest China, where sun was more plentiful and land less expensive, had already reached that milestone.
Most of the rest of the country would follow this year, before the age of subsidies ends completely in 2020, he said.

""If you need subsidies (at that point), you just stop.""

MONTREAL (Reuters) - New York City Transit will stop taking new train car deliveries from  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) until it fixes existing cars, as the Canadian aerospace and transportation company faces pressure to improve performance at its rail unit, its largest division by revenues.
NYC Transit President Andy Byford told a Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) committee meeting this week that Bombardier is not making a ""case"" to win future rail contracts from its longstanding customer, following performance problems and delivery delays on the 300 subway car order, according to a webcast of the meeting viewed by Reuters.
Bombardier has made progress in meeting its latest delivery schedule on the order worth about $600 million, but several of its R179 subway cars were pulled from service recently, partly because of air compressor software defects, members of the MTA's Capital Program Oversight Committee were told on Tuesday night.
""The most recent thing we've done is stopped delivery,"" Byford said. ""And we're not yet turning that delivery mechanism back on until they get their act together.""
Bombardier spokesman Eric Prud'Homme said the company is working with NYC Transit to approve a ""technical solution"" that would return the trains to service. 
""We expect this to happen shortly,"" Prud'Homme said. A spokesman for MTA, which oversees NYC Transit, referred to the webcast when contacted by Reuters for a comment.
Bombardier shares gave up early gains to trade down about 2 percent soon after the Reuters report.
Montreal-based Bombardier's rail unit accounts for about 55 percent of total revenue and has an order backlog of $34 billion. But some older contracts are marred by delays and performance problems.
Bombardier has said it will focus on growing its rail and business jet divisions after the company ceded a controlling stake in its flagship CSeries jet program to Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and sold its Q400 turboprop aircraft program to Canadian aircraft manufacturer to Viking Air.
Its stock fell sharply after the last quarterly earnings in November when the company missed cash flows due to troubles with a handful of delayed rail orders.
On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Swiss Federal Railways would not take new trains from Bombardier until it fixes the ones already in service.
""CHRONICALLY LATE""
Bombardier has delivered 160 cars from the 2012 NYC order of 300 R179 subway cars, worth about $600 million. The order is now expected by September 2019, compared with an original completion date of early 2017.
The MTA is undergoing a 10-year plan to modernize the city's transit, with billions of dollars of investment earmarked for thousands of new subway cars. ""I have just made it very clear to them (Bombardier) that they are certainly not making their case for new orders very favorable. And that right now I wouldn't be wasting my board's time in asking for the business for them,"" Byford said. ""If we're comparing bids and we know that someone is chronically late, by not just a couple of months, but a couple of years, this board will remember that,"" MTA board member Susan Metzger said. Prud'homme said Bombardier is taking responsibility for the trains, and has over 50 full-time employees in NYC working to support the R179 fleet. The company will have to provide at least 16 additional trains above the 300, free of charge and MTA board members were told the agency is in negotiations for an additional two trains as damages.

Separately, Bombardier said on Thursday it will buy a wing manufacturing unit from aircraft parts supplier Triumph Group (N:TGI) to boost its business jets program.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",Renault names new leaders as scandal-hit Ghosn bows out,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) appointed  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard as its new chairman on Thursday, after Carlos Ghosn was forced to resign in the wake of a financial scandal that has rocked the French carmaker and its alliance with Japan's Nissan.
Senard will become chairman immediately, the company said, with deputy chief executive Thierry Bollore taking over Ghosn's other Renault role as full CEO.
The appointments may begin to ease a Renault-Nissan leadership crisis that erupted after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift dismissal as Nissan chairman.
Senard, 65, now faces the task of soothing relations with Nissan and resuming talks on a new alliance structure to cement the 20-year-old partnership.
""It's important that this alliance remain extremely strong,"" Senard told reporters after a board meeting - citing the mounting investment demands of new vehicle technologies. ""It is our compulsory duty to go forward together.""
Nissan welcomed the leadership change, which CEO Hiroto Saikawa said would open a ""new chapter"" for the partnership.
The announcement also marks a clear end to one of the auto industry's most feted careers, two decades after Ghosn was despatched by former Renault boss Louis Schweitzer to rescue newly acquired Nissan from near-bankruptcy - a feat he pulled off in two years.
After 14 years as Renault CEO and a decade as chairman, Ghosn formally resigned from both roles on the eve of the board meeting.
Ghosn's arrest and indictment for financial misconduct has strained the Renault-Nissan relationship, threatening the future of the industrial partnership he transformed into a global carmaking giant over two decades.
For two months, the tensions deepened as Renault and the French government stuck by Ghosn despite the revelation he had arranged to be paid tens of millions of dollars in additional income, unbeknownst to shareholders.
Ghosn has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had agreed to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the Japanese company itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny the deferred pay was illegal or required disclosure, while not contesting the agreements' existence. Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
Ghosn had agreed in recent days to step down from Renault, Reuters reported on Tuesday - but only after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected.
Senard, who had been due to retire from Michelin in April, now has fences to mend in Japan.
Following Ghosn's arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa had sought to weaken Renault's control and resisted its attempts to nominate new directors to the Japanese carmaker's board.
In a possible sign of detente on Thursday, Nissan called an April shareholder meeting to appoint a Renault-nominated board member and formally terminate Ghosn and Kelly's directorships. It remains unclear whether Renault, as Nissan's parent, will also name its next chairman.
Nissan currently owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent and 34 percent in Mitsubishi Motors, a third major partner in their manufacturing alliance.
Once its new management is settled, French officials want the alliance to resume work on a new ownership structure to cement the partnership - which Ghosn had been mandated to explore when his Renault contract was renewed last year.
Nissan is wary of any such moves. Now is not the time to discuss structural changes, Saikawa reiterated on Thursday.
""Communication between the boards of the two companies has been a bit difficult"" since Ghosn's arrest, the Nissan CEO said. ""I'm looking forward to better communication.""
As Renault CEO, Bollore will also become chairman of the alliance, a French official told Reuters - as set out in the 2002 shareholder pact underpinning the partnership.
His operational alliance role will be overseen by Senard, who will lead discussions on the future ""evolution"" of its structure, Renault said. 
Renault has yet to finalize Ghosn's severance package, estimated by the CGT union at 25-28 million euros ($28-32 million) in addition to an annual pension of 800,000 euros.
Ghosn's golden parachute could be politically explosive in France, where the government is battling ""yellow vest"" street protests over low pay and inequality.
Fabien Gache, a Renault CGT spokesman, said on Thursday the union would press the government to vote against the package at Renault's annual shareholder meeting in June.
""We should not add indecency to indecency,"" Gache said.
The government will decide how to vote on Ghosn's severance pay when details become clear, a finance ministry official said.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>","Barclays was 'basically dead' without Qatari cash, London court told","By Kirstin Ridley and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Richard Boath, an ex-Barclays (L:BARC) boss on trial on fraud allegations, said the bank would be ""basically dead"" without a Qatari cash injection in 2008, a prosecutor said on Thursday.
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutor told the trial of  Barclays ' ex-chief executive John Varley and three former senior executives that Qatar had played hardball as the British bank struggled to shore up its balance sheet during the financial crisis.
""Without 1 bln (pounds), at the very least, from Q (Qatar) we are basically dead,"" Boath told his Barclays line manager on May 28, 2008, in a communication read out in Southwark Crown Court by prosecutor Edward Brown on the second day of the case.
Former CEO Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Boath deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representations when Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from investors in 2008, allowing it to avert a British state bailout.
Prosecutors allege the bankers hid from public documents around 322 million pounds in secret fees paid to the Qatari investors as they fought to meet their tough demands.
Jenkins, former chairman for the Middle East of the BarCap business, was the ""gatekeeper for Qatar"", Brown said, adding that when the Gulf state said it might invest at least 1 billion pounds in May 2008, there was initial delight at Barclays.
""Made my day. Know we have to get it over the line, but it's a great starting point for the conversation,"" Varley told Bob Diamond, the American executive who later replaced him as CEO, around May 13, 2008 in communications read out in court.
But this was short-lived after Qatar asked first for a fee of 3.75 percent in return for investing - substantially above the 1.5 percent Barclays was offering other investors - before settling on 3.25 percent, the prosecution alleged.
Trying to structure this deal proved a headache, Brown added, because all investors had to be offered the same terms.
""GOT US BY THE BALLS""
The case hinges in part on whether so-called advisory services agreements were for genuine services to be provided by Qatar or a means for Barclays to pay extra fees it demanded.
Transcripts of telephone and email conversations between Barclays executives at the time show the bankers debating the bank's vulnerable condition and the need to get the Qatari investment at all costs, the prosecution alleged.
""They've got us by the balls because the price is so low,"" Boath told a senior colleague, referring to Qatar's tough stance and the bank's low share price.
Some of the executives also joked about the possibility of going to jail if the Qatari deal did not play by the rules.
""None of us wants to go to jail here,"" Kalaris said to Boath in a recording of a telephone conversation played to the court. ""The food sucks and the sex is worse,"" Kalaris added.

The trial is set to last up to six months. ($1 = 0.7653 pounds)

1667,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",U.S. shutdown 'extremely negative' for IPO market: Morgan Stanley CEO,"(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on Thursday it would be extremely negative for the initial public offering market if the United States government shutdown goes on much longer.
""This is not the way the U.S. should be working,"" Gorman said, speaking in a CNBC interview at Davos, adding, ""I truly hope the leadership of both sides come to some way resolving what seems to be a relatively straightforward problem.""
Gorman became the latest Wall Street executive to call on Washington to end the shutdown by finding a middle ground on President Donald Trump's demand for money to build a wall along the border shared with Mexico.
The shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay, affected market sentiment and impacted companies seeking to list themselves in the U.S.
Skeletal staffing at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has nearly extinguished the pipeline of IPOs expected in early January, since companies typically rely on the SEC to approve their IPO following a review of their prospectus to investors before going ahead with a public listing.
Some are considering workarounds, such as going ahead with their IPO registrations without waiting for SEC approval, or seeking direct listings, both of which carry associated risks, especially of alienating investors.
Gorman, whose investment bankers are expected to underwrite Uber's IPO this year, said the shutdown not only impacts the IPO market, but also the momentum in the economy. 
When asked what the solution to the ""straightforward problem"" was, Gorman said, ""I'd recognize we have a wall - it's 500 miles long and it has been sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans for a very long time. If there were some sensible additions to be made to that wall to improve border security, let's make them.""
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) CEO David Solomon told CNBC at Davos that a combination of things not going the right way, including the government shutdown, the 90-day trade deadline, and Brexit negotiations, will have an impact on financial markets, and slow down the U.S. economy.
Solomon, however, added that the chances of a recession in 2019 are still ""relatively low"".

Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also urged the Republican and Democratic leaderships to end the shutdown, saying it could, along with geopolitical issues and Brexit tensions, cause a ""slowdown or recession"" in the U.S. economy.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 08:38AM ET</span>",'AI' to hit hardest in U.S. heartland and among less-skilled: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Midwestern states hit hardest by job automation in recent decades, places that were pivotal to U.S. President Donald Trump's election, will be under the most pressure again as advances in artificial intelligence reshape the workplace, according to a new study by Brookings Institution researchers.
The spread of computer-driven technology into middle-wage jobs like trucking, construction, and office work, and some lower-skilled occupations like food preparation and service, will also further divide the fast-growing cities where skilled workers are moving and other areas, and separate the high- skilled workers whose jobs are less prone to automation from everyone else regardless of location, the study found.
(Jobs most at risk of automation by state: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HpTe5H)
But the pain may be most intense in a familiar group of manufacturing-heavy states like Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa, whose support swung the U.S. electoral college for Trump, a Republican, and which have among the largest share of jobs, around 27 percent, at ""high risk"" of further automation in coming years.
At the other end, solidly Democratic coastal states like New York and Maryland had only about a fifth of jobs in the high-risk category. 
The findings suggest the economic tensions that framed Trump's election may well persist, and may even be immune to his efforts to shift global trade policy in favor of U.S. manufacturers.
(Occupations by automation potential: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HuJK9f)
""The first era of digital automation was one of traumatic change...with employment and wage gains coming only at the high and low ends,"" authors including Brookings Metro Policy Program director Mark Muro wrote of the spread of computer technology and robotics that began in the 1980s. ""That our forward-looking analysis projects more of the same...will not, therefore, be comforting."" 
The study used prior research from the McKinsey Global Institute that looked at tasks performed in 800 occupations, and the proportion that could be automated by 2030 using current technology. 
While some already-automated industries like manufacturing will continue needing less labor for a given level of output - the ""automation potential"" of production jobs remains nearly 80 percent - the spread of advanced techniques means more jobs will come under pressure as autonomous vehicles supplant drivers, and smart technology changes how waiters, carpenters and others do their jobs.
That would raise productivity - a net plus for the economy overall that could keep goods cheaper, raise demand, and thus help create more jobs even if the nature of those jobs changes.
But it may pose a challenge for lower-skilled workers in particular as automation spreads in food service and construction, industries that have been a fallback for many. 

""This implies a shift in the composition of the low-wage workforce"" toward jobs like personal care, with an automation potential of 34 percent, or building maintenance, with an automation potential of just 20 percent, the authors wrote.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 07:53AM ET</span>",Chip results augur more tech gloom as slowing China weighs,"By Cate Cadell and Ju-min Park
BEIJING/SEOUL/PARIS (Reuters) - Somber results from chipmakers  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN), on the heels of warnings from tech behemoths Samsung and Apple, indicate more gloom for the sector as China's economy slows to its weakest in decades.
A raft of earnings, analyst notes and market commentary in recent weeks have confirmed that a slowdown in the world's No.2 economy, exacerbated by its crippling trade war with the United States, will continue to squeeze sales and profits at technology companies, at least in the first half of the year.
Chinese woes led to South Korea's SK Hynix turning in its first quarterly profit decline in two years. The world's No.2 memory chipmaker, which depends on China for more than a third of its revenue, also said it plans to spend 40 percent less on buying chip equipment this year.
Texas Instruments (TI), supplier of touchscreen controllers, power-management chips and a control device for Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhones and iPads, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its revenue missed estimates.
The Dallas-based company said demand in China was weaker than other regions, especially for smartphones, including demand from Chinese smartphone makers.
""We are seeing signs from our customers and the channel that this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions,"" Dave Pahl, head of TI's investor relations, said. 
""We assume that this weakness is a combination of lower local end-demand as well as reduced exports, but we do not have the visibility to distinguish between the two.""
STMicroelectronics (PA:STM), Europe's second-biggest chipmaker after Germany's Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), said it expected first-quarter sales to drop by more than a fifth from the last quarter of 2018. 
The Geneva-based company, which supplies sensors to Apple and the automotive industry, is suffering from weaker demand for its mass-market microcontrollers as Asian clients use current inventories rather than placing new orders. 
Market data indicates shipments in China, the world's largest smartphone market, fell about 12 percent last year as consumers held on to their older devices. 
Economic growth in the country, which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years, slowed to its weakest in nearly three decades in 2018 and is expected to ease further this year. 
Smartphone shipments will further dip 3 percent in 2019 to below 400 million for the first time in five years, market research firm Canalys estimates.
BAD NEWS
Apple was the first to flag anemic Chinese demand for iPhones with a rare cut to its sales outlook earlier this month.
The company, which lost its crown as the world's top-listed firm after the news, is likely to have cut planned production for the March quarter as well, Nikkei reports.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), chip supplier to Apple and Chinese tech giant Huawei [HWT.UL], followed with more bad news - an estimated 29 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit and subdued earnings for the current quarter.
""Demand in the tech industry is going to be weaker than thought in the first half,"" Seoul-based Yuanta Securities analyst Lee Jae-yun said.
""Until the first half of 2018, companies were very aggressive about their investment, then that quickly turned conservative from the second half of last year and will continue throughout the first half of 2019."" 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has lost nearly a fifth of its gains since hitting a record high in March 2018, as chip prices fell due to bleak smartphone sales and a push back in spending by data center customers to cut inventories.
SILVER LINING
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330), which last week forecast its sharpest quarterly revenue fall in a decade, said a sudden drop in sales of high-end smartphones has led to an inventory build-up.
Still, the pushout in chip orders is generating optimism that sales will pick up towards the later half of the year.
Dutch chip-tooling company ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML), which serves Samsung, TSMC and Intel (O:INTC), told Reuters that Chinese demand for chip manufacturing equipment has not waned. 
ASML forecast lower sales for the first quarter, but said it would pick up later.
Things are also expected to get better for Samsung and Hynix, which have been plagued by weak demand from data centers.
STMicro shares jumped nearly 9 percent, making them the top performer on France's CAC 40 index after its boss delivered an upbeat forecast for the second half of the year. 
Huawei, the world's No. 2 smartphone maker after Samsung, struck an optimistic note on Thursday, saying 2018 sales at its consumer business exceeded a record $52 billion on strong demand for its premium smartphones. 
The company, which is facing mounting global scrutiny of its activities, also announced its first 5G base station chipset and said it aimed to unveil its first foldable 5G smartphone next month.
ASML's American rival Lam Research (O:LRCX), posted better-than-expected quarterly results. 

Programmable chipmaker Xilinx's (O:XLNX) results and outlook beat analysts' expectations, helped by rollouts and preparation for so-called 5G cell phone networks in South Korea and, to a lesser extent, China and North America.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 07:31AM ET</span>",France seeks support for minimum corporate tax at world level,"By Silvia Aloisi
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - France called on Thursday for a new global system of taxation, including a tax on digital giants, as governments look to prevent companies from shopping around for tax havens.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the Group of Seven (G7), of which France holds the rotating presidency, should consider setting a joint minimum corporate tax and tackle the power of giant multinational corporations.
Le Maire said he had discussed the issue with his U.S. counterpart, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The tax would be aimed at eliminating imbalances between the amount small and big companies pay. 
""There is a common understanding among all G7 members that we need a new taxation system,"" he said at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
This new global system, he said, should include a tax on digital multinationals that France is pushing to introduce within the European Union and then at the G7 level.
""We will put on the table the idea of a fair taxation of Internet giants,"" he told Reuters TV in an interview.
However, EU finance ministers failed to agree a tax on digital revenues in December, despite a last-minute Franco-German plan to salvage the proposal by narrowing its focus to companies like Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB).
The EU's executive arm last year proposed a 3 percent tax on big digital firms’ online revenues, alleging the companies funneled profit through states with the lowest tax rates. 
But that proposal needs the backing of all 28 EU member states, including small, low-tax countries like Ireland which have benefited by allowing multinationals to book profits there on digital sales to customers elsewhere in the EU.
Le Maire has since said a deal could be reached by the end of March. The French government has invested considerable political capital in the initiative, which is seen in Paris as a useful example of joint European action before EU parliament elections in May.

Le Maire said France also wants the G7 - which also includes the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy and Canada - to introduce new rules forcing companies to report their highest and lowest wages to reduce the pay gap and help address social inequalities.

Earlier this month, Dallas-based Southwest said the shutdown was delaying its plan to launch service to Hawaii, which needs approval from federal government. Southwest was planning to start Hawaii service early this year. 
But as the shutdown dragged into its 34th day, many federal workers, including those who oversee route authorizations and aircraft certifications, remained furloughed.
""We are anxious for the government to resolve this shutdown so we can bring low fares and a boost to Hawaii's travel and tourism industry,"" Southwest Chairman Gary Kelly said.
The fourth largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic forecast unit revenue, a closely watched performance metric that compares sales to flight capacity, to rise in the four to five percent range in the quarter, helped by healthy passenger demand and strong fares.
Dallas, Texas-based Southwest, which reported a 1.8 percent rise in unit revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31, said net income fell to $654 million, or $1.17 per share, from $1.75 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.
The year earlier quarter included a tax benefit of $1.3 billion.
Total operating revenues rose 8.5 percent to $5.70 billion.

Analysts on average had expected quarterly profit of $1.07 per share and revenue of $5.67 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives had been working out which House panels would take the lead in investigating Trump's business ties to Germany's largest lender, lawmakers and aides familiar with the plans told Reuters last week.
""The bank has received an inquiry from the House financial services and intelligence committees,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement on Thursday after a report from Politico said the chairs of the two committees were planning a joint investigation of Deutsche and its dealings with Trump.
A White House representative was not available outside business hours.
""We're going to work jointly,"" Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was quoted as saying by Politico. ""We think we'll be more effective doing it that way.""
Deutsche Bank said it is engaged in productive dialogue with the two committees to ""determine the best and most appropriate way of assisting them in their official oversight functions"".
Since U.S. voters on Nov. 6 shifted majority control of the House from the Republicans to the Democrats, the party has been promising to investigate the first two years of Trump's administration and possible conflicts of interest presented by his hotel, golf course and other ventures.
A 2018 financial disclosure form showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of the German bank. They are for properties including a Trump hotel in a former post office in Washington.
The Financial Services Committee, chaired by Democrat Maxine Waters, has the broadest power to look into Trump's relationship with Deutsche.
When the Republicans still controlled the House, Waters tried in 2017 to request documents from the bank on its dealings with Trump and his businesses, as well as information about potential Russian money laundering through the bank.
The bank told Congress that privacy laws prevented it from handing over such information without a formal subpoena and committee Republicans ignored Waters' request. As chairwoman, Waters can now issue subpoenas herself.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>",Renault to name new leaders as scandal-hit Ghosn bows out,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) board was meeting on Thursday to appoint new leadership, after Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn resigned in the wake of a financial scandal that has rocked the French carmaker and its alliance with Japan's Nissan (T:7201).
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, confirmed the board was being asked to name outgoing  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard as chairman and Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore as chief executive.
Senard and Bollore ""will be presented this morning to the board of directors"", government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said before the meeting began at 0900 GMT.
The widely expected appointments may begin to resolve a Renault-Nissan leadership crisis that erupted after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift dismissal as Nissan chairman.
They also mark a clear end to one of the auto industry's most feted careers, two decades after Ghosn was despatched by former  Renault  CEO Louis Schweitzer to rescue newly acquired Nissan from near-bankruptcy - a feat he pulled off in two years.
After 14 years as Renault CEO and a decade as chairman, Ghosn formally resigned from both roles on the eve of the board meeting, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.
Ghosn's arrest and indictment for financial misconduct has strained the Renault-Nissan relationship, threatening the future of the industrial partnership he transformed into a global carmaking giant over two decades.
For two months, the tensions deepened as Renault and the French government stuck by Ghosn despite the revelation he had arranged to be paid tens of millions of dollars in additional income, unbeknownst to shareholders.
Ghosn has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had agreed to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the Japanese company itself have also been indicted.
Both men deny the deferred pay was illegal or required disclosure, while not contesting the agreements' existence. Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.
Ghosn finally agreed in recent days to step down from Renault, Reuters reported on Tuesday - but only after the French government called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected by the Japanese courts.
Senard, 65, faces the immediate task of soothing relations with Nissan, which is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault but the larger partner by sales.
Following Ghosn's arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa had sought to weaken Renault's control and resisted its attempts to nominate new directors to the Japanese carmaker's board.
In a possible sign of detente on Thursday, Nissan called an April shareholder meeting to appoint a Renault-nominated board member and formally terminate Ghosn and Kelly's directorships. It remains unclear whether Renault, as Nissan's parent, will also name its next chairman.
Nissan currently owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent and 34 percent in Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), a third major partner in their manufacturing alliance.
Once its new management is settled, French officials want the alliance to resume work on a new ownership structure to cement the partnership - which Ghosn had been mandated to explore when his Renault contract was renewed last year.

Nissan is wary of any such move. In an interview last week, Saikawa acknowledged shareholders' concerns that the current structure undervalues their investments, but added that altering it was ""really not the current priority"".

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 02:25AM ET</span>","Asia convertible bonds boom as rates, market risk rise","By Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian companies are borrowing record amounts via convertible bonds as they seek cheaper ways to raise funds amid rising interest rates and volatile equity markets.
The surge in popularity comes as companies must manage refinancing needs at a time borrowing costs are picking up from their ultra-cheap levels of recent years as U.S. interest rates rise against a backdrop of growing market risks.
Technology companies, often unrated but in search of growth capital, are also tapping convertible bonds.
""There is a strong correlation between interest rates and issuance volume; so in an environment where interest rates are going up, the convertible bond product becomes an attractive funding alternative,"" said Aaron Oh, head of structured equity origination, Asia Pacific at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Convertible bonds are a cheaper funding avenue due to their lower coupons in exchange for giving the bondholder the option of converting the debt into company shares at a set price in future. The equity link gives investors fixed returns and the prospect of profiting from a rise in the issuer's share price.
""Bearing in mind the trajectory of rates and higher spreads, we expect the issuance for convertible bonds to increase this year,"" said Artur Piasecki, portfolio manager of BlackRock’s Asian credit team. 
GRAPHIC: Convertible bonds issuance in Asia since 2000 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RZV1Cz
Convertible bond sales in Asia hit their highest in 2018 since the global financial crisis, with $35.5 billion being raised, roughly 18 percent higher than the five-year average, according to Refinitiv data.
Asian companies must repay $495.4 billion in dollar-denominated bonds over the next two years, the highest since early 2000, Refinitiv data show. The $245.4 billion coming due this year is 80 percent higher than the past five-year average. 
Asian executives have been leery of convertibles for, in their view, it meant selling shares cheaply and diluting their holdings in the process. Their appeal lessened further when central banks started flooding markets with liquidity since the global financial crisis, driving interest rates even lower.
Now, however, corporate borrowers are facing rising interest rates while recent stock market volatility has piqued investor interest in the equity options embedded in the bonds. 
In the eyes of some, the return of the equity-linked product is a sign that long-term market trends are on the turn. 
""Demand for our product tends to increase when things are about to change, so basically we're at an inflection point in markets,"" said Nathan McMurtray, head of equity linked products for CLSA.
Convertible bonds last boomed around 2007, when equity prices hit new peaks and interest rates were high before the crisis hit.
TECH BORROWERS EMERGE 
Cash-hungry Chinese property developers dominated the issuance of convertibles last year, with just two -  Country Garden  (HK:2007) and  Evergrande  (HK:3333) - selling more than $5 billion between them.
Tech firms with more volatile stock prices have also begun turning to convertible bonds, in part because selling straight debt is harder and more expensive.
China's Netflix-like video platform iQiyi (O:IQ), which raised $2.42 billion in its New York IPO last year, raised a further $750 million in November by issuing a five-year unrated convertible bond at a coupon of 3.75 percent, with a conversion premium of 40 percent. 
""With the new listed companies, as they look to raise growth capital going forward, they will look at convertible bonds as well as equity to decide what they want to do. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a more diverse sector representation beyond just the developers,"" said David Binnion, co-head of equity capital markets for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Last week, Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group (HK:0992) also achieved significant savings on its borrowing costs by issuing $675 million in five-year convertible bonds at a coupon of 3.375 percent, compared with its outstanding five-year bonds yielding about 6 percent. 
""A lot of clients look at it as cheaper debt financing,"" said Ashu Khullar, head of Asia Pacific capital markets origination for  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
Lenovo's stock price is also up 29 percent since the beginning of 2018, meaning the 40 percent conversion premium embedded in the bond - the difference between the price of the convertible against the market value of the common stock - will ensure that any dilution takes place at a high level.
Dilution risk - from issuing more stock thereby diluting the percentage ownership of existing shareholders - remains one of the main drawbacks of convertible bonds, but a high conversion premium can make it more palatable for existing shareholders.

Anvita Arora, head of Asia Pacific equity linked origination at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), said: ""The fact that you can put an enormous premium on top of your existing share price, if any equity is created, it's only created at a very high stock level...so people feel like dilution then becomes acceptable.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese shares linked to the city of Nagasaki got an unlikely boost on Thursday after Pope Francis unveiled a plan to visit Japan, with media reporting Nagasaki, for centuries a center of Christianity in Japan, would be on his itinerary.
Stock traders said the first Papal visit to Japan in almost four decades would be a big publicity boost and help attract tourists to the city, associated in the minds of many foreigners with a second U.S. atomic bomb attack in 1945.
The Pope told reporters on Wednesday he would visit Japan in November. While his travel plan has not been announced, Japanese media said the visit would include Nagasaki, Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb was dropped, as well as Tokyo.
""If the Pope visits various places in Japan, they will be reported around the world. Possibly that could increase the number of visitors,"" said Ryuta Otsuka, strategist at Toyo Securities. 
Investors believe the business boost from a papal visit would be most palpable in Nagasaki, the smallest city on his itinerary, with a population of 430,000, and were piling into shares linked to it.
H.I.S. (T:9603), a travel company that operates a theme park in Nagasaki, rose 2.1 percent, while the Nikkei average (N225) saw a 0.1 percent fall.
Kyushu Railways (T:9142), which operates trains in the region, rose 0.3 percent before ending flat. Even Ringer Hut (T:8200), which operates a restaurant chain specializing in Nagasaki-style noodle dishes called ""champon"", rose 0.4 percent.
Foreign tourists have provided a major boost for the Japanese economy, helping to offset a declining population, with arrivals more than doubling over the past five years.
More than 600,000 people visit the atomic bomb museum in Nagasaki every year. The 82-year-old pontiff said this month he was afraid about the danger of nuclear war.
The southern port city has ancient links to the Christian world and one of Japan's largest Catholic communities.
The first Christians to arrive in Japan - Portuguese Catholics in the 16th century - came ashore in the Nagasaki area.

Nagasaki was home to ""secret Christians"" who kept their faith underground for more than 200 years despite an official ban that began in the early seventeenth century.

Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) took centre stage after the Cyberspace Administration of China accused the company’s popular news app “Tian Tian Kuai Bao” of spreading vulgar information.
Tencent has been ordered to overhaul its operations, the watchdog said in a notice on Wednesday evening. The company’s shares were down 1.4% at HK$329.2 by 1:25 AM ET (6:25 GMT).
The Chinese internet giant was already under pressure earlier this week after its games were once again absent from a list of new titles to be approved by Chinese regulators.
The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television ended a 10-month-long halt on video-games approvals in December, giving the green light to a total of 260 games. Tencent has yet to have any of its titles approved so far.
Meanwhile, Chinese stocks gained about half a per cent after Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said the country’s economic growth “will continue and will be sustainable.”
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Wang said that “there will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019, but something that is certain is that China’s economy, China’s growth, will continue and will be sustainable.”
His comments came after China reported on Monday that the growth in its fourth-quarter GDP slowed to 6.4% from the previous quarter’s 6.5%, leaving 2018 growth the weakest in 28 years.
Wang added that the Chinese government is trying to remind people that the “quality, structure and efficiency” of the economic development is “what really matters.”
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 0.4% and 0.8% higher following Wang’s speech. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.3%.
Separately, while not a directional driver, Reuters reported on Thursday that China’s top leaders formally approved the launch of a new high-tech board at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The establishment of the board was previously announced at the China International Import Expo last year.
The new board would feature a new IPO registration system as China pushes forward reform in the country’s listing and trading procedures. Under the current approval-based IPO system, it could take months and even years for firms to be listed on Chinese exchanges, according to the state-run Xinhua.
The draft rules for the new trading venue could come later in January the soonest, the report said.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.7% after the country’s central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged as expected.
State-run media Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s “unusual determination and will for the settlement of the issue” on Wednesday. Kim also ordered “technical preparations” for the next meeting between the two leaders, according to the media.
“Kim Jong Un said that we will believe in the positive way of thinking of President Trump, wait with patience and in good faith and, together with the U.S., advance step by step toward the goal to be reached by the two countries,” the report said.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 underperformed its regional peers and traded 0.3% lower in afternoon trade.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was up 0.4%. The Australian dollar traded lower on Thursday after one of the Australian top four big national banks, the National Australia Bank (NAB), raised the home loan rates today.

The world's second-largest aerospace group employs 14,000 people in Britain, including 6,000 at its main wings factory at Broughton, Wales, and 3,000 in Filton, western England, where wings are designed and supported.
Critics of previous warnings by Airbus have cast doubt on whether the France-based group would move significant operations out of Britain, arguing Broughton is an efficient factory and that the case for staying is buoyed by a weak sterling.
German-born Enders insisted Airbus was not bluffing, adopting a more partisan tone than in previous statements.
""Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong,"" he said.

""Of course, it is not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to re-direct future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And make no mistake there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft.""
