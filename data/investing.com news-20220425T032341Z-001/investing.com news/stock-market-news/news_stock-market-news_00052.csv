(Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court on Tuesday reinstated a lawsuit by a group of former child slaves accusing the U.S. unit of Nestle SA (S:NESN), the world's largest food maker, and Cargill Co (CARG.UL) of perpetuating child slavery at Ivory Coast cocoa farms.
Judges of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, said in a unanimous decision that the group could proceed with its claims despite the alleged abuses having occurred overseas.
""In sum, the allegations paint a picture of overseas slave labor that defendants perpetuated from headquarters in the United States,"" the court wrote. 
The court did not rule on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims.
The plaintiffs, originally from Mali, are contending that the companies aided and abetted human rights violations through their active involvement in purchasing cocoa from Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire).
They originally sued Nestle USA, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (N:ADM) and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) in 2005. Archer-Daniels-Midland was dismissed from the lawsuit in 2016, according to court records. The case has since made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 2016 rejected the companies' bid to have the lawsuit thrown out.
The companies have denied the allegations.
Nestle said in a statement on Tuesday that it had explicit policies against child labor and was working to combat the global problem. The company said it disagreed with the 9th Circuit decision and was assessing appellate options.
""Regrettably, in bringing such lawsuits, the plaintiffs' class action lawyers are targeting the very organizations trying to fight forced labor,"" Nestle said.
Cargill did not reply to a request for comment.
A district court in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit twice, most recently in March 2017. That court found that the former child slaves' claims were barred by U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have made it harder for plaintiffs to sue corporations in U.S. courts for alleged violations overseas.
According to those rulings, violations elsewhere must ""touch and concern"" U.S. territory ""with sufficient force.""
The 9th Circuit said on Monday that the plaintiffs' claims fulfilled those requirements as the alleged violations fell outside the scope of the companies' ordinary business conduct.
The former child slaves alleged that the companies provided financial and technical assistance to local farmers to guarantee the cheapest source of cocoa.
The federal appeals court said that those ""kickbacks"" were supported by regular inspections of Ivory Coast cocoa farms by U.S. company employees who allegedly knew of and upheld the financing arrangements.
Cote d'Ivoire is the world's leading cocoa grower. Other leading producers of cocoa include Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria and Cameroon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading bank regulator on Tuesday fined Capital One Bank [COFCO.UL] $100 million for failing to enforce anti-money laundering controls that have been in place for years.
Capital One failed to satisfy a 2015 consent order that demanded the bank improve its anti-money laundering policies, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said in a statement.
""The Bank failed to timely achieve compliance with the 2015 Consent Order,"" the OCC said in a new consent order that outlined the fine.
Capital One said it disclosed the issue to the OCC in July 2015.
""The consent order emanates primarily from prior banking relationships with certain check cashing service providers – a business we made the decision to exit in 2014,"" the bank said in a statement.

""Since that time, we have worked diligently with our bank regulators to strengthen our processes and internal controls to ensure we address any concerns regarding our ... compliance processes.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares jumped more than 9 percent on Tuesday after long-time critic and short-seller Citron Research said it had a change of heart and is now betting the electric automaker's stock will rise. 
The firm said in a research note that Tesla's Model 3 sedan is a ""proven hit"" and serious competition from other automakers for the plug-in car market has not materialized, marking a sharp reversal from its previous stance. 
Tesla will release third-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, a week earlier than it has typically reported.
Chief Executive Elon Musk has promised a Model 3 ramp-up will help make Tesla profitable in the quarter, and has said the automaker should not have to sell more shares to raise cash. 
But a number of Wall Street analysts say the ramp-up, added to other production promises and debt obligations, make some sort of capital raise likely. 
Citron's change of opinion came just a month after the Andrew Left-led firm sued Tesla and Musk, saying Musk fraudulently engineered his abandoned plan to take the carmaker private to ""burn"" short-sellers. Citron said it was not withdrawing its lawsuit against Musk and Tesla.
Left told Reuters: ""I would not short this again. I understand that industry better and I think the company just turned the corner.""
Tesla announced record quarterly car production earlier this month but warned of major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs.
""The numbers coming out of the company are too compelling,"" Left said. 
Tesla shares got another boost during mid-day trading following a tweet by Richard Pearson's Mox Reports, saying ""numbers will be blowout."" 
Investors have been rattled by Musk's abrupt turnaround on his go-private plan and other recent behavior including smoking marijuana on a live web show. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission called Musk's Aug. 7 tweets about financing for a deal ""false and misleading"" and accused him of fraud last month. Tesla and Musk settled with the regulator by agreeing to pay $20 million each and have Musk step down as chairman for three years. 
""While the media has been focused on Elon Musk's eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being dominated by Tesla,"" Citron said.

22,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 01:08PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: United Technologies Shines on Dark Day for Industrials,"Investing.com - Industrials slumped Tuesday, heaping further pressure on the broader averages as investors digested mixed earnings from heavyweights  Caterpillar , 3M and United Technologies.
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) rose from session lows, but continued to nurse a 6% slump as investors fretted about margin pressures weighing on profits. The company's third-quarter results highlighted a rise in costs with higher steel prices and tariffs. Caterpillar beat third-quarter estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
The uptick in materials costs comes as the U.S. and China have implemented tariffs on billions of dollars worth of their goods this year, though reports that President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could resume trade talks at the G20 summit at the end of November has somewhat eased investor jitters.
3M (NYSE:MMM) swooped to a six-month low, down about 4%, as the company cut its 2018 profit guidance to no more than $10 a share after posting earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Revenue fell for the first time in two years as growth slowed in many of the markets served by 3M.
United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), meanwhile, was rewarded for its upbeat quarterly results, beating both profit and revenue estimates for the third quarter and raising its full-year earnings guidance. Its shares rose 2%.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",GAM flows a warning sign for asset managers over culture,"By Simon Jessop and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based GAM's (S:GAMH) stringent response to suspected rule breaches by one of its top fund managers has cost it dear - leaving an asset management industry, facing ever tighter regulation, at pains to avoid the same fate.
The extent of recent and planned Europe-wide and UK rule changes and the new culture of whistle-blowing they engender, however, could leave more asset managers facing similar crises and the dilemma of how to handle them.
GAM shocked markets in July when it suspended top money manager Tim Haywood for suspected breaches of risk management and record keeping procedures. In August it said it would liquidate his funds, worth around $7 billion. 
A month later, GAM said Haywood may have breached the company's policy on the number of signatures required on documents, used his personal email for work, and violated the company's gifts and entertainment policy.
Its decision to suspend Haywood, which has triggered huge outflows and a share price slump, was prompted by a tip from an internal whistleblower, it said. 
""When a popular manager is suspended by a fund group it's no surprise to see assets walking out of the door, as investors no longer have the same pair of hands running their money,"" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said.
""There are many risks investors can tolerate, but conduct is not one of them,"" he added.
Haywood has not publicly commented and was not available to comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. GAM has said Haywood remains an employee ""and was currently engaged in the firm's internal disciplinary processes"".
GAM said on Tuesday assets had fallen 10.8 percent in the three months to the end of September, as the impact of Haywood's suspension was compounded by weaker markets. Its shares have fallen to nine-year lows. 
Of 8.5 billion Swiss francs in total net outflows, 5.3 billion came from funds not connected to Haywood. 
One recent GAM investor contacted by Reuters, said he was ""astounded"" by the company's handling of the situation and would have preferred a warning be given, while a second said the breaches were ""blown out of proportion"".
Chris Egbunike, managing consultant at regulatory consultant Bovill said the tougher regulatory oversight and increased focus on an individual's personal accountability meant companies did not want to be accused of not doing enough.
""People are still not sure what is minor or not. It's almost a case of disclose everything; that way no one can ever fault you for not doing your job.""
For its part, GAM has sought to be transparent with investors by setting up a website answering a number of questions and it said this was bearing fruit. 
""Our engagement with clients showed a marked improvement as we moved into October,"" the firm said on the website.
WATCH OUT
GAM's action came almost a decade after the financial crisis that spurred regulators globally into toughening up rules on the behavior of companies and individuals in the financial services sector, and which have increasingly focused on money managers.
New rules around insider trading and other forms of market abuse went live in Britain in 2017, and January saw the launch of the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). 
Britain's top regulator next year plans to extend rules aimed at making individuals more accountable for their actions from banks to most other financial institutions.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said improving culture and governance is a priority for the coming year and it is in the process of reviewing firms' processes and controls, which include rules to help whistleblowers come forward.
The increasing amount of data being collected was also spurring companies to be proactive and be seen to be taking the initiative instead of brushing breaches under the carpet, aided by bigger compliance teams and increased spend on technology.
""The FCA has a lot of information about you and your firm,"" a leading industry consultant said. ""You want to be able to find your own issues before the FCA phones up and asks you about something, so your systems and controls have to be tighter.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading corporate governance expert Anne Sheehan is joining boutique investment bank PJT Partners as an adviser, the firm's PJT CamberView unit announced on Tuesday.
Sheehan for 10 years oversaw company engagements and proxy voting, weighing in on topics ranging from income inequality to boardroom diversity, as director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers Retirement System. Her team managed a $4.1 billion portfolio.
She retired at the end of March.
Also on Tuesday, CalSTRS, which oversees $229 billion, said it had hired Sheehan's replacement. 
""Anne Sheehan is one of the leading voices of corporate governance and we are excited to have her join our team as a Senior Advisor,” said Abe M. Friedman, who heads PJT CamberView. 
Two months ago PJT bought CamberView, which was founded by Friedman six years ago. The two joined forces at a time when more corporations are being pressured by investors to perform better and want help to defend against so-called activist investors, who often demand changes ranging from sale processes to share buybacks.
CalSTRS, Sheehan's old employer, said that Kirsty Jenkinson, who headed Wespath Benefits and Investments' environmental, social, governance integration, corporate engagement, portfolio screening and proxy voting activities unit, had been hired director of corporate governance. She will replace Sheehan and start at CalSTRS in January 2019.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",A passion for makeup drove Urban Decay's Zomnir to cosmetics industry,"By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan
NEW YORK(Reuters) - Wende Zomnir has always had a passion for makeup - as an eighth grader, she was sent home from school for wearing too much. It should come as little surprise that she would grow up to co-found the edgy cosmetics company Urban Decay.
The enterprise came about in 1996 because Zomnir noticed a void in the cosmetics industry - the palettes available were awash with feminine colors such as pink and red, with few options for women who wanted to do a bold purple or green. She first teamed with Sandy Lerner, cofounder of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and now the brand is owned by L'Oreal Group and sold by retailers including Sephora and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN). 
Zomnir, chief creative officer of the brand, lives in Newport Beach, California with her husband and two sons. She spoke to Reuters about the lessons she has learned on her journey.
Q: What did you learn from your first job that helped you in your beauty business?
A: My first beauty job was behind an Elizabeth Arden counter at a department store in downtown Fort Worth, Texas. It seemed so glamorous, and they gave us free makeup! My co-workers were career counter ladies in their 50s and 60s. I learned so much from them about products, why people buy, and about life in general. Our customers were older, so it was more of a skin-care play, but I always managed to sell them some makeup because that was what I loved.
Q: What has being in the beauty business - which can be rather mercurial and unforgiving - taught you about being a good business person?
A: Be resourceful, don't take yourself too seriously and be ready to change.
Q: Who was your big role model? 
A: Gloria Steinem became my heroine. When I was invited to serve alongside her on the board of Ms. Magazine in 1999, I jumped at the chance to learn from my idol. Working behind the scenes at Ms. exposed me to the broad spectrum of women's issues. I discovered it wasn't just about women fighting for equal pay, but also about extending access to education, ending female genital mutilation and domestic violence and supporting visionary entrepreneurs.
Q: Was there a mistake you made when you started your business that you would tell entrepreneurs to avoid?
A: I didn't have a finance or operations person in the beginning. I thought a great product would sell itself and that the money would follow! Wrong!
Q: How do you decide where to donate your money? 
A: Urban Decay has always stood for the empowerment of women - from the products we create to the causes we support. In 2015, we launched The Ultraviolet Edge, our global initiative to empower women.
Each year we create a new product to fund the organization, and this year it's Vice Lipstick in Outspoken, a universal pink shade with a metalized finish. One hundred percent of the purchase price of each lipstick sold is donated to the fund. 
Women's rights are a complicated landscape with many worthy causes, so we decided to pool together the money raised by The Ultraviolet Edge, which gives us the flexibility to support a variety of organizations that are doing incredible things to empower women. By 2018, we will have donated over $2 million to women's empowerment nonprofits.
Q: Why is it important to give?
A: By providing women with the resources to better their lives, we are empowering and encouraging women to embrace their strengths and worth in everything they do. 
The initiative has supported organizations that work for women in various ways, from women in Uganda with microfinance (The Women's Global Empowerment Fund), girls in Kenya with education (The Kakenya Center for Excellence), low income women in New York City with legal services (Her Justice), victims of discrimination worldwide and global legal change, including the efforts to end female genital mutilation (Equality Now) and visionary entrepreneurs with connections and mentorship (The Circular Board).
Q: What money or life lessons do you try to pass down to your two sons?
A: Work hard and hustle.

41,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Poland's biggest construction firm pays for help in finding workers,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's biggest construction firm  Budimex  (WA:BDXP) has become the first in its sector to offer cash incentives to anyone who helps it find new workers at a time of the lowest unemployment in decades, the company said on Tuesday.
Almost half of Polish companies in Poland face problems finding new employees, a report showed in August. 
The construction industry has been particularly affected, as infrastructure funding from the European Union has driven growth at a time that it has been losing workers to higher-paying EU markets such as Germany and Britain. 
""We are the largest employer in the construction market in Poland and a responsible employer,"" Budimex said in a statement. ""We were one of the few companies on the market that did not reduce employment in 2014-2016 when the construction industry faced a reduction in the number of orders.""
The company, which recruits through agencies, internal recommendations and job advertisements, said it will now pay up to 2,000 zlotys ($534.00) to anyone who helps it employ a worker for a specific job. 
""We are currently looking for specialized construction managers, engineers and masters in many branches, especially in the field of rail and buildings construction,"" Budimex said. 
The company has increased its average pay for manual workers by 20 percent over the last year, it said. 
Budimex, which is owned by Spain's Ferrovial (MC:FER), said it plans to hire 1,100 workers by the end of 2019. The group has already increased employment to more than 7,000 people from 4,500 four years ago. 
It mostly employs Polish workers but last year started hiring foreign staff, mostly from Ukraine, as Poland struggles to compete with other European Union countries in attracting EU workers.
The unemployment rate in Poland, which has one of the fastest aging societies in the European Union, has for months been the lowest since 1990, at 5.7 percent in September.
Poland's construction industry needs an extra 100,000 workers to handle a surge in public sector projects and save more companies from bankruptcy, Budimex's chief executive told Reuters in June.

Shares of Tesla jumped in midday trading after the electric auto manufacturer received a huge endorsement from a former critic.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose about 5% at 11:45 AM ET (15:35 GMT), a rare view of green in a sea of red in today’s selloff.
Short-seller Andrew Left’s Citron Research surprisingly reversed its view of the stock, saying it is now long because of the company’s dominant position.
“While the media has been focused on Elon Musk’s eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being DOMINATED by Tesla,” Citron said in a note.
“Plain and simple -- Tesla is destroying the competition,” it added.
Citron has long been shorting shares of Tesla and Left is suing the company over alleged stock price manipulation, including Musk’s infamous tweet saying he had funding to take the company private at $420 per share.
Left is still suing the company, despite the change of opinion on the stock, he told CNBC.
Meanwhile,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) continued its long post-earnings slide, falling about 3.5% midday.
Shares are down about 14% in the last month. The were at an all-time high near $86 when the company reported results on Sept. 25, where a contraction in gross margins spooked investors.

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) reported quarterly profit and net new phone subscribers well ahead of Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as customers took advantage of its subsidies for Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) latest iPhones late in the quarter. 
The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has been focusing on upgrading its network and winning over more customers in a saturated market as rivals AT&T Inc (N:T), Sprint Corp (N:S) and T-Mobile have been focusing on merger deals and paying down debt.
Verizon shares rose 3.4 percent to $56.87, their highest in more than 18 years.
The company said it added a net 295,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter, easily beating the estimate of 161,000 provided by research firm FactSet.
Wall Street analysts pay attention to customers with a recurring bill, or so-called ""postpaid"" customers, as they are more valuable to carriers.
Verizon has been investing heavily this year in its next generation 5G network, which will become the backbone of its largest business. 
Meanwhile, its next-largest rival AT&T Inc (N:T) bought Time Warner for $85 billion, in a bet that it can use media content on its services to lure more customers. T-Mobile and Sprint Corp (N:S), the third and fourth-placed U.S. carriers, have agreed to merge in the hope of cutting costs and becoming more competitive. 
AT&T and Sprint have been focusing on paying down debt rather than winning customers by lowering prices, which meant Verizon did not face cut-throat competition in the quarter, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.
""Competitive intensity is now more moderate than at any time since 2014,"" said Moffett in a research note. ""With two of the Big Four all but taking a knee, Verizon - and T-Mobile - now has the freedom to grow without discounting.""
OATH INTEGRATION
Verizon's media and traditional phone businesses did not fare as well. 
Revenue from Oath, its digital media subsidiary that owns dozens of websites including AOL and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion for the third quarter. Verizon said it does not expect Oath to reach its previous goal of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, as it struggles to generate as much revenue as it hoped from mobile advertising, to make up for shrinking desktop usage of its websites. Last month, Verizon said Oath CEO Tim Armstrong would leave the company at the end of the year.
""I would expect the next move will be that the business is jettisoned entirely,” said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research. 
Verizon declined comment on any planned deals. Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said in an interview with Reuters that Oath's revenue trend had not met expectations, but the company is working to integrate its advertising sales platform this quarter.
""That will make it easier for publishers to do business with us,"" Ellis said. 
Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.92 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding some items, Verizon earned $1.22 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Verizon said it is on track to reach $10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021.
5G ROLLOUT 
Verizon launched home 5G internet service on Oct. 1 in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The next-generation wireless network is expected to bring faster data speeds, which Verizon hopes will help it compete with competitors like cable company Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA).
It has, so far, concentrated on investing in its wireless network rather than deal-making. Its next-largest competitor AT&T Inc (N:T) bought Time Warner in an $85 billion deal that closed in June, betting it could attract more customers with media content.
Verizon's wireline business, which sells traditional phone service and its Fios video and internet products, saw revenue decline 3.7 percent from last year to $7.4 billion.
It lost 63,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 18,000 it lost last year, as viewers continue to favor cheaper TV services delivered over the internet, over paying for pricier cable packages.
It added 54,000 Fios internet customers, fewer than the 66,000 Verizon added a year earlier.

Total operating revenue rose 2.8 percent to $32.61 billion during the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $32.51 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking documents from  Glencore  (L:GLEN) about intermediary companies that the commodities firm has worked with in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria, sources familiar with the matter said.
The investigation is not directed at Glencore's own activities or its senior executives, two sources told Reuters, giving no further detail about the type of information sought.
""The investigation focuses on intermediaries,"" one source familiar with the probe said. A banker working with Glencore also said the focus was on three intermediary firms.
In mining and other extractive industries, intermediaries are firms or individuals paid a fee by producers, buyers or both for services such as brokering deals.
Glencore said on July 3 it had been subpoenaed for documents relating to its business in the three countries since 2007, sending its shares down 13 percent and leaving investors guessing about the direction of the investigation.
The Switzerland-based firm had said the subpoena related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and money-laundering statutes but did not indicate the Department of Justice was focused on intermediaries or give further details.
Glencore, which said on July 11 it would cooperate with the U.S. authorities after receiving the subpoena, declined to offer additional comment for this article. The Department of Justice declined to comment.
A third source, who was familiar with the Nigerian element of the probe but not other areas, said the Department of Justice wanted Glencore to hand over documents related to associates of former Nigerian oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke, namely the owners of Nigeria-based Atlantic Energy Holdings.
The U.S. authorities are investigating alleged bribery of the former minister and alleged money-laundering by her associates, who include Olajide Omokore and Kolawole Aluko, according to U.S. court documents seen by Reuters.
Glencore was a buyer of oil from Atlantic Energy Brass Development, a subsidiary of Atlantic Energy Holdings, which was owned by Omokore and Aluko.
Glencore declined to comment on its oil dealings with Atlantic Energy. A lawyer representing both Atlantic Energy and Omokore also declined to comment.
A lawyer for Alison-Madueke requested Reuters send questions by email, but did not respond when that email was sent.
A lawyer for Aluko could not be identified, as court documents did not name a representative and other lawyers involved in the case could not offer guidance.
Nigeria's government referred requests for comment to the justice minister, who is also attorney general. He did not respond to requests for comment.
For Congo, the U.S. authorities were seeking documents from Glencore relating to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, while for Venezuela they wanted documents from Glencore relating to Miami-based trading firm Helsinge Inc, the first source and the banker said.
The sources declined to disclose any more information about the probe into these two intermediaries.
Gertler, who was a partner in Glencore's cobalt and copper mines in Congo until 2017, could not be reached for comment. His spokesman in London declined to comment. 
Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende said Gertler had business in Congo and that any investigation into his activities had nothing to do with the government.
For Venezuela, Helsinge acted as an intermediary for Glencore's fuel sales to state energy firm PDVSA, according to PDVSA's internal trade documents seen by Reuters.
Helsinge did not respond to telephone or email requests for comment about the Department of Justice probe.

A spokesman for PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - For two years Airbus faced a shortage of engines and had to slow jet deliveries. Now engines are arriving fast - but fresh snags mean a Hamburg plant that assembles best-selling jets is having trouble absorbing them, industry sources said.
The internal snags have exacerbated delivery delays that leave Airbus with the challenge of delivering 76 single-aisle planes per month in the last quarter, according to consultants Flight Ascend, 9.6 percent more than its previous record.
Airbus is working flat out to maintain this year's target of 800 total aircraft deliveries needed to meet financial goals and single-aisle assembly lines are its most important cash cow. 
""They're late; everyone is mad at them. They've been hiding behind the engine problems,"" a senior aircraft buyer said, referring to the tendency of supply chains to focus on the most visible laggards without always tackling problems in waiting. 
Other industry sources say Hamburg may not be the immediate source of the problem, but that this facility has felt the worst impact in Airbus's global jigsaw of assembly plants because it is introducing a new version of A321 just as production is running faster than ever.
That illustrates a wider challenge as planemakers struggle to introduce new models and fix technical issues without pausing record output increases – a task some compare to taking the steepest hill in a cycle race at a sprint while fixing a tyre.
Deliveries of the A321, a large single-aisle jet mainly made in Germany, spiked higher in May as delayed engines started coming in but slowed down again in September, Airbus data shows.
Now, Airbus is introducing a new A321neo ACF version, which offers more flexible cabins but requires complex configuration.
One of the sources said the Hamburg assembly plant was facing some problems with cabling the jets, stirring memories of cabling problems which plagued the A380 superjumbo a decade ago. 
An Airbus spokesman confirmed the customized new A321neo version had ""led to some rescheduling of aircraft deliveries,"" in combination with pressure from output increases and the queue of jets still waiting to be delivered from the engine crisis.
Quality problems in Hamburg have also contributed to delays, Reuters reported last month.
OIL PRICE SQUEEZE
Despite disruption, Airbus has said it is confident it will meet single-aisle production goals of 60 a month spread across all its factories in mid-2019, up from around 55 now.
Sources say Airbus is also preparing to make capacity of 65 single-aisle jets a month available by the end of next year, though there has been no decision on whether to implement this.
Ultimately, Airbus aims to raise output as high as 70-73 to serve record travel demand and the company says planes offering premium seats like the A321neo ACF will help to drive this.
Still, delays at Hamburg are a headache for new sales chief Christian Scherer as airlines wait for deliveries.
For many airlines, the financial pain is acute since oil prices have bounced back to $80 dollars: exactly the market the A321neo and similar fuel-saving models were designed for.
""Airlines can deal with planes that are off-spec but not ones that are late. They have built a network plan which takes account of new aircraft in the fleet,"" Ascend chief consultant Rob Morris said. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has also had some delays.
Hamburg's woes highlight the operational issues at stake as planemaking chief Guillaume Faury prepares to become chief executive in April. His two main industrial lieutenants, Tom Williams and Didier Evrard, retire at end-year.

Insiders say Faury, who has made production the ""priority of priorities"" for this quarter, will not be replaced as president of commercial jets but may appoint an operations leader.

Pessimism gripped investors amid renewed concerns over a host of economic and geopolitical issues, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to pull out of the US-Russia nuclear arms agreement, U.S. midterm elections and the fallout from the murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi.
Concerns over the U.S.-China trade war, the dispute over Italy’s budget and a lack of progress in Brexit negotiations also soured market sentiment.
In a busy week for earnings, with 32% of the S&P 500 companies reporting this week, the downpour of earnings released ahead of the opening bell Tuesday added to the loss of risk appetite.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), considered a bellwether for the global economy, led losses on the Dow as the company reiterated its forecast for 2018 earnings per share of $11.00 to $12.00, the midpoint falling below expectations of $11.65. Shares were off 7%.
3M (NYSE:MMM) was the second-largest decliner on the index, falling 6.3%, as its third-quarter results missed consensus and the company issued disappointing full-year earnings guidance.

94,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>","Xerox beats on profit, misses on revenue under Icahn appointees","By Sonam Rai
(Reuters) -  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX) fell short on revenue but beat estimates for profit on the back of cost-cutting in its first full quarter under new management backed by activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.
The U.S. photocopier, which is facing a long-running decline in its core business, reported net profit that roughly halved and said revenue fell 5.8 percent year-on-year to $2.35 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, below an average analyst estimate of $2.42 billion.
Operating cash flow for the quarter, however, rose and the company increased its 2018 share repurchase target to $700 million from $500 million and forecast for full-year free cash flow to between $900 million and $1 billion.
""Clearly, our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort,"" Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, who worked as a consultant to Icahn in the proxy fight, said on a call with analysts. 
""We are putting in place actions to sustainably improve our revenue performance. These start with building a more simplified, agile organizational structures and include further expanding our channel presence..."", he said. 
Xerox has struggled with falling demand for office printing equipment as the popularity of smartphones reduced the need to print, and the company agreed in January to a $6.1 billion merger with Fuji Xerox, its 56-year-old joint venture with Fujifilm.
But the complex deal ran into strong opposition from Icahn and Deason and in May the photocopier pioneer scrapped the merger and handed management control to the activist investors.
Shares of the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company that have fallen about 9 percent this year so far, rose marginally in early trading on Tuesday. 
Fujifilm, which was to take a majority stake in the combined company as part of the deal, has sued Xerox, winning an appeal last week giving the Japanese company leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table.
""We don't believe (the appeals court's ruling) means very much for Xerox, because Xerox terminated that transaction for reasons unrelated to the injunctions,"" said Visentin.
Net income attributable to Xerox fell to $89 million, or 34 cents per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, from $179 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier, hurt by higher taxes. 

Excluding items, the company reported earnings of 85 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 78 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

95,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>","The stock market's 'dead cat bounce' is over and the rolling bear market is making a comeback, Morgan Stanley says","The stock market may have bounced back from its sharp drop at the beginning of October, but Morgan Stanley says it's time to buckle up because the ""rolling bear market has unfinished business with the S&P.""
""We think attempts to rebound were more short lived than sustainable,"" a Morgan Stanley team led by the equity strategist Michael Wilson said in a note sent out to clients on Monday.
""Recent price declines in crowded Growth, Tech, and Discretionary have caused enough portfolio pain that we think most investors are playing with weak hands. We are increasingly thinking a rally into year end will be harder to come by as lower liquidity and concerns on peaking growth weigh on the S&P and an investor base in defense mode.""
The Morgan Stanley team hypothesized earlier this year that  a bear market in stocks might have already begun and that earnings growth would deteriorate in the second half of the year as the impact of President Donald Trump's tax cuts began to fade.
Wilson and his team say they are looking for  the S&P 500's 200-day moving average — which has been tested a handful of times this year, but has held — to finally give way.
Simply put, the 200-day is an indicator traders use to determine the overall trend of the market. The market is in an uptrend as long as it's above its 200-day, and it's in a downtrend if it's below the measure.
So what can that mean for stocks? The benchmark index suffered through a correction, or worse, the past two times it fell below the key technical level.
In August 2015, the S&P 500 plunged 15% amid the fallout from Greece's default on a loan payment and China's ""Black Monday,"" the day the country's benchmark Shanghai Composite index fell more than 8%. Before that, the S&P 500 plunged into a brief bear market after the US lost its AAA rating at the ratings agency Standard & Poor's. In both instances, the S&P 500 wouldn't make new highs for at least five months.
If there is any comfort for investors, it's that the firm said  earlier this year that it didn't think the 20% to 40% stock-market plunge that characterized the past three bear markets would rear its head this time. Instead, it sees individual stocks and sectors coming under fire. Wilson's team says to tread carefully in two sectors: tech and consumer discretionary.
""Given the high degree of cyclicality in both Tech and Consumer Discretionary, we think their derating should be more in line with the broader S&P 500, or another 6-8 percent,"" they wrote.
""Of course, that begs the question of whether the valuation for the S&P 500 has fallen too far already. We don't think so."""

106,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>","Harley-Davidson posts largest profit beat in two years, Europe sales rise","(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) reported its biggest quarterly profit beat in two years on Tuesday and the motorcycle maker maintained its 2018 shipments forecast, as sales for its classic heavy touring bikes climbed overseas led by Europe.
The 115-year old Milwaukee-based company's demographic challenges in the domestic market are well documented - core customers are growing older and outreach efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results.
In addition, President Donald Trump's call to boycott the motorcycle manufacturer for its decision to move production for European markets overseas has only compounded the company's troubles.
Shares of the company were up 1 percent in trading before the bell. Rising costs and a tit-for-tat tariff war with China have weighed on the shares of most U.S. manufacturers. Harley's shares are down about 30 percent so far this year and have underperformed the broader S&P 500 index.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) last week cut the 12-month price target for the stock to $45 from $47. Similarly, brokerage BMO Capital Markets last Friday downgraded the company's shares, citing frustration with its performance.
The company still dominates the local heavyweight motorcycle market, but rivals such as Polaris are chipping away at its market share.
To counter weak demand at home, Harley has plans to make deeper inroads into some of the fastest growing two-wheeler markets in Asia through lightweight motorcycles.
But much of the strategy's success in a highly cost-competitive market like India will hinge upon the price of the new bikes. While Harley has declined to disclose a price range, it has said that the lightweight bikes will be a premium product.
Retail sales in the United States, which accounts for more than half of the company's sales, fell 13.3 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Analysts expect 2018 to be the third straight year of declining sales.
International retail sales, however, rose 2.6 percent. In Europe, retail sales rose 3 percent.
The company said its net income rose to $113.86 million, or 68 cents per share in the third quarter, from $68.21 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding manufacturing optimization costs, the company earned 78 cents a share.
Revenue from motorcycles and related products rose 16.8 percent to $1.12 billion.
Analysts on average expected a profit of 53 cents a share and revenue of $1.07 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.

The company maintained its full-year shipments forecast range of between 231,000 and 236,000 motorcycles and said it expects motorcycle segment operating margin to be in the range of between 9 and 10 percent.

116,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Exxon, Rosneft to build LNG plant with Japanese, Indian partners - sources","By Olesya Astakhova and Denis Pinchuk
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and U.S. ExxonMobil (N:XOM) plan to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in a consortium with Indian and Japanese partners, spreading the estimated $15 billion cost, two sources familiar with the talks said.
The four companies - Rosneft, Exxon, Japan's SODECO and India's ONGC Videsh (NS:ONGC) - are partners in the Sakhalin-1 group of fields that will supply the gas, but Exxon and Rosneft had initially planned to build the LNG plant without the other consortium members.
As well as spreading the costs among more stakeholders, the broader involvement of the participants may mitigate sanctions risk.
Initially, Rosneft and Exxon unveiled their joint plans to build an LNG production site in Russia's Far East to President Vladimir Putin in 2013.
But production of the super-cooled, seaborne gas has so far failed to materialize for many reasons, including international sanctions against Moscow for its role in the Ukraine conflict.
LNG production itself is not subject to sanctions, but Russian companies have limited access to financial markets due to the restrictions. Exxon had to leave most of its other new joint projects with Rosneft due to the West's punitive measures against Moscow.
Two sources - one person close to Exxon, and a high-ranking Rosneft executive not authorized to speak publicly - said both firms are committed to carrying out the LNG plant project within the framework of the Sakhalin-1 agreement. 
Sakhalin-1, a hydrocarbon project, is led by Exxon with a 30 percent stake. Twenty percent belongs to Rosneft, with the rest split between SODECO (30 percent) and ONGC Videsh (20 percent). 
""No one is interested in financing such a project alone,"" the source close to Exxon said. Asked how the LNG plant deal would be structured, the senior Rosneft executive said: ""It will be Sakhalin-1.""
The sources did not say how the financing of the LNG plant would be shared between the participants. 
The source close to Exxon said a decision whether to go ahead with the LNG project was expected in 2019, otherwise the project risked losing its market amid growing competition. 
Currently, two LNG plants, Novatek's (MM:NVTK) Yamal LNG and Gazprom's (MM:GAZP) Sakhalin-2, are producing the frozen gas in Russia, which has set an ambitious target of more than doubling its global LNG market share to 20 percent in the next decade.
Sakhalin-1 is pumping close to 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, a record high, as well as natural gas that it has been unable to sell abroad. Gazprom has the exclusive rights to export pipeline gas from Russia.
Sakhalin-1 has to pump most of the gas back into the ground, while a small amount goes to local customers in the sparsely populated region. Decade-long talks with Gazprom and the consortium over gas sales have not yet yielded any results.
Rosneft, ONGC and SODECO declined to comment. The Russian Energy Ministry and the government also declined to make any immediate comment.
""The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,"" an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in Moscow said in emailed comments sent in response to Reuters questions.
SITE LOCATION
Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive, said in June that the LNG plant would be built just across the Tatarsky strait in the port of De Kastri in Russia's Khabarovsk region, where Rosneft already has an export terminal for Sakhalin-1 oil. 
Sechin said then that the plant's annual capacity was seen at 6 million tonnes of LNG, with supplies aimed at starting in 2025. Gazprom's Sakhalin-2 has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes. 

The source close to Exxon confirmed the technical plans for the plant and said the project partners are considering the option of laying a gas pipe along the existing oil pipeline from Sakhalin-1 to the LNG plant in De Kastri.

Restaurant chains in the United States have been fighting for a bigger share of an over-crowded restaurant market by offering dollar menus, discounts on beverages and limited-time menu items as well as freshly prepared meals to diners.
Global comparable store sales at McDonald's increased 4.2 percent, topping the average analyst estimate of a 3.72 percent rise.
Sales at McDonald's U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 2.4 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the slowest in six quarters. Analysts on average expected 2.55 percent growth, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Net income fell to $1.64 billion, or $2.10 per share, in the quarter from $1.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.10 per share beating the $1.99 analysts expectation.

Revenue in the quarter revenue fell 7 percent to $5.37 billion, but also beat expectations of $5.32 billion.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Dealmaking by private equity firms in Asia has surged this year, data showed, underscoring their rising presence in the region's otherwise stolid, tycoon-dominated M&A scene, backed by an unmatched warchest.
Private equity-backed deals so far this year total $79 billion in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, up 63 percent over the same period of last year and surpassing the $74 billion full-year record set in 2015, according to Refinitiv data. 
The growth was much higher than the 12 percent year-on-year increase seen in the region's total mergers and acquisitions value of $892 billion, the data showed.
While investments in Chinese technology companies such as Ant Financial have headlined private equity's activity in Asia, a series of actions including buyouts show the industry is becoming more aggressive. 
Private equity's banner year also comes as the region's companies face challenges, with trade tensions and regulatory scrutiny curbing outbound deals from China, the dominant dealmaking force for the past three years.
The result is an increased acceptance of buyout groups in a region well known for cosy behind-the-scenes dealmaking between established tycoons and companies.
""When we are on the sell-side, even if it is a strategic asset, the feedback (from potential buyers) would be more private equity than strategic. The clients themselves are very surprised,"" said Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS. 
The sizes of deals and proposed deals are one indication of the heightened interest of private equity.
In August Hillhouse Capital Group led a consortium that bid $17.6 billion for U.S.-listed fast food chain operator Yum China (N:YUMC). The bid was later rejected.
And last month China's  Anta Sports  (HK:2020) teamed up with private equity firm Fountainvest Partners to offer $5.3 billion for Finnish sports company Amer Sports (HE:AMEAS).
""They are not afraid of big deals,"" UBS's Lo said of private equity firms. 
TECH DEALS DOMINANT
In Europe and the United States, private equity firms flex their muscles primarily via large buyouts, but in Asia they have also made a splash investing in growth companies, especially in the internet and technology sector.
An industry who's who, including  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus, in June backed Ant Financial in its $14 billion fund raising - the world's largest such deal.
""This (tech sector) is the pond with the most fish. So do you want to fish in it or not?"" said Jim Tsao, chairman and head of China for UK-based firm Permira, a traditional buyout firm which raised its first global growth-focused fund this year. 
KKR & Co (N:KKR) also made news earlier this year when it invested in Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., the owner of China's leading news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, via convertible bonds. Toutiao is seeking a valuation of $75 billion in its latest funding round.
""Looking forward, internet and tech are still going to be the biggest sectors largely driven by China,"" said Kiki Yang, a Hong Kong-based partner at consulting firm Bain & Co, adding that the sectors would be less impacted by trade tensions as they are more related to local markets.
DRY POWDER 
The region's private equity dealmaking surge has been helped by the sheer volumes of funds available to finance it.
Last year the industry raised a record $138 billion in new funds for the region, according to data provider Preqin. The fundraising has continued this year too. Hillhouse Capital in September raised Asia's biggest fund at $10.6 billion.
The dry powder, or investable capital, reached $309 billion in September - its highest level ever.
Average deal size in the first half of this year hit a record $172 million, up 51 percent from its five-year average, according to a September report from Bain & Co.
China has been Asia Pacific's biggest market by value since 2014 and this year's $49 billion is already a record, Refinitiv data showed. India has also boomed with a record $10 billion in deals so far.
Private equity houses are also venturing into Southeast Asia, where recent changes in market regulations and the proliferation of new technologies have brought opportunities.

Warburg Pincus, KKR and TPG have all made sizable investments in Indonesia and Vietnam, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Private Equity Asia just announced on Monday it has raised over $440 million for a Thailand-focused fund.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares slid towards their lowest level in a year on Tuesday, as negative drivers from fatigued earnings and Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to a brewing spat over Italy's finances piled on the pressure.
Wall Street looked set to for another jolt lower when it reopens (N) but it was heavy selloffs in both Asia and Europe [.SS][.T], which was heading for a fifth day of uninterrupted falls, that did the main damage. (EU)
The tech sector posted the worst performance after Swiss-listed chipmaker AMS plunged 25 percent as its outlook triggered alarm bells, but there was a broader force at play.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was near a two-year low with almost half of its stocks now in bear-market territory -- down 20 percent from their peak. 
Germany's DAX dropped to late 2016 lows, MSCI's world share index was just two points of a one-year low while Wall Street's S&P 500 was set to test the lower limits of its 200-day moving average again. (N)
""This is quite an important period now because we have tried to rally a few times and haven't really managed it,"" said Natwest Markets' head of global strategy James McCormick (NYSE:MKC).
There has been a spike in U.S. bond yields similar to earlier in the year, ""but the macro picture for equities is more challenging now,"" he added, pointing to fading synchronization in global growth as well a stronger dollar.
That strength kept the euro pinned near a two-month low at $1.146 before a European Commission meeting that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of demanding changes to Italy's recently laid out budget plans. 
Italian bond traders were biding their time amid reports of some conciliatory moves from Rome's coalition but the spat has also bred doubts about the European Central Bank plans to possibly raise its interest rates next year.
Questions about the future of Britain's prime minister, mired in a stalemate over Brexit, relented just a enough to help sterling claw higher but the mood remained distinctly 'risk off' regardless. 
That helped strengthen the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell. 
""The prospect of a normalisation of (ECB) monetary policy was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now going to crumble,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.

SAUDI TENSIONS
U.S. stock index futures were pointing to a more than 1 percent fall for Wall Streets main markets later. Digger maker Caterpillar's shares fell 5.4 percent in premarket moves after it blamed U.S. tariffs for rising costs, while 3M (NYSE:MMM) slumped 7 percent after missing analysts estimates. 
Markets were also digesting Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's comments on the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month.
""Intelligence and security institutions have evidence showing the murder was planned....

133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Caterpillar Plunges Despite Reporting Best-Ever Third Quarter,"(Bloomberg) --  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). fell more than 6 percent after reporting third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates while flagging concern over rising raw materials costs.
“Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs.”
Caterpillar, an economic bellwether expected to report record earnings this year, is feeling the pinch as trade frictions boost metal costs. The company has been trying to raise prices at a time when analysts say some end-user industries may be reaching peaks in their growth cycles. The International Monetary Fund this month warned of “choppy” waters in the global economy.
The cost of benchmark steel in the U.S. has risen almost 30 percent this year amid growing global demand and U.S. tariffs on the metal that have made domestic prices expensive compared with the rest of the world.
Caterpillar fell before regular trading in New York. The heavy-equipment maker dropped to the lowest closing price this year on Monday.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>","U.S. judge affirms Monsanto weed-killer verdict, slashes damages","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday affirmed a verdict against  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) unit  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) that found its glyphosate-based weed-killers responsible for a man’s terminal cancer, sending the German company's shares down 8 percent.
In a ruling by San Francisco's Superior Court of California, Judge Suzanne Bolanos said she would slash the punitive damages award to $39 million from $250 million if lawyers for school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson agreed.
Bayer said in a statement the decision to reduce the damages was a step in the right direction, but it would still file an appeal with the California Court of Appeal, because the verdict was not supported by the evidence presented at the trial. 
""According to an earlier hearing, the judge toyed with the idea of dropping the damages altogether,"" brokerage alpha said in a note to clients. ""Now, however, the judge made a U-turn and confirmed the jury's previous verdict."" 
Monsanto, which denies the allegations, had asked the judge to throw out the entire original $289 million verdict or order a new trial on the punitive damages portion.
A jury on Aug. 10 found the company’s glyphosate-based weed-killers, including RoundUp and Ranger Pro, had caused Johnson’s cancer and that the company failed to warn consumers about the risks.
The verdict wiped 10 percent off the value of the company and marked the first such decision against Monsanto, which faces more than 8,000 similar lawsuits in the United States. 
The German company, which bought Monsanto this year for $63 billion, says decades of scientific studies and real-world use have shown glyphosate to be safe for human use.
Lawyers for Johnson in a statement on Monday said they were still reviewing whether to accept the reduced award or retry the punitive damages portion.
""The evidence presented to this jury was, quite frankly, overwhelming,"" the lawyers said.
The amount of punitive damages is limited by law, and Bolanos said California's constitution did not permit a higher award. If Johnson accepts the reduced damages, the final verdict would order Monsanto to pay a total of $78 million, split equally between compensatory and punitive damages.
Bolanos' Monday decision is a turnaround from a previous tentative ruling she issued on Oct. 10.
In that preliminary order, Bolanos said she was considering ordering a new trial on punitive damages, saying Johnson had failed to meet his burden of producing clear and convincing evidence of malice or oppression by Monsanto, a requirement for allowing a jury to award punitive damages.
But following that tentative ruling, at least five of the jurors who delivered the Aug. 10 verdict sent letters to the judge, urging her to uphold their decision. Bolanos did not directly refer to the jurors' letters in her Monday ruling, but said the jury was entitled to its findings.
In September 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found that the chemical was not a likely carcinogen to humans.
However, in 2015, the cancer unit of the World Health Organisation classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

Johnson's case, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, that he alleged was caused by years of glyphosate exposure.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been indirectly supporting local stocks, using local institutions, to limit a market crash caused by the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, sources familiar with the matter said.
Foreign investors have been dumping Saudi equities over the past two weeks. Last week, they sold 1.07 billion in Saudi stocks, in one of the biggest sell-offs since the market opened to direct foreign buying in mid-2015.
The sell-off came amid increasing investor worries over the potential blow to Saudi Arabia's relations with the West following the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Riyadh said on Saturday that Khashoggi died in a fight inside its Istanbul consulate, its first acknowledgement of his death after denying for two weeks that it was involved in his disappearance.
The Saudi index (TASI) has dropped over 4 percent since the beginning of October, but the loss would have been bigger if state-linked funds had not mounted an operation to support the stock market, several sources said.
The PIF, with assets estimated at over $250 billion and the largest shareholder in public equities in the kingdom, was one of the funds intervening in the market, buying stocks through institutional funds, fund managers and bankers said.
One of the sources said the buying by state funds was a natural response at a time when valuations were low.
Last week, PIF-backed funds bought around 5 billion riyals ($1.33 billion) of stocks, a regional fund manager said.
The PIF, which is to play a leading role in Saudi Arabia’s drive to develop non-oil industries, declined to comment.
Stocks that PIF holds stakes in are among those that have outperformed the index in the month to date, among them Riyad Bank (SE:1010), Samba Financial Group (SE:1090) and National Commercial Bank (SE:2010), according to Refinitiv data.
The Saudi index plunged by 3.9 percent on Oct. 11, the biggest drop since January 2016, and plummeted further on Oct. 14, shedding up to 7 percent during that day - its biggest drop since December 2014, when oil prices were crashing.
But by market close that day the market had recovered some of its losses, ending down 3.5 percent as state-backed funds started buying stocks to limit the damage. Since then, the pattern has continued, with stocks declining during the day and rebounding by market close.
Foreigners sold 619.9 million riyals of stocks in the week ended on Oct. 11 and 4 billion riyals of stocks in the week ended on Oct. 18, exchange data showed. [nL8N1X10O8]
It is not the first time state funds have stepped in to stabilize the market. They helped boost stocks in the days after last November's sweeping anti-corruption investigation by the government, which raised fears that people detained in the crackdown could dump assets.
Among the other $148 billion in mainly Saudi-listed assets, PIF holds stakes include Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010) and Saudi Telecom Company (SE:7010), according to Refinitiv data.

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said on Tuesday it will buy all outstanding shares of Japanese skincare firm Ci:z Holdings Co Ltd (T:4924) that it does not already own for 230 billion yen ($2.05 billion) in cash.
J&J is betting the deal - which will give it ownership of popular brands such as Dr.Ci:Labo, Labo Labo and Genomer - will help it strengthen its international innovation pipeline.
The purchase adds to a flurry of cosmetics deals in Asia in recent years, as global brands seek to expand in a booming region that includes the $53.5 billion China market by leveraging Asian brands' smart online marketing and fast turnaround times for new products.
France's L'Oreal SA (PA:OREP) agreed to buy South Korean makeup and fashion firm Nanda in May, and Unilever NV (AS:UNc) bought cosmetics firm Carver Korea for $2.7 billion last year. LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Estee Lauder  Companies Inc (N:EL) have also invested in South Korean cosmetics firms.
J&J will pay 5,900 yen per Ci:z share, a 55 percent premium over Tuesday's closing price, and also acquire the shares owned by the Japanese firm's founder Yoshinori Shirono, J&J said in a statement.
CIC Corp, the founder's ownership vehicle, is the biggest shareholder of the dermo-cosmetics specialist with a 27.96 percent interest, showed Refinitiv data.
J&J is the second-largest shareholder, owning 19.9 percent through an affiliate since 2016, allowing it to distribute Ci:z's brands outside of Japan. J&J expects the full acquisition will help it leverage the large consumer database of the collagen gel and medical skin products maker.
""This transaction will maximise value creation ... by bringing in an agile innovation model and rapidly accelerating sales through our global commercialization expertise,"" Jorge Mesquita, worldwide chairman at Johnson & Johnson's consumer division, said in the statement.
J&J, which has been selling businesses such as diabetes care devices to focus on better-performing units and product development, plans to launch the tender offer on Oct. 29.

""It is highly criticizable that the bank apparently has given wrong information to the FSA during this very long period,"" Jarlov told a meeting of the Danish parliament's business committee. ""That is very serious"".
""We must see if a liability could be claimed in this regard,"" he said. ""I think it is prudent that the FSA is examining this,"" he said.

He said it was important to find out if the bank deliberately gave apparently wrong information or if the bank did so unwittingly due to insufficient overview of its own business.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Hedge funds officially welcomed in from the shadows,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds and other alternative investments will no longer be dubbed ""shadow banks"" by global regulators, lifting a pejorative label which has stuck to the $45 trillion sector since the financial crisis.
Treated with suspicion by regulators and policymakers, ""shadow banks"" have in recent years been welcomed as providing market-based capital to plug gaps left by retreating banks.
The Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 Economies (G20) is replacing the term with ""non-bank financial intermediation"" in all its work.
""The new terminology emphasises the forward-looking aspects of the FSB's work to enhance the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation,"" the FSB, which is chaired by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, said in a statement on Monday.
As regulators tightened the noose on banks, forcing them to hold far more capital than they did before markets went into global meltdown in 2007-09, non-banking financial alternatives like investment managers and hedge funds, repurchase agreements and securitization sectors grew.
Although the FSB has introduced tougher rules since the crisis, the term shadow banking is likely to survive with the latest FSB figures showing it grew 7.6 percent to $45.2 trillion in 2016, representing 13 percent of total financial system assets in 29 jurisdictions surveyed.
The FSB also said in a statement it will develop global practices for banks to respond and recover from cyber attacks, and a report will be published by mid-2019.
But the board said much of its work program will focus on implementing and tweaking rules already agreed, rather than embarking on a wave of new regulation.
The appetite for new rules has waned, with the United States trimming its rulebook to encourage lending by banks.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell to their lowest levels in nearly two years on Tuesday after a disappointing batch of third-quarter results, particularly in the tech sector, amid ongoing worries on Brexit, Italy's budget, Saudi isolation, trade wars, Chinese growth and U.S. interest rates. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 1.3 percent at 0838 GMT, its lowest since December 2016, as it headed toward a fifth day of losses after a negative close in Asia and on Wall Street. 
Other benchmarks sustained heavy losses: the Paris CAC 40 (FCHI) fell 1.3 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXi) lost 2 percent, also at December 2016 lows.
The Frankfurt bourse's blue chips are down 16.7 percent since their January high and not far from a 20 percent fall, which typically defines a bear market. 
""Risk off the table as geopolitical tensions remain,"" was the message from LCG analyst Jasper Lawler to his clients ahead of the open.
The European tech sector (SX8P) posted the worst performance, down 3.7 percent as chipmaker AMS (S:AMS) tumbled and lost 17 percent after its outlook failed to convince investors. 
The sector, a key driver of stock markets, is down 18.4 percent since its June peak, also not far from bear market levels. 
French IT services company Atos ATOS.PA cut its revenue growth forecast for 2018 on Tuesday, citing disappointing results in Germany and North America and global economic uncertainty. 
Also losing were Sweden's Saab (ST:SAABb), which announced a rights issue, and Finnish ship technology and power plant maker Wartsila (HE:WRT1V), after a lower-than-expected quarterly profit.

Among heavy weights, Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn) dropped 7 percent after a U.S. judge affirmed a verdict against its  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit that found Monsanto weed-killers caused a man’s terminal cancer.

160,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Renault Quarterly Sales Decline on Emerging-Markets Plunge,"(Bloomberg) --  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) reported a bigger drop in third-quarter sales than analysts expected, as turmoil in emerging markets from Turkey to Iran cut into business and currencies faltered in several key countries.
The shares fell to the lowest in more than three years after the French carmaker said demand weakened in Turkey, Argentina and India, compounded by a pullout of Iran. Currency declines added to the carnage, including in Brazil and Russia. The company also cut its market outlook for China, where a slowing economy is dragging down car sales and Renault recently upped its presence.
The results highlight Renault’s unique dependence on developing countries compared with other major carmakers. The company, based in Boulogne-Billancourt, counts Russia as its biggest market outside of France, and China is now fourth. That’s placed Renault in a tricky position as trade tension between the U.S. and China, as well as President Donald Trump’s activist foreign policy, rattle smaller economies. Renault had to stop doing business in Iran, and deliveries to Turkey halved in the three months to September.
This quarter was “not an easy one,” Chief Financial Officer Clotilde Delbos told analysts during a conference call. Still, she said, the company is seeing improvement in Russia and Brazil, “which are offering us great opportunities.”
While Renault only sold 72,100 vehicles in China last year out of a total of 3.8 million autos, it recently created a joint-venture with Jinbei and Huasong there to sell commercial vehicles. The company now sees the world’s largest automotive market growing by 2 percent this year, versus a previous forecast of 5 percent, it said Tuesday in a statement.
Emission Rules
The carmaker also warned that new emission testing rules known as WLTP that entered into force last month added uncertainty on European car demand for the rest of the year. The new regulation is putting pressure on prices as dealers have been seeking to sell cars that didn’t comply with the rules.
“The fourth quarter is still going to be impacted by WLTP,” Delbos said. “But I do not have any major concern for the underlying health, let’s put it that way, of countries like France, like Germany, and Spain.”
Renault stuck to annual forecasts for operating return on sales to exceed 6 percent and to boost comparable revenue, which rose 4.4 percent since the start of the year.
The shares were down 2.6 percent to 64.06 euros at 10:23 a.m. in Paris, after earlier falling to 62.27 euros, the lowest intraday since September 2015.
Carmaker shares have buckled under weaker market conditions and trade tensions in recent months, prompting  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG to warn of lower profits.
A slowdown in China, the engine room for carmaker growth for a number of years, is adding to concerns for the sector that’s already struggling with the costly shift to electric and self-driving cars. Purchases of passenger vehicles by dealerships plunged for a third straight month during September, as deepening trade tensions with the U.S. unsettle consumers. Car sales are barely up for the year, leaving the industry facing the prospect of a first contraction in sales since at least the 1990s.
In Iran, where Renault sold almost 100,000 vehicles since the beginning of the year, deliveries were stopped as a result of U.S. sanctions, the company said. To compensate for that loss, the company is exploring new markets in Africa, including South Africa, Delbos said.
Sector Concerns
Revenue at Renault fell 6 percent to 11.5 billion euros ($13.2 billion), compared with a forecast of 12.2 billion euros of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding a drag from currency impacts from emerging-market economies like Argentina and Brazil, revenue fell 1.4 percent.
“Renault’s sales numbers were not too bad given where sentiment towards the space sits today,” Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with Evercore ISI, said in a note. “However, they are also unlikely to result in any positive sentiment shift either -- an inconclusive start to earnings season.”

The deals include agreements with French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), commodities trading house Trafigura Group and several Chinese and South Korean companies, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the matter hasn’t been officially disclosed.
Some of the deals totaling about $50 billion have already been announced, while others mark progressive steps on existing agreements. A few of the announcements are for new ventures. Trafigura declined to comment, and Total didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, seeks to portray an image of business as usual at the conference, which has endured dozens of cancellations from top bankers, chief executives, and foreign dignitaries. The gathering gained the moniker of “Davos in the desert” last year after it attracted some of the same business elite who frequent the unrelated World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The event is the brainchild of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs day-to-day business in the kingdom. 
Participants Cancel
The 33-year royal has come under pressure since the Saudi government acknowledged after days of denials that a group of his own intelligence officers had killed a Washington Post contributor, Jamal Khashoggi, at the country’s consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. 
While global business leaders commended the crown prince last year for his efforts to reform the nation’s economy, executives in industries from banking to new technologies are skipping the conference this time. Top oil industry officials, however, are still participating, including Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne and the CEOs of Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, two of the world’s top oil services groups.
The Saudi government plans a public signing ceremony for some of the deals -- mostly memorandums of understanding rather than final investment decisions -- during the conference, in what appears to be an effort to shore up confidence among international business leaders. Saudi Arabia pumps one of every ten barrels of oil consumed worldwide."

172,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",South Korea's Lotte seeks fresh start with revised $44 billion investment plan,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Lotte Group, whose chairman was released from jail this month, has reset a five-year investment plan just two years after its initial announcement, saying it now aims to spend 50 trillion won ($44.05 billion) through 2023.
The group had previously pledged $35.20 billion through 2021 after Chairman Shin Dong-bin apologized for a corruption probe involving his family. However in the intervening years, the chairman's own legal battles - in which he was jailed in February for bribery and breach of trust - stalled that plan.
""Since we set out our previous investment plan, we've been eight months without a chairman,"" said a Lotte Corp official, who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified. ""Our revised plan is to tell shareholders and the public that we are resetting our goal and making a fresh start.""
The plan follows other long-term spending pledges from Samsung (KS:005930) Group and Hyundai Motor Group, made after the liberal government assumed office in May last year calling on major firms to invest more in the local economy and create jobs.
""Lotte's investment plan is typical of a Korean family-run conglomerate,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score. ""When a family member emerges from a scandal, the firm announces an investment plan as a sort of gesture.""
Samsung similarly announced a major investment plan in the months after the release from jail of heir Jay Y. Lee, who had also been convicted of bribery.
""It's also a tradition to announce big investment plans usually within months of a new government, to respond to the administration's call for support in strengthening the economy,"" Park said.
The new plan includes about 12 trillion won to be spent in 2019, mainly to expand chemical plants in South Korea, Indonesia and the United States. The amount represents the group's largest investment for a single year, exceeding the 11.2 trillion won spent on the purchase of a petrochemical firm in 2016.
""The plan reflects our will to quickly normalize management activities that recently slowed, secure competitiveness for future growth and to contribute to revitalizing the national economy,"" holding company Lotte Corp (KS:004990) said in a statement on Tuesday.
The company declined to elaborate how much money had been spent so far under the initial five-year investment plan.
In its retail business, which includes shopping malls and supermarkets, Lotte said it would improve online services using big data and artificial intelligence, and build more malls. It also said it would hire 70,000 people over the next five years.
In China, Lotte's retail business has been struggling since the Chinese government objected to a U.S. missile defense system being deployed in South Korea on land provided by Lotte, in a row that sparked anti-Korean sentiment in the country.

Lotte Corp shares ended down 3.4 percent on Tuesday versus a 2.6 percent fall in the benchmark share price index (KS11).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) is arranging 220 billion yen ($2 billion) in financial support for its aircraft unit, which has struggled to deliver its first passenger plane, national broadcaster NHK reported on Tuesday.
Mitsubishi Heavy said in a statement that it was considering ways to resolve excess liabilities at the unit, but added it had not yet made any decisions.
Mitsubishi's regional jet program, Japan's first passenger plane since the 1960s, has been delayed by several years, with first customer ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) now expecting its delivery in 2020 rather than 2013 as originally planned.
The 90-seat MRJ was long seen as Japan's great hope to revive a dormant commercial aviation industry. Japan was banned from manufacturing aircraft for nearly a decade after World War Two. 
According to NHK, Mitsubishi's aircraft unit will issue shares worth 170 billion yen as part of a debt-to-equity swap, while Mitsubishi Heavy will forgive 50 billion yen of debt.
The aircraft unit's debts exceeded assets by about 100 billion yen at the end of March, the broadcaster also said.
Mitsubishi Heavy CEO Shunichi Miyanaga told a press conference in May that the company would increase Mitsubishi Aircraft's capitalization this fiscal year ""to enable it to emerge from insolvency"".
Analysts said there were still questions over whether the jet project could deliver.
""This support will, of course, improve Mitsubishi Aircraft's balance sheet. But that doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as accelerating the jet's development,"" said Kentaro Maekawa, a senior analyst of Nomura Securities.
The news comes on the heels of Canada's Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) decision to sue Mitsubishi's aircraft unit, saying former Bombardier employees passed on trade secrets to help Mitsubishi's jet project.
Mitsubishi Heavy's shares were down 2.7 percent in afternoon trade, slightly underperforming the broader market. 

Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp is 64 percent-owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011), with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058) each holding a 10 percent stake. Other shareholders include state-owned Development Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Corp (T:8053) and Mitsui & Co (T:8031).

181,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 01:23AM ET</span>",Philip Morris aims to revive Japan sales with cheaper heat-not-burn tobacco,"By Taiga Uranaka and Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) released cheaper versions of its IQOS ""heat not burn"" products in Japan on Tuesday as it tries to revive sales and ward off competition from other alternatives to conventional cigarettes.
As regular e-cigarettes with nicotine-laced liquid are effectively banned in Japan, the country has become the main market for ""heat not burn"" (HNB) products, which emit less smoke and smell less than conventional cigarettes.
Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, was first to start selling HNB products in Japan in 2014. But after an initial surge in sales last year, it has run into competition from  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) and Japan Tobacco Inc, and its market share has stopped growing in recent quarters.
The companies slashed prices of their heating devices earlier this year, as competition intensified.
""Clearly IQOS sales have slowed down"" since their launch in Japan, Philip Morris CEO Andre Calantzopoulos told reporters on Tuesday.
But he said the increased competition was not necessarily a bad thing in the long run if the increased choice made the products more popular among consumers.
A new ""HEETS"" line priced at 470 yen ($4.18) a pack would be available from Tuesday, he said. That is cheaper than Philip Morris's current HeatSticks, tobacco rolls used with IQOS devices, which are priced at 500 yen per pack.
""Clearly, for some people, spending 30 yen more, 40 yen more per day is expensive,"" Calantzopoulos told Reuters in a separate interview.
In mid-November, the company will also release newer versions of its ""IQOS 3"" and ""IQOS 3 MULTI"" devices. The existing versions will still be available at current prices.
Philip Morris, the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company, has seen weaker-than-expected growth in IQOS recently, after building a leading position in the global HNB market.
Japan accounts for about 85 percent of the $6.3 billion HNB market, according to Euromonitor.
Philip Morris says IQOS has a 15.5 percent share in Japan's overall tobacco market, including conventional cigarettes, but market share has stabilized.
""I think it's natural in any category that you have slowdowns,"" Calantzopoulos said. ""We have people who adopted earlier and people who are more conservative.""
Philip Morris has also made a marketing application to the FDA for IQOS, which would allow the company to sell it with a claim of reduced risk.
Philip Morris was spun off from  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc nearly a decade ago, and Altria will commercialize IQOS in the United States.
Calantzopoulos said permission for commercialization would come hopefully before the end of the year and Altria was ""ready to launch"".
A Reuters report in December identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA by Philip Morris.

On Monday, Philip Morris drew accusations of hypocrisy after using a four-page newspaper advertisement to urge smokers to quit cigarettes.

That move by the Chinese authorities led to UBS asking its wealth management staff to reconsider any travel plans to China, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
""UBS would like to confirm that we allow all our staff to travel freely in and out of the country and it is business as usual for us in China,"" the bank said in a statement issued to Reuters on Tuesday.
""UBS has had a strong franchise in China for 30 years and remains fully committed to further developing our business on the mainland.""
The Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the wealth management unit, was last week asked to delay departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.
While the purpose of the banker's meeting with authorities is not clear and UBS has declined to comment on the matter, the uncertainty led several of its rivals to ask private banking staff to reconsider trips to China.
Their caution highlighted the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.
China is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.

But its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.

The State Council announced it would support bond financing by private firms on Monday, and said the central bank will provide funding to facilitate this. The People’s Bank of China soon after announced a plan to support such issuance, without providing any details of the size of the plan, or when it would begin.
The central bank reiterated President Xi Jinping’s vows to offer ""unwavering"" support for the private sector, which has been most affected by the government’s campaign to curb debt and cut the shadow banking sector. The collapse of stock prices has also hit the private sector hard, as has the slowdown in economic growth.
The new bond support tool isn’t just a central bank policy, but an urgent, national-level policy, according to Iris Pang, Greater China economist with  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong. ""More and more companies are going to have payment difficulties on their existing bonds or existing loans,"" and the new policy ""should help avoid systemic default risk in China,"" she said.
There should be some pilot cases within the next month or so, according to Pang.
Relending Expansion
In a separate statement on Monday, the central bank also announced a 150 billion-yuan ($22 billion) increase in its re-lending and re-discounting quota. These are tools that allow the central bank to supply financial institutions with money to lend. The quota was also raised by 150 billion yuan in June.
That should be a lifeline for small and medium-sized enterprises, Pang said. ""For the SMEs, they are more likely to be exporters, so they are hurt more directly by the trade war.""
These measures are a follow-up to the confidence-boosting comments from policy makers last week, and are trying to show they are making good on their promises of supporting the private sector, said Yao Wei, chief China economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA in Paris. ""If the efforts are sustained, they will certainly be positive to everyone’s confidence in long-term reforms, even though they may not lead to a quick, short-term growth rebound.""
China’s central bank will initially provide funds to professional agencies for them to support bond issuance by private companies, the State Council said after a meeting led by Premier Li Keqiang on Monday. The PBOC will focus its support on companies ""suffering temporary difficulties but which have market share, prospects and technological competitiveness,"" it said in the statement on its website.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Arconic weighs $11 billion offer from Apollo: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - Aluminum products maker Arconic Inc's (N:ARNC) board of directors is mulling an $11 billion acquisition offer it received last Friday from buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO), according to people familiar with the matter.
The offer is at a small premium to where Arconic shares are trading, adding pressure on the U.S. company to decide if it will remain independent after President Donald Trump's imposition of aluminum tariffs drove up its costs this year and weighed on business prospects.
Apollo's offer values Arconic at between $23 and $24 per share, one of the sources said. Arconic shares ended trading on Monday at $21.45. Arconic had $6.3 billion in total debt and cash of $1.46 billion as of the end of June.
Another bidding group, comprising buyout firms Blackstone Group LP (N:BX),  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG), Onex Corp (TO:ONEX) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, has yet to submit an offer for Arconic, and it is not clear whether it will submit a bid to rival Apollo's in the coming days, the sources said.
Arconic has not yet set any firm bid deadline and no deal is imminent, though the company is hoping to reach a decision on whether it will sell itself by the time it holds its investor day next month, according to the sources. It is not clear whether more bids from other parties will emerge.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Arconic, Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board declined to comment, while Onex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Arconic's products, which are made of aluminum, titanium or nickel, are used around the world by aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation and packaging manufacturers.
Arconic, which was spun out of  Alcoa  Corp (N:AA) in 2016, said in February it would carry out a ""strategy and portfolio review.""
In August, Arconic announced it was considering selling its building and construction systems unit, which makes facades, windows and framing products. The announcement came one year after a major fire broke out at London's Grenfell Tower apartment complex, where the company's Reynobond PE panels were used in the cladding. More than 70 people were killed in the blaze.
Activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, which won board representation at Arconic last year following a proxy contest, has been instrumental in pushing the company to explore a sale, sources have said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial complaints service could be revamped within a year to better serve small firms, a report recommended on Tuesday, rejecting calls from lawmakers for a new tribunal.
Relations between lenders and small businesses have come into focus since the financial crisis after some banks and their executives were accused of asset stripping clients for personal gain.
The report, chaired by former Institute of Directors chief Simon Walker, said a new division within the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) could focus on disputes between banks and small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).
A new panel would advise the division on banking issues, said the report, which was commissioned by UK Finance, a banking trade body.
The recommendation is likely to disappoint lawmakers who have expressed doubts that the FOS could cope with an expanded remit and argued that revamping the body won't go far enough.
Tribunals can be expensive to run and use and would take years to legislate given that parliament is clogged up by Brexit, the report said. Revamping the FOS could be done by mid-2019. 
""The creation of a new tribunal vehicle solely for dealing with the financial sector would represent a significantly burdensome and bureaucratic addition to current UK legal infrastructure,"" the report said.
The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, a cross-party group of UK lawmakers who back the idea of a tribunal, said the Financial Services Tribunal is supported by senior lawyers and many banks, despite Walker dismissing the tribunal as simply being popular with politicians.
""We simply cannot accept that this would provide the holistic dispute resolution scheme that is required to make sure we level the playing field between business and banks and will continue our campaign until we do deliver the right solution,"" the APPG on Fair Business Banking said.
FINANCIAL DISTRESS 
The FOS handles complaints that individuals and small firms have failed to resolve with financial firms. Many businesses have complained they are too big to be eligible and the only alternative is a costly court case.
The report said banks dealt with small businesses in a ""cavalier manner"" during and after the financial crisis. ""Loans were called in, many businesses suffered financial distress and some collapsed,"" it said.
Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) Global Restructuring Group for instance has been accused by some small firms of stripping their assets. The bank has said it regretted mistakes made with some customers.
The FOS can only handle complaints from firms that have a turnover of less than 2 million pounds ($2.6 million) and fewer than 10 employees.
The Financial Conduct Authority said last week that from next April firms with fewer than 50 employees and annual turnover of less than 6.5 million pounds will be able to use the FOS, a big increase in the number of eligible firms.
But in a bid to ""bring closure"" to disputes going back to the financial crisis, Walker also recommended banks should voluntarily agree to mechanisms for resolving disputes at firms with turnover of between 6.5 million and 10 million pounds.
These mechanisms could also address some legacy disputes that have not been dealt with by any court or arbitration body.
UK Finance Chief Executive Stephen Jones said the industry body would work with banks and others on how best to take the Walker recommendations forward.

Saudi Arabia has drawn strong international criticism after saying that Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the consulate - after two weeks of denials that it had anything to do with his disappearance.
""I am convinced that an 'empty chairs at the table' strategy serves no useful purpose, especially when it comes to respect for human rights,"" Total's CEO Patrick Pouyanné said in a statement.
The French oil major's decision comes despite President Emmanuel Macron's decision last week to pull his finance minister out of the Future Investment Initiative conference.
It contrasts with the decision of Siemens' CEO not to attend the conference.
Another French energy company, state-owned EDF (PA:EDF), said late on Monday its CEO would not attend the conference, citing a conflicting meeting in Paris.
 Total  and Saudi Aramco co-own one of the largest refining facilities in the world, the SATORP complex in the eastern Saudi city of Jubail.
EDF hopes to sell a nuclear plant in Saudi Arabia and has submitted a bid in a Saudi tender for the project, along with several other nuclear vendors.
Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic and commercial relations spanning energy, finance and weapons. But France, which considers Riyadh a bulwark against Iranian influence in the Middle East, now faces a delicate balancing act in its response to the incident.

Macron has sought to downplay the importance of trade relations with Riyadh, saying that Saudi Arabia was not a major client of France, although from 2008-17 it was the second biggest purchaser of French arms.

The former head of family holding company Edizione which controls Italy's biggest infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), died after a short illness, the family said on Monday.
With his brothers Luciano and Carlo and sister Giuliana, Gilberto founded United Colors of Benetton in a small town in northeast Italy in 1965. Carlo died earlier this year.
The retailer rose to fame in the 1980s and 1990s with its brightly colored sweaters but faced headwinds in recent times as demand for its products fell. 
Besides Atlantia, the Benettons, one of Italy's richest families, also control travel caterer  Autogrill  (MI:AGL) and Rome's airports.
As the only member of the family on the Atlantia board, Gilberto faced a major crisis when a bridge in Genoa operated by a unit of Atlantia collapsed in August, killing 43 people.
Earlier this year Atlantia agreed a deal with Spanish builder ACS (MC:ACS) to take control of motorway group Abertis .

In a statement, the chairman of Atlantia, Fabio Cerchiai, and CEO Giovanni Castellucci said they shared the family's pain at Gilberto's death.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow fell in choppy trading on Monday as energy and financial stocks lost ground and caution grew ahead of a slew of earnings reports this week.
Technology sector gains limited losses on the S&P 500 and helped to lift the Nasdaq. The beaten-down S&P technology index was up 0.8 percent.
The S&P 500 energy index sank 1.1 percent after Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) warned that fourth-quarter earnings would miss estimates amid ongoing weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market.

""It's a big earnings week,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""That's causing some trepidation for investors. We've seen decent results but not universally, and there are some negative issues companies have talked about.""
While profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 21.9 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, many investors are focusing on the outlook for future growth due to concerns over trade, rising costs and other factors.
Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), both due to report results this week, rose on Monday. 
The Dow swung between gains and losses of more than 100 points early in the session, highlighting the volatility in U.S. equities as they struggle to recover from a recent sell-off even as the earnings season gathers steam.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 126.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,317.41, the S&P 500 lost 11.9 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,755.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.60 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,468.63.
The S&P 500 remained below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level.
Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio, thinks the market will be more volatile and investors will lean toward being more cautious in the near term, at least ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm elections.
""People are looking at the negatives and saying that it's a situation where there are more headwinds. At least until the midterms, it's going to be difficult to make any significant progress on the upside. The drift will be lower,"" he said.
Finiancial stocks fell 2.1 percent and were the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to its lowest level in more than two weeks. 
Early in the session, a surge in China stocks and positive sentiment across Europe on Moody's decision to keep Italy's sovereign rating outlook stable helped to support stocks.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 50 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 286 new lows.

About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

204,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Big Day for Dow Earnings
Earnings come fast and furious before the bell tomorrow, including from a number of Dow components that will grab the headlines.
3M (NYSE:MMM),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) will all weigh in ahead of trading.
Along with the obvious beat or miss on earnings and revenue, 3M and Caterpillar results will be examined to see any impact from President Donald Trump’s trade battles, especially with China.
Investors in Verizon will be looking for more clues on how the company plans to battle rivals in content, with AT&T (NYSE:T) nabbing Time Warner.
 United Tech  will be talking more about its acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL).
And of special interest in McDonald’s results will be any information on delivery and automated ordering, which has become part of the fast food landscape revolution.
2. Two Trump-Tied Names Also Report
Other companies of note reporting before the bell are  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU).
Politics come into play in the first of those names.
Analysts on the call will likely ask Lockheed what impact a further deterioration in U.S-Saudi relations would have on the company and how much it is relying on an arms deal Trump has touted as essential to provide U.S. jobs.
Harley-Davidson was, at one point, the face of the Trump trade wars and it will be interesting to see if tariffs are still hurting its business and if being decried by the president has had a big impact or was just quarterly noise in the end.
JetBlue will give further insight into how much higher fuel costs hit the airline industry as a whole.
3. Oil Prices Could Hinge on Turkey PM Speech
Oil prices were little changed today, but that may be the calm before the storm.
Crude could move sharply if, as expected, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan gives a speech about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi that implicates Saudi Arabia in a premeditated plot.
Erdogan has promised the “naked truth” in his speech to parliament.
That could rock Western and Saudi relations and lead to speculation of a loss of power by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This, in turn, could lead to bets that Saudi Arabia will disrupt crude production to use as leverage against any moves against it, like sanctions, despite its assurances to the contrary.
Trump said Monday that he is “not satisfied” with the current Saudi explanation of Khashoggi’s death."

208,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",This week's earnings shine spotlight on China growth risk,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It's not the U.S. economy, stupid. It's China's.
That new risk has begun rippling across Wall Street as the effects of a sharp slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy spill beyond its borders and cut into U.S. corporate profits.
How large a threat a slowdown in China's economic expansion poses could come into sharp relief as  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN), chip makers and other companies that rely on China for growth post quarterly score cards.
    The list of potential victims is growing and is not limited to U.S. companies. General Motors Co (N:GM) has suffered from shrinking Chinese auto sales and Volvo on Friday warned it expects truck demand in China to fall about 13 percent as the construction industry cools.
""The question investors will be asking is not necessarily what the impact is for the current quarter, but, 'if China continues to slow, what will the impact be for the rest of 2018 and 2019?',"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Patrick Palfrey.
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), 3M Co (N:MMM),  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Eastman Chemical Co (N:EMN) all depend on China for more than 10 percent of their revenue, according to Refinitiv estimates, and will report this week. 
Wynn Resorts, reporting on Wednesday, earned more than three-quarters of its operating income from Macau hotels and casinos last year, the biggest share for an S&P 500 company, according to Refinitiv. Its Macau operating income jumped nearly 140 percent in 2017, far outpacing 36 percent growth at its Las Vegas businesses.
 Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), which reports results on Tuesday, saw its construction machine sales in Asia Pacific surge 43 percent in the first half of the year, helped by construction and infrastructure demand in China.
In the second quarter, 3M Co's (N:MMM) China and Hong Kong organic local currency sales rose 12 percent, more than in any other region.
Several S&P 500 microchip companies also hand in reports over the next week, including Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), which depend on China for more than a fifth of their sales.
China is trying to navigate multiple challenges after a trade war with the United States sparked a blistering sell-off in domestic stock markets and a steep decline in the yuan versus the dollar. 
Concerns grew last week after China reported its slowest economic growth since the height of the global financial crisis in the third quarter.
Chinese shares have been volatile, flirting with four-year lows last week. The benchmark blue-chip index surged more than 4 percent on Monday, its sharpest gain in almost three years, after regulators revealed tax changes and other measures to support the economy and companies.
U.S. companies have been benefiting from a robust domestic economy and deep corporate tax cuts, but a China growth slowdown could hit multinationals that rely heavily on the country for growth. 
Chipmakers in recent quarters have struggled with oversupply, a problem that could worsen if demand for automobiles in China keeps weakening, or if Trump places tariffs on smartphones, televisions or other Chinese products manufactured with semiconductors.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has fallen 2 percent this year, with many investors worried it could drop further following its 38 percent rally in 2017.
""You're looking for potential triggers,"" said Bernstein chip analyst Stacy Rasgon. ""The trade war with China is one."" 
Citing weak third-quarter auto sales in China,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) last week cut its price targets for Ford Motor (N:F) and General Motors, sending Ford's stock to its lowest level since 2009. Ford is expected to report a decline in quarterly profit on Wednesday. 
China accounted for just over half of GM's vehicle sales during the first half of 2018, and in July the automaker highlighted record quarterly profit from its Chinese operations. GM stock is down about 24 percent in 2018.
Analysts on average expect a 22 percent jump in S&P 500 companies' earnings per share in the September quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
But slower earnings increases are expected for 2019, when corporate tax cuts become a year old. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a report on Friday that it expects S&P 500 earnings per share to grow 7 percent next year under a ""baseline"" scenario. But earnings would remain flat if the United States applies 25 percent tariffs to all China imports, Goldman Sachs said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.5%. The S&P 500 fell 0.44%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.26%.
Falling financials, mostly banks, kept a lid on the broader averages, weighed down by a slump in shares of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) fell more than 2%, even as the bank revealed plans to grow its consumer finance business, Marcus, in a bid to boost revenue.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and  Polaris Industries  (NYSE:PII) got the busiest week of the corporate earnings underway. Both delivered earnings that beat economists' forecast, extending a trend of upbeat earnings, but Halliburton shares sank on concerns of North American revenue.
Data from Factset showed 82% of the S&P 500 companies that have posted earnings have topped expectations.
The U.S.-China trade war, meanwhile, returned to focus, denting risk sentiment, as Chinese government leaders said they were not afraid of a trade war with the United States. This comes after a report from Axios, citing unnamed sources, suggesting that President Donald Trump wants Beijing to ""suffer more.""
Energy, meanwhile, also pressured the broader market, despite oil prices clawing back losses to end the day just above the flatline.
Losses in the broader market, however, were limited by a strong outing for tech underpinned by a rise in semiconductor stocks shrugging off a cautious note from Morgan Stanley.
""Sentiment in the group has become very negative as investor fears about a semi downturn grow,"" Morgan Stanley said in a sector report.
But Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 6%, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) also ended the day higher.
In corporate news, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly looking at acquiring a cybersecurity firm as it looks beef up the security on its social media platform, which recently suffered a cyberattack in which millions of user data were compromised. Its share rose 0.47%.
Shares of cybersecurity names including FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) closed up for the day.

210,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. Growth Engine Looks Able to Power Past Stock Market's Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Despite a slump in equities and gains in the dollar, few economists are concerned that broad financial conditions will strangle the second longest U.S. economic expansion on record.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has one of the gloomier outlooks and forecasts the the recent decline in equity markets, as well as Federal Reserve interest-rate increases and a stronger greenback, will trim growth by about three-quarters of a percentage point by mid-2019, according to economist Daan Struyven. His outlook assumes stock prices remain steady.
Other economists expressed were not convinced that overall financial conditions had tightened significantly in recent months. And by some measures, including Goldman Sachs’ own index of financial conditions, they are looser now than when the Fed started raising rates in December 2015 in order to rein in the economy.
“The real question is whether the Fed unleashes forces it then loses control of and financial conditions are tightening more substantially than they would have liked,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC in New York. “That doesn’t seem like a huge risk at this stage.”
That may help explain why Fed officials have been slow to express concern over recent stock market woes or the dollar, which has appreciated by more than 3 percent his year. While central bankers say they’re sensitive to sharp movements in financial conditions, their reaction to this months’ decline in equity prices was typified by the muted response from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.
“So far this all seems modest,” he said on Oct. 12, when the S&P 500 was coming off a six-day losing streak.
The term financial conditions refers to a handful of factors -- typically including equity prices, foreign-exchange values, credit spreads and sometimes commodity prices -- that can influence economic growth. The Fed lowers and raises short-term interest rates in the hope of affecting those conditions and nudging the economy to slow down or speed up. But the transmission is imperfect, and other factors such as fiscal policies or global economic conditions can play a role.
Though the Fed has raised its benchmark rate by two percentage points since December 2015 -- a shift that ought to strengthen the dollar by attracting more capital to the greenback -- the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has since declined 2.7 percent. And their recent drop notwithstanding, U.S. stocks have behaved similarly with the S&P 500 returning 41 percent in that period.
That means the dollar and equities are providing more support to economic momentum than they were when the federal funds rate was near zero.
And some components of financial conditions have eased when you look at recent data. For example, the spread of junk bonds over investment grade corporate credit has narrowed about 15 basis points this year.
Detecting a firm signal from financial conditions is also complex because economists and policy makers use a blizzard of models and formulas. While the closely-watched Goldman Sachs index is lower than in 2015, it has increased this year because of its sensitivity to stocks and foreign exchange. Meanwhile a different gauge produced by the Chicago Fed has continued to ease in 2018.
Recent stock moves, given less weight by Chicago, have resulted merely in what economists there termed a “leveling off” of overall financial conditions.
Economists also have any number of individual methods for interpreting fuzzy indicators of future economic activity. Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, said he likes to separate signs of “financial stress,” like bond spreads and volatility, from longer-term conditions more closely related to monetary policy.
“The latter hasn’t changed much,” Gapen said about longer-term conditions. “Messages from the Fed have been a touch more hawkish lately. The markets have baked in a little more of the Fed’s messaging, and financial conditions have probably tightened a touch.”
Gapen expressed a lingering concern, however, over what will happen when the impact of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and a burst of federal spending wear off.
“The presence of fiscal stimulus has kept spreads tight and reduced volatility,” he said. “What I worry about is that fiscal stimulus is masking an underlying tightening in monetary policy.”
More reason to monitor a measure of financial conditions. Just choose carefully.

""At this stage in the company's evolution, I feel it needs a more hands-on Chair, who can focus on the business and these opportunities,"" the statement quoted Branson as saying.
""It will be difficult for me to fulfil that commitment as I already devote significant time to my philanthropic ventures and the many business within the Virgin Group.""
Virgin Hyperloop One's biggest shareholder, Dubai's DP World (DI:DPW), said the company was seeking a new chairman.
Earlier this month Branson said his Virgin Group would suspend discussions with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment in the group's space ventures, in light of the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi who was killed inside the consulate in Istanbul..

Branson also suspend his directorship in two Saudi tourism projects around the Red Sea.

The stock of the economic bellwether is headed for its worst monthly performance since 2015 as investors await third-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors are looking at industrial earnings with a “glass-half-empty” mindset, according to Karen Ubelhart of Bloomberg Intelligence.
Among the things emptying that glass are worries that the full impact of U.S.-China trade frictions has yet to be felt at a time when many industrial customers may be reaching peaks in their growth cycles. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of mining and construction equipment, said as recently as last month that the trade spat hadn’t yet dented sales.
During this earnings period, “there’s been a lot of companies that beat and raised and the market just doesn’t seem to care right now,” Stephen Volkmann, managing director of equity research at Jefferies LLC in New York, said by phone. “It’s all about whether we’re at the peak of the cycle right now.”
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company is expected to report third-quarter earnings of $2.85 a share excluding one-time items on Tuesday, based on the average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company has posted earnings that topped analysts’ estimates in every quarter since mid-2016.
Shares in the manufacturer fell to the lowest closing price this year on Friday after Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON). flagged potential costs in the “hundreds of millions of dollars” from higher Chinese and U.S. tariffs.
At the start of earnings season, “people went in worried and now they are looking for the things that are negative,” Ubelhart said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. Caterpillar “is one of those cyclicals that people are worried about.”
Caterpillar’s earnings will come a day after Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. escalated its criticism of the Trump administration’s metals tariffs, which the automaker has said are taking a bite out of profit. Domestic hot-rolled coil -- the benchmark price for American-made steel -- has gained almost 30 percent in 2018 as the Trump administration implemented tariffs on imports.
Caterpillar said in July that would boost prices to offset as much as $200 million in costs brought on by tariffs.
Even with the recent share sell-off, Ubelhart expects global machinery demand to stay robust into 2019. The U.S. construction market continues to expand, commodity price gains support mining equipment sales and heavy truck production should accelerate as orders remain robust, she said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. equity short sellers are rooting for a Republican sweep of Congress in U.S. elections on Nov. 6, which are seen as partly a vote on President Donald Trump's pro-business policies, a leading Wall Street short seller said on Monday.
Brad Lamensdorf, a portfolio manager and advisor to the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF, also said in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum online chat room that electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) was too risky for his portfolios betting on stock market losses, while the buoyant U.S. oil sector was ripening as a bet for bears.
Here are chat excerpts:
Question: Each day, it's more difficult to predict whether or not the GOP (Republican Party) will be forced to share power in Washington. Which scenario is best for shorts?
Answer: Markets act the best when the Senate and Congress (House of Representatives) are split; that way nothing gets done, and the environment stays more consistent. As a short seller I want more volatility. So, I would like it for the Republicans to get both.
Q: Are U.S. stocks vulnerable to a major selloff? 
A: The price-to-sales is at an historic high. Sentiment is bullish for the most part. Consumer confidence ... shows everyone is very bullish too. It all points to more disappointment for the markets next year.
Q: Do you own any Tesla, the electric-car maker that is a well-known short?
A: Tesla is troubled but it’s too watched; so we stay away. The borrowing (costs) also stays high, so we like more stealth names to short. When shorting a stock, you want people to not have any hope and sell and keep selling. (Tesla CEO Elon) Musk can keep hope alive, and that is bad for a short seller.
Q: What is your read on oil and its heavy debts among frackers?
A: We have not been short oil for 3-4 years but I’m starting to like it now, and I am looking for shorts. Sentiment is quite high but there is a bottleneck in the Permian Basin right now. And in 6-18 months, it’s going to gush! At the same time, NOAA has come out and forecasted a warm winter. A double bang for oil bulls.

Segars is the latest among several high-profile company executives to pull out of the conference amid mounting pressure on Riyadh over the disappearance and alleged killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Arm Holdings was acquired by SoftBank Group (T:9984) in 2016 for $32 billion.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Monday that SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will not be attending the Saudi Arabia investment conference this week. 

Softbank's Vision Fund, nearly half of whose $93 billion in funding came from Saudi Arabia, acquired a 25 percent stake in Arm from SoftBank last year, among the fund's largest deals to date.

216,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Ford Says Trump Tariffs Make U.S. Steel Costliest in the World,"(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. said Donald Trump’s tariffs have made steel more expensive in the U.S. than any other market, escalating the company’s criticism of the president’s trade war.
“U.S. steel costs are more than anywhere else in the world,” Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of global operations, said Monday at an event marking the start of Ranger pickup production at a factory west of Detroit. He added that Ford is talking to the administration about the tariffs: “We tell them that we need to have competitive costs in our market in order to compete around the world.”
Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett last month called on President Donald Trump’s administration to resolve trade disputes quickly, warning that they would otherwise do more damage to the second-largest American automaker. He said the company sustained a roughly $1 billion hit to profit despite the fact that it sources most of its metals from the U.S.
Domestic hot-rolled coil -- the benchmark price for American-made steel -- has gained 28 percent in 2018 as the Trump administration implemented tariffs on imports. The levies helped push the price to about $920 a metric ton earlier this year, the highest in a decade.
‘Babies’
Trump has portrayed his levies as key to getting other countries to cow to his trade demands. When celebrating a trade deal with Canada and Mexico to replace Nafta earlier this month, he referred to those who have complained about tariffs as “babies.” The president also accused motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). of using them as an excuse to move jobs overseas.
It’s been a rocky road for relations between Ford and Trump. He repeatedly attacked the company on the campaign trail in 2016 for announcing its intention to move small-car production to Mexico. The automaker earned the president-elect’s praise for nixing that plan weeks before his inauguration.
Trump has since answered a call by Ford and other carmakers for the U.S. to re-examine fuel economy standards set by the Obama administration. The company received this relief with some trepidation, clarifying that it wasn’t asking for a rollback to rules and didn’t want the federal government to battle states led by California over their tougher standards.
China Challenges
Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs aren’t the only way in which his trade policies have had an impact on Ford. In August, the automaker scrapped a plan to sell a new model called the Focus Active in North America. Ford cited the U.S. slapping an additional 25 percent levy on vehicles imported from China, where the crossover will be built.
President Xi Jinping has gone tit-for-tat with Trump, matching his 40 percent tariff on imported vehicles. That’s led Ford to reduce American exports to China, particularly of Lincoln models that it’s trying to sell in the world’s biggest auto market.
While Ford only imports a small number of vehicles into China, it’s been struggling mightily in the market. Sales there have declined in 14 of the last 15 months and plunged 43 percent in September, as trade tensions combine with a stale lineup and dearth of sport utility vehicles to drag on demand.
“We encourage all counties -- but especially the U.S. and China -- to work together,” Hinrichs said. “We think it’s in the global economy’s interest to do so.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Barington Capital Group L.P. on Monday turned up the heat on Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin' Brands Inc's board by urging it to hire an independent chair to push management to spin off three smaller restaurant chains.
The New York-based hedge fund said Bloomin' Brands chief executive, Elizabeth Smith, who also serves as board chair, has held the company back, blaming her for a lagging stock price, lower revenue growth and a lack of strategic focus.
Now Barington is pressuring not only management to make better operational decisions but also the board to bring in someone who can oversee management more effectively.
Barington asked the board ""to appoint an independent Chairman to help improve Board oversight of management and the strategic direction of the Company"" in a letter seen by Reuters.
Bloomin' Brands' lead independent director James Craigie said the board is ""actively engaged in overseeing the strategy of the Company,"" and supports management and its successful ongoing efforts.
Barington wants Bloomin' Brands to hire a strategic adviser and to spin off Bonefish Grill, Carrabbas and Flemings into a new company. Outback, a more casual steakhouse chain, should be operated separately, the hedge fund said.
Barington has not called for Smith to be replaced as CEO but pointed to shortcomings in its seven-page long letter.
""Smith has failed to create meaningful long-term value for shareholders during her tenure as a public company CEO,"" Barington wrote. It is concerned ""that Ms. Smith has not announced measures to improve the Company's strategic focus,"" the fund said, adding ""A more focused management team would perform substantially better."" 
Barington first raised concerns with Smith in February. The fund said Smith has declined to meet or speak in person. The fund has spoken with the chief financial officer and an investor relations executive and the company said there have been seven discussions with Barington. 
It urged the board to add other independent directors and offered to supply names.
Bloomin' Brands stock has fallen 8.34 percent this year and was trading at $19.85 on Monday. In February, Barington forecast the price could climb to roughly $41 a share if its suggestions were followed.
While a number of activist investors have called for the ouster of a CEO even at the outset of campaigns, Barington prides itself on working collaboratively with target companies and has run only seven proxy contests during its 18-year long life-time.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Corona brewer Constellation seeks to sell U.S. wine brands - sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ), the U.S. producer of Corona and Modelo beers, is looking to sell some of its U.S.-based wine brands, in a deal that could be worth more than $3 billion, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Constellation's review of its wine portfolio underscores the family-controlled company's gradual shift to beer and cannabis products that target a younger demographic. Founded as a small wine producer in upstate New York in 1945, Constellation has grown to be worth more than $40 billion thanks to bets on offerings such as premium imported Mexican beers. 
Constellation, the third-largest brewer in the United States behind Anheuser-Busch NV (BR:ABI) and MillerCoors, has hired investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) to explore the divestitures, the sources said on Monday.
Among the wine brands that Constellation is considering selling are Clos du Bois, Mark West, Arbor Mist and Cooks, one of the sources said. Collectively, Constellation could sell wine brands that generate 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than $260 million, according to the sources. 
The sources cautioned that no deal was certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
""We continue to focus on driving growth organically and through acquisition and innovation at the higher end of our wine & spirits portfolio, which has consistently grown three- to four-times the U.S. market rate,"" a Constellation spokesman said in an emailed statement.
""We are also considering a variety of potential actions to optimize value at the low end of our portfolio, so we can direct our growth efforts and investment dollars more fully towards our focus brands,"" the Constellation spokesman added in the statement.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Constellation announced last week that its chief executive of 11 years, Rob Sands, would step down in March, handing the reins over to President and Chief Operating Officer Bill Newlands.
Wine accounted for 38.6 percent of Constellation's consolidated net sales of $7.6 billion in the 12 months to the end of February, down from 44.7 percent of net sales two years ago.
The company's beer business, on the other hand, has continued to grow. Constellation said this month that its portfolio of international and craft beer brands was the top market share gainer in the U.S. beer industry in the second quarter of this year, partly thanks to younger drinkers who continue to shun domestic beers.
The Modelo brand has delivered a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 20 percent in the last five years, Sands said this month on a company earnings call. 
Meanwhile the company has also been expanding in the legal marijuana industry, splashing out $3.8 billion in August to boost its 10 percent stake in a Canadian seller of marijuana products Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED) to 38 percent.
This would not be the first time Constellation has explored divesting some wine brands. In 2016, it agreed to sell its Canadian wine business to Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan for about C$1.03 billion ($775 million).

220,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 02:17PM ET</span>","Ford sees higher metal costs, hopes China and U.S. can settle trade issues","By Ben Klayman
WAYNE, Mich. (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has seen higher steel and aluminum costs driven by trade tariffs bite into profit, but is hopeful the United States and China can avoid further tensions that could make things more costly, a top Ford executive said on Monday.
The United States said in March it would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum from most countries. The tariffs have allowed U.S. steel producers to raise their prices.
""They're certainly up year over year and they're up versus what we were expecting,"" Joe Hinrichs, Ford executive vice president and president of global operations, said of steel and aluminum costs.
U.S. steel costs are higher than anywhere else in the world, Hinrichs told reporters. Ford officials have been working with all the parties involved, including the U.S. government, to address the issues, he said at a plant in Wayne, Michigan, to celebrate next week's production launch of the Ranger midsize pickup truck. 
While the United States reached a new regional trade agreement with Canada and Mexico late last month, the tariffs remain an issue. In addition, the United States and China are locked in a spiraling trade war in which they have lobbed increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
The U.S. auto industry has warned against imposing more tariffs on Chinese products, saying that doing so would harm vehicle sales and cost jobs.
The only Ford exports that have been hurt have been vehicles built for the Chinese market, due to that country's move to increase tariffs to 40 percent after the United States slapped 25 percent tariffs on Chinese-built vehicles entering the United States, Hinrichs said. However, the affected vehicles are not a significant volume.
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford last month said the automaker wanted trade deals that allowed it to plan and invest with certainty. The day before, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs would cost the automaker $1 billion in profit in 2018 and 2019.
The new Ranger pickup will go on sale in early January, bringing back a vehicle Ford previously killed in 2011.

Ford's decision to invest $850 million in the Wayne plant to build the Ranger and a new Bronco SUV won praise last year from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Aegean Airlines reached an agreement with European planemaker Airbus in March for the order of 42 aircraft worth $5 billion (4.36 billion euros) to renew its fleet of single-aisle planes and add capacity for future expansion.
The order was the largest by a Greek carrier and one of the biggest investments by a private Greek company in recent years.
Aegean Airlines said Pratt & Whitney engines would be used for 30 firm, 12 option, and up to 20 leased aircraft. 
""We selected the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine to provide our passengers with the newest and most advanced technology available for our new Airbus aircraft,"" said Eftichios Vassilakis, Aegean Airlines' Chairman.

The agreement with Airbus was part of a fleet expansion and renewal program expected to take place between 2020 and 2025.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Industrial gases groups Praxair (NYSE:PX) and Linde won U.S. antitrust approval for their $86 billion merger on Monday, clearing the last hurdle for the deal in the nick of time.
The all-share merger of equals will create an industry leader with revenues of about $27 billion based on 2017 figures, and 80,000 employees across more than 100 countries, which will be called Linde plc.
That will make it bigger than France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP), which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas (NYSE:ARG).
Shares in Linde jumped 4 percent, while Praxair shares were up 2.4 percent at 1335 GMT.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Monday that the companies would have to divest assets in nine industrial gases product markets in United States as part of a settlement that resolves antitrust charges.
The companies had been up against a Wednesday deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules, almost two years after agreeing the deal in principle in December 2016.
Under a finely balanced power-sharing agreement, the new company will be registered in Dublin, board meetings will be held in London, and operating headquarters will be in both Munich and Danbury, Connecticut, with Chief Executive Steve Angel and finance chief Matt White based in the latter.
Shares will be listed in both New York and Frankfurt.
Linde said last week it had agreed with FTC staff on remedies to secure approval but that the package was still under review by FTC's top-level commissioners.
All other relevant competition authorities have previously given the green light, including the European Commission, which was won over by a deal to sell Praxair's European gases business to Japanese rival Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp. 
Also on Monday, the EU signed off on Taiyo Nippon Sanso as a suitable buyer.
Linde lined up a consortium of gases firm Messer and investor CVC (CVC.UL) in July as a buyer of its North and South American assets to allay U.S. antitrust concerns, but talks with the FTC later hit a snag, requiring more asset sales.

The companies have until Jan. 29 next year to complete certain divestitures in the United States, and need to remain separate and independent companies until the majority of these deals are wrapped up, Linde added.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>","Hasbro results dented by lingering Toys 'R' Us woes, shares drop","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) missed analysts' expectations for quarterly revenue and profit on Monday, as the demise of major retail partner Toys 'R' Us hurt sales in Europe and the United States, sending its shares down as much as 8 percent.
The company and rival  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) have scrambled to find new avenues to sell their products following the sudden collapse of Toys 'R' Us, once the world's largest standalone toy retailer, a year ago.
""As we go into 2019, we certainly believe we'll continue to make up for the Toys 'R' Us difference,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said on a post-earnings call.
""Our goal in holiday 2018 is not to necessarily make up the Toys 'R' Us difference this year.""
Investor expectations were high going into the third quarter after Goldner and Wall Street analysts hinted the company may mitigate some of the impact from the toy retailer's bankruptcy in the second half of the year.
But Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based Hasbro reported a 7 percent drop in quarterly sales in the United States and Canada to $924.2 million, due to the loss of Toys 'R' Us revenue and an inability to meet shipping demands of other retailers.
Hasbro and Mattel are retooling their supply chains to target more retailers since the collapse of Toy 'R' Us, but volumes remain still below levels before the toy retailer's bankruptcy filing. 
Traditional toymakers have also been rattled in recent years by thousands of manufacturers selling on Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and other e-commerce sites, as well as kids preferring electronic games over physical toys.
The drop in Hasbro's international sales was much steeper, down 24 percent, pressured by changing consumer shopping trends and a stronger dollar.
""International revenues were the biggest surprise,"" B Riley analyst Susan Anderson said. 
Sales in Hasbro's partner brands that include tie-ups with Marvel and Disney also fell 37 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, partly due to the absence of a major movie release in the quarter.
The company also said on Monday it was restructuring its business, which would lead to severance charges of $50 million to $60 million in the current quarter.
Hasbro did not disclose the number of layoffs, but told Reuters last week that it would be a ""single-digit percentage"" of its global workforce. The company had more than 5,000 employees as of Dec. 31.
Excluding certain items, Hasbro earned $1.93 per share, missing expectation of $2.23, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Revenue also fell short of expectations.

Hasbro shares were down nearly 5 percent at $93.41 in late-morning trade, while those of Mattel were down 2 percent.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Aston Martin considers flying in components, changing ports to handle Brexit","By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Aston Martin is considering flying in car components and moving more parts through UK ports other than Dover to avoid possible border friction after Britain leaves the European Union, its boss told Reuters.
Chief Executive Andy Palmer said changing to alternative ports or flying in parts would add costs compared to sticking with Dover, where there are concerns among firms that the port may not be able to cope with new customs checks after Brexit.
London and Brussels hope to reach an agreement soon on Britain's exit from the EU. The automotive sector, however, is worried that if there is a hard Brexit or no Brexit deal port and motorway snarl-ups could disrupt production, affecting the movement of thousands of components and vehicles to and from the continent every day.
With just over five months until Brexit day, carmakers have triggered contingency plans such as moving shutdown periods, certifying models abroad and redrawing production schedules. 
At stake is Britain's car industry, which employs roughly 850,000 people and is one of its few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s. 
Aston, which this month became the first British carmaker in decades to list on the London Stock Exchange, predominately uses Dover for moving components.
""The European-sourced parts, which include the engine and the gearbox as a complete assembly, come back in from Europe so an alternative port is one way, predominately for lorries, and then reserving space on aircrafts for one-off shipping,"" Palmer told Reuters. 
""You can get a few days of engines and gearboxes relatively easily into the cargo decks of a plane so whilst it's relatively expensive that is probably our primary backup,"" he said, adding the company only did so in an emergency at present. 
Coventry and Birmingham airport, near the firm's central English Gaydon plant, and the port of Sunderland are among the locations the firm is considering for such contingencies.
'BETTER THAN NOT MAKING CARS' 
With Britain due to leave the European Union on Mar. 29, Palmer said the plan would have to be approved by the board by the end of the year, in an example of decisions executives are needing to take without clarity on what Brexit will mean. 
""There is undoubtedly a cost associated with it, but it's cheaper than not building cars,"" he said. 
""I simply work to the worst and hope for the best.""
After earlier this year switching its car approvals from Britain's vehicle agency to Spain's due to uncertainty over the validity of such licenses, Palmer said its crossover DBX will also be approved there. 
""You're forced to make a change,"" he told Reuters. ""Once you set in place a process, you tend to stick with that process because it works."" 
The United States is also due to overtake Britain in 2018 as the firm's single biggest country market as the firm continues a strategy to mitigate Brexit risk with a U.S. sales drive, reducing its reliance on the EU. 
Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday sought to reassure business leaders that the EU was still committed to a deal this autumn, which would avoid disruption next year. 
Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost the firm 1.2 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) per year with the firm's boss saying he still did not know whether his plants could still operate. 
Despite the Brexit uncertainty, Aston successfully floated earlier this month but its share price has since fallen by over 20 percent. 
Palmer said most shareholders knew the firm would deliver long-term value as it rolls out a series of new models. 
""When we made the pitch to investors, I think almost all understood that this is basically a long-term story and it is all about value creation... and that's what we are going to deliver,"" he said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank, which is involved in a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal in Estonia, processed a large share of the country's cross-border payments between 2008 and 2015, its central bank said on Monday.
Estonia has been rocked by revelations that banks there laundered money from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank accounts.
Shares in Nordic banks Swedbank, SEB and Nordea slumped when media reports this month suggested that the scale of the money laundering through the small Baltic country may have been larger then previously thought.
""Statistics show clearly that a large share of total cross-border payments was processed by Danske Bank,"" the Estonian central bank said in a statement.
The central bank said earlier this month that banks doing business in Estonia handled cross-border transactions of more than $1 trillion in and out of the country between 2008 and 2017.
At the peak in 2013, Danske Bank processed 29.8 billion euros of payments going out of the country, giving it a market share by volume of 41.3 percent, the central bank said.
In the 2008-2015 period, Danske processed 147.7 billion euros of the total 446.5 billion payments going out of the country, while Swedbank, SEB and Nordea processed 104.5 billion euros, 74.8 billion euros and 44.4 billion euros, respectively, according to the central bank.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 09:42AM ET</span>",Global banks curb China travel after UBS banker stopped from leaving,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global banks including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) have asked their private banking staff to postpone or reconsider travel to China after authorities there prevented a UBS banker from leaving the country, sources said.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people familiar with the matter said.
Swiss private bank Julius Baer, which manages assets worth $390 billion globally, has asked staff to be cautious about China travel plans, a separate person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.
The purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.
Their caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.
China is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.
But its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.
BNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
FREQUENT TRAVEL
UBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Most offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients. 
Citi asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
JPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said. 
Bank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
A Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.
UBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC and Julius Baer.
Credit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.

The number of high net-worth individuals – those with at least $1 million to invest – rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Market turmoil forced Italy to tighten bad loan guarantee scheme,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - The turmoil in Italian asset markets since May has forced Rome to tighten a state guarantee scheme devised to help banks offload bad loans, making it costlier for lenders, an EU Commission document showed.
Regulators and investors see efforts to clean up bad loans as crucial for the full recovery of the Italian banking sector, which is again in the market's crosshairs due to the falling value of its large sovereign bond holdings.
Italy introduced the 'GACS' guarantee scheme in 2016 to help banks tackle a 360 billion euro ($414 billion) pile of problem loans left behind after a deep recession.
The Commission on Aug. 31 granted a final six-month extension to the scheme, which allows banks to buy a guarantee from the state at market prices to ease sales of bad loans repackaged as securities.
The price of the guarantee reflects the cost of insuring debt issued by a basket of Italian corporates and financials against default, as measured by credit default swaps (CDS).
However, CDS on Italy's debt  have nearly tripled since mid May, when investors were spooked by the prospect of a new anti-establishment coalition government with profligate spending plans and anti-euro rhetoric.
In approving the extension to the GACS scheme, the Commission noted that such a sharp increase in CDS levels, including a 40 percent rise on one day, was a very rare event.
""The fact that CDS premiums have not eased considerably since then could be interpreted as a ... change in the market, representing a fundamental reassessment of risks inherent to Italy,"" the Commission said. 
To avoid breaching EU state aid rules when seeking the renewal, Italy proposed calculating the CDS average, which is used to price the GACS, over a period of two months, instead of the six months used previously, when the difference between the two calculations exceeds a certain threshold.
The shortening of the calculation period prevents Italian banks from benefiting from the lower CDS levels before the market sell-off. 
A person working on a bad loan sale said the changes translated into lower prices for the bad loan portfolios being sold and hence larger losses for banks, stymieing the bad loan market.
After a slow start due to the patchy state of Italian banks' loan records and its own complexity, the GACS scheme has been a key contributor to banks' bad debt sales. 
Bad loans are normally sold at a loss and the hit to banks' capital limits the amount of these assets lenders can offload.
The guarantee wraps the least risky notes in bad loan securitization issues, reducing the overall financing cost of the transaction, helping banks achieve a better price. 
Italian banks had cut their pile of impaired debt to 264 billion euros by the end of last year, according to consultancy PwC. 
Bailed-out Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) has tapped the GACS scheme in a record 24 billion euro bad loan securitization. UniCredit (MI:CRDI), Creval (MI:PCVI), Carige (MI:CRGI) are among other banks that have used the guarantee.

(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co's third-quarter profit edged past analysts' estimates on Monday, helped by its international business, even as pipeline bottlenecks in North America led to fewer well completions.
Halliburton, the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services, has seen demand for its services soften as U.S. producers cut down on spending and transportation bottlenecks in the Permian basin of west Texas and New Mexico pushed the price of regional crude lower. 
The company had previously warned that slowing growth in the largest U.S. shale basin would impact its results. 
But while demand for its North American completions services has weakened, the firm's international business is showing signs of recovery, the company said on Monday, as global oil prices have climbed to around $80 a barrel.
Halliburton's international revenue rose 5 percent from the second quarter to $2.4 billion, while in North America, revenues decreased 2 percent sequentially to $3.74 billion. North American revenues are up 18.2 percent year-over-year.
""Our international business continues to show signs of a steady recovery,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said in a statement.
Shares of Halliburton were up about 2 percent in pre-market trading at $38.30. In September, they fell to a two and a half year low after the company warned of slowing U.S. activity. 
Analysts from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) on Monday said Halliburton's results were ""neutral to slightly positive."" 
Rival Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) also managed a slight profit beat on Friday and cautioned that North American growth would slow due to the bottlenecks and hurt results next quarter.
Net profit attributable to Halliburton rose to $435 million, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $365 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 50 cents per share, beating average analysts' estimate of 49 cents per share, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Total revenue rose to $6.17 billion from $5.44 billion a year ago. Analysts had anticipated revenues of $6.13 billion for the quarter, according to Refinitiv estimates.

TOKYO/MILAN (Reuters) - Japan's Calsonic Kansei, owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR, has agreed to buy Fiat Chrysler's Magneti Marelli for 6.2 billion euros ($7.1 billion) to form the seventh-largest independent car parts supplier.
The first big deal by FCA's newly-appointed chief executive Mike Manley, who took over in July after the sudden death of long-time boss Sergio Marchionne, creates a company with revenue of 15.2 billion euros ($17.5 billion), the companies said.
The newly formed Magneti Marelli CK Holdings is likely to cut costs through synergies and expand its customer base as components makers try to keep up with a shift by carmakers into autonomous driving, connected cars and electric vehicles.
""This combination with Calsonic Kansei has emerged as an ideal opportunity to accelerate Magneti Marelli's future growth,"" Manley said on Monday of the FCA unit, which specializes in lighting, powertrain and high-tech electronics. 
FCA shares were up 5.2 percent at 0906 GMT as investors welcomed the hefty price tag, which will boost FCA's net cash position and raises expectations of a share buyback.
""Getting this transaction completed at the price agreed is a significant early milestone and accomplishment,"" George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said of Manley and his team's ability to match Marchionne's deal-making reputation.
Marchionne had set in motion a process to spin off the unit and distribute its shares to FCA shareholders by early 2019, but said in June that FCA would still be ""receptive"" to an offer.
Neither FCA nor its top shareholder, Fiat's founding Agnelli family, will have a stake in the combined business but FCA said it would enter into a multi-year agreement to secure supplies to its plants and also to maintain operations and staff in Italy.
GLOBAL AMBITION
KKR bought Calsonic from Nissan and other shareholders in 2016, saying it would help the parts maker, which relies on the Japanese carmaker for most of its sales, to expand globally.
Calsonic has been in talks with FCA for months and made an initial 5.8 billion euro bid, sources have said.
FCA does not break out earnings for Magneti Marelli, which sits within its components unit alongside robotics specialist Comau and castings firm Teksid. The unit employs around 43,000 people and operates in 19 countries.
A takeover of Magneti Marelli had remained elusive as potential bidders were offering too little or were only interested in some parts of the business. 
FCA also preferred the Calsonic offer to a pure private equity bidder because it limits the risk of the unit being broken up, sources have said. 
JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were financial advisers to FCA on the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of next year and is subject to regulatory approvals.

(Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures fell a tad earlier this week before Federal Reserve's release of minutes from its policy meeting last month, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The Treasuries market had stabilized earlier this week from heavy losses in the previous two weeks due to jitters about rising inflation and a faster pace of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.
The Fed's record of its Sept. 25-26 meeting suggested a few policymakers are open to raising short-term interest rates above a ""neutral"" level as the economy has been growing faster than their forecast.
The latest minutes sparked a dramatic selloff in the money markets that caused a sharp spike in key short-term rates on Thursday. Bond yields however were buffered by safe-haven demand from losses on Wall Street.
The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 615,970 contracts on Oct. 16, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data.
A week earlier, speculators held 622,422 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures.
In addition to the FOMC minutes, big swings in global equity prices and worries about Italy's budget, Brexit negotiations and strained relations between United States and Saudi Arabia have stoked volatility in the bond market the latter part of this week, analysts said.
On Friday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ended up 2 basis points at 3.196 percent, holding below the 7-1/2 year high of 3.261 percent reached last week. 
By investor groups, asset managers increased their net longs in 10-year T-notes to 987,547 contracts, while hedge funds raised their net 10-year T-note shorts to 833,471 contracts.
Bond dealers' 10-year net shorts slipped to 231,145 from prior week's 232,818, which was the highest level since late August, CFTC data showed.
Among other bond contracts, speculative net shorts in ultra bonds reached a record peak of 244,975 contracts on Tuesday.
On the other hand, speculators pared their T-bond net shorts to 103,937 contracts from previous week's 138,382, which was the highest since June 2007.
Among interest rate futures, speculators rebuilt their net shorts in Eurodollar to 2.59 million contracts from 2.47 million contracts which were the fewest since late December. 
They increased their net shorts in federal funds for first time in four weeks to 30,038 contracts.

Cigarettes account for the vast majority of Philip Morris's revenue, but the company has repeatedly stated a longer-term vision to replace cigarette sales with products such as its IQOS tobacco-heating device, which it says is less dangerous.
""This is staggering hypocrisy from a tobacco company to promote its own smoking-cessation products in the UK while continuing to promote tobacco cigarettes across the world,"" Cancer Research UK said. 
""The best way Philip Morris could help people to stop smoking is to stop making cigarettes.""
Philip Morris has said that Britain, where advertising and marketing of cigarettes is prohibited, could eradicate cigarettes in coming years. British health regulators have also endorsed e-cigarettes as a way to help people to quit. 
""This campaign is simply PR puff,"" said Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy for Action on Smoking and Health.
""If they were serious about a smoke-free world they wouldn't challenge tobacco legislation around the world but instead support regulations that will really help smokers quit and prevent children from taking up smoking.""
Last year Reuters published a special report on efforts by Philip Morris to subvert the World Health Organization’s global tobacco treaty, which is aimed at reducing smoking worldwide. https://reut.rs/2OEoUHQ

263,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Foreigners Are Dumping Saudi Stocks Like Never Before,"(Bloomberg) -- The crisis triggered by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is hurting Saudi Arabia’s plans to attract and retain international stock-market investors.
Foreigners were net sellers of a total of 4 billion riyals ($1.1 billion) of stocks last week, more than any other since data was first made available in 2015, with the exception of a one-time outflow from a single transaction in September 2017. Most of the sales came from qualified foreign institutional investors, which were first authorized to trade directly in the market three years ago. Local retail investors were also net sellers for the week, while Saudi institutions were net purchasers.
Investors from outside the kingdom and local individuals accelerated sales as volatility surged amid escalating concerns tied to the government’s potential involvement in the death of Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the killing was carried out by a “rogue operation” that then tried to cover it up. European leaders and even President Donald Trump have expressed skepticism over the official explanation.
The crisis comes as the kingdom’s market regulator and its stock exchange, known as Tadawul, proceed with reforms aimed at aligning the market with international standards as part of a broader plan to diversify the economy. Foreigners are still net buyers for the year after they accelerated purchases in the first half, when FTSE Russell and MSCI Inc. announced they will upgrade Saudi Arabia to an emerging market starting in 2019.
“The record amount of the sell-off really shows the gravity of the situation,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK in London. “The Saudis have suffered a major set back, and it is going to take a very long time and hard work for them to gain the same kind of confidence.” The Tadawul All Share Index fell as much as 2.1 percent on Monday.
Despite the increased concerns, the main Saudi stock gauge posted a 1.6 percent increase for the week, prompting traders to speculate that funds tied to the government could be propping up shares, a suggestion that hasn’t been confirmed. Numbers provided by the stock exchange on Sunday show that Saudi institutional investors were net buyers of 7.8 billion riyals in the week ended Oct. 18, the highest value since June 2017.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>","Italy relief, China stimulus hopes lift global stocks","By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares gained on Monday amid relief over Italy's budget, following rallies in Asia after China promised to provide stimulus to stabilize its economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.
Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of support for stock markets in the world's second-largest economy saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three years. Shanghai blue chips jumped around 4.5 percent, adding to Friday's bounce on Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. 
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains.. 
European stocks opened higher after Moody's kept Italy's sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of cutting it to negative. The decision fueled a rally in Italian government bonds and boosted shares in the country's banks.
""Moody's opens the door for a euro bounce, while Chinese verbal support for the economy and markets has given us a risk-friendly mood to start the week,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said in a note to clients. 
The mood looked to spill over into U.S. markets, where E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were 0.4 percent higher while Nasdaq's added 0.7 percent. 
This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) among the companies reporting.
Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
""The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being 'strong' and the vast majority of companies will exceed consensus expectations,"" said analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note.
""However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.""
The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial conditions would trigger the next downturn.
ITALIAN RELIEF
On currency markets, the euro sailed higher against the dollar after the Moody's report. It also benefited from comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who reiterated the country does not intend to leave the single currency. 
Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June.
But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its budget, possibly leading to sanctions.
The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first time ever, a government source said on Sunday.
Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about its reinvestment policy until December.
The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies at 95.578 [USD/] while sterling idled at $1.3081 as the market waited for more developments on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May will tell parliament that 95 percent of Britain's divorce deal has now been settled. But she will repeat her opposition to the EU's proposal for the land border with Northern Ireland and many see the risk of a leadership challenge being mounted.
Saudi Arabia also remained in the spotlight after Riyadh called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a ""huge and grave mistake"" but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the crisis.
U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders are pushing Saudi Arabia for more answers. 
In commodity markets, Brent crude futures climbed past op $80 per barrel, with U.S. sanctions against Iran's crude exports due to be implemented next month. [O/N]
Gold prices edged higher toward the 2 1/2-month peak hit last week.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Sony makes no concessions to EU regulators in EMI music bid,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T:6758) has not offered concessions to European Union antitrust regulators reviewing its $2.3 billion offer for control of EMI to become the world's largest music publisher, the European Commission website showed on Monday.
EU antitrust regulators earlier this month asked rivals and users whether they think the Japanese group would use its greater market power to win better terms in digital media deals.
The deadline for proposed concessions in the European Commission's preliminary assessment of the deal was Oct. 19. The EU executive's website showed that Sony had not submitted any.
This could either mean Sony expects unconditional approval or for the Commission to open a full-scale investigation on Oct. 26 at the end of its review.
Sony, which owns a 30 percent stake in EMI, wants to buy Mubadala Investment Co's 60 percent stake. In July, it acquired the estate of Michael Jackson's minority share of EMI.
Sony's new CEO Kenichiro Yoshida is making his boldest strategy move with the deal, which would give the company rights to 2.1 million songs from artists such as Drake, Sam Smith, Pharrell Williams and Sia.

Independent music labels group Impala and the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance have called for the EMI deal to be either blocked or cleared only with major concessions.

266,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Italian Assets Climb After Moody's Resists Downgrade to Junk,"(Bloomberg) -- Italian government bonds and stocks rallied after a credit ratings decision by Moody’s Investors Service removed the immediate threat of a downgrade to junk.
Yields on 10-year securities fell to their lowest level in over two weeks following Friday’s cut to Baa3 -- its lowest investment-grade rating -- with a “stable” outlook enough to tempt back investors. Italy is due to be reviewed by S&P Global Ratings Friday, who have the nation two notches above junk.
“One important event risk has now been taken away, with the risk that Italy was on its way to become non-investment grade now relatively small,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of fixed-income research at Danske Bank A/S. “The more positive general risk appetite should support BTPs.”
Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped as much as 18 basis points to 3.30 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 4, before paring the decline to 5 basis points as of 9:18 a.m. London time. The spread over those on equivalent German bonds was 299 basis points. The FTSE MIB index of shares gained 0.7 percent, with banks among the biggest beneficiaries. The euro climbed 0.1 percent to $1.1526.
With the prospect of a junk rating put on hold for now, the main risks for Italian bonds depend on the ongoing budget negotiations between the European Union and the country’s populist leaders. Local news media reported that the coalition will tell the Commission that it is sticking with its plan to enlarge the fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent next year, despite push back from the bloc.
The government will send its response to the Commission by noon Rome time Monday, according to newspaper La Repubblica, without saying where it got the information. Commissioner for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici struck a more conciliatory tone Friday, saying the bloc wouldn’t interfere with Italy’s economic policies.
“The Commission then needs to decide whether it will show a yellow card or reject the budget by next Monday,” wrote Commerzbank strategists including Michael Leister in a note to clients, who recommend a long position in Italian bonds, with a spread target of 270 basis points over Germany. “The remarkable u-turn in the Italy news flow since Friday afternoon should set the tone for now.”

The government asked the world's largest social media network to fully communicate security issues to users, increase surveillance of providers of applications on its platform, and inform regulators of any change in security measures.
The request comes after Facebook this month said attackers stole data from 29 million user accounts. That followed the April revelation that personal data of nearly 87 million users was improperly accessed by British firm Cambridge Analytica.
Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission, which investigated the Cambridge Analytica incident with authorities in Britain and elsewhere, issued a statement on Monday detailing its request to Facebook. The request carries no administrative orders or penalties and is not legally binding.
Facebook has promised to detail on its Japanese-language website how it will address the request, the Commission said.
It also said the Cambridge Analytica incident potentially affected up to 100,000 users in Japan, and that the cyber attack may also have had an impact on users in Japan.

Representatives of Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 02:12AM ET</span>",Truck makers rev up for rollout of electric big rigs,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk put electric heavy commercial trucks on the map in November 2017 when he unveiled the company's futuristic, battery-powered Semi, booked hundreds of orders and said he would start delivering the vehicles by 2019.
Now, it looks like 2020 could be the big year for electric big rigs. Incumbent truck makers are accelerating their electric truck projects toward launches that year, while Musk told investors in June production of the eye-catching Semi freight hauler should begin ""basically (in the) first half of 2020"" instead of 2019. 
Driven by regulatory pressure to cut diesel pollution, commercial truck makers have made a flurry of fresh announcements to deliver battery electric or hydrogen-fueled vehicles. They have landed orders from big fleet operators such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) and Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (BR:ABI). 
The challenge is gauging how big the market for electric commercial trucks will be, especially outside of China.
The limited range of most first-generation electric or hydrogen commercial trucks and a lack of charging infrastructure threaten to limit sales to short-haul operations.
In China, regulators are considering a long-term plan to replace 1 million diesel big rigs with cleaner trucks, including electric models, and some Chinese ports and cities are banning diesel trucks, which could significantly boost sales.
In the United States, the outlook for electric truck demand is cloudier. Some analysts estimate that by the mid-2020s, U.S. annual electric truck sales may number only in the hundreds. Over the last 12 months, North American diesel and so-called semitruck orders totaled 497,000 units.
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) experience at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach illustrates the potential, and the problems for clean truck technology.
The first of Toyota’s working hydrogen fuel-cell trucks was designed with a 200-mile (322 km) range for daily operations and has already logged more than 10,000 miles running short routes around the ports. 
The newer second iteration has a 300-mile range but that is still well short of the 1,000 miles or more diesel trucks can run between refueling stops.
Toyota has not provided a production timeline, but executive program manager Chris Rovik said “so far we feel confident the technology is absolutely applicable to this type of use case.”
""CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM""
Fueling infrastructure is a major headache for electric and hydrogen trucks.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) commercial vehicle director Mark Freymueller describes a chicken-and-egg problem: Trucking companies are reluctant to buy trucks without fueling stations, but fuel station operators will not install them without trucking customers.
Battery electric trucks can take hours to recharge and charging stations are scarce in most U.S. states. Hydrogen trucks can be refueled in about the same time as a diesel truck - but hydrogen refueling stations are even rarer, with most concentrated in California.
""Fueling infrastructure is a very important first step,"" said Chris Cannon, chief sustainability officer for the Port of Los Angeles. ""The trucks may work great, but if they can't get any fuel they can't operate."" 
Last month, the California Air Resources Board announced $41 million in grants to the port toward building 10 new hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks to be developed by Toyota and  Paccar Inc  (O:PCAR) unit Kenworth. The grant will also partly-fund two new hydrogen fuel stations to be built by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa). 
Most manufacturers see short-haul routes such as drayage services to or from ports or rail yards as likely first adopters of electric or hydrogen trucks. 
""We think the first applications are going to be shorter haul,"" said Denny Mooney, Navistar International Corp's (N:NAV) vice president of engineering. ""We're going to start out where the business makes sense.""
Tesla customers like  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) unit DHL, which has ordered 10 Semis, say they could save tens of thousands of dollars on maintenance and fuel annually. 
CEO Musk says the Semi's range could hit 600 miles. But a spokesperson said running uphill with air conditioning on or running other appliances would cut that range. Many modern 18-wheelers contain televisions, fridges and other appliances.
Package delivery giant UPS has pre-ordered 125 Tesla Semis and will use them on daily routes hauling packages between hubs and on UPS Freight routes between businesses - mostly shorter routes.
""In many ways we are ideally suited to be an early adopter of this technology because we don't have much long-haul business,"" said UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara.
Tesla is working with potential customers including UPS,  Pepsico  (O:PEP) and Anheuser-Busch to build charging stations at their facilities.

Nikola Motor Co, a startup offering a fuel cell truck, has ambitious multibillion-dollar plans to build 700 U.S. hydrogen fueling stations over the next decade, starting along the major routes of Anheuser-Busch, which has ordered up to 800 trucks, says CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola has secured funding for those stations, he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) has named veteran banker Todd Leland as its investment banking head for Asia Pacific excluding Japan, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, adding to leadership changes at the bank with CEO David Solomon taking over this month.
Leland, an American who joined Goldman in 1992, will replace Andrea Vella and Kate Richdale who were appointed co-heads of the unit in 2015.
Vella and Richdale will remain in the region to become the co-chairs of the unit, said the memo sent to the bank staff and seen by Reuters on Monday.
Leland was named a co-president of the bank for Asia Pacific excluding Japan in September last year, a designation that he will retain, the memo said. He had previously worked in London for 10 years.
A Goldman spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed the content of the memo. 
Leland takes over at a time when China's aggressive outbound push for mergers and acquisitions has slowed this year amid an escalating trade war with the United States, and weaker markets are expected to weigh on the appetite for new equity offerings.
In the first nine months of 2018, Goldman's revenue in Asia, which is smallest of its three regions, rose 9 percent to $3.9 billion. Asia's share of group sales fell by 1 percentage point to 14 percent in that period, its filings showed.
Richdale, a fluent Mandarin speaker with experience in Southeast Asian dealmaking, joined Goldman from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in March 2013.
Before taking over the Asia leadership role, Vella had been co-head of the financing group in the region since January 2014. Prior to that he was head of credit capital markets in Asia excluding Japan.
In a separate memo, Goldman also announced that Raghav Maliah, its head of the technology, media and telecom group in Asia Pacific excluding Japan, will become global vice-chairman of the investment banking division.
Among other executive changes since Solomon was named the group chief executive, Goldman last month named Dan Dees, who heads the technology, media and telecom investment banking group globally, as investment banking co-chief.
Dees will share his new title with Gregg Lemkau and Marc Nachmann.

Dees's promotion came about a week after Goldman elevated former investment banking co-head John Waldron to president and chief operating officer and named Stephen Scherr as its new finance chief.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Highly leveraged property firm China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) is in talks with financial institutions to raise about $1.5 billion this month by offering its Hong Kong office tower as collateral, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The fund-raising plan by China's No.2 developer by sale underscores the pressure the developer is under, as China's property sector slows and Beijing's capital controls have restricted its ability to pay offshore debt, which stood at $16.4 billion as of the end of June. 
Evergrande bought the office tower in Wan Chai, a bustling business district by day and red-light district by night on Hong Kong island, for HK$12.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in 2015 from Chinese Estates Holdings (HK:0127). 
Evergrande, which has yet to fully settle the transaction, plans to use the capital raised from refinancing the tower partly to pay back offshore debt and make dividend payments, one of the sources said.
Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment. The sources requested anonymity because the talks were private.
While the practice of raising money by offering property as collateral is not uncommon among highly leveraged Chinese developers, it is unusual to securitize a building that has yet to be fully paid off, a property market expert said.
Evergrande had agreed to pay off the tower in installments to Chinese Estates within six years of the sale.
""Evergrande is trying to... extract additional liquidity,"" said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the fund-raising plan.
Helped by record profit and a boom in China's property market, Evergrande cut its net gearing ratio to 127 percent at end-June from 184 percent at the end of 2017, while total borrowings dropped as much as 8 percent during the period.
The developer aims to further cut the ratio to about 70 percent by June 2020 by repaying high-interest debts and curbing land purchases.
But there are rising concerns for the property sector's ability to deleverage, with developers expecting a slowdown after two years of government measures aimed at cooling the red-hot sector.

Shares of Evergrande, which has a market value of $31 billion, were up 2.7 percent as of 0240 GMT on Monday. They have plunged 26 percent so far this year, lagging a roughly 14 percent fall in the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI).

(Reuters) - Canadian airplane maker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) has sued the aircraft unit of Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011), saying former Bombardier employees passed on trade secrets to help Mitsubishi's oft-delayed regional jet project.
Bombardier filed the lawsuit late Friday in a federal court in Seattle against Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, Seattle-based Aerospace Testing Engineering & Certification Inc (AeroTEC) and several former Bombardier employees.
AeroTEC is working with Mitsubishi Aircraft to help it get the 90-seat passenger jet certified by regulators. 
The 92-page lawsuit alleges that Bombardier employees who were recruited by Mitsubishi or AeroTEC brought with them confidential documents and data related to the certification of airplanes in Canada and the United States. 
Bombardier is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Mitsubishi Aircraft and AeroTEC from using the information it says was taken. The lawsuit says the employees sent key documents to their personal email accounts prior to leaving Bombardier and joining the Mitsubishi project.
A spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Aircraft said on Monday the company believed Bombardier's claim was ""groundless"". 
""We will consider the details and prove this in the appropriate venue,"" she added.
AeroTEC could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.
Mitsubishi's regional jet program, Japan's first passenger plane since the 1960s, has been delayed by several years, with first customer ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) now expecting the 90-seater plane in 2020, rather than in 2013 as originally envisaged.
In the lawsuit, Bombardier accused Mitsubishi Aircraft of violating the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 by trying to use the confidential data and documents obtained from former employees to accelerate the ""extremely complex and costly"" process of getting its planes certified. 
According to the lawsuit, Mitsubishi has in the past cited the difficulty of achieving certification as one of the factors holding up the launch of its planned regional aircraft. It is set to compete with Bombardier's C Series jet, which was renamed as the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A220 in July.
Bombardier said it took it nearly a decade to take its C-Series from concept to commercial flight. It said only four companies since 2000 had been able to develop a ""clean-sheet"" aircraft program approved by regulators in Canada, Europe and the United States.

""This is because, understandably, these various regulatory agencies require aircraft manufacturers to meet innumerable exacting standards to ensure aircraft airworthiness and public safety,"" Bombardier said in the lawsuit.

The Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.1 percent to 2,629.90 as of 10:11 a.m. local time, the biggest advance since May 2016 and extending Friday’s gain. Over the weekend, President Xi Jinping vowed “unwavering” support for non-state firms, while the country’s stock exchanges committed to help manage share-pledge risks. China also released its widely-expected plan to cut personal income taxes after data showed the nation’s economy grew at the slowest pace since 2009.
Chinese stocks rallied Friday following a rare coordinated effort from top financial officials to support the equity market, after margin calls and forced selling accelerated this year’s downward spiral. The nation’s share market has still lost more than $3 trillion in value since January, amid concern a liquidity crunch and the U.S. trade dispute would hurt economic growth. The Shanghai Composite is the world’s worst performing global benchmark in 2018, falling below 2,500 points last week for the first time in almost four years.
“There is some sincerity in the tax deduction policies and the news on relief funds over the weekend,” said He Qi, fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management Co. in Shanghai. The policies “may serve the purpose of providing a golden window of opportunity for a rebound before the end of the month.”
Shares of securities firms, which are among the biggest lenders to private firms trading on the mainland, surged onshore and in Hong Kong. Moves by authorities to reduce stock-pledge risks should stabilize the equity market and help lift valuations for Chinese brokers, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Shares of Orient Securities Co., Citic Securities Co. and Huatai Securities Co. rose at least 8 percent.
The yuan fell 0.1 percent to 6.9423 per dollar. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he’s open to changing how the U.S. determines which nations are gaming their currencies, after refraining to labeling China a currency manipulator in a semi-annual report last week.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears chairman Lampert seeks partner for bankruptcy financing - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) Chairman Eddie Lampert is in discussions with at least one potential partner to contribute to a $300 million bankruptcy loan the U.S. retailer is seeking, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, has held discussions with Cyrus Capital Partners LP, an investment firm that holds some of Sears' existing debt, about sharing the burden of funding portions of the $300 million loan, which would be separate from another $300 million bankruptcy loan that Sears' banks have offered to provide, the sources said. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A Sears spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
Sears' survival will depend on the willingness of creditors and suppliers to keep the company afloat. Strong sales in the end-of-year holiday season will be key in determining that, putting pressure on the department store operator to secure enough financing to remain operational until then.
Through his hedge fund, Lampert has invested billions of dollars in Sears since he created it in its current form in 2005 through a merger with peer Kmart. As a result, he is the department store operator's largest shareholder and creditor.
The bankruptcy loan from the banks, including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), falls first in line for repayment in the Sears bankruptcy case, while the $300 million loan that Sears is seeking from lenders including ESL would be repaid afterwards.
Some people representing Sears while it navigates bankruptcy have also privately suggested to Lampert that he should seek to replace the $300 million loan from the banks with his own financing, some of the sources said. This would mean that Lampert would potentially be contributing to bankruptcy loans totaling $600 million, the sources said.
Such a move would potentially consolidate Sears' obligations during bankruptcy proceedings, and give Lampert more control over the company’s court case since he would essentially be the main so-called debtor-in-possession lender, the sources said. As it stands now, Sears is contemplating having two such loans.
However, it isn’t clear whether Lampert can or is willing to provide financing to repay the banks lending Sears money in bankruptcy, the sources said. Lampert could demur on the idea and remain focused on contributing to the $300 million loan Sears wants that would be subordinated in repayment to the banks, the sources said.  
The sources cautioned that negotiations between Sears, Lampert and other potential sources of bankruptcy financing remained fluid and might not result in a deal. Sears filed for bankruptcy protection in White Plains, New York on Oct. 15 with a plan to close about 142 of its 700 stores by year-end and sell up to 400 of its best-performing stores in an auction in January to a buyer that will keep them operational. 
Lampert stepped down as Sears CEO following the bankruptcy filing, and is planning to bid for the stores that go up for sale.
Sears, which has close to 70,000 employees, has not turned a profit since 2011. It struggled with competition from e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), as well as brick-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT).

The company listed $6.9 billion in assets and $11.3 billion in liabilities in documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. A court hearing finalizing bankruptcy financing for Sears is expected during the week of Oct. 29.

The Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies’ Absolute Return Fund is increasing investments after benchmark indexes slumped due to surging oil prices, higher borrowing costs and defaults at a local shadow lender. The intensity of selling for the S&P BSE Sensex Index last week hit levels not seen since the height of the 2008 financial crisis.

More than 31 growth-oriented institutional funds, which have long relied on the banks to deliver strong and predictable earnings, have closed their positions this year. 
A further 146 growth funds have trimmed their holdings, helping push share prices of the so-called ""Big Four"" down between 14 to 20 percent lower in the past year, a Reuters analysis of stock portfolios has found.
Veteran Australian investor Geoff Wilson, chairman of Wilson Funds Management, told Reuters the market was yet to digest the full impact of the headwinds facing the sector.
""One thing we do know is that markets over-react,"" Wilson said. ""I don't think they've over-reacted yet on the banks."" 
The dour outlook will challenge the reputation of some of Australia's biggest financial institutions - Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) - as world leaders in profitability.
The four retail banks yielded close to 20 percent return on equity over the last decade, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. That has shrunk to 12 percent this year. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expect ANZ, the third largest lender by market capitalization to report a 15 percent fall in cash earnings for the second half of the fiscal year to A$2.93 billion ($2.09 billion) when it releases results on Oct. 31, driven by higher costs and lower lending volumes. 
Annual cash earnings at NAB, the fourth largest, are similarly anticipated to fall by about 12 percent when it reports on Nov. 1.
ROYAL COMMISSION FALLOUT
The Royal Commission, as the public investigation into financial sector misconduct is called, has already accelerated a tightening of lending standards, and is likely to trigger structural change that would add pressure to the money-making models of the banks.
The powerful inquiry has drawn a direct causality line between the bank's high profitability and the widespread misconduct exposed at the banks and other large, vertically integrated financial firms over the last seven months.
Among the revelations, the inquiry found banks lending without doing basic checks to ensure customers could afford loans, uncovered how they have taken fees from customers' accounts without providing them with services, and exposed lending referral programs that incentivized staff to commit fraud.
The banks have apologized and are spending over A$6 billion in legal and compliance costs, including remediating customers affected by their poor behavior, according to Shaw and Partners analysis.
Spokespeople for the big four banks did not comment for this story, but referred Reuters to previous public statements.
Three of the four - ANZ, CBA and NAB - are offloading a large proportion of the businesses where much of the wrongdoing occurred: their wealth management and insurance units. 
TOUGH CONDITIONS 
Without the diversity that those units provided in the past, revenue growth now largely depends on local housing and business loans at a time when property prices are falling and Australian household indebtedness is at record highs.
Growth in Australian home loans is expected to fall to record lows of 4 percent or less, after averaging about 12 percent the previous two decades, therefore intensifying competition.
As their businesses shrink, bank fees - another key revenue source- have fallen from making up about 40 percent of bank's revenues to only half that today. 
Regulators are also scrutinizing that area of business, clamping down on excessive fees on foreign exchange services and credit cards.
""It's going to be a bit more challenging for the banks to grow profits as they have previously,"" said Argo Investments managing director Jason Beddow, a fund manager who still holds large bank stakes.
""At a high level, you're in a period of relatively sluggish credit growth, in an area where you've got higher regulatory and compliance costs and you've got the four banks looking far more homogenous, having got rid of their periphery businesses, fighting over the same market.""
PAYING LESS FOR DEPOSITS; HIKING MORTGAGE RATES 
To fight the headwinds and maintain profitability, experts believe the banks will focus on shedding costs, and increasing mortgage rates while they cut the price they pay for deposits.
Executing that strategy will be challenging, as it risks further scrutiny at the time regulators investigate whether banks have used tougher rules on lending as an excuse to profiteer through increased mortgage rates.
""Those return on equity numbers have been reasonably high and it wouldn't be surprising to see them come down from a combination of extra costs, higher bad debts and lower credit growth across the system,"" said Alex Shevelev, an analyst at Forager Funds Management.
Even so, not all growth-focused funds have sold out yet and many value investors remain invested. Records show that while their numbers have fallen, there are still over 200 large funds with growth mandates invested in the Australian banks.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Foreigners sell net $1.1 billion of Saudi stocks as journalist disappearance rattles investors,"By Saeed Azhar and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Foreigners sold a net 4.01 billion riyals ($1.07 billion) in Saudi stocks in the week ending Oct. 18, exchange data showed on Sunday - one of the biggest selloffs since the market opened to direct foreign buying in mid-2015.
The selloff came during a week when investors were rattled by Saudi Arabia's deteriorating relations with foreign governments following the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Riyadh said on Saturday that Khashoggi died in a fight inside its Istanbul consulate, its first acknowledgement of his death after denying for two weeks that it was involved in his disappearance. 
A breakdown of the exchange data showed foreigners sold 5 billion riyals worth of stocks and bought 991.3 million worth. 
""The market started to price in a fundamentally different relationship between Saudi Arabia and the U.S.,"" said Jaap Meijer, head of equity research, at Arqaam Capital.
""We believe the U.S. will keep Saudi Arabia as its close ally given (amongst other things) the importance of the kingdom in the Middle East region and being the producer of 10 percent of the world oil supply.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that Saudi Arabia's explanation of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a ""good first step but not enough"", adding it was premature to discuss any sanctions against Riyadh over the incident.
The comments were the latest from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that appear aimed at censuring a killing that has sparked global outrage, while protecting relations with the world's top oil exporter.
The stock exchange data also showed Saudi individual investors such as retail investors and high net worth individuals sold a net 3.4 billion riyals worth of stocks during the week, however Saudi institutions bought a net 7.8 billion riyals worth of stocks. Investors from other Gulf countries were also net sellers.
Market analysts told Reuters last week that state-linked funds appeared to have mounted an operation to support the stock market after heavy foreign selling.
The Saudi stock market is down about 4 percent since Khashoggi disappeared on Oct 2. The market had already started to weaken before the incident as foreign funds slowed their buying after MSCI's announcement in June that the kingdom will be included in its global emerging market benchmark next year.
The Saudi index closed up 0.2 percent on Sunday after falling as much as 3.5 percent earlier in the session. 
Saudi Arabia's foreign debt has also been pressured, with yields rising across the the country's dollar bond curve. 
The yield on Saudi Arabia's $5.5 billion bond due in 2026 and $6.5 billion note due in 2046 rose to record highs last week, according to Refinitiv data.

Saudi credit default swaps, which investors buy as protection against default, rose to 100 basis points late last week for the first time since June, data from IHS Markit showed.

A spokesman for the Japanese company said that MUFG Bank Deputy President Eiichi Yoshikawa will attend the Saudi event in place of CEO Kanetsugu Mike. MUFG said the decision was made after ""evaluating factors in a comprehensive manner"".
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh's policies, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia on Saturday said he had died in a fight there. Two Saudi officials have since attributed the death to a chokehold.
More than two dozen top officials and executives from the United States and Europe, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the chief executives of  JP Morgan Chase  (N:JPM) and HSBC (L:HSBA), have canceled plans to attend the Future Investment Initiative.

LONDON (Reuters) - Most British companies will implement their plans for coping with a disruptive Brexit by December if there is no clarity by then on how Britain will leave the European Union, a survey by a major employers group showed.
The Confederation of British Industry said its findings showed how the lack of a breakthrough in negotiations between London and Brussels was endangering British jobs, investment and economic growth.
""Businesses have displayed remarkable resilience since the referendum, but patience is now threadbare,"" CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said.
""Negotiators must secure the withdrawal agreement before December to unlock a transition period. The message to politicians on all sides is: 'your actions will echo through generations',"" she said in a statement.
The CBI has urged Britain to keep as close a relationship as possible with the EU after Brexit in March next year but British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out its favored option of permanently staying in a customs union with the bloc.
May has so far failed to reach a deal with her EU peers on their future trading relationship. Their next summit is due to take place in mid-December although a November meeting might be scheduled if talks progress.
The CBI said 39 percent of the 236 companies it surveyed planned to implement contingency plans -- including job cuts, adjusting supply chains away from Britain and stockpiling -- by November if there was no clarity on Brexit.
A further 24 percent said they would do so by December, while 19 percent said they had already begun to implement contingency plans.
Eighty percent of the firms said Brexit had already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, the CBI said. 

The survey was carried out between Sept. 19 and Oct. 8.

In a guest article for the Sunday paper, extracts from which were made available on Saturday, Scholz fleshed out proposals that he was considering jointly with France to make it harder for international firms to evade tax.
Both countries are seeking ways to ensure that firms like Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL) and Google (O:GOOGL) pay domestic taxes in proportion to the profits they earn in Europe's largest markets, though attempts to harmonize tax rates across the European Union have met stiff resistance from lower-tax members like Ireland.
""We need a worldwide minimum tax level that no state may go below,"" Scholz said in the article, adding that any such rules would need to be accompanied by measures to make it harder to move money into tax havens.
Scholz said the internet economy ""was exacerbating a problem that we recognize from globalization and that we are trying to address: the placing of profits in low-tax locations.""

Germany, Europe's largest consumer market, is particularly fertile ground for U.S.-based internet giants, many of which have used offshore structures to minimize their tax exposure to what remains a relatively high-tax economy.

(S:UBSG) has asked its China wealth management staff to reconsider their travel plans to the country after authorities there asked one of its bankers to delay her departure from Beijing to meet with local officials, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banker, who is based in Singapore and works in the relationship management team in UBS's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was asked to remain in China and meet with local authority officials next week, the person said. The identity and position of the banker were not known.
The purpose of the meeting with authorities is not clear, but the bank has asked others in its China wealth management team to review their travel plans carefully.
No other units in the bank, including back office or asset management teams, have been asked to re-consider existing travel plans. A UBS spokeswoman declined to comment
The Swiss bank is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of  Citigroup  (n:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) , HSBC (L:HSBA) and Julius Baer . 
The meeting also comes as UBS has been building up its presence in China. Last week it moved a step closer to becoming the first bank to take majority ownership of its China joint venture under new rules designed to open up the sector, when two of its current partners put their stakes up for sale. 
Any deal on the stakes will need the approval of Chinese authorities, who are yet to give the green light for the 51 percent shareholding.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook on Friday told an online news website that Bloomberg should retract a story that claimed Apple's internal computer systems had been infiltrated by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese intelligence agents.
Bloomberg said it stood by its report, published earlier this month. 
“There is no truth in their story about Apple,” Cook told BuzzFeed News in an interview with the online publication. ""They need to do that right thing and retract it.""
Apple confirmed the accuracy of the BuzzFeed News report to Reuters but declined to comment further. 
Cook's comments follow a denial by Apple that Bloomberg included in its story, a statement posted on Apple's own website, and a letter to U.S. lawmakers.
Apple declined to say whether it planned to take legal action against Bloomberg.
In response to questions from Reuters about Cook's request for a retraction in the BuzzFeed News story on Friday, Bloomberg reiterated that it was confident of its reporting, conducted over more than a year. The news agency said that 17 sources confirmed ""the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks.""
Bloomberg had reported that a unit of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army infiltrated the supply chain of computer hardware maker Super Micro Computer Inc to plant malicious chips that could be used to steal corporate and government secrets. 
Bloomberg said in its report that some 30 companies and multiple U.S. government agencies were targeted by the chips, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks.

Super Micro also has denied the report.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra has transformed the No. 1 U.S. automaker in her almost five years in charge, but that is still not enough to satisfy investors.
Ahead of third-quarter results due on Oct. 31, GM shares are trading about 6 percent below the $33 per share price at which they launched in 2010 in a post-bankruptcy initial public offering. 
The Detroit carmaker's stock is down 22 percent since Barra took over in January 2014. After hitting an all-time high of $46.48 on Oct. 24, 2017, the shares have declined 33 percent. In the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500 index (SPX) has climbed 7.8 percent.
Several shareholders contacted by Reuters said GM could face a third major action by activist shareholders in less than four years if the share price does not improve.
""I've been expecting it,"" said John Levin, chairman of Levin Capital Strategies. ""It just seems a tempting morsel to somebody."" Levin's firm owns more than seven million GM shares.
Barra has guided the company through the settlement of a federal criminal probe of a mishandled safety recall, sold off money-losing European operations, and returned $25 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks from 2012 through 2017. 
GM declined to comment for this story, but the company's executives privately express frustration with the market's reluctance to see it as anything more than a manufacturer tied mainly to auto market sales cycles.
GM's profitable North American truck and SUV business and its money-making China operations are valued at just $14 billion, excluding the value of GM's stake in its $14.6 billion Cruise automated vehicle business and its cash reserves from its $44 billion market capitalization. 
The recent slump in the Chinese market, GM's largest, and plateauing U.S. demand are ratcheting up the pressure.
GM is one of the few global automakers without a founding family or a government to serve as a bulwark against corporate raiders. 
In 2015, a group led by investor Harry Wilson pressed GM to launch a $5 billion share buyback, and commit to what is now an $18 billion ceiling on the level of cash the company would hold. In 2017, GM fended off a call by hedge fund manager David Einhorn to split its common stock shares into two classes.
Einhorn, whose firm still owned more than 21 million shares at the end of June, declined to comment about GM's stock price. 
Other investors said there were no clear alternatives to Barra's approach.
""I'm clearly a frustrated investor,"" said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owned 2.57 million GM shares at the end of September. ""GM is a name that I am still particularly bullish about despite years of disappointment.""
Some investors said they would welcome a spinoff or partial float of Cruise, or the creation of a tracking stock, as a way of calling attention to the potential value of GM's autonomous vehicle technology. 
""In the near term, really the only way to drive this stock higher is via Cruise,"" Razewski said.Some investors have given up waiting. Barometer Capital Management sold its 420,000 GM shares in the first quarter of 2017. 
Barometer portfolio manager Jim Schetakis said GM should exit the money-losing sedan business like rivals  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) have done and possibly split off its China operations. Barra has had enough time as CEO, he said.

""The board has to walk out to the mound and take the ball away,"" he said.

This is the second presidential meeting in as many weeks for executives from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT),  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) to discuss their supply chains, also referred to as their industrial base.
During the roll out of the Defense Industrial Base Review on Oct. 5, executives from the four defense firms were invited to the Oval office for a meeting that turned into a 90 minute discussion with Trump, according to sources familiar with the meeting.
The Pentagon-led review ordered by Trump identified hundreds of instances where the U.S. military depends on foreign countries, especially China, for critical materials.
The 150-page review included a series of recommendations to strengthen American industry.
Friday's meeting in Arizona will include executives from BAE Systems Plc (L:BAES), which makes howitzers for the Army, as well as industrial giant Honeywell International Inc (N:HON).
An administration source said weapons sales to Saudi Arabia were not on the official agenda for the Friday meeting, but did not rule out the issue could be raised.
Major U.S. defense contractors have expressed concern to the Trump administration that lawmakers angered by the disappearance of a Saudi journalist in Turkey will block further arms deals with Saudi Arabia.

Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who has been working to shore up the defense manufacturing base, Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey were also expected to be at the meeting.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.26%. The S&P 500 fell 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.48%.
Consumer staples led the rebound on Wall Street from a selloff the prior day, supported by a rally in shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) after it posted earnings and revenue that beat analysts' consensus estimates.
Consumer staples, widely viewed as a defensive corner of the market, notched a its biggest daily gain since June 2016 on Friday.
Industrials, meanwhile, struggled even as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported better-than-forecast profits. Shares of Honeywell closed down, however, as investors focused on the company's weaker guidance for 2018, weighed down by the spinoff of Garrett Motion.
Honeywell cut its 2018 adjusted earnings to a range of $7.95 to $8.00 a share, down from previous guidance of $8.10 to $8.20, while the sales outlook was lowered to $41.7 billion to $41.8 billion from $43.1 billion to $43.6 billion.
The corporate earnings season, while in the early innings, is off to strong start. With more than 15% of S&P 500 companies having reported, 83% have topped analyst estimates, according to FactSet.
Positive earnings helped offset investor concerns over global growth in the wake of slowing performance in China.
China said overnight that its economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter, missing expectations. After a brief leg lower, Chinese stocks surged as the government pledged to introduce stimulus in a bid to calm jittery markets.
Falling energy stocks also kept lid on gains in the broader market as oil prices settled higher, but pared gains on data showing the U.S. rig count had risen to March 2015 highs after drillers added four rigs this week.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",U.S. landlords copy hotel model to cut risk as coworking surges,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading owners of prime U.S. office space are taking a page from the hotel industry to boost profits from coworking's rapid growth and to mitigate some of the risk they assume when signing long-term leases with these flexible workspace providers.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group's EQ Office, private equity firm Rubenstein Partners LP and others have turned to ""management agreements,"" a new format in the office market that avoids fixed-lease payments that critics say can be disastrous for coworking in a downturn.
Landlords stand to make more money in these profit-sharing partnerships with coworking firms, which industry goliath WeWork well understands as it rapidly gobbles up office space with leases in Manhattan, San Francisco, Boston and elsewhere.
The partnerships unite interests, unlike with leasing, and they cut exposure to the same liability critics say pushed serviced-office giant IWG's Regus into bankruptcy in 2003. Regus couldn't make lease payments when some customers declined to renew short-term rental contracts during the dot-com recession.
""There's some real validity to that criticism,"" said Jamie Hodari, co-founder and chief executive of Industrious, a leading coworking firm with more than 50 locations in three dozen U.S. cities.
Only in the past six months have property owners embraced management agreements, looking to a mainstay for hotel operators as a way to meet growing tenant demands for shorter and less rigid contracts that the workplace industry provides, Hodari said. 
Rubenstein announced an agreement with Industrious last week to operate tenant amenities and a coworking space in Alexandria, Virginia, the first time the Philadelphia-based real estate investor will provide coworking in one of its properties.
Terms of the agreement at Carlyle Tower, a 49-year-old building that was gutted and rebranded, were not disclosed. 
In a typical hotel agreement the management fee is set at 3 percent. But Hodari envisions coworking firms will receive fees of 5 percent to 10 percent from shorter-term tenants while profits from a joint venture between landlord and manager for the same space may be split 30 percent to 70 percent after payment for the going market price of the space that would have been leased before, he said.
Last year only 5 percent of the projects in Industrious' pipeline involved management agreements while the remainder were leases, Hodari said. The project pipeline has doubled since then with 75 percent management agreements and 25 percent leases this year, he said.
Most owners now assume that between 15 percent to as much as 30 percent of their office building will move to a shorter-duration financial arrangement with the tenant, said Ryan Simonetti, chief executive of Convene, an event space provider backed by Brookfield Asset Management, among others.
""Landlords have to respond to what customers want,"" said Simonetti, whose firm recently added flexible workspace to its offerings. ""This isn't a fad.""
COMFORT ZONE
WeWork's surpassing JPMorgan (N:JPM) last month as the largest office tenant in Manhattan is testament to coworking's appeal. That success, however, has yet to ease concerns about the asset-liability mismatch among some landlords.
""You've seen these models fall apart,"" said Richard Anderson, a REIT equity analyst at Mizuho Americas. ""That mismatch between assets and liabilities becomes very apparent when the model starts to break down,"" he said.
(For an interactive graphic on Manhattan's coworking surge, please click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2P8ssBq )
Some real estate investment trusts will not do business with WeWork, Anderson said, citing  Paramount Group Inc  (N:PGRE), among others, and some limit their exposure. Boston Properties Inc (N:BXP) obtains just 1 percent of its revenue and Columbia Property Trust Inc (N:CXP) only 2 percent from WeWork, he said.
Lenders tend to be more comfortable issuing debt on a property with a long-term lease, a reason why management agreements haven't gotten much U.S. traction, said Granit Gjonbalaj, chief real estate development officer at WeWork.
The majority of U.S. landlords would sign managed agreements with the right partner but banks are still trying to understand how to underwrite coworking's income stream, he said.
While WeWork has recently offered management agreements, the firm has more to gain from a lease, he said. Demand in Manhattan is so strong WeWork has a hard time keeping up, he said.

""We're going to continue to be aggressive in acquiring space,"" Gjonbalaj said. The obvious trade-off that we're making is that we share the risk with the landlord.""

The move is part of increasing trend among Swiss banks to reestablish ties to American customers years after many financial institutions were hit with hefty fines following disputes with U.S. tax authorities over offshore wealth.
Under the deal Lombard Odier will sell its existing discretionary and advisory wealth management business with U.S-based clients through an asset transfer to Vontobel. The business manages assets of approximately 600 million Swiss francs ($602 million) for international private wealth management clients based in the United States.
In addition Vontobel will take over any of Lombard Odier's U.S.-based brokerage private clients who want to switch to a wealth management or advisory relationship. Lombard Odier manages another roughly 600 million francs through its private brokerage, which is based in Montreal, Canada.
""North America is one of our focus markets in which we intend to achieve above-average growth,"" said Georg Schubiger, head of Vontobel Wealth Management. 
""With the acquisition of Lombard Odier's discretionary and advisory wealth management business with U.S.-based clients, we are supporting our organic growth in this region.""
Vontobel said it would complete the deal, which was for an undisclosed sum, from its own funds. It was expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.

The industrial conglomerate's revised estimate for asbestos-related liabilities was $2.61 billion as of end-2017, some $1.09 billion higher than a prior estimate, a regulatory filing.
The liabilities are related to Bendix Friction Materials, a business previously owned by Honeywell and sold in 2014, which made automotive brake linings containing asbestos.
Thousands of individuals have alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos from the brakes.
The company has also revised its 2017 reported earnings per share lower by 14 cents to $2.00.

The ministries of procurement and defense said Ottawa and Irving Shipbuilding, a Canadian firm which will actually build the vessels, had identified Lockheed Martin Canada as the ""preferred bidder to provide the design and design team.""
The ministries said in a joint statement that Lockheed Martin would have to go through a due diligence process before a contract was awarded later this year. It did not say how much the design deal could be worth.
Last year, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Canada would spend between C$56 billion and C$60 billion on 15 ships to be known as Canadian Surface Combatants. Construction of the first vessel is due to begin in the early 2020s.
""These ships will form the backbone of our Royal Canadian Navy and will be Canada's major surface component of maritime combat power for decades to come,"" the ministries' statement said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Friday that it was building a new ""fintech campus"" in Silicon Valley for more than 1,000 employees, as it pushes to keep abreast of changes in digital payments.
The building is set to open in Palo Alto, California in 2020, the bank said in a statement and interviews. Most of the employees at the site will work for JPMorgan's Chase Merchant Services division, which is the second-biggest U.S. processor of card payments for merchants.
The division last year bought WePay, a young Silicon Valley-based firm that specializes in connecting payment software with bank networks. WePay now has about 275 employees, who will move to the new building. WePay's co-founder Bill Clerico said the bank will also hire hundreds of people for new jobs at the site.
This year, JPMorgan made its digital products strategy a major theme of its annual February conference for investors and stock analysts.
The bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets, has said it believes that handling more payments for consumers and companies will bring it more of their deposit and loan business. 
Matt Kane, chief executive of JPMorgan's merchant services division, said the bank was prepared to pay the high costs of operating in Silicon Valley for the chance to hire local software engineers. They are intended to complement payments industry specialists that JPMorgan employs now, largely in Plano, Texas and Tampa, Florida.

Chase Merchant Services ranks second to Atlanta-based  First Data Corp  (N:FDC) in processing card transactions for merchants.

Clegg, 51, succeeds Elliot Schrage and will report to Sandberg beginning on Monday. He will move to California with his family in the new year.
He was ousted as deputy prime minister after the Conservatives won a majority in 2015 in an election that saw his Liberal Democrats suffer a significant loss of support.
Clegg, whose appeal to younger voters was critically damaged when he broke a promise not to raise student tuition fees, lost his own seat in Britain's parliament in an election last year.
He apologized in 2012 for breaking his promise on student charges, saying ""I will never again make a pledge unless as a party we are absolutely clear about how we can keep it"".
Clegg is joining a company that has apologized for its mistakes and has promised to do better on many occasions, for example for breaching its users' trust. 
""Throughout my public life I have relished grappling with difficult and controversial issues and seeking to communicate them to others,"" Clegg said in a Facebook post. 
""I hope to use some of those skills in my new role""
Clegg, a strong advocate of Britain's membership of the European Union, said it was a ""wrench"" to be leaving the public debate at a crucial time in Brexit, but added that key decisions would pass to parliament, of which he was no longer a member.
He will join his Liberal Democrat colleague Richard Allan at the social network. 
Allan, a member of parliament between 1997 and 2005 who now sits in the upper house, is Facebook's vice president of public policy for Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
Clegg has discussed online security and privacy, both when in office and more recently in newspaper articles.
""I'm not especially bedazzled by Facebook,"" he said in an article in the London Evening Standard in 2016. 
""While I have good friends who work at the company, I actually find the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating.""
He also said he was not sure that companies such as Facebook really pay all the tax they could, although he added that was as much the fault of governments that still hadn't got their tax act together. 
Schrage, who led the social network's response to its several scandals, stepped down from the role in June after a decade with the company. Schrage will stay as an adviser, Facebook said.
Facebook has faced a barrage of criticism from users and lawmakers after it said last year that Russian agents used its platform to spread disinformation before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation Moscow denies.
In March, the company faced new scrutiny over how it protects personal information after acknowledging that the data of up to 87 million people ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

The firm’s asset management arm says it’s time to buy as months of underperformance for developing-nation securities relative to their U.S. peers won’t last much longer. The divergence was an anomaly, spurred in part by sanctions on Turkey and Russia as well as the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts, according to Sam Finkelstein, the co-chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s $800 billion fixed-income group.
Valuations have tumbled this year as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid into a bear market and a gauge of bonds headed for its worst year since 2013 amid speculation that developing nations would be hurt by rising interest rates in the U.S., global trade tensions and a surging dollar. U.S. assets have fared much better, with the S&P 500 Index beating the emerging-market index by a full 20 percentage points.
""Do I think it’s a crisis or buying opportunity? I’d put myself in the latter camp,"" Finkelstein said. ""Value is being created.""
The money manager says there’s now “reasonable value” in some of the world’s worst-performing currencies this year: the Argentine peso (which has lost 49 percent), the Turkish lira (down 33 percent) and the Brazilian real (11 percent weaker).
Still, Finkelstein said he remains concerned by the deteriorating relations between China and the U.S., which is leading to a more cautious stance on Asian currencies that otherwise would be attractive due to their stronger fundamentals.
“The tension exceeds trade,” he said. “There’s intellectual property, access, influence in the world, South China Sea.”"

Five out of seven recognized unions at Air France signed the wage deal providing for a 4 percent pay increase in two stages, the company said. However, the largest Air France pilots' union, SNPL, was not among the signatories.
With the endorsement of unions representing 76.4 percent of staff, the pay agreement becomes binding and will be implemented, the company said.
Upon taking over last month, former Air Canada chief operating officer Smith re-opened talks on a dispute that had wiped 335 million euros ($384 million) off group earnings as workers demanded a 5.1 percent raise to offset past inflation.
The deal announced by Air France-KLM on Friday includes a 2 percent pay increase back-dated to the start of 2018, followed by a further 2 percent on Jan. 1, 2019.
""I would like to thank everyone involved at Air France for the quality of our discussions over the past few weeks, and for the trust that has prevailed throughout,"" Smith said in the company statement.
The agreement comes as Ireland's Ryanair (I:RYA), Europe's biggest budget carrier, also said on Friday it had reached a deal with British, Portuguese and Italan pilots to end a series of strikes that have hurt its business.
Squeezed between long-haul Gulf carriers like Emirates and a proliferation of low-cost regional rivals, Air France-KLM has struggled to overhaul costs and services the way British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) or Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) have done.
The SNPL union, which had demanded assurances that the second 2 percent hike would not be counted towards 2019 pay awards, said it had withheld its signature because the deal remained ""ambiguous"" on this point.
In its statement, the French carrier said its next annual pay talks in October 2019 would be ""based on the global economic environment, the present situation of the Air France-KLM group (and) the company's economic performance"".

In addition to the company-wide pay deal agreed on Friday, Air France pilots are pressing their own demands for supplementary pay increases, which have yet to be addressed.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>","Honeywell says China growth slowing, tariffs to squeeze margins","By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Honeywell (N:HON) said on Friday it was seeing slower growth in China and that trade tariffs would squeeze margins and potentially cost it ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in 2019.
Like most U.S. industrial companies, Honeywell is taking a hit from the ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington, while China's economy shows signs of slowing.
Shares of the company, which makes everything from aircraft engines to catalysts used in petroleum refining, rose earlier in the day after better-than-expected quarterly results, but pared most of those gains by midday.
""We grew the Chinese market but not at the double-digit pace that we saw earlier in the year. So that's probably my number one area to watch,"" said Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk. ""As I look into 2019 ... I think the U.S. is going to be a very robust market again.""
Honeywell also said it expected to see some pressure on its margins next year when additional tariffs on Chinese exports could go into effect, raising the company's costs in ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars from ""tens of millions"" in 2018.
U.S. companies are putting in place measures, ranging from raising prices on products to increasing sourcing from countries other than China, to cushion the blow from escalating trade tensions.
""The hill gets steeper,"" Honeywell's Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis said.
Honeywell lifted its full-year forecasts for cash flow and margins as it rode a boom in e-commerce driven warehouse investment and aircraft production.
The company has benefited from a rise in global travel that has driven record orders for jets, leading to robust demand for its avionics, braking systems and other aircraft parts.
Sales at the aviation unit, the company's biggest business, rose 10 percent to $4.03 billion. Margins expanded by 80 basis points to 22.1 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
The company has also taken advantage of a boom in e-commerce as it supplies warehouse automation equipment and software to customers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Sales in safety and productivity solutions unit, which houses the warehouse automation business, climbed 11 percent to $1.58 billion, while margins jumped 150 basis points to 16.6 percent.
Excluding items, Honeywell earned $2.03 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.99 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's revenue rose 6.3 percent to $10.76 billion, topping the consensus of $10.75 billion.

Excluding the divestiture of some businesses, Honeywell said its full-year earnings will be in a range of $7.95 to $8.00 per share.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose broadly on Friday, driven by the consumer staples sector which was helped by Procter & Gamble results, brushing aside growth risk concerns in Europe and political tensions in Saudi Arabia.
Consumer goods bellwether Procter & Gamble (N:PG) reported a surprise rise in first-quarter sales, sending its shares up 6.8 percent and boosting the consumer staples (SPLRCS) index by 1.8 percent.
The sector, which has largely underperformed the broader S&P 500 this year, was set for its biggest daily gain since June 2016.
Analysts also said China's move to calm its markets, with regulators pledging to enact measures to help ease corporate financing problems, helped improve sentiment globally.
""The fact that China is supporting its market is a comfort for the U.S. That combined with strong earnings is giving a bit of a breather from macro events,"" said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware.
At 11:34 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 90.67 points, or 0.36 percent, at 25,470.12, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 12.99 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,781.77 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 34.52 points, or 0.46 percent, at 7,519.66.
U.S. stocks fell more than 1 percent on Thursday, weighed down by the European Commission's warning to Italy and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's decision to pull out of an investor conference in Saudi Arabia.
Friday's rebound was also driven by a 1.7 percent gain in Apple (O:AAPL), after the company began taking pre-orders for its new iPhone XR and on Wedbush's ""outperform"" rating.
Among gainers on strong results was PayPal (O:PYPL), which rose 9.2 percent and was on track for its best daily gain in two years after the payments company beat quarterly profit estimates.
Schlumberger (N:SLB) rose 1 percent as its third-quarter profit increased on higher oilfield services demand.
Honeywell (N:HON) shares pared earlier gains to edge 1.7 percent higher as the industrial conglomerate said it was seeing slower growth in China and that trade tariffs would squeeze margins and potentially cost it ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in 2019.
""Potential slowdown of global growth due to tariffs between the U.S. and other countries is really very concerning,"" Roth said. 
Earnings growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to have increased 22.2 percent in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 84 companies that have reported earnings so far, 78.6 percent have beaten expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.62-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and 27 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 100 new lows.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said its operating profit would fall by over 10 percent this year, its second earnings warning since June, blaming ""government proceedings and measures in various regions"" as a crackdown on diesel emissions takes a toll.
Daimler warned investors it expected its full-year earnings before interest and tax to be ""significantly below"" last year's level. Earnings at Mercedes-Benz Cars, its main contributor, will likewise fall ""significantly below"" the prior-year level.
Analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note that the profit warning was not triggered by a slowdown in business, since demand for Mercedes-Benz cars remains high, but was caused by one-off factors such as regulatory and court rulings.
The company did not gives details on what was behind the latest warning in a statement rushed out ahead of the scheduled release of quarterly earnings next week. 
A hit of up to 400 million euros ($460 million) was related to government proceedings into diesel and a European Court of Justice ruling around Mercedes' use of banned cooling agent R134a, analysts at Evercore ISI said.
The Stuttgart-based owner of Mercedes-Benz is being investigated for its diesel emissions in Europe and the United States, and last month announced Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche would step down in 2019 to become chairman from 2021.
The company's shares fell to a five-year low on the news, dragging other European auto stocks lower, before paring some of the losses. The European auto sector index (SXAP) fell 3.8 percent to a two-year low.
The warning from Daimler came after economic growth in China, a major market for carmakers, slowed to its weakest quarterly pace since 2009.
Adding to concerns about the broader sector, Swedish truckmaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) forecast slower demand for trucks in Europe and China next year, while French tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) cut its full-year market forecasts on Thursday.
RUSH RELEASE
Daimler rushed out the release of third-quarter earnings figures that fell well short of market expectations.
The profit warning comes amid friction between the German government and carmakers over who pays for expensive retrofits of new exhaust systems for polluting older vehicles, and an ongoing probe by U.S. authorities into emissions. 
In May, German prosecutors searched Daimler offices as part of a fraud probe related into possible manipulation of exhaust-gas after-treatment in diesel cars. A spokesman for the Stuttgart prosecutor's office on Friday said there was ""nothing new"" to say about this investigation, which is ongoing.
In February 2016 the United States Environmental Protection Agency asked Mercedes-Benz to explain emissions levels in some of its diesel cars.
The Stuttgart-based company also reported lower unit sales from its vans division due to delivery delays; and the need to recognize costs related to a European Court of Justice ruling on vehicles using an old coolant.

Daimler said its third-quarter earnings before interest amounted to 2.49 billion euros ($2.85 billion), down 27 percent from 3.41 billion in the year-earlier period due to a 35 percent EBIT fall at Mercedes-Benz Cars to 1.37 billion euros.

The company's shares opened at $15.41, about 2.7 percent above its initial public offering price of $15.
The Austin, Texas-based company had initially filed to sell 42 million shares and expected the offering to be priced between $17 and $19 apiece.

The former World Bank chief economist told Bloomberg Television that investors may be prioritizing liquidity to protect themselves in the event of a selloff, rather than pursuing growth.
“The expectation of another crisis may be part of why we see so much accumulation of liquid assets and so little investment in machines, infrastructure, the things that really raise the quality of life,” he said in an interview Friday in New York. “You want to hold on to a lot of liquid assets so you don’t get forced to sell them off.”
Economists and investors are on the lookout for signs of the next crisis, with the International Monetary Fund this month warning that investors may be underestimating the risk of a financial shock.
“We’ll almost surely have another financial crisis,” said Romer, who shared this year’s Nobel award with William D. Nordhaus. “We don’t know when, but we’ll have it happen again.”"

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - With Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's stock at nearly a nine-year low and the company squeezed by tariffs and trade tensions, Chief Executive Jim Hackett sought to restore confidence among dealers gathered in Las Vegas this week, days ahead of announcing the automaker's third-quarter results. 
In closed-door meetings with members of Ford's national dealer network, Hackett and other top Ford executives showed off future versions of the popular Explorer and Escape SUVs, as well as new the Ranger mid-sized pickup truck and an unnamed smaller off-road utility vehicle, attendees said. Ford has said it will refresh 75 percent of its North American lineup over the next two years.
""I feel better after seeing the product,"" said Jim Seavitt, owner of Village Ford in Dearborn, Michigan, near the company's headquarters. He saw Hackett speak on Wednesday night.
Hackett's presentations were not open to the press or public. Ford in July postponed a planned investor presentation that was scheduled for September. 
After  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Friday cut its price targets for Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) due to slumping industry demand in China, Ford's stock dipped to $8.19 - its lowest price since November 2009 - before recovering to $8.47. Ford is expected to report a decline in third-quarter profits on Oct. 24.
Dealers said the most important aspect of the meetings in Las Vegas was that Hackett laid out his vision for the company and explained to dealers how they fit in those plans - reassurances they said were long overdue. 
Hackett and other executives promised dealers there will be a wave of new models to replace an aging lineup, that future models would come at a faster pace and that more of those new models would be electric or hybrid. 
Company executives also outlined plans to cut time from a customer ordering a vehicle to delivery from 82 days to 38, as well as plans for the launch of an enhanced customer appreciation program to reward Ford's most loyal buyers.
""His (Hackett's) first slide was a McKinsey-type slide and I was like, 'Oh great, this is going to be like a consulting session here,' but I found him to be very genuine,"" Pete DeLongchamps, senior vice president with Group 1 Automotive, told Reuters. 
DeLongchamps, whose Houston-based company owns 17 Ford stores, saw Hackett speak on Tuesday night. 
Seavitt said what Hackett lacked in the ""wow factor,"" he made up for in sincerity and credibility. 
While some dealers expressed concern about Ford's previously announced decision to drop sedans in the U.S. market due to declining demand, they accepted the logic.
One large dealer, who asked not to be identified, said Ford's October sales were down double digits at his stores and criticized Ford's product line and lack of aggression with incentives and advertising.
Jim Farley, Ford's president of global markets, told reporters the dealers simply wanted to see proof of Ford's change in direction and plans. Farley said Hackett had been the ""catalyst"" for that change.
""Most dealers have their entire net worth sunk into a dealership so it was important for us to know what's going on,"" Santosh Viswanathan, managing partner with Willis Ford in Smyrna, Delaware, told Reuters. He attended Hackett's presentation on Monday.
Ford announced an $11 billion restructuring in July and three months before that said it would drop production of traditional sedans in the U.S. market and accelerate cost cutting. Many investors and analysts have called for greater detail about the restructuring and complained the company lacked a clear strategy.

Dealers attending the Las Vegas meetings said they applauded Ford's next batch of ads, which will launch this weekend. The ads tout Ford's long manufacturing history and the involvement of the Ford family, and use the tagline ""Built Ford Proud,"" echoing the long used Ford truck slogan, ""Built Ford Tough.""

364,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Dell to take $21.7 billion tracking stock offer to December vote: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc will ask holders of ""tracking stock"" tied to its software company VMware Inc to vote on its $21.7 billion cash-and-stock offer to buy it back from them on Dec. 11, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move sets Dell on a collision course with some investors opposing the offer, including billionaire Carl Icahn, who owns 8.3 percent of the tracking stock. Icahn argued in an open letter to other investors this week that the deal would unfairly give $11 billion in value to Dell's controlling shareholders, founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake.
Dell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy data storage company EMC (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion because it could not pay for the entire deal in cash and did not want to add to its debt burden. EMC owned a majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited.
The security ""tracks,"" or depends on, the financial performance of VMware, and has been trading at a discount of more than 35 percent to VMware's stock, which is steeper than what investment bankers advised Dell it initially would be. This has emboldened investors such as Icahn to argue that Dell's offer undervalues the tracking stock.
Dell needs a majority of the holders of the tracking stock to approve the deal. An Oct. 18 record date has been set, by which time investors needed to hold the tracking stock to be eligible to vote, according to the sources.
The acquisition of the publicly-traded tracking stock would result in Dell becoming a publicly listed company without an initial public offering (IPO). Dell disclosed on Oct. 3 that it had met with investment banks to explore an IPO as a contingency.
Dell will explore the IPO further only if the tracking stock owners vote down the offer in December, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the decision to set a vote has not yet been announced. A Dell spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dell is offering $109 in cash for each tracking share, up to $9 billion in total, with the remainder payable with 1.3665 shares of Dell's Class C common stock for each tracking share. That is equivalent to a 41/59 cash-stock split.
Following the deal, investors who owned the tracking stock would collectively account for between 20.8 percent and 31 percent of Dell's ownership. 
Icahn said this week that, based on his calculations, the tracking stock should be worth about $144 per share, and that Dell's offer is actually worth only $94 per share, because, in his view, Dell is inflating the value of its own privately held shares. The tracking stock ended trading on Thursday at $94.49.
Dell has argued that its growth justifies a pre-transaction equity value for the company of $48.4 billion.
Dell has also cited its regulatory filings that show the deal was the outcome of months-long negotiations between Dell and a special board committee representing the interests of tracking stock owners.
Dell can force investors to convert their tracking stock into common stock at a 20-percent premium in the first year following an IPO, 15 percent in the second year, and 10 percent from the third year on. It has argued that tracking stock investors are better off accepting its offer now, which carries a 29 percent premium to the price of the tracking stock on June 29, before Dell announced the transaction.
Shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) said earlier this month that Dell should renegotiate the tracking stock deal. ISS said it was reserving its final opinion until Dell files its definitive proxy statement, but added there were questions on whether the bid was worth as much as Dell claimed and whether it represented a fair premium.
ECHOES OF AN OLD BATTLE
Michael Dell has turned to deal-making to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security.
The tracking stock battle has echoes of the $24.9 billion deal that Dell and Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013, a transaction that Icahn also opposed, though he managed to secure a slight bump in the buyout offer.
Other investors that have opposed the tracking stock deal include P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP, which earlier this month asked Dell to raise its offer by 20 percent. Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp is also not satisfied with Dell's offer, sources have said.
If the deal goes through, Michael Dell would own 47 percent to 54 percent of the combined company and Silver Lake would own between 16 percent and 18 percent. Going public would give Michael Dell and Silver Lake the ability to eventually sell down their stakes, even though they have said they have no plans to do so. 

As a public company, Dell could also more easily use its stock as currency for acquisitions. While its debt has dropped from $57.3 billion following the EMC deal to $50.3 billion, it remains heavily indebted. The company continues to pay down debt and has told investors it aims for an investment-grade rating sometime next year.

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) reported first-quarter profit that beat estimates and sales that unexpectedly rose on Friday, thanks to robust demand for its beauty and cleaning products, helping it stave off rivalry from cheaper store-branded products.
Organic sales, which exclude revenue from newly acquired units, enjoyed growth of 4 percent, the best in five years.
Sales surged 5 percent in P&G's beauty business, driven by its premium skin care brands SK-II and Olay. The grooming business, including Gillette shaving products, surged 5 percent in volume, boosted by product innovation and price cuts.
Shares in the company, which makes Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, jumped 4.8 percent in premarket trading. The stock has fallen 13 percent this year, underperforming the broader consumer products index.
P&G and its rivals have been rocked this year by surging input costs and the foreign exchange impact of a strong dollar. 
Fierce competition between retailers and changing consumer habits have also made it harder for consumer companies to lift sales, forcing them to raise prices in some categories.
P&G's challenges relating to commodities, transportation and foreign exchange have increased in the past quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with journalists. 
P&G had told retailers during the quarter that it planned to raise prices on ""several products"" in U.S. home care, oral care and personal care, Moeller said.
The company is also raising prices in many developing markets, including Argentina, Turkey and Russia, to make up for foreign exchange headwinds, he added. The sturdy dollar makes the company's products more expensive in overseas markets.
""In less than the 3 months since our last earnings release, the foreign exchange headwinds on earnings increased by $400 million after tax,"" Moeller said.
In July, P&G said it was rolling out an average 4-percent increase in Pampers diaper prices and an average 5-percent price rise for Bounty and Charmin toilet paper and Puffs tissue products in North America.
Lofty prices may not sit well with U.S. retailers that have been aggressively cutting prices and tightening inventory levels to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Net income attributable to the company rose to $3.20 billion, or $1.22 per share, in the first quarter. Excluding items, the company earned $1.12 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.09 per share, according to data from Refinitiv.
Sales in its fabric and home care division, the company's biggest unit by sales, grew 2 percent. The unit sells Tide detergent and Febreze air fresheners among other products.

Net sales inched up unexpectedly to $16.69 billion from $16.65 billion. Analysts had forecast overall sales to fall to $16.46 billion.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European politicians have called for action to tackle dividend stripping after Reuters and other media revealed how large banks were involved in trading schemes that cost taxpayers billions of euros.
In Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, prosecutors in Cologne are investigating banks involved in the trades, which secured illicit double tax rebates on dividend payouts. 
Danish authorities are also seeking to recover hundreds of millions of euros in tax rebates they paid out after falling victim to a similar scheme and have filed dozens of lawsuits this year against individuals in the United States. 
""It is large-scale greed, and we will pursue the culprits,"" said Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen.
""That this is a problem across Europe makes me even more upset ... The answer ... is closer international cooperation.""
Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as part of a European media investigation called the ""cum-ex files"" coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv. 
These documents showed that prosecutors in Cologne opened a tax investigation into Santander (MC:SAN) in June. They believe its role in the scheme was to carry out trades. Other banks are being investigated as part of the wider probe.
Santander said it was ""fully cooperating"" with German authorities and conducting an internal investigation. 
Jeppe Kofod, a Dutch member of the European Parliament's committee on tax evasion and financial crime, called for a public hearing by lawmakers to quiz banks about the scheme. 
""Several of the biggest European banks are involved,"" Kofod told Reuters. ""It is a European issue."" 
Germany made three attempts to stamp out the practice by changing and clarifying the law in 2007 and 2009 before finally succeeding in 2012.
TIGHTER CHECKS
The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark has prompted other countries, including Austria and Belgium, to open their own investigations. They have discovered that they were also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.
A spokeswoman for the Belgian finance ministry said it was investigating a similar fraud after it discovered illicit tax reclaims. It repaid 201 million euros before halting far larger reclaims, some as recent as 2017.
State prosecutors in Austria have also opened an investigation into similar trades, a spokeswoman said.
""The culprits tried to replicate the fraudulent scheme used in Germany in Austria,"" she said, adding that a joint investigative team had been launched with prosecutors in Cologne. ""The investigation is very advanced,"" she said.
Norway also fell victim to the fraud in 2013 with a loss of 580,000 Norwegian krone ($71,270) according to the tax authorities. Norway was was able to stop 10 further attempts in 2015 in fraudulent claims of $4.3 million.
""After discovering these fraud attempts we introduced much tighter checks before paying refunds,"" said Hans Christian Holte, director general of the Norwegian Tax Administration.
The circle of countries that theoretically could have fallen victim is even wider, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has monitored the situation. 
Responding to the investigation, French Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin said on twitter: ""If the frauds are confirmed, we will be ruthless.""
The scheme involved trading a company stock rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners - each entitled to a tax rebate.
""We need to look at our laws to make sure they can stop this kind of large-scale tax fraud,"" said Tove Maria Ryding of the European Network on Debt and Development, which campaigns on tax issues.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The pressure is on for Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft as they prepare to report quarterly results at a time when confidence in those market leaders looks increasingly fragile and in danger of derailing Wall Street's rally.
After worries about higher interest rates sparked a steep sell-off in early October and again on Thursday, the S&P 500 remains down 5 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close, with top-shelf stocks including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) showing little of their vitality from recent years.
A quarterly report from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) on Wednesday after the bell, followed by Alphabet and Amazon late on Thursday, will influence sentiment across Wall Street. 
""The equity market is at a critical point here,"" said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager, Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""In order for it not to get a lot worse, I think you need to see Amazon and Alphabet put up some good numbers."" 
With investors worried about increased internet regulation and criticism of Facebook's handling of user data, the social media company's stock has slumped 29 percent from its record high on July 25. Alphabet is 15 percent below its July 26 record high close, while Amazon has fallen 12 percent this month.
Microsoft has also stalled after doubling over the past two years.
Still, Netflix and Amazon remain up 81 percent and 51 percent year to date, respectively, underscoring their places among Wall Street's crème de la crème. The S&P 500's largest component, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) has gained 28 percent in 2018, even after falling 7 percent from its record high on Oct. 3.
A 5 percent surge in Netflix on Wednesday after its upbeat quarterly report allayed fears the video streaming company was losing steam. 
But that did little to perk up its fellow stocks in the so-called FANG group that also includes Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook. In the past, those stocks have often risen together.
Powerful rallies by Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix in recent years have made them must-own stocks for portfolio managers, making their ownership so widespread that they are at risk of a major sell-off should a majority of investors' views about them change for the worse. 
""So many funds are invested in the same stocks. They got less crowded in the past week, but at this point it's difficult to say if we are going to shrug everything off and go to new highs a month from now, or if we're going to test more lows,"" warned Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.
The recent slide has left Amazon and Facebook trading at discounted multiples of their expected earnings. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio last week touched 74, a seven-year low, according to Refinitiv data. Facebook this month traded as little as 18 times expected earnings, the lowest since its 2012 public listing.
ROBUST EARNINGS GROWTH
Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. But some investors are already eyeing slower growth in 2019, when the corporate tax cut benefits will be a year old and no longer create an extra boost.
Investors are also nervous about potential fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade conflict with Beijing, and higher interest rates as the strong U.S. economy and low unemployment pressure prices. 
Propelled by its cloud computing business, Amazon is expected by analysts to report a September-quarter non-GAAP net profit of $1.54 billion, or $3.12 per share, compared to just $256 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv. 
Alphabet's September-quarter non-GAAP net profit is seen rising 9 percent to $7.36 billion, or $10.43 per share. 
Microsoft's non-GAAP net income is seen rising 13 percent to $7.46 billion, or 96 cents per share.
Facebook reports its quarterly results on Oct. 30, followed on Nov. 1 by Apple.

Amazon and Alphabet are widely considered technology companies. However, within S&P Dow Jones Indices' Global Industry Classification Standard, Amazon falls into the consumer discretionary sector and Alphabet belongs to the recently renamed communication services sector.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>",No room at the inn: Central Europe student housing crunch attracts investors,"By Michael Kahn
WROCLAW, Poland (Reuters) - Wroclaw's hulking Soviet-era public dormitories held little appeal for Odysseas Savvas when he moved to the Polish city from Greece to study business at university. Instead, he opted for his own room and bathroom in a newly built private residence.
""The other dorms were really old from the communist times and really simple,"" Savvas, 19, said. ""I couldn't be comfortable sharing a room and a bathroom with four people.""
Investors and developers sizing up the potential for new student housing projects in central and eastern Europe believe there will be many more foreign students just like Savvas willing to pay extra for their creature comforts.
That's why the company behind the new residence in Wroclaw which has a gym, private kitchens and big-screen TV in the communal area, is planning to quadruple the number of student housing projects it runs in the next two to three years.
Central Europe's old world charm and tradition-steeped universities are increasingly attracting international students eager to study in English-language degree programmes for a fraction of the cost back home.
It's also creating a housing crunch with many older dormitories filled to capacity and students snapping up rooms in private residences such as the nearly 500-bed residence in Wroclaw, which opened in September.
""We can see the demand is there,"" said Nebil Senman, managing director of Griffin Real Estate https://griffin-re.com/en which operates the residence in Wroclaw and is backed by Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital Management (N:OAK). ""We are currently over-subscribed.""
""In the last six months I've really seen the market pick up. There is more demand from international investors approaching us. This is something we are considering,"" said Senman, who oversees four student housing projects in Poland at the moment.
SIMPLE ECONOMICS
In Poland, the region's biggest country and largest economy, the number of international students has surged more than four-fold to almost 57,000 in the past nine years, according to government statistics compiled by StudentMarketing http://www.student-market.com/home.
It has jumped 72 percent to 38,868 in the Czech Republic while Hungary's international student population has doubled to nearly 27,000 over the same period. 
For investors it's simple economics. More students and not enough beds in cities where development costs are lower than in western Europe means higher yields on new projects than in more mature western European student housing markets.
""Central and eastern Europe is on the radar of those big investors who have established their presence in western Europe and it is a natural next move for them,"" said Stefan Kolibar, head of marketing at StudentMarketing, an independent research company focussed on student housing data.
""The region is even more under supplied with not as much volume,"" he said. 
Kolibar said the percentage of private beds to international students was 5 percent in Prague, 1 percent in Warsaw, 9 percent in Wroclaw and 13 percent in Budapest compared to 16 percent in Barcelona, 55 percent in Amsterdam and 30 percent in Dublin.
In Budapest, Austrian company value one http://www.value-one.at opened the 418-apartment Milestone project last year offering a roof-top terrace, high-speed internet and a fitness room.
It now has its sights set on the Czech Republic and Poland, which entered the top 10 destinations for the Erasmus program http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus for international students, a spokeswoman said. 
""Both markets are interesting for us because they offer a high number of students from all over the world and they are near our home market,"" said spokeswoman Caroline Hadl.
HEDGING YOUR BETS
Investors such as Corestate Capital Holding (DE:CCAG) see student housing as a durable asset because of the perpetual pipeline of domestic and international students, said Philipp Rohweder, one of the company's investment directors. His firm is keen to invest in projects in central Europe, especially Poland where a thriving student population, years of economic growth and a stable currency provides opportunity for investors in an emerging market.
The country of 40 million people also has a large number of university towns attractive for investors who want to establish a network of student housing projects, he added. ""Student housing is hedging your bets against other economic cycles because when the economy is good everyone wants to study and when it isn't everybody has to study,"" said, adding that he hopes to have a deal for a 1,000-bed project secured this year.
Low costs are a big draw for students. Yearly tuition at Prague's Charles University https://www.cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html is about 6,000 euros ($6,950) per year for a degree programme, far less than in most universities in the United States and Asia.
Commerz Real https://www.commerzreal.com/en, a subsidiary of Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), launched a 500 million euro fund in August aimed at tapping into the European student housing market.
The fund's manager, Heiko Szczodrowski, sees fast-growing central European cities such as Warsaw, Prague and Budapest as attractive potential targets: ""We don't have a property in the fund but we want to change that soon.""
'THE RIGHT TIME'
In Prague, enrolment in the Erasmus program at Charles University has surged from less than 200 at the turn of the century to nearly 2,000 today, said Beata Tomeckova, who coordinates student housing.
Average monthly rent for a single room in private student residences is 299 euros in Prague, 238 euros in Budapest and 176 euros in Warsaw, according to data compiled by StudentMarketing.
That compares with an average 627 euros in Barcelona, 760 euros in Milan and 870 euros in Dublin.
""We have an increasing number of students but there are limits and some students may not get a place in the dormitories,"" Tomeckova said.
Alexander Gulya, managing director for international acquisitions at International Campus https://www.ic-campus.com/en/home, which is controlled by Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (TO:BRE), is planning a 550-bed dormitory in Prague's trendy Holesovice district.
It started a project for a 1,400-bed residence in Budapest in April and a 1,000-bed dorm in Krakow in July. The company is also targeting Warsaw in the central European region where Gulya said it was possible to see attractive yields. 
""We believe it is the right time to reach out and find chances in higher yielding markets especially in an asset class where there will be future demand,"" he said.

""But we should not forget that student housing is at a very early stage in this region and those going to CEE need to take a strong entrepreneurial view.

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>","Europe, U.S. Escalate Trade War With Dueling Disputes at the WTO","(Bloomberg) -- China and the EU have joined a group of countries asking the World Trade Organization to investigate the Trump administration’s decision to impose metals tariffs on national security grounds. In a separate filing, the U.S. asked the WTO to review those nations that retaliated against its duties.
The move sets the stage for a showdown at the Geneva-based trade arbiter that some fear could either lead to a U.S. exit or a flood of new protectionist measures invoking what has until now been a rarely used national security loophole in global trade rules.
The U.S. has said the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imposed earlier this year are allowed under the WTO’s national security exemption, which permits governments to take “any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.” This has drawn the ire of those affected, many of which are close American allies, such as the European Union and Canada.
Countries so far have refrained from challenging that at the WTO. But in a statement issued Thursday, Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide said her country and other nations had chosen to request the establishment of a dispute panel at the WTO.
“We believe that the U.S.’s additional duty on steel and aluminum is in violation of the WTO rules,” she wrote.
A WTO spokesman declined to comment on the matter.
National Security
The dispute puts the trade organization in a difficult position: If it rules in support of the U.S. it could encourage other members to enact protectionist measures under the guise of national security. If it rules against the U.S. it could draw further ire from the largest economy in the world and a possible withdrawal by the Trump administration.
The “worst outcome” for the WTO is if the dispute settlement system “decided that it was in a position to judge whether something was or was not in the national security interests of the U.S. or any other member,” Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Dennis Shea said in an October speech in Washington.
So far, Canada, China, the EU, Mexico, Russia and Turkey have imposed retaliatory tariffs on more than $25 billion worth of U.S. goods. The Trump administration previously said there was no basis under WTO rules for the countries to impose their retaliatory tariffs.
“These tariffs appear to breach each WTO Member’s commitments under the WTO agreement,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in July. “The U.S. will take all necessary actions to protect our interests.”
Metals Tariffs
The requests will be considered at the next meeting of the WTO dispute settlement body, which is scheduled for Oct. 29.
Nine WTO members -- Canada, China, the EU, India, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Switzerland and Turkey -- have filed initial complaints that allege Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum violated WTO rules. But Thursday’s move takes the disputes an important step closer to a formal case.
The complaints differ slightly, but each country alleges that the measures violate core WTO agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, and the WTO Safeguards Agreement, which governs the use of temporary trade restrictions, known as safeguards.
In July, the U.S. said its tariffs were authorized under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962 -- which permits the president to impose trade restrictions if imports are found to harm U.S. national security.
The U.S. argued that WTO members have a legal right to impose national security tariffs under Section 21 of the GATT, which permits a government to take “any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.”
‘America First’
If the WTO determines that national security measures aren’t permitted under the WTO’s national security exemption it could then ask Trump to roll back a key tool in his “America First” trade arsenal.
Conversely, if the WTO agrees with the U.S. argument it could encourage Trump to implement national security tariffs on cars and spur a proliferation of other new trade restrictions authorized under the guise of national security.
The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting an investigation to determine if foreign imports of autos and auto parts are having a detrimental impact on U.S. national security. The inquiry is identical to the process the Trump administration pursued earlier this year when it triggered 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum in the name of protecting U.S. national security.
The move also comes as the Trump administration has mounted a broader attack on the WTO’s dispute system, which it accuses of overreach.
Since last year the U.S. has blocked the appointment of new members of the WTO’s appellate body, bringing the number of appellate judges in Geneva from the usual seven down to three.
If nothing changes, that number is due to fall further by the end of next year, leaving the body unable to form the requisite three-member appeals panel to hear a dispute.

A decision is expected before Christmas, he said, with the widebody jets to replace aging 747s, 777-200s and 777-300s. It would also give the airline the capacity to relaunch U.S. flights assuming Thailand's safety rating is upgraded by the Federal Aviation Administration.
""We also have to do proper market studies whether it is the east coast, the west coast or whatever,"" Chantalitanon said of U.S. flights. ""At the moment we have not decided where our metal is going to land and we also need the delivery of our future fleet.""
The flights would compete against non-stop U.S. flights from Southeast Asian rivals Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) and Philippine Airlines Inc (PHL.UL). Chantalitanon said there was enough premium traffic from Thailand and neighboring countries to make the flights viable.
Thai Airways, which has been struggling financially, is pinning hopes of a revival on the new leadership team, jet purchases and improving its brand as tourism booms in the region.
Chantalitanon said there had been a ""bit of a drop"" in passenger demand on Chinese routes after a boat accident in July that killed dozens of tourists. 
European and Japanese demand was stronger, he said, with the airline adding more flights to those regions.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 05:42AM ET</span>",Weak earnings and EU-Italy budget clash drive European stocks down,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks tumbled again on Friday as a showdown between Italy's populist government and the European Union heated up and weak results from  Michelin  and  Bouygues  reignited investors' concerns about auto and construction stocks.
Euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) fell 0.8 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.4 percent and Italy's top stock index (FTMIB) slid 1.2 percent.
Brussels sent Rome a letter demanding an explanation for its budget plans, calling them an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules. 
Italy's bank stocks index (FTIT8300) fell 2.9 percent to a 22-month low as government bonds were sold off. It was set for its fourth straight week of declines.
A crop of results, some with negative outlooks, suggested growth slowing in China, car demand falling, and issues in the construction sector.
""Companies that disappoint are always more harshly punished but, given the trend in the market currently, reactions are stronger than usual,"" said Emmanuel Cau, European equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Shares in tire maker Michelin (PA:MICP) tumbled 6.7 percent after it cut its sales outlook and downgraded its market growth forecasts, blaming slowing Chinese car demand and new emissions testing regulations.
Its German rival Continental (DE:CONG) fell 3 percent to the bottom of the DAX, and the autos and parts sector as a whole (SXAP) sank 2.9 percent. 
""This warning provides a negative read across to all tire makers (weaker market volume and higher input costs),"" said UBS analysts.
CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS 
French conglomerate Bouygues (PA:BOUY) fell 6.5 percent after cutting its profit outlook due to difficulties in its construction businesses, also reporting a shrinking margin due to problems with contracts and France's rail strikes.
""This was particularly surprising two weeks after a bullish construction capital markets day,"" wrote  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts.
British construction equipment rental firm Ashtead (L:AHT) fell 4.5 percent in sympathy.
Swedish builder Skanska (ST:SKAb) fell 9 percent after saying it had booked charges of 1.3 billion crowns ($140 million) in the third quarter relating to construction projects in the United States.
Overall, the construction and materials sector (SXOP) fell 0.3 percent, its second day of declines after being hit on Thursday by a profit warning from Heidelbergcement.
""We have a negative view on this sector - it's very sensitive to emerging markets and China, and we're quite cautious on those areas,"" said Barclays' Cau. ""Construction is penalized both by a slowing economy and by rising raw materials costs.""
Sopra Steria (PA:SOPR) was the top STOXX 600 faller, dropping 26 percent after cutting its 2018 revenue forecast due to a contract loss in banking software. 
""The profit warning will probably trigger around 15 percent EPS downgrades and obviously a bit of an additional hit from a share price perspective because of derating as well,"" said Georgios Kertsos, an analyst at Berenberg.
""It's probably a bit too harsh a hit,"" he added, saying more detail was needed from the company, which is in a quiet period before its third-quarter results on Oct. 25.

Overall, analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for European earnings quite sharply in recent weeks, but Barclays' Cau said he thought estimates for 2019 earnings growth were still too high and could decline further.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Ryanair trumpets progress in relations with European pilots,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) has reached a deal with Portuguese pilots on contentious seniority and home base issues, following similar agreements with their counterparts in Britain and Italy this week, the Irish budget airline said on Friday.
Ryanair also expects to sign a recognition agreement with the union representing Spanish pilots shortly as it seeks to end a damaging series of strikes that have hurt its business.
Ryanair has struggled with labor relations since it bowed to pressure to recognize unions for the first time almost a year ago, contributing to a rare profit warning this month and a warning of worse to come if strikes continue.
It said the Portuguese deal - covering issues such as leave allocation and promotion - would allow talks with Portugal's SPAC union on a full collective labor agreement to start by the end of the month.
A recognition agreement in Spain will also pave the way for rapid negotiations on a full labor agreement with Spanish pilot union SEPLA, Europe's largest low-cost carrier added.
Ryanair signed its first recognition agreement with pilots in its largest market of Britain earlier this year where it has avoided industrial action. Pilots in Italy approved a collective labor agreement in August.
""These signed agreements with our pilot unions in Portugal, the UK, Italy and shortly in Spain, demonstrate the considerable progress we're making in concluding union agreements with our people in our major EU markets,"" Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
""I expect that these agreements in Spain, and Portugal in particular, will encourage the cabin crew unions in both those countries... to quickly conclude cabin crew agreements.""
Cabin crew in Spain and Portugal took part in a walkout across six European countries last month that disrupted the plans of more than 40,000 passengers in one of Ryanair's worse strikes to date.
Two Belgian unions representing Ryanair cabin crew warned of several more days of strikes in Europe before the end of the year if Ryanair does not change its position in negotiations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors sold Italian bonds and the euro on Friday, with Italy's bond yield hitting four-year highs as the European Union called its draft budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules.
Late on Thursday, the European Commission told Rome in a letter https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/18_10_18_commission_letter_to_italy_en_0_1.pdf that planned government spending was too high and that its structural deficit would rise instead of fall, and that the country's public debt would not fall in line with EU rules.
Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte defended the budget.
EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the month.
While it isn't unusual for the EU to ask member countries for clarification on points of their budget plans, the sending of a formal letter and the tone of the comments were particularly strong, analysts said. 
""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on an 'unprecedented' scale,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) research strategist Jim Reid said in a note to clients. 
Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent in early trade on Friday, the highest since February 2014.
The closely watched Italian/German bond yield spread hit a fresh 5-1/2 year high of 332 basis points.
Portuguese and Spanish bonds, that have been resilient so far through the Italian budget worries, were also sold, with several analysts suggesting that this was the first sign of contagion from Italy. [GVD/EUR]
Italian stocks tumbled nearly 1.2 percent, while its bank stocks in particular fell almost 3 percent.
The news also weighed on the euro, which fell to a two-month low. [FRX/]
Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP (Italian government bond) yields moved notably higher ""correlations could well strengthen and this would provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.
Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this week, they were projecting an increase next September. [/ECBWATCH]

Stocks in Europe managed a modest rise at the start of trading, but fell back into the red.
The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent on the day. It was set for a fourth weekly loss on the trot, which would make it its longest weekly losing streak since the end of 2015.
In currencies, the dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against major peers, was 0.1 percent higher at 95.981.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) China venture with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) has started building a $2.5 billion new energy vehicle (NEV) plant in Shanghai, which will make VW's luxury  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG) brand cars, a possible first for the venture.
The new plant is a key step for Audi to diversify production of its cars in the world's largest car market from its long-standing local partner, China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL]. This shift has been delayed amid resistance from local dealers.
SAIC Volkswagen said the new plant would have an annual capacity to make 300,000 cars and begin production from 2020. Audi sold 481,387 vehicles in China from January to September this year.
Audi unveiled the plan to bolster ties with SAIC in late 2016. Earlier this year the Germany luxury carmaker bought a 1 percent stake in the SAIC Volkswagen venture, paving the way for the joint venture to produce and sell Audi cars.
Volkswagen currently gets a larger proportion of the proceeds from the 50-50 tie-up with SAIC than from its 40 percent stake in the venture with FAW.
SAIC Volkswagen said in a statement on Friday the plant would cost 17 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) and would make VW and Skoda models as well as Audi cars. It will help VW tap China's fast-growing market for NEVs, a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 01:26AM ET</span>",China to allow bank wealth-management funds to be invested in stocks,"By Shu Zhang and Engen Tham
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's banking regulator said on Friday it plans to start letting funds from products publicly sold by banks' wealth management subsidiaries be directly invested in shares.
Currently, only funds raised from privately sold bank wealth management products can be invested in China's stock market.
The long-awaited announcement from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) came as Chinese stocks traded near four-year lows amid fears of forced selling.
Shares on mainland bourses fell after a prolonged crackdown earlier this year on risk hammered many financial institutions handling funds from wealth management products (WMPs).
The CBIRC announced the policy change in draft rules that allow banks to set up wealth management subsidiaries to strengthen risk management. The regulator is seeking feedback on the draft, which does not specify what percentage of such WMP funds can be invested in shares.
Li Qilin, chief economist at Lianxun Securities in Beijing, estimates the at most 20 percent of WMP funds could be invested in stocks, adding that some other constraints may limit the potential amount.
""Bank WMPs target investors with low risk tolerance and many of those products lean towards cash management,"" said Li. ""It's unlikely to see massively investment in high-risk, high-volatility equity assets that can trigger large fluctuations of fund values.""
The outstanding amount of bank WMPs stood at 29.54 trillion yuan ($4.26 trillion) at end-2017, according to official data.
Wealth management entities launched by China's banks will be asked to set aside a risk reserve fund, according to the draft rules. 
The minimum registered capital for bank wealth management subsidiaries is 1 billion yuan, while the minimum investment requirement for investors in products sold by such entities has been scrapped. 
Many of China's lenders have launched wealth management subsidiaries as Beijing ratcheted up its tightening of the way funds from WMPs could be invested. 
Bank wealth management subsidiary investments in non-standard debt assets, typically referring to shadow loans, cannot exceed 35 percent of WMP products' net capital, the draft rules said.
The regulations encourage commercial banks to attract investment from foreign financial institutions in their wealth management subsidiaries. 
Some of the rules ""are kind of loosening control"", said one person in the wealth management department of a large state-owned lender.
""Everything seems to be about boosting market confidence at this moment,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Investors slammed U.S.-based stock funds during the latest week, pulling $17.5 billion, the most cash from such investments since June, according to Lipper data on Thursday.
The withdrawals came during a volatile week for markets as minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve policy meeting showed broad agreement on the need to raise borrowing costs further, cementing investor concerns that had helped cause a major sell-off the week before. (N)
Domestic stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted $18.2 billion in withdrawals, only marginally offset by $648 million moving into equity funds focused abroad, according to data from the research service that covers the seven days through Oct. 17.
Rising rates could draw money away from stocks and into bonds. It could also crimp the economic growth that has plumped corporate profits to record levels and enabled a near decade-long rally.
""There were people ducking for cover,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper. ""This is fast money - people getting in and getting out.""
Also during the week, Japanese stock funds based in the United States but invested primarily in Tokyo pulled in $1.2 billion, the most cash since 2013 and an endorsement of that market's chances to rally.
Despite a strong start to earnings season and the hope of rising rates increasing bank profits from lending activity, fast-money investors pulled $2.5 billion from financial sector funds, the most on record.

JEJU, South Korea (Reuters) - Strong e-commerce demand is fuelling Asia's air freight market, with the U.S.-China trade war having minimal negative impact so far and in some cases even boosting shipments, industry executives said on Friday.
E-commerce is growing at pace in populous Asia, driven by Chinese behemoth  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and rival JD.com Inc (O:JD), as well as others such as Japan's  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755), sponsor of Spanish soccer giants FC Barcelona.
But the flow of goods has been threatened this year by the United States imposing import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods to redress what it regards as unfair trade relations - with China's government responding in kind.
""I think right now we are probably going to see a pretty strong fourth quarter,"" Randy Tinseth, Boeing Co's (N:BA) vice president for commercial airplane marketing, said on the sidelines of an industry conference.
""The economy today has been very, very strong. Frankly in anticipation of this geopolitical situation I think people are just going out and moving (cargo) quickly.""
Asia-Pacific air cargo volume rose 4.8 percent in January-August, showed data from the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). That was lower than last year's 9.8 percent but came off a higher comparison base at a time of record shipments, said AAPA Director-General Andrew Herdman.
""Given this short-term effect of scrambling to meet deadlines for tariff imposition and so on we are seeing pockets – lanes and channels – where demand is stronger than expected. For the next several months the cargo picture remains relatively robust. The question is what will the outlook for next year be.""
INTERNET SHIPPING
Asian airlines have an outsized role in air freight, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the global market as the region is a major manufacturing hub and e-commerce is growing.
""E-commerce is changing the way people are buying stuff, especially in countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines,"" said Jean-Francois Laval, Airbus SE (PA:AIR) executive vice president, Asia sales. ""It is coming from China, from Korea, it is coming from other parts of the region. You need a huge amount of cargo space.""
Boeing on Monday forecast air cargo traffic would double over the next 20 years, growing at an average rate of 4.2 percent a year.
To meet that demand, the aircraft manufacturer expects the world freighter fleet to expand over 70 percent to 3,260 planes. Around half of air cargo is carried in the bellies of passenger jets, with the remainder flown on dedicated freighters.
WAR PREPARATION
Some large Asian cargo carriers including Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) rely on freight for around a quarter of revenue.
""Last year the cargo market was extremely hot. In 2018 it still grew. The trade tensions in the world will have some effects but we haven't seen it yet. I see constraints coming in a very short time. However we are preparing for it,"" Korean Air President Walter Cho told reporters on Friday.
""Anything from the U.S. to China and vice versa is going to be affected. We are looking at alternate markets to China and the U.S. as well.""
 Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201) President Yuji Akasaka said the trade war had made no change to the cargo market to date and he only expected an impact if ""extremes"" occurred.
""If it does happen it may affect us in the future but as of right now we haven't seen it and hope it will cool down and go back to normal,"" he said through a translator.
In the short term, trade war impact has not been too visible because initial tariffs were on items not typically transported by air such as metals, AAPA's Herdman said. That is starting to change, however, as duties apply to more goods.

""I heard one example... Seafood from the U.S. to China is subject to retaliatory tariffs, so demand in China is down. Guess what? Demand for Canadian seafood is doing just fine.""

JEJU, South Korea (Reuters) -  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) is very likely to order more  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 widebody jets to mainly replace its existing aircraft, as it seeks to streamline its fleet and reduce costs, its president said on Friday.
""We have too many fleet types now. Consolidating in one large order will help reduce maintenance costs and pilot training,"" Walter Cho, president of the South Korean flagship carrier, told reporters.
""There is a very high possibility we will expand our fleet on the 787. The 777X would be a good replacement for our current 777 generation and we are also keeping in mind the A350 as well,"" he said, in reference to an Airbus SE (PA:AIR) jet.
It is possible a decision on the widebody fleet would be made next year, Cho said, adding the airline held 10 options over 787s.
Korean Air, whose reputation has been tainted by scandals involving members of its owner-family, has seen business to Europe and the United States improve sharply from last year, but its China route traffic remained weak, Cho said.
Cho's father, Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang-ho, was indicted this week on charges including embezzlement and breach of trust.
""I believe the brand and reputation starts with our employees. I'm trying to communicate more with them and make sure they are happy working with us,"" the president said in his first public remark since the indictment.
""We are still struggling with China due to political issues. Japan is slowly but steadily regaining momentum at this time. We are doing much better than last year,"" he said. 
Cho also said that, as tensions ease over North Korea's development of nuclear missiles, Korean Air is reviewing flight paths over the North.

""Overflying, there is already talks about that. We are discussing internally about that. It will save a lot of costs for us but we will be very careful about when to start that given U.S. tensions"" with North Korea.

The companies set up the venture in 2011 on expectations that construction for nuclear power plants would increase. 
But the Fukushima catastrophe that same year - in which a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown at a power station on Japan's northeast coast - has led to a shift away from nuclear and reduced demand for new equipment, Keiichi Sakamoto, an IHI spokesman, said on Friday. 
A Toshiba spokeswoman confirmed they would dissolve the venture, called Toshiba IHI Power Systems. 
The news was first reported on Friday by the Nikkei business daily, which said the firms would shift towards renewable energy.
Sakamoto said IHI, which makes containment vessels and reactor pressure vessels, will continue its nuclear business.

IHI owns 52 percent of the venture, which has roughly 80 employees, and Toshiba holds the rest.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - About 300 staff of National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) have been fired or left the company as a result of internal investigations into wrongdoing, Chief Executive Andrew Thorburn said on Friday, following public revelations of misconduct across the sector.
Thorburn said he was ashamed of the bank's behavior and admitted he had been wrong to oppose a commission of inquiry which has exposed scandal after scandal in the country's greed-driven banking culture.
""It's been a particularly difficult and shameful year,"" Thorburn told a parliamentary committee in his first public comments since the quasi-judicial inquiry began hearing evidence of financial sector wrongdoing earlier this year.
More than 1,200 staff had been questioned about their adherence to the bank's code of conduct as part of the internal probe, he said. Seven hundred of those questioned were found wanting and over 300, or less than 1 percent of total staff, were ""either terminated or have left,"" Thorburn said.
""If there's anybody who's committed a fraud or absolute clear misconduct they're terminated immediately and files in many cases are handed straight to police,"" he said.
A NAB spokeswoman declined to provide further detail about which department the staff worked for or what jobs they held.
Thorburn added however that ""very few"" of the terminations were at executive level. NAB has slashed executive pay and announced the departure of its top consumer banking executive last month after the inquiry uncovered misdeeds in his department.
The comments encapsulate just how far the sector has shifted, from defiance before the explosive inquiry began in February, to contrition and apology. Thorburn was the fourth boss of a major bank to appear before the committee in recent weeks, and the fourth to express regret at past misdeeds.
Last week, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group's (AX:ANZ) head told the committee his bank had fired more than 200 staff for wrongdoing. The heads of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) were also apologetic.
NABBED
The powerful public inquiry heard NAB's wealth management arm had charged hundreds of thousands of retirees for financial advice they never received.
The banks, including NAB, have now set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for refunds, legal costs and compliance charges arising from the inquiry.
The gusher of scandals and malfeasance uncovered, and the expectation that fines and regulations will follow has already knocked almost A$55 billion ($39 billion) from the market cap of the big four banks, and Thorburn said it had spooked international investors.
""They're probably requiring higher prices for us to borrow the money or they're a little more reluctant to get as heavily involved at the moment,"" he said.
NAB shares edged 0.3 percent lower on Friday, in line with the broader market (AXJO).
Separately on Friday, the head of Australia's corporate watchdog said banks were still too slow to respond to concerns about potential breaches.
""Whilst we are hearing important acknowledgements from leaders of financial institutions about change, such change is not happening as quickly as it should,"" Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chairman James Shipton told a separate parliamentary committee.
""ASIC is still experiencing slow and delayed responses from financial institutions and, in some cases, overly technical responses aimed at delay.""

404,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",China Verbal Intervention Leaves Stock Investors Wanting More,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s top financial officials moved to shore up investor confidence in the country’s tumbling stock market, a rare coordinated show of verbal support that failed to immediately put a floor under the deepest equity sell-off since 2015.
The heads of the central bank, banking and insurance regulator and securities regulator all issued statements on Friday voicing their support for the market and promising measures to help ease financial pressures on companies, especially those with a high proportion of pledged shares. The officials stopped short of promising direct intervention.
Policy makers are grappling with a stock market that’s among the world’s worst performers amid an economic slowdown and an escalating trade war with the U.S. As share prices fall, the fate of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shares pledged as loan collateral has become a pressing concern.
“The majority of the major shareholders’ holdings of listed companies are pledged,” said Central China Securities analyst Zhang Gang. “Once force liquidations occur, it may trigger a systemic financial crisis.”
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said in a statement on the central bank’s website that the recent stock market turmoil was caused by investor sentiment. The PBOC is studying measures to ease company’s financing difficulties and will also use monetary policy tool to support banks’ credit expansion.
Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said in an interview posted on the regulator’s website that recent “abnormal fluctuations” in markets don’t reflect the country’s economic fundamentals and “stable financial system.” At the same time, Liu Shiyu, head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said his agency encouraged local government-backed funds to help ease pressures created by share-pledge risks.
“This kind of pep talk will have little short-term boost to the market,” said Liu Wu, an analyst at China Development Bank Securities. “The main problem is that the institutional investors keep selling, some actively as they want to gather ammunition for when the real bottom comes, and some from investor redemptions, so this will not cause a sustainable upturn.”
The Shanghai Composite Index pared early losses after Yi’s comments, though was still down 0.9 percent at 10:09 a.m. local time.
Here’s What Top Regulators Said on Friday
Guo also said that China will allow insurance companies to introduce products designed to ease liquidity risks caused by share pledging of listed companies. Liu revealed a number of measures in a statement on the CSRC’s website, including encouraging private equity funds to take part in company restructurings, enhancing share buyback mechanisms and exploring ways to help private companies to issue bonds.
“The comments are mostly addressing problems in the mid-to-long term,” said Nie Wen, an economist at Huabao Trust. “The regulators don’t want to encourage expectations that the national team will always save the day, hence giving rise to more margin trading. But from the circumstances now, that may be the only remedy.”

China’s economic growth slowed to 6.5% year-on-year, compared with the general consensus of a 6.6% growth. It was the weakest pace since the first quarter of 2009.
On a quarterly basis, GDP grew 1.6% in the third quarter, in line with expectations but slower than the 1.8% growth in April-June.
Earlier reports said Beijing’s official growth target for 2018 is around 6.5%.
""The combination of slower global economic growth, ongoing US-China geopolitical/trade concerns and the increased likelihood the FOMC raises the funds rate by more than is currently discounted (75bps over the next 12 months) is weighing on investment sentiment,"" Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a morning note.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component slid 0.9% and 0.6% by 10:04 PM ET (02:04 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dipped 1.0%.
While not a directional driver, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission Guo Shuqing said China will allow insurance companies to begin selling products designed to ease liquidity risks.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 1.3% lower, while South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.4%.
Australia’s ASX 200 also slipped 0.3%.
Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.27%, while the S&P 500 index declined 1.44%, and the NASDAQ Composite index fell 2.06%.
U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday that he is “waiting for the results of about three different investigations”, but it “certainly looks” like missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi is dead and warned of “very severe” consequences for those responsible for his death."

According to the website, the rear-wheel-drive model has a ""mid range"" battery, a range of 260 miles, 50 miles less than the long-range battery that the more expensive Model 3 is equipped with. 
The new version has a delivery period of six to 10 weeks, according to the website, which would customers eligible for the current $7,500 U.S. tax credit if they take delivery by the end of the year. The tax credit for Tesla cars will drop by half on Jan. 1. 
Although Tesla has promised a base-level version of the Model 3 priced at $35,000, so far it has only produced higher-cost versions starting at about $49,000. Tesla has said that it would not manufacture the base-level version of the Model 3 this year.

Adding the mid-priced version of the Model 3 appears to be a strategic way to lure possible buyers who had been waiting for the lower-priced version. It is not clear how many of the more than 400,000 reservations for the Model 3 are for the base models.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Thursday joined the growing list of high-profile businesses snubbing a Saudi investment conference next week amid mounting pressure on Riyad over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
A number of top bankers and business leaders, including the CEOs of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and the chairman of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, have pulled out of the event in recent days. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday also abandoned plans to attend.
In an interview with CNBC, Goldman CEO David Solomon said the bank was not sending any senior executives. He said that Dina Powell, a Goldman executive who rejoined the bank earlier this year after serving as an adviser to President Donald Trump, had initially planned to attend but would not go.
""This incident is unacceptable and clearly they have to answer questions specifically regarding this incident,"" Solomon said. ""How they answer those questions and how more information becomes apparent will have an impact on how we all interact.""
Other chief executives are still torn over whether to attend. Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser on Tuesday said he had not yet made up his mind whether to attend the event in a country where his company has almost 2,000 employees and had some 1.4 billion euros in sales in 2017.
""There is a person missing… there is a massive concern. On the other hand, if we skip communicating with countries where people are missing, I just can stay home because I cannot talk to anybody anymore,"" he said at an event in Toronto.
Media outlets are also boycotting the event. On Thursday, Fox News said it had canceled its sponsorship of and participation in the event, joining outlets such as CNN, the New York Times and Bloomberg LP.
Goldman began operating in Riyadh in 2009 and obtained new licenses in 2014 and 2017 that have allowed it to expand. It bought a portion of oil giant Aramco's $10 billion credit facility last year in an attempt to secure a role in the company's IPO, which is delayed. 
The bank was recently hired by the Saudis' main sovereign wealth fund, PIF, to advise on the sale of its majority stake in Saudi petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) to Aramco, sources have told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five industry groups representing major internet providers and cable companies filed suit on Thursday seeking to block a Vermont law barring companies that do not abide by net neutrality rules from receiving state contracts.
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Vermont by groups representing major providers like AT&T Inc (N:T), Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ). It followed a lawsuit by four of the groups earlier this month challenging a much broader California law mandating providers abide by net neutrality rules.
The trade associations are also challenging an executive order on the issue signed by Vermont Governor Phil Scott. Other states, including New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Montana and Hawaii, have adopted similar rules to bar state contracts from companies not complying with net neutrality protections.
Scott said he was disappointed the lawsuit was filed against the state ""for taking action to protect our citizens and our economy."" The Republican governor said he believed Vermont residents ""have a right to free and open access to information on the internet. In the absence of a national standard to protect that right, states must act.""
The Vermont lawsuit was filed by the American Cable Association; CTIA - The Wireless Association; NCTA - The Internet & Television Association; USTelecom - The Broadband Association and the New England Cable & Telecommunications Association.
The lawsuit argues that states cannot regulate “indirectly through their spending, procurement, or other commercial powers what they are forbidden from regulating directly.”
The U.S. Justice Department in late September filed its own lawsuit to block California's law set to take effect on Jan. 1. A federal judge has set a Nov. 28 hearing.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Communications commission voted 3-2 along party lines to reverse the 2015 net neutrality rules that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization.
The Trump administration rules were a win for internet providers but opposed by companies like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
The FCC in December handed ISPs sweeping powers to recast how Americans use the internet, as long as they disclose changes. The new rules took effect in June, but providers have made no changes.

The FCC said in repealing the Obama-era rules that it was pre-empting states from setting their own rules governing internet access. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told Reuters that arguments states could set their own net neutrality rules were ""completely baseless."" The FCC did not immediately comment on the Vermont suit.

Starting in 2019, the firm is offering to contribute 10 to 50 percent of the revenue top brokers produce in their final year to their post-retirement bonus, according to a memo Vince Lumia, Morgan Stanley wealth's head of field management, sent to staff. 
To earn the additional bonus in what the firm called its enhanced former adviser program, brokers must produce $2 million in fees or commissions annually and must agree not to work at another financial services for 90 days after they leave. 

The program, which was reported earlier in the day by the wealth management news website AdvisorHub, is optional and will be open to around 800 of Morgan Stanley's roughly 15,600 brokers.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 04:44PM ET</span>","Campbell, Third Point battle heats up, no concessions on the table","By Richa Naidu and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
CHICAGO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb and  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) hardened their positions in the battle over the soup maker's future on Thursday as the hedge fund manager tried to woo retail shareholders and the company's interim chief executive told Reuters that Loeb had left no room for compromise.
Campbell has been embroiled in a proxy fight since early September with Loeb's Third Point LLC, which wants to replace the entire board of the 149-year-old company, accusing it of mismanagement and destroying shareholder value. 
Keith McLoughlin, interim chief executive of the company, which has flatly rejected Third Point's arguments, told Reuters on Thursday that Third Point seemed uninterested in compromise. 
""Right now, I don't know exactly what we would talk about with Third Point if their position is either sell the entire company or replace the entire board,"" McLoughlin said in his first interview since Campbell announced a strategic review at the end of August.
""Those are two kind of dramatic actions; I'm not sure how to talk about that,"" said McLoughlin, a board member who took over after longtime CEO Denise Morrison stepped down abruptly in May. Third Point did not immediately respond to a request for comment after McLoughlin's interview. 
McLoughlin said he had not spoken with the New York-based hedge fund since Loeb unveiled plans to unseat the company's 12-person board in September.
""We're interested in engaging with all shareholders,"" McLoughlin said, adding that he had not heard from Loeb since Aug. 30. That is unusual, given that even in the bitterest proxy contests, there are often conversations between the activist and the target company.
Third Point, which had initially pushed for a sale or breakup of the company, owns about a 7 percent stake. Heirs of the Dorrance family, who have controlled the company for decades, sit on the board and some said on Wednesday that they will vote their 41 percent stake for the current board. 
George Strawbridge Jr., another heir who owns a 2.7 percent stake, is siding with Loeb. Retail investors, who own between 10 percent and 15 percent of shares, could be the deciding factor.
CALL FOR CHANGE
Third Point released a video on Thursday specifically aimed at persuading retail investors to back the $18 billion hedge fund at the Nov. 29 annual meeting.
The four-minute long video presents many of the arguments Third Point has made in mailings and on its website, set to a version of the familiar Campbell Soup jingle. Third Point says in the video that fixing the company will take more than just adding some salt or gluten-free noodles. It calls for changing the board - ""all of them"" - and says current directors have destroyed shareholder value. It said one dollar invested in Campbell 20 years ago would be worth $1.19 now while a dollar invested in the S&P 500 index (SPX) would be worth $4.06. Campbell, whose stock has lost about a third in value over the past two years, said in a separate statement that it has taken ""swift action"" and changed senior management, launched a now-completed strategic review and laid out a plan to spin off some businesses and cut costs. 
""We are focused on the core issues at hand,"" the company said, adding that Third Point's video lays out no plan and that the hedge fund is ""attempting to mislead Campbell shareholders.""

The credit-card issuer said quarterly card customer spending rose 10.3 percent in the United States and 5 percent in overseas markets during the three months ended Sept. 30.
Rising wages and a strong economy have fueled U.S. consumer spending, with consumer confidence last month reaching its highest level in 18 years.
Payments networks like AmEx and  Visa Inc  (N:V) earn fees from merchants every time a consumer swipes a card issued by them. They also make revenue from interest paid by customers on overdue spending.
American Express now expects 2018 adjusted earnings of between $7.30 and $7.40 per share, up from the previous $6.90 to $7.30 range.
AmEx said third-quarter net income climbed to $1.65 billion from $1.36 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, AmEx earned $1.88, compared with $1.51 in the prior-year quarter.
Analysts on average had expected $1.77 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, rose 9.2 percent to $10.14 billion, above analysts' estimates of $10.05 billion.

AmEx shares rose 1.6 percent to $104.50 in extended trading on Thursday.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Senator Warren urges Fed to require removal of Wells Fargo CEO,"By Pete Schroeder and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday the Federal Reserve should not allow  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) to grow in size until the bank replaces Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan.
In a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Warren said Sloan, a 30-year veteran of Wells, was ""deeply implicated"" in prior bank misconduct and it was untenable for him to remain at the bank as the Fed sought a drastic overhaul of its operations.
""The Wells Fargo Board of Directors cannot plausibly claim that it is 'ensuring senior management's ongoing effectiveness in managing the firm's activities' while retaining a CEO that helped oversee this much misconduct,"" she wrote.
The Fed took the unprecedented step of ordering the bank to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion in February, saying Wells Fargo had prioritized growth at the expense of proper compliance and risk management. The bank now must convince the Fed it has sufficiently overhauled its policies before it is permitted to grow.
Warren has called for Sloan's removal in the past, but she cannot compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step. Still, her letter indicated she was ramping up her efforts to oust Sloan, and it marks the latest challenge for the bank in Washington, where Wells Fargo has been working to move past its scandals and rebuild its reputation.
Wells Fargo is confident in the steps it has taken so far to satisfy the consent order and is engaged in constructive dialogue with the Fed, spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in response to questions about the letter.
A Fed spokesman said the agency had received the letter and would respond.
Sloan told analysts during a conference call on Friday that the bank continues to expect the asset cap to be lifted in the first half of next year.
Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.
Since Sloan took over as CEO in 2016, analysts and investors have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn around the bank. Wells's board has defended its pick, saying Sloan's deep knowledge of the bank was an asset. 
Most recently, the bank's chair, Betsy Duke, shot down rumors that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former  Goldman Sachs Group  (N:GS) executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn. 
""CEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered,"" she said in a statement at the time. 
Financial analysts do not expect Warren's letter to carry much weight with the Fed or with Wells Fargo's board, but the Fed has given in to Warren's pressure once before. In May, the Fed said it would hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on Wells Fargo, after being urged to do so by the Democratic senator. 

""I don't think that political pressure is going to sway the Fed either way,"" said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, noting that President Donald Trump's criticism of rising interest rates have not deterred the regulator from implementing more hikes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1.27%. The S&P 500 fell 1.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.06%.
Investor concerns over frothy tech-stock valuations drew a sharp selloff in shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google-Parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), deepening losses in the broader averages for the month.
Corporate earnings, though still in the early innings exacerbated the selloff as industrials slumped after several companies sounded the alarm bell on future profits, citing margins pressures owing to higher raw material and freight costs.
 Sealed Air  Corporation (NYSE:SEE) fell 8% after missed earnings estimates and slashed its profit outlook for the year. While Textron (NYSE:TXT) fell 11% after its quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share missed analysts' estimates of $0.76 a share.
Industrial heavyweight  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) fell about 4% after its earnings reports underlined the impact of a slowing Chinese economy in the wake of President Trump's tariffs.
U.S.-China trade relations were thrown into further disarray Thursday as National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow slammed China's ""unfair"" trade practices and conceded that little progress had been made on trade talks.
""China has not responded positively to any of our asks,"" said Kudlow said at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of US imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
Surging U.S. government bond United States 10-Year, meanwhile, which many have attributed for the recent selloff, gave up gains, lifting stocks from session lows.
The Federal Reserve's somewhat hawkish minutes released Wednesday, pointing to further increases in interest rates. Fed policymakers said that rates could even stretch beyond the neutral rate – one that neither holds back nor spurs economic growth.
In corporate news, Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) shares slumped after it said its newest ""Call of Duty"" game had opening weekend sales of $500 million, matching that of last year, but below analysts' estimates for modest improvement.
In economic news, strong labor market and manufacturing data did little lift sentiment on equities.
The Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index fell to a reading of 22.2 in October, below 22.9 last month but above economists' estimates for 19.7.

The plant in the city of Valencia stopped operations on Monday, union representative Carlos Rodriguez said in a telephone interview. Its cardboard provider, Ireland's  Smurfit Kappa  (I:SKG), halted production in Venezuela last month after government authorities took over its local unit.
Smurfit Kappa was one of the few remaining shipping materials manufacturers in the OPEC nation. Colgate is attempting to import cardboard from neighboring Colombia, Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez said the lack of cardboard prompted the company to push up vacations for the plant's 77 workers. He said a Colgate toothpaste plant was still operating, but had enough cardboard stock to cover only one more month of production. 
""If (the toothpaste plant) does not get the cardboard, its operations will also be suspended,"" Rodriguez said.
Colgate-Palmolive did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has five plants in Venezuela, including a soap factory that stopped operations more than a year ago.

Multinationals in Venezuela have drastically scaled back operations as the socialist government's currency controls have made obtaining raw materials difficult, and an economic collapse marked by spiraling hyperinflation has dented demand.

434,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>","Canadian Pot Will Lose Out to U.S. Brand Behemoths, Firms Say","(Bloomberg) -- Canada may have a head start in the global cannabis industry now that pot is legal, yet companies targeting the U.S. market say the advantage won’t last long once the American branding machine gets rolling.
“The Canadians have a first-mover advantage in large-scale production, large-scale farming, large-scale commodity input, but the U.S. has an edge in brands and the consumer experience,” Ben Kovler, chief executive officer of Chicago-based Green Thumb Industries Inc., said in an interview at a pot conference in Toronto. Americans are “not growing the hops or the barley, we’re making the beer; we’re not tomato farmers, we’re making Heinz ketchup.”
Canada legalized recreational pot on Wednesday and has taken the lead in many aspects of the industry. Since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level in the U.S., Canada’s stock exchanges and investment bankers have dominated business on both sides of the border. As a result, Canadian licensed producers such as Tilray Inc. boast a much bigger market value than their U.S. peers.
Canada won’t be able to maintain that lead for long, said Afzal Hasan, president and general counsel at CannaRoyalty Corp., an Ottawa-based company that invests in pot companies, often in exchange for a royalty on their revenue.
Not Reality
“The people that for whatever foolish reason thought Canada was going to dominate the world of cannabis, they need to disabuse themselves of that notion because it was never founded on any reality,” Hasan said in an interview.
CannaRoyalty trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange, but it’s largely focused on the California market, where marijuana has been legal for almost a year. It also has a strategic partnership with Canadian retailer 180 Smoke and intends to bring some of its 50-plus brands to Canada next year when vaping and edibles become legal.
Hasan, who’s from Nova Scotia, doesn’t pull any punches in explaining why Canada’s cannabis industry is at a disadvantage.
“There is literally no industry in the world that we have an advantage in,” he said. “‘Our most prolific companies, Nortel, BlackBerry, Bombardier -- we’re not good at running businesses, period, and it has to do with our culture. We’re not as aggressive and competitive and capitalistic as the folks down south.”
Canada has laid down very strict rules around branding, including requirements that packages have to be a single color, logos can’t be bigger than the mandatory health warning, and marketing can’t associate a product with glamour or fun.
Consumer brand awareness on the first day of legalization was “extremely low,” with more than 95 percent of consumers unaware of the brands they had just purchased, according to GMP analyst Martin Landry. The brokerage surveyed 100 consumers on Day 1. This “raises questions about the large sums of money spent by some LPs to launch their brands,” he wrote in a note.
That means U.S. brands have an opportunity to connect with their consumers in a way that Canadian licensed producers don’t, said Kovler.
“That gives us pricing protection, pricing power, shelter against the storm of price compression because you have an experience with the consumer,” Kovler said.

Porsche sold 196,562 vehicles during the first nine months of the year, with Europe showing a 9 percent increase and China, the world's largest car market, growing by 4 percent.
""In the light of these good numbers we expect that we can reach last year's record again,"" Blume said in e-mailed comments on Thursday.
Porsche delivered 246,375 vehicles in 2017.
Blume reiterated there are no plans to list Porsche AG on the stock market. To free up resources for new investments in electric cars for example, Porsche is opting for partnerships and leaner production and development processes.
""We develop many things digitally. The Panamera Sport Turismo was launched without building physical prototype vehicles,"" Blume said.
Porsche is also pooling resources with its sister brand Audi (DE:NSUG) to develop a premium electric car platform. The cooperation is still going strong, despite the stepping down of Audi's technical development chief Peter Mertens for health reasons last month.
""We are working with Audi more intensively than ever, the resignation of Mr. Mertens has not changed this,"" Blume said.
Porsche can cut its development costs by 30 percent by pooling resources with Audi on vehicle architectures, modules and components, he said.

""A good example of such synergies is our cooperation in the area of battery cells for our electric cars. Both of us, Porsche and Audi, source them from LG Chem (KS:051910), which has built up a plant for this in Poland.""

EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit Day next March will be published in the coming days.
The study is being led by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank with input from the European Commission and Britain's finance ministry.
Banks have called for regulators to take preventive action to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives contracts if there is a no-deal Brexit.
Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity, but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of derivatives is one area of concern that has emerged, but the private sector could take action to mitigate risks, such as shifting contracts from London to the EU before March.
Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
Dombrovskis said he would be following up on the central banks' initial findings to see if any regulatory action was needed by the EU.

""There is no cliff edge,"" Olivier Guersent, Dombrovskis' top civil servant added.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Jollibee Foods  (PS:JFC), a major Asian fast-food operator, hopes to generate half its sales outside its home market of the Philippines within five to seven years, up from 30 percent now, its chief executive told Reuters.
It also hopes to double its revenue in five years, as it expands its own chains and buys others, at a time when dealmaking in the restaurant sector is heating up as increasing competition and costs fuel consolidation. 
Earlier this year, Coca-Cola (N:KO) agreed to buy Costa Coffee and JAB Holdings bought Pret a Manger, which Jollibee also considered.
More recently, Restaurant Brands New Zealand (NZ:RBD) said it was in takeover talks, TGI Friday's UK went on the block and sources said Bojangles (O:BOJA) was exploring a possible sale.
""There are a lot of discussions going on, but only a few end up with final negotiations,"" CEO Ernesto Tanmantiong said in an interview on Thursday, ahead of the weekend opening of its first British Jollibee fried chicken restaurant in London. 
Tanmantiong said he was open to strategic acquisitions, adding the size didn't matter, as long as targets were fast-food or fast-casual restaurants, offered a superior product and had scope to scale up. 
The company, which has a market value of more than $5 billion, already has 4300 stores under 14 brands in 20 countries. It operates Burger King stores in the Philippines, Dunkin Donuts (O:DNKN) in China and Highlands Coffee in Vietnam and is the majority owner of Smashburger in the U.S. 
Growth in China and the United States is key, Tanmantiong said. ""We intend to replicate what we did in the Philippines by having multiple brands in China and the USA,"" he said.
The company last month entered into a venture with US chef Rick Bayless to build a Mexican chain. 
China already accounts for 10 percent of group sales, through Dunkin and its two local brands. There are currently no Jollibee restaurants in China, where rival KFC (N:YUMC) is very strong, but Tanmantiong sees its locations in Hong Kong and Macau as a gateway to the mainland. 
GROWING ORGANICALLY 
Over the next five years the Jollibee chain, which began as an ice cream parlor in Manila, will expand in Europe, the United States and Asia. 
A Manhattan Jollibee, New York City's second, will open later this month, followed by one in Malaysia by the end of the year and one in Indonesia by 2020.
Overall, Jollibee expects to have 50 stores in Europe over the next five years, half of them in Britain. 
""It has a big Filipino population and it has a big fried chicken market,"" Tanmantiong said. 
Jollibee has 41 stores in North America, the bulk of which are in the United States. Within five years, it expects this to balloon to 150 in the US and 100 in Canada. 

The company is planning a stock market listing next summer of its Vietnamese coffee business, but Tanmantiong said no other of its businesses were currently ripe for a listing.

440,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Why Main Street Should Worry About Wall Street's Bond Selloff,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The recent leg lower in the bond market has pushed mortgage rates to the highest since the start of the decade. The glass half full people might say that's not a problem since rates are less than half the levels seen during the bad old days of the 1980s when borrowing costs exceeded 10 percent. But that's not the way to think about the potential fallout from higher rates. The real issue is what current mortgage rates represent to the current generation of home buyers. And by that measure, the outlook is rather dire.
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average loan rate for a conforming 30-year mortgage was 5.10 percent in the week ended Oct. 12, the highest since early 2011. Back then, that level didn't hold for long, as rates crashed to 3.5 percent by late 2012 and held at those low levels for years. As recently as July 2016, the 30-year rate was at 3.6 percent. Starting points matter, especially now with home prices at nosebleed levels. According to Black Knight’s August Mortgage Monitor, the monthly payment on the average home has jumped by 16 percent since the start of the year. That's up from a 3 percent increase in 2017, illustrating the effect of rising rates on affordability.
The potential for rising rates to inflict damage on household finances has grown in the era of extraordinarily easy monetary policy. Yes, mortgage lending standards were tightened after the housing bubble burst in the financial crisis, but record low rates have nevertheless allowed buyers to afford pricier homes and homeowners to refinance to improve their cash flow via lower payments in order to augment stagnant income growth. But that was then. Refinancing activity is off by a third compared with last year, an effective drag on households.
Twice a month, the University of Michigan reports its Consumer Sentiment Index. In the preliminary October report, reported buying conditions for autos and homes fell. The last time both of these gauges were as low as they are today was the early 1980s as the economy was emerging from a grueling recession. If history is any guide, a sustained level of higher rates is the second nail in the coffin for housing followed by an upward turn in the unemployment rate and recession. We’re well on our way to the second stage.
Determined homebuyers are increasingly turning to adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, which have low initial rates that adjust either higher or lower after some period depending on prevailing rates at the time. Currently, the average 5-year ARM charges a rate of 4.34 percent. As per the Mortgage Bankers Association, ARMs comprised 7.1 percent of new applications in the latest week, the most in a year.
To be clear, demand for ARMs is a shadow of what it was during the last boom when underqualified buyers did whatever it took to get into overpriced homes and lenders were happy to accommodate. At the apex of the housing bubble, ARMs were over half of mortgage activity. The drivers of ARM usage, however, have not changed. It’s still all about price. The average ARM today is $661,000, which are clearly being used to finance high-end homes. And just like when the last housing bubble burst, the risk is that ARMs taken out in recent years will reset at higher rates, leading to defaults and weighing on housing prices.
And don't forget that well-heeled home buyers are also likely to have a high concentration of stock market holdings. And given that eight of the top 10 markets with the largest monthly declines in home prices in July as measured by Black Knight were on the tech-heavy West coast, a month when technology stocks were headed to record highs, it's not hard to imagine how fast home prices will fall once the air comes out of the tech bubble.
Black Knight highlighted San Jose in its latest report. The average home price in San Jose fell 1.4 percent in July, a sharper decline than any other market and the steepest drop for any month in any of the top 100 markets since the housing recovery began. Prices are down by 2 percent since May following a cumulative rise of 35 percent over the prior 20 months. Black Knight notes that ""71 of the largest markets nationwide have seen the rate of home price appreciation slow in recent months.”
How bad things get may depend on supply. The housing market has been marked by low inventories placing ever greater upward pressure on home prices. There are two root causes. The first is that both small and institutional investors have scooped excess supply to flip or rent homes. And the second is the millions of owners who were able to hold onto their homes by modifying their mortgages through a government program through 2016. But after five years, their 2 percent interest-only payment period ends. At that point their loans will fully amortize and the mortgage rate will rise by one percentage point per year for five years. The payment shock will be enormous and could lead to an exorbitant number of homes being dumped on the market.
Two announcements in recent weeks suggest lenders have grown wise to the building risks. Home builder  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN). put Rialto Capital, its real estate lending group, up for sale. And  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said it will rein in the expansion of Marcus, its direct lending to consumers arm.
The outlook for households, and by extension the economy, is on shaky ground. Many households simply cannot weather a rising rate environment."

PARIS (Reuters) - French tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) cut its full-year market forecasts on Thursday and said a sales slowdown would worsen in the fourth quarter, blaming weaker Chinese vehicle demand and new emissions standards that have hit European registrations.
Michelin's own sales volumes are now expected to show only a ""slight increase"" for 2018, the company said. It had previously pledged to increase sales in line with more robust market growth expectations, in guidance reiterated on Sept. 13.
The fallout from slowing car- and truck-tyre demand in China and a European auto registrations slump linked to tougher new emissions tests has proven worse than expected, Chief Finance Officer Marc Henry told reporters on a call. 
""All of these markets are going to be in decline by comparison with the forecasts we had made,"" he said.
The company posted a 5.2 percent increase in third-quarter revenue to 5.62 billion euros ($6.44 billion) as it reported sales four days earlier than planned.
But tire sales to carmakers fell 5 percent in China and Western Europe - where the tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) has led to model approval delays and withdrawals.
Michelin, which had earlier pledged to increase 2018 recurring operating profit, said its growth would amount to at least 200 million euros before exchange-rate effects.
But it slashed 2018 market growth forecasts to 0.5 percent for car tires, instead of the previously forecast 1.5 percent; and to a 1.5 percent decline in truck tires rather than a 0.5 percent expansion.
Truck tire demand is expected to shrink by 5-6 percent in the fourth quarter, Henry said, without giving any explanation for the earlier-than-scheduled results publication.

The company nevertheless reiterated its 2018 target of 1.1 billion euros in positive structural free cash flow goal.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Column: Loans could drain U.S. retirement plans by $2.5 trillion,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Americans could dig a $2.5 trillion hole in the country's retirement system as they fail to pay back loans taken from workplace retirement plans over the next 10 years, according to a new study from Deloitte Consulting.  
The problem is called “leakage” - borrowing from a 401(k) plan without repaying the money or paying it back so slowly that it disrupts growth. 
About 40 percent of people borrow from workplace plans. Most repay their loans within five years with interest, which is a typical requirement. But academic studies have found that about 10 percent default; often when laid off, which recalls the loan immediately. If you cannot repay the balance in cash, it counts as an early withdrawal, subject to taxes and penalties. 
An additional problem is that two-thirds of people cope with that payback issue by pulling out the entire balance from their 401(k)s, according to Deloitte. 
The result for a typical 42-year-old borrower, taking out a $7,000 loan from a $70,000 account: $300,000 less at retirement age than they would have had if they had never touched the money and investments gained 6 percent a year.
“People absolutely do not realize the consequences,” said Deloitte senior manager Gursharan Jhuty.    
FIX NEEDED
The financial industry has done little to plug the leaks. Instead, the focus of employers, fund companies and 401(k) administrators has been on getting people to save more. During the first half of this year about 55 million Americans had 401(K) accounts with a total of $5.3 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Loans are available in about 90 percent of plans because research indicates that people are more comfortable saving when they know they can withdraw money in a pinch. 
People with incomes below $30,000 account for 22 percent of the borrowing, with 10 percent by people earning over $100,000, according to Vanguard. People borrow to deal with emergencies such as medical expenses or try to get rid of the pressures of other loans such as high-cost credit card debt. They also pull money to buy or renovate homes or for college tuition. 
Here are some strategies experts think could help stop the drain: 
1. BORROW ONCE
Companies often require that employees have no more than one loan outstanding at a time, but Deloitte suggested they might also limit employees to an ongoing limit on loans.
Financial planners such as Charles Adi of Houston, Texas said he was comfortable with a single loan to pay off high credit card debt if the person does not add debt again and keeps saving. “I have them cut up their credit cards in my office,” he said. 
It is also crucial before borrowing to examine whether a job is secure or whether there is another source of funds that could be used to pay back the loan if a layoff occurs.
2. LIMIT USE
Using a 401(k) loan for a home downpayment or maintenance can make sense provided jobs are secure, said White Plains New York financial planner Byrke Sestok. Yet, he and others discourage the use for college: “I tell them to have their child consider a less expensive school.”
3. SOLVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
Increasingly, companies are offering employees financial wellness programs to help with debt management and budgeting – practices that could keep them out of a financial bind in the first place if they use the advice.
In addition, Deloitte suggested employers require employees to get counseling before taking loans so they understand the impact of a lost job or the damage the loans could do to their retirement.
But counseling often comes too late, noted Kelley Long, a Financial Finesse financial planner who takes hotline calls from employees required to talk to advisers before pulling money from the 401(k). 
At the point that people call in to a financial services company to discuss the loan terms, “it’s too late to fix the problem that led to the loan,” Long said.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",U.S. midterms a mere blip on equity options traders' radar,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than a month before the U.S. congressional elections, data suggests equity options traders do not view the election as a big catalyst for setting the direction of U.S. stock market in the immediate aftermath of the vote results.
Political control of the U.S. Congress will be up for grabs on November 6 and should Democrats take the U.S. House of Representatives away from Republicans it could hinder President Donald Trump's political agenda.
""We are not seeing market participants hedge for midterms or discuss it explicitly,"" said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, adding that election uncertainty is discussed, even if it isn't translated into trades.
If Democrats win the House or Senate next month, nearly every aspect of Donald Trump's presidency could face swift examination – from his long-elusive tax returns to possible business ties with Russia and conflicts of interest, congressional sources say. 
Such potential change has increased talk of policy adjustments or whether Democrats would try to remove Trump from office.
""If investors actually believed that, there should be a meaningful volatility premium,"" said Andrew Scott, head of flow strategy & solutions at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York.
""And there isn't.""
The shape of the volatility term structure, calculated from prices of options with different expirations, and reflects the market's expectation of future stock gyrations, suggests investors are not overly concerned, Scott added.
SANGUINE STOCK INVESTORS
Despite the stock market's sharp swings in recent days, as investors fretted over rising interest rates and braced for increased trade-related tensions, U.S. equity price gyrations are more muted than they were ahead of midterms over the last three decades.
One-month volatility for the S&P 500, a measure of the magnitude of daily price swings for the stocks in the benchmark index, is at about 17. For the last eight midterm elections this measure has averaged 20, according to Refinitiv data. Except for the pop in market volatility in the last week, the measure was actually the lowest it has been in the last three decades at this point in the election cycle.
(For graphic on U.S. midterms and historical volatility for U.S. stocks, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2J40cKT)
Even if there is a knee-jerk reaction to the election outcome, analysts expect U.S. stocks to continue trending higher. The S&P 500 has been up 14.5 percent on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946, according to an analysis by LPL Research.
""I think clearly what happens in the elections will be important in terms of giving us some clues to what happens in 2020,"" said Societe Generale's Scott.
""But it is unlikely to derail the rally in stocks in the near-term,"" he said.
The recent pullback in stocks, which has spurred a healthy pick-up in hedging demand, has also left investors better positioned to weather any fleeting knock to stocks should one materialize, analysts said.
Even though it might not necessarily have been about election nerves, investors have sold riskier assets in recent days.

The sell-off boosted the one-month skew on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) options, a measure of investor sentiment toward downside risk, to about the second-highest it's been all year since the February market rout, said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.

NHTSA will investigate to determine if the issue poses an unreasonable risk to safety and whether the agency should seek a recall.
In October 2017, Ford issued a technical service bulletin addressing the issue, and found water intrusion in the wire harness as the root cause of tailgate problems, NHTSA said.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","Sales growth accelerates at retailer Casino in third quarter, keeps goals","PARIS (Reuters) - French retailer  Casino  (PA:CASP), which is battling investor concern over its high debt, said that sales growth accelerated in the third quarter, reflecting an improving performance in its core French market and in Brazil.
Casino - which is more than halfway on its way to reaching its goal of selling 1.5 billion euros ($1.72 billion) of assets by early 2019 to help cut debts - said it was maintaining all its annual financial objectives.
Casino's credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor's in March 2016, and the firm is under pressure to show it can revive profits in France while conditions in Brazil stay tough.
The company, which controls Brazil's top retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar (SA:PCAR4), said third-quarter group sales reached 8.922 billion euros, in line with the 8.9 billion euros average in a consensus of analysts' forecasts compiled by the company. 
Stripping out acquisitions, currency effects and revenue on fuel, sales rose 5.4 percent, against 5.2 percent growth in the second quarter.

The stock is down by nearly 20 percent so far in 2018, partly on concerns over Casino's balance sheet and parent group Rallye's (PA:GENC) ability to refinance its debt.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock fell about 7.4% at 11:35 AM ET (15:35 GMT) after reporting sales numbers for the first three days of release of “Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.”
The stock was the biggest loser in the S&P Communication Services index, which was down about 1.3%.
Activision reported three-day sell-through of $500 million for the latest title in the popular franchise, with player count and hours played rising year over year.
But with the price at $59.99, that would mean unit sales of 8.33 million, which was lower than some analyst estimates of about 10 million units, Briefing.com reported.
Activision’s weakness bled into the stocks of competitors, as investors wondered what other big-name releases might face less than a blockbuster reception.

WALLDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Faster than expected growth in its cloud business has pressured margins at German business software company SAP (DE:SAPG), but for Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic that's a good problem to have.
Operating margins expanded by only 10 basis points in the third quarter, SAP said on Thursday, disappointing some investors and sending shares in Europe's most valuable tech firm down by more than 5 percent by 1355 GMT.
That reflects the relative outperformance of new services hosted on remote servers, which have required heavy investment, over SAP's more profitable legacy software license business, Mucic told Reuters in an interview. He added that the best answer to that challenge was to focus on growth and efficiency.
""In the long term, the cloud is the healthier business model because it is easier to plan, because it has a higher total lifetime value,"" he said in an interview at SAP's headquarters in Walldorf.
""I am very happy with this development and would never try to hold back the cloud business to optimize our margins in the short-term.""
SAP raised its outlook for revenues and profits this year after reporting a 41 percent jump in cloud revenues in the third quarter. 
MARGIN PROGRESSION
Non-IFRS operating margins, at constant currencies, were 29.4 percent in the third quarter. At a capital markets day in March the company forecast they would expand to 30.7 percent in 2020, the time horizon for its mid-term strategy. [nL5N1QO786]
Mucic confirmed that capex would likely peak this year at around 1.6 billion euros ($1.84 billion) as SAP partners with 'hyperscale' cloud providers like Microsoft (O:MSFT) Azure or Amazon Web Services (O:AMZN) for hosting.
""Next year there will be a big positive step-change regarding efficiency in the cloud because we are about to complete a multi-year process to shift significant cloud assets onto our own database technology,"" he said.
Total savings from the migration would run to the low-triple-digit millions of euros, Mucic said, confirming existing guidance to analysts.
The company is also 'long' data centers in the United States following recent acquisitions, and will save money by consolidating their infrastructure at a site in Colorado, Mucic added. 
SAP plans to unveil a new mid-term strategy at its next capital markets day in February in New York. Mucic said it would probably have a time horizon through to 2023.

""You can be sure to see plenty of optimism from SAP,"" he said, declining to go into detail.

Alsea already franchises more than 900 Starbucks stores in Latin America.
U.S. restaurant chains typically seek to cut overhead costs by franchising their store operations to third parties instead of operating them themselves. 
Starbucks' move also comes at a time when it is facing increasing competition on its home turf. The company is undergoing an organizational restructuring, including cutting jobs and trimming other costs. 
For the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, the coffee chain said it plans to restructure its back-office support functions, close a support center in Amsterdam and keep a coffee roasting facility in the Netherlands.
Starbucks said it has built more than 260 stores, employing over 3,100 people in the four European markets between 2008 and 2016.
After the deal closes, Alsea would expand its ties with Starbucks outside of Latin America to Europe and would partner with the chain in nine markets globally.

Alsea also operates other international chains, including Domino's Pizza (N:DPZ) and Restaurant Brands' (TO:QSR) Burger King.

At 9:54 AM ET (13:54 GMT), the yield was at 2.907%, its highest level since June 23, 2008 when it touched 2.951%.
While the minutes showed that policymakers had some doubts about the future path of the economy, they were united in their September decision to increase by a quarter-point and anticipated continuing with plans to gradually increase interest rates with one more this year and perhaps an additional three in 2019.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court denied a request this month by Monsanto's local unit to suspend licensing of its popular Intacta soy seed technology to privately-owned seed maker Sementes Talismã, according to a ruling seen by Reuters.
 Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) sought to suspend the licensing of the genetically modified seed technology after Talismã filed for bankruptcy protection in January, one of the seed maker's lawyers, Daniel Amaral of DASA Advogados in São Paulo, said.
""Monsanto sought to end the licensing contract to try and negotiate better terms in Talismã's ongoing financial restructuring,"" Amaral said. 
Press representatives for Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), which bought Monsanto in a $66 billion deal, said like various other creditors in Talismã's proceedings it is taking ""the applicable legal measures to secure its rights."" 
Amaral said remaining a licensee of Monsanto's Intacta technology is crucial for Talismã as it seeks to reorganize the business and restructure about 180 million reais ($49 million) of debt.
The appeals court decision, handed down in the state of Goiás on Oct. 11, sets a precedent for any Brazilian seed company in financial distress that chooses to repay overdue royalties under court supervision, Amaral said.
In July, a Brazilian judge ordered local units of Monsanto to deposit in an escrow account royalties related to its Intacta RR2 Pro technology pending the outcome of litigation over a patent dispute between the firm and Brazilian soy growers. 
Talismã is still in the process of negotiating new terms for repaying all its debt obligations, Amaral said. Monsanto is Talismã's single largest unsecured creditor and is owed 40 million reais, he said.
Amaral said Goiás-based Talismã is up to date on royalty payments to Monsanto due after the bankruptcy filing, and has yet to negotiate terms of pre-filing obligations.
So far this year Talismã has paid about 8 million reais in royalties to Monsanto.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 09:26AM ET</span>",Ericsson tops third-quarter forecasts as savings and 5G sales kick in,"By Helena Soderpalm and Olof Swahnberg
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Mobile telecom equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) beat third-quarter operating profit forecasts on Thursday, boosted by sales of next-generation 5G gear in North America, and said it was making solid progress toward its long-term financial goals. 
Marking its third consecutive quarter of substantial progress toward its 2020 financial targets, the company reported net sales rose 9 percent to 53.8 billion Swedish crowns ($6 billion) thanks to strong growth in its networks business. 
That was led by early 5G sales in North America and 4G upgrades in Europe and Latin America, and helped to drive its shares 5 percent higher in early Thursday trading. 
However, finance chief Carl Mellander told Reuters that, as a result of this strong performance, fourth quarter sales growth would be ""a few percentage points lower"" than typical 17-18 percent growth versus the third quarter, adding North American network sales would be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter.
Ericsson has pledged to deliver a gross margin of 37-39 percent by 2020. It nearly got there in the third quarter, reaching a figure of 36.9 percent, excluding restructuring charges, topping analysts' forecast of 36.2 percent.
The quarterly operating margin rose to 6.0 percent from a negative 7.4 percent a year ago. Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said he was confident Ericsson could produce an operating margin of at least 12 percent beyond 2020.
""There is strong momentum in the global 5G market with lead markets moving forward,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said in a statement. ""More work remains, however, to get all parts of the business to a satisfactory performance level. 
MORE TO DO
Ericsson has responded to an industry-wide downturn and heavy losses since 4G network sales peaked in the middle of the decade with a strategy to focus on profitability over growth, replacing most of its management and making sweeping cost cuts.
Operating profit for the latest quarter swung to 3.2 billion crowns ($356.5 million) from a 3.7 billion loss in the same period last year, outpacing a mean forecast for an 800 million crown profit in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Shares in Ericsson have risen nearly 50 percent this year, buoyed by the progress toward its financial targets after three years of steep revenue declines.
Ericsson now sits on the cusp of a potential new cycle of network upgrades as demand for 5G gear has started to kick in in the United States and is expected to be followed by upgrades in North Asian markets in early 2019.
Net sales in North America, Ericsson's biggest regional market, rose 10 percent in currency-adjusted terms, while Europe rose 4 percent, offsetting weakness in its Middle East and North Asian markets.
However, the company said it continued to invest heavily in 5G research and development, closely manage underperforming services businesses while keeping a tight rein on costs after completing a restructuring plan that will results in 5-7 billion crowns of restructuring charges this year. 
As a result, many investors want to see more proof of progress before betting on a sustained 5G recovery. Ten out of 15 analysts polled by Reuters rate the stock as ""neutral"" in terms of share price appreciation. 

Once the world's biggest supplier of mobile communications gear, Ericsson is facing falling spending by telecom operators, weakness in formerly fast-growing emerging markets and stiff competition from bigger rivals Huawei [HWT.UL] of China and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) of Finland.

LONDON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International (N:PM), maker of Marlboro cigarettes among others, reported higher than expected quarterly sales and profit on Thursday, helped by its IQOS tobacco-heating device.
Philip Morris is pinning its hopes for the future on IQOS, which heats tobacco instead of burning it, thereby producing a vapor instead of smoke. It says this is less dangerous than smoking. 
The company reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.44, ahead of $1.27 in the same period last year and analysts' average estimate of $1.28, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
Net revenue was $7.5 billion, up 0.4 percent, held back by currency fluctuations. Analysts had expected $7.17 billion.
Sales were helped by market share gains and pricing increases, the company said. 
Philip Morris stood by its 2018 forecast for diluted earnings per share of between $4.97 and $5.02 at prevailing exchange rates. Excluding currency fluctuations, it said its forecast represented growth in adjusted earnings of 8-9 percent. 
The company cut its full-year forecast twice already this year, citing currency fluctuations and slower IQOS sales.
Total volume of cigarette and heated tobacco units was 203.7 billion, down 2.1 percent. Excluding the impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, volume was up 1.1 percent, the company said.
The company said distributors in Japan reduced inventories of existing IQOS products ahead of the launch of new models of the device, which heats up small tobacco sticks.

Nonetheless, the company said worldwide sales of its heated tobacco units was set to almost double this year, and it continued to expect shipments of 41 billion to 42 billion units.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Primark, the fashion chain owned by Associated British Foods (L:ABF), has emphasized its commitment to environmental standards and safer working conditions as it fights for market share in discount-loving Germany and other countries. 
The company's low prices came under scrutiny in 2013 after 1,129 people died in the collapse of a factory in Bangladesh, where clothes were made for brands including Primark.
That prompted it to ramp up efforts to police its suppliers, building up a team of over 100 people who focus on ethical trade and environmental and sustainability issues.
""Germany is the homeland of Aldi and Lidl so German customers appreciate low prices, good quality,"" said Wolfgang Krogmann, head of Primark in Germany, as the chain opened its 28th store in the country in west Berlin. 
""They understand that kind of model. That is definitely in our favor."" 
German shoppers are also more demanding when it comes to ethical standards, Krogmann said, prompting the company to trial ""Primark Cares"" posters in its stores in the country, with information about its factories and how it sources raw materials.
Germany is a key growth market for Primark, which is expanding across continental Europe and the United States after nearing saturation point in Britain and Ireland. It expects to open two more stores in Germany in the current financial year, after five in the 2017/18 fiscal year.
But it is locked in a battle with rival discount retailer H&M (ST:HMb), successfully drawing customers away from the Swedish company's 458 German stores. H&M saw sales steadily decline in Germany, its biggest market, in the last two years until a rebound in its latest quarter.[nL8N1WD159]
H&M is another major brand putting a bigger emphasis on sustainability. It, Primark and other retailers are seeking to promote recycling and more environmentally-friendly cotton farming methods in response to customer concerns. 
""We don't want to give the impression that we've got everything right...We're on a gradual journey,"" said Katharine Stewart, Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability.
Primark, which has 360 stores globally, will roll out more products next spring made from cotton planted under its sustainable farming program in Pakistan, including children's pyjamas and women's jeans.
""We now know it works. We know we can ... get visibility all the way through the supply chain,"" Stewart said. 

Primark has slightly slowed its pace of expansion in the last year as like-for-like sales have declined, but it still plans to open 14 new stores in the 2018/19 financial year, with most in Germany, France, Spain and Britain.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc), two of the world's biggest consumer goods makers, both reported a pick-up in quarterly sales on Thursday after getting higher prices for their products. 
The increased cost of oil, as well as a strengthening of the US dollar, in which many commodities are priced, has given makers of food and toiletries greater scope to push through price rises in an inflationary environment.
This is a change from earlier this year, when pricing was steady and the likes of Unilever and Nestle had to rely almost entirely on selling more goods to drive revenue growth. 
Unilever -- the Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap which dropped plans to move to the Netherlands this month after British investors rebelled - said it expects more price rises to come through in the fourth quarter, which could weigh on demand.
""We do think that with the higher levels of pricing that are going to be required we will see a rebalancing toward more price and a little less volume going forward,"" Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly told analysts.
Consumer goods companies need to carefully balance prices and demand, ensuring that customers remain loyal to their brands and don't defect to cheaper or own-label supermarket products. 
For the full year, Unilever's sales growth is likely to come towards the bottom end of its 3 to 5 percent target range, Pitkethly said, adding it could be a bit higher than the most pessimistic forecasts.
Nestle stood by its full-year forecast for sales up 3 percent, after third-quarter sales accelerated, helped by higher pricing. But its results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, were largely overshadowed by news that Wan Ling Martello, its Asia chief, was leaving. 
Nestle shares were up 0.3 percent in morning trade, while Unilever shares were down 1.3 percent. 
Unilever did not give an update on its latest thinking about simplifying its dual-headed structure after it abandoned its plans in the face of an investor backlash. 
MARKET BY MARKET
Nestle, the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee, said third-quarter sales rose 2.9 percent in the third quarter, up from 2.6 percent in the second. That included a 0.9 percent boost from pricing increases, up from 0.2 percent in the second and first quarters. 
Nestle has warned about higher freight and packaging costs, whereas Unilever noted crude oil, chemicals and the impact of the strengthening US dollar.
Unilever reported a 3.8 percent rise in third-quarter sales, excluding steep price increases in Argentina to offset soaring inflation there. Including Argentina, sales would have been up 4.5 percent, which was ahead of analysts' forecasts for 4.3 percent. 
Unilever got a 1.4 percent lift from pricing, up from 0.2 percent in the first half.
U.S. rival Procter & Gamble is due to report its latest quarterly figures on Friday. 
Unilever's Pitkethly said pricing decisions were taken market by market, and that Unilever has products at various price points to satisfy people who need to trade down to cheaper brands as prices rise.
Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood said Unilever's growth was higher than Nestle and  Danone  (PA:DANO), which reported on Wednesday.

""This more balanced growth was pleasing and the acceleration in pricing may diminish worries from some investors about pricing power,"" he said in a research note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), the world's largest manager of alternative assets, modestly exceeded analyst expectations with an 11 percent jump in third-quarter earnings on Thursday, as climbing equity markets buoyed its holdings. 
The New York-based firm's economic net income ( ENI  (MI:ENI)) per unit for the three months through September was 76 cents, compared to the mean forecast for 74 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year earlier, Blackstone reported ENI per share of 68 cents.
ENI reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on Blackstone's portfolio and is a closely watched earnings metric for U.S. private equity firms.
In premarket trading, Blackstone shares were flat. 
Stock market swings often impact the valuation of private equity firms' holdings because they mark many of their holdings to market. The benchmark S&P 500 index (SXP) rose 7.2 percent in the third quarter. 
Blackstone also benefited from a 19.9 percent appreciation of Gates Industrial Corporation (N:GTES), in which it still holds a majority stake. 
""Assets under management increased 18 percent versus the prior year, bringing the total to a new record of $457 billion,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Schwarzman said in a statement.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Lack of Italy debt contagion explodes notion of euro periphery,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The striking lack of financial contagion across the euro zone from Italy's bond-market blowout this year shows investors are breaking an eight-year habit of lumping together the bonds of Italy, Spain and Portugal. 
In an apparent vindication of European Central Bank efforts to reduce spillover across the bloc each time one of the southern European economies gets into trouble, the market has so far treated the Italian budget dispute as a domestic storm. 
For years after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis, Italy, Spain and Portugal - collectively referred to as the ""periphery"" by bond investors - saw their bonds track each other. 
Anything that risked a repeat of the euro zone's existential angst six years ago tarred all the weaker credits with the same brush. 
(Spain, Portugal stay strong during latest Italy selloff: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OwpuqP)
Yet six years after ECB chief Mario Draghi pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro zone, the correlation is fading. 
An uproar over Italy's budget deficit and risks of a clash between Rome and European Union authorities have barely touched Portuguese and Spanish debt. Such has been the divergence that the premium demanded by investors to hold Italian risk over Spain's hit its widest in over 20 years.
""We are very close to record low levels in terms of correlation between peripheral countries, and it's very clear that from the market perspective for the first time in a while a major euro zone bond market incident is not being seen as a threat to the euro system,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, a global strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. 
One reason is that the budget concerns are so far confined to Italy. But idiosyncratic risks have in the past spread across southern European bond markets too -- one example being the approach to the Catalan independence referendum last year. 
Confidence is higher this time that the Italian debt problem will not threaten the country's euro membership. The country's anti-establishment coalition government has been at pains to stress it has no interest in exiting the zone. 
Contagion would return only if the euro's future is in danger, said Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. 
Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said the fund he oversees has been buying Spanish government debt through the recent Italian ruckus. 
""If you're a fund manager and you don't want to own Italy, Spain and Portugal are the only realistic alternatives,"" he told Reuters. 
""Spain has been the poster child for European growth in recent years - if you think about 2012, where unemployment rates were, how strong concerns were over the banking system in the periphery, we are in a very different place now,"" he said. 
(Spain, Italy bond yield correlation dips since May selloff: https://tmsnrt.rs/2J3cRxC)
Spain has led the euro zone economic recovery in 2016 and 2017, growing more than 3 percent a year and earning multiple credit ratings upgrades to Baa1 from Moody's and A- from both S&P Global and Fitch.
Portugal, not long ago rated junk by all three major agencies, last week was restored to full investment-grade status after a Moody's upgrade. Its economy grew 2.7 percent in 2017, outperforming the euro zone.
Both countries have benefited from their share of the ECB's 2.6 trillion-euro ($3 trillion) stimulus program.
But even countries partly or fully outside the ECB program have felt its effect. Cyprus recorded stellar growth of 3.9 percent last year and Greece exited its bailout program in August. 
This week, Greece said it achieved a primary budget surplus well above target for the year so far. 
(Italy-Spain spread hits widest in 20 years:https://tmsnrt.rs/2Oqh0Sa )
""The type of investors invested in Spain and Portugal is not the same as it was before,"" said BBVA (MC:BBVA) rates trading strategist Jaime Costero Denche. ""We have seen new investors such as Scandinavian accounts and Middle East and Asian investors who didn't want to buy peripheral debt in the past."" 
A major factor limiting contagion from Italy is that Portuguese and Spanish banks are in better shape, thanks to authorities' success in tackling bad loans -- a road Italy embarked on only recently.
(https://tmsnrt.rs/2Oqh0Sa:https://tmsnrt.rs/2OstLLP )
Portuguese banks have mostly returned to profit. In June, Moody's lifted its outlook for Spain's banking system to positive. It cited robust economic growth and improved asset quality after disposals of troubled assets.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a one-week high on Thursday and stocks were mixed after minutes showing the Federal Reserve may favor more rate hikes next year.
S&P 500 futures pointed to a softer open after a flat session on Wednesday, while stocks in Europe resisted earlier declines in Asia to rise on the back of strong earnings.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to as high as 3.21 percent after minutes showed Fed officials appeared to favor an eventual move in rates above the level they see as neutral for the U.S. economy. 
China's stock markets were hit hard in a gloomy session for Asian equities. The yuan fell to a two-month low as the U.S. Treasury refrained from naming China a currency manipulator, while at the same time increasing scrutiny of Beijing's exchange-rate policy. 
China's premier warned of risks to the economy from an escalating tariff war with the United States.
European shares, though, largely shrugged off the disappointment in Asia. Frankfurt's DAX and Paris's CAC both rose 0.3 percent and London's FTSE traded 0.1 percent lower. A pan-European equity index rose 0.6 percent.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed that borrowing costs were set to rise further.
That reinforces expectations that U.S. yields will rise further despite President Donald Trump's view that the Fed is tightening too much. 
""Corporates have done incredibly well but it's clear we are going into monetary tightening in the U.S. and that makes people worried about global debt having gone up so much in recent years,"" said Peter Lowman, CIO at Investment Quorum, a UK wealth manager. 
At a time of simmering trade war tensions, ""people are perhaps taking chips off (the) table and maybe going into cash and short-dated bonds,"" he said. 
Overall, third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen growing 21.8 percent, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv.
The greenback held on to gains on Thursday. Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar rose for a third consecutive day, trading broadly flat at 95.517. That checked emerging-market gains.
""The last thing emerging markets, or the U.S. yield curve or equities, want is a reminder that U.S. rates are going to keep going up,"" Rabobank analysts told clients in a note. 
The euro changed hands at $1.1518, holding steady versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on Wednesday. The euro has lost just under 3 percent of its value versus the dollar over the last three weeks.
Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S. government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China as a currency manipulator.
In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China's yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, and U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency's value.
""The U.S. refrained from labeling China a currency manipulator, but dialed up the rhetoric against its currency practices,"" said Sue Trinh, Head of Asia FX Strategy, RBC Capital Markets. 
The yuan fell 0.2 percent to 6.9443 per dollar in offshore trade. That is the weakest level since a 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in August.
STERLING SUPPORTED
In Europe, an EU leaders' summit with British Prime Minister Theresa May yielded little obvious progress on a Brexit deal being negotiated between Britain and the bloc.
Sterling did, however, turn positive on Thursday after May confirmed she was open to discussing an extension of the transition period after Brexit.
Oil steadied on Thursday as support from ongoing tensions over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist offset a big drop overnight due to a jump in U.S. crude stockpiles.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery was up 1 cent at $69.56 a barrel by 0840 GMT, after falling 3 percent in the previous session to settle below $70 for the first time in a month.

505,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Khashoggi Saga Deepens Enigma of Saudi Arabia `Black-Box' Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- A slump in stocks followed by an unexplained rebound. A bond market that appeared to be driven by an entirely different narrative. And at the end of it all, a gauge of volatility at its highest in almost three years.
By any measure, the past few days in Saudi Arabia’s markets have been a wild ride, as the unfolding drama surrounding the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi drove prices this way and that.
But far from being unusual, the swings have merely served to underline an inescapable fact about the kingdom’s markets -- that it’s hard to know what determines price movements at the best of times.
“It’s difficult to invest money in a black box,” said Ekaterina Iliouchenko, a Frankfurt-based money manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH. Saudi Arabia’s “openness to the investor community is a problem,” she said.
That lack of transparency is under mounting scrutiny because the kingdom -- home to the $485 billion Tadawul stock market, the region’s biggest -- has sought for the past three years to make itself more accessible and open to foreign investors. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to wean the kingdom off revenue from crude and attract more foreign investors, a key element of which is the planned sale of a stake in Saudi Aramco, the national oil company.
Some fund managers say accessing information about Saudi stocks or companies isn’t easy, sometimes near impossible. Not only are some company announcements just in Arabic, executives aren’t used to the level of scrutiny demanded by global funds.
“I can call a Russian company’s investor-relations department and get an answer within a couple of hours,” Iliouchenko said, adding that she failed to find a plausible explanation for the sudden drop in share prices a month ago. “In Saudi, it’s even hard to get quarterly results in English,” and coverage from the sell-side is limited, or the quality “not great,” she said.
There’s Progress
That’s not to say Saudi Arabia’s bourse isn’t working to align itself with international standards. Since 2015, it allowed investors abroad to trade stocks directly, introduced new corporate-governance rules and adopted global accounting standards, among other measures. While foreigners currently own only about 5 percent of the nation’s equity market, MSCI Inc.’s decision in June to include the nation’s stocks in its emerging-market index next year was a recognition of the exchange’s progress.
“It’s less about the level of transparency and more about whether it’s moving in the right direction, and Saudi Arabia has made progress in that direction,” said Michael Bolliger, the Zurich-based head of emerging-market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management’s chief investment office. But investors need to decide “whether they’re willing to tolerate and incorporate geopolitical risk into their portfolios,” he said.
Risk Matters
This month’s mysterious disappearance of Washington Post columnist Khashoggi, and subsequent fears the U.S. may punish Saudi Arabia if the kingdom is found to be responsible, roiled the nation’s assets this week.
While bonds fell and riyal forwards jumped when foreign investors returned to work Monday, stocks rallied the most in more than a year. It was an anomaly that prompted some traders to guess government-related funds were propping up shares, speculation that was never confirmed. The Tadawul All Share Index had tumbled as much as 7 percent on Sunday before partially recovering to end the day 3.5 percent lower.
A dearth of information means higher volatility and, theoretically, lower valuations for Saudi shares, said Yevgeny Ruzhitsky, a New York-based senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman Group. The gauge’s 10-day volatility climbed to the highest level since January 2016, and the iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF on Tuesday suffered its worst outflow on record.
Investor confidence has been frayed since June last year, when the Saudis led a four-nation campaign to isolate Qatar, followed by an anti-corruption crackdown in November that saw billionaires imprisoned in the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. There were further bumps when the kingdom was involved in a dispute with Canada following its criticism of the jailing of Saudi rights activists. All set against mounting tension with Iran.
“Other than macro and geopolitical challenges, I would say transparency or the level of disclosure, quality of management and access to management are probably the biggest concerns today,” Ruzhitsky said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) offered a modest fourth-quarter revenue growth outlook, predicting weaker sales of high-performance computers for cryptocurrency mining will partially offset solid demand for chips from smartphones.
TSMC (N:TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker whose clients include iPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL), also shrugged off concerns over Sino-U.S. trade tensions hurting its sales, betting investment in advanced chipmaking technology will help cushion the impact.
In a move likely to further consolidate TSMC's technological leadership, key rival GlobalFoundries said recently that it would not compete in the latest generation of chipmaking technology that is hotly sought after by high-end device makers.
""Despite the current market uncertainties, our business will benefit from a continued steep ramp (up) of 7 nanometre for several high-end smartphones,"" Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told the company's earnings conference.
""However this will be partially offset by continued weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand and inventory management by customers,"" she said.
TSMC forecast its fourth-quarter revenue at $9.35 billion-$9.45 billion, marginally higher from $9.21 billion a year ago.
It warned the mid-tier smartphone market will shrink this year, but predicted premium phones will continue to show a positive growth, helping it ride out the slowdown, as TSMC mainly serves the high-end segment.
Analysts said solid demand for Apple's new iPhone models, estimated from contract electronics maker Foxconn's revenues for September, will also support TSMC's growth in the fourth quarter, a crucial year-end holiday season for smartphone makers.
TSMC reported July-September profit of T$89.07 billion ($2.9 billion), in line with the T$89.0 billion average forecast drawn from 23 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue rose 1.9 percent to $8.49 billion, higher than the company's own estimate of $8.28 billion-$8.38 billion, as well as the average $8.4 billion estimate of 25 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
The results came after semiconductor industry bellwether ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML), a supplier to TSMC, posted better-than-expected third quarter results and gave a bullish outlook on Wednesday, helping assuage fears of slackening demand.

Shares of TSMC, which rivals  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) as the world's biggest semiconductor firm by market value, closed down 0.8 percent at T$236.50 on Thursday ahead of the financial results, compared with a 0.3 percent fall for the benchmark index (TWII).

MACAU (Reuters) - The son of billionaire Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho on Thursday announced the revival of an entertainment project left dormant for eight years, as authorities move to seize idle land in the world's largest gambling hub.
Macau Theme Park and Resort Ltd aims to open an 820 room hotel and leisure facilities costing HK$5 billion ($638 million) by 2020, but without the theme park it initially planned.
The firm has held land for the project for almost a decade while seeking permission to build the theme park. With its application still unsuccessful, and a change in law targeting unused land, the firm has decided to proceed without the park.
""We continue to communicate with the government and hope it can give us the opportunity to develop a new Macau theme park,"" said Arnaldo Ho.
Booming casino revenue in the Chinese-controlled territory has seen land prices soar over the past decade, particularly near the Las Vegas-style Cotai strip where the revived project is located.
But since last year, the authorities have seized over 100 plots under a 2013 law aimed at deterring developers from hoarding land to profit from rises in value, as well as to make better use of land in the space-starved territory.
Some developers have responded, including  Genting Hong Kong  Ltd (HK:0678) which in December began construction on land vacant for over 10 years.
Jorge Neto Valente, head of Macau's Lawyers Association, said the government did not distinguish between land idle for speculative intentions or reasons out of the developer's control.
HELLO KITTY
Arnaldo Ho's mother, Angela Leong, initially announced the project in 2010, saying it would feature five hotels with themes such as the character Hello Kitty, plus an indoor beach, equestrian center, amusement rides and convention facilities.
The government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the status of the theme park application.
Leong, a Macau legislator, manages her nonagenarian husband's family businesses which include casino operator SJM Holdings Ltd (HK:0880), the Macau Jockey Club horse racing franchise and former greyhound racing stadium Canidrome Club.
Her project, dubbed Lisboeta, is on land adjacent to the $4.6 billion Lisboa Palace casino that SJM will open in 2019. Arnaldo Ho on Thursday said it would have a more nostalgic feel in contrast to Macau's mainly glitzy resorts.
He also said Lisboeta would recreate the floating Casino Macau Palace featured in 1974 James Bond film ""The Man with a Golden Gun"". Other attractions would include indoor skydiving and an urban zipline.

""If we bring more hotel rooms to market, we can definitely improve accessibility, bring in more visitors and indirectly more gaming revenue,"" said one Macau analyst, who declined to be identified due to company policy.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",HSBC poised to be first firm to issue Chinese Depositary Receipts: sources,"By Julie Zhu and Lawrence White
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) is set to be the first company to issue Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs), through a link between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges which will begin by year end, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
China finalised rules earlier this year for its CDRs, which mainly allow Chinese tech companies listed overseas to also list at home. It announced a series of CDR rules for London-listed firms under the planned Shanghai-London Stock Connect last week.
HSBC has tasked its investment banking joint venture in China as well as CITIC Securities Co Ltd (SS:600030) to work on the issuance, said two of the people. 
The size and time frame are still under discussion and an initial plan will be announced by year-end, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the information was not public. 
""We are studying the proposed framework for the listing of Chinese Depositary Receipts under the Shanghai-London Stock Connect but cannot comment further at this time,"" said a HSBC spokesman.
CITIC Securities did not respond to a request for comment.
Under the stock connect, firms listed in Shanghai will be able to sell Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) to investors in London, and those listed in London will be able to issue CDRs to investors in Shanghai.
Brokerage Huatai Securities Co Ltd (SS:601688) last month became the first Chinese firm to announce the sale of GDRs in London, with plans to raise at least $500 million.
However, while Chinese firms will be able to raise fresh funds by issuing GDRs, London-listed firms initially will only be able to sell CDRs based on existing shares.
""London-listed firms however can broaden their investor base, enlarge regional market impact and raise their profile in the world's second-largest economy via the CDR offerings,"" one of the people said. 
It is not the first time HSBC has tried to list in Shanghai. In 2011, the bank cited unfavourable market conditions when shelving plans to list on a proposed Shanghai international board - which never came to fruition. Other firms expressing interest at that time included  Unilever  PLC (L:ULVR) and  Standard Chartered  PLC (L:STAN).
""Standard Chartered is also studying the possibility of a mainland Chinese listing,"" a person familiar with the matter said. The bank issued depositary receipts in India in 2010, but they attracted dwindling interest and are now largely dormant.
The stock connect is China's latest move in opening up its capital markets, following similar schemes between bourses in China and Hong Kong. Talks with London began in 2015 but slowed after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

While the stock connects are generally regarded a success, its CDRs have had a slower start. CDRs were originally aimed at bringing back overseas-listed tech giants, but one of the first set to sell CDRs - smartphone maker  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) - postponed any issuance.

Air France KLM shares were up 5.3 percent, although the stock remains down nearly 40 percent so far in 2018, mainly due to the impact of staff strikes over pay that have cost the airline over 300 million euros ($346 million).
Benjamin Smith took over as Air France KLM's chief executive last month. Smith faces having to overcome union resistance to reduce the French unit's swollen cost base while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch staff on side.

The raids come after the Corruption Eradication Commission, known as KPK, arrested two Lippo Group (HK:0226) consultants and an employee accused of trying to pay off city officials to obtain property permits for Meikarta.
Costing $21 billion and billed as the ""Shenzhen of Indonesia"", after the booming Chinese city, Meikarta is Lippo's largest project to date and is meant to be a center for the automotive and electronic industries. It will also include five-star hotels, shopping malls, hospitals, and universities.
Febri Diansyah, a spokesman for the KPK, said in a text message its investigators had seized financial documents and computers during the raids.
The raids targeted the home of Riady, a Lippo Group office and the home and offices of top local government official Neneng Hasanah Yasin, one of nine suspects arrested by the KPK this week. 
Yasin, Riady and other representatives of the Lippo Group did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
The KPK said Lippo employees detained this week said they had been acting on instructions from Lippo director Billy Sindoro to bribe Yasin, who is the regent for West Java's Bekasi area where the Meikarta project is located.
Sindoro has also been arrested, as well as four other public servants. Lawyers for Sindoro and Yasin have not responded to requests for comment.
Investigators have confiscated 513 million rupiah ($33,772) and S$90,000 ($65,378) that they said had been intended as bribe money and suspect other instances of corruption.
Counsel for Meikarta has told Reuters there was no tolerance for corruption at the company and pledged to cooperate with KPK investigators.
Lippo Group shares have dropped since the investigation was made public. The company's flagship real estate developer company,  Lippo Karawaci , fell 2.78 percent on Thursday, with its dollar bonds near record lows while  Lippo Cikarang  shares were down 18 percent this week (JK:LPKR) (JK:LPCK).
Meikarta's parent company is Mahkota Sentosa Utama, a 49.99 percent-owned subsidiary of Lippo Cikarang, which is 54 percent-owned by Lippo Karawaci.
Moody's said on Thursday the alleged bribery incident would be credit negative for Lippo Karawaci, while S&P Global Ratings noted it risked weakening the firm's already fragile liquidity.

Meikarta had completed residential units and previously told media it had secured 32,000 fixed buyers, some of whom moved in in September.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Industrial gases group Praxair (N:PX) and Linde (DE:LIN1) are set to win U.S. antitrust approval for their planned $86 billion merger, clearing the last major hurdle for the deal, German monthly Manager Magazin reported.
The Praxair board has been given verbal assurance by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that the conditional go-ahead was imminent, and the ruling will be issued in writing in the next few days, the magazine said on its website, without specifying its sources.
Linde, which declined to comment, had said on Monday it had agreed with FTC staff on remedies to secure approval but that the package was still under review by FTC's top-level commissioners.
Shares in Linde jumped as much as 10 percent and were up 6.2 percent at 220.40 euros by 0847 GMT.
All other competition authorities in question have given the green light, including the European Commission, which was won over by a deal to sell Praxair's European gases business to Japanese rival  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091). 
The EU, however, has yet to sign off on Taiyo Nippon Sanso as a suitable buyer.
Linde in July lined up a consortium of gases firm Messer and investor CVC (CVC.UL) as a buyer of North and South American assets to allay U.S. antitrust concerns, but talks with the FTC hit a snag, requiring more asset sales.
The companies face an Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 05:18AM ET</span>","Exxon Mobil bets big on China LNG, sidesteps trade war","By Gary McWilliams and Henning Gloystein
HOUSTON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is placing big bets on China's soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet.
Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon's first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company's plans. 
That combination ""will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,"" said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company's top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster. 
""China's natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,"" the Exxon manager said.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT
An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company's LNG investments in China.
Exxon said last month it would participate in the construction of an LNG import terminal in Huizhou, Guangdong region and provide supplies to it. This makes it only the second foreign major with such a stake in an LNG terminal. 
Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon's massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing.
Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides ""a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.""
Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex.
Exxon's Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals' exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China's support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country's closed markets.
The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world's fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years. 
TRADE WAR RISKS 
Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations.
His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world's largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. 
Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project.  BP  (LON:BP) Plc is the only other foreign major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal. 
Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment. 
The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon's in China in jeopardy.
In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany's BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor. 
The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates.

CALL FOR NEW PROJECTS
China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities.
That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects. 
But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China.
""Major Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,"" said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Sydney, Australia.
Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil.
That is changing, in part because China's importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it.
The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases.

""LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,"" said Credit Suisse's Kavonic.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Private equity giant Blackstone Group (N:BX) has quit a takeover battle for Australian office-block owner Investa Office Fund (AX:IOF) after it was gazumped by Canadian landlord Oxford Properties Group's A$3.35 billion ($2.4 billion) bid.
Blackstone told Investa it would not match the offer, Investa said on Thursday, all but handing the sought-after target to Oxford as office rents boom, especially in Sydney where Investa's 20 towers are concentrated.
With Investa's board now recommending the Oxford buyout, notwithstanding a better offer, it also ends a takeover battle running since the Canadian firm emerged as 11th-hour contender last month.
""There's only the formalities to go through. I think that's as high as it'll go,"" said Winston Sammut, managing director of property investor Folkestone Maxim Asset Management.
""The question really now is what does Blackstone do given that it's got some cash available.""
A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group.
""This is an excellent opportunity for IOF unitholders to crystallize their investment in IOF at an attractive and certain price,"" IOF Fund Manager Penny Ransom said in a statement.
The transaction, which requires shareholder and regulatory approvals, comes as tight supply in downtown office markets is driving a slew of deals in a sector that is defying softening home prices in Australia. 
British-based consultant BIS Oxford Economics, unrelated to the bidder, forecasts vacancy rates for Sydney offices to hit an all-time low of 3 percent by the end of 2019 and office rents to rise 56 percent over the next five years.
""Some people think this is over, but it's not,"" Frank Gelber, economist and a director at BIS said by phone. ""We reckon this cycle's got another four to five years to run.""
In other deals, Miami-based Starwood Capital has three times raised its offer for Melbourne-based landlord  Australian Unity Office Fund  (AX:AOF) to A$480.4 million.
Industrial and office landlord Propertylink Group (AX:PLG) on Tuesday dropped its A$755 million bid for peer Centuria Industrial REIT (AX:CIP) while it mulls a A$732 million takeover offer from Warburg Pincus (WP.UL) controlled ESR Real Estate.
Investa, which first drew interest from Blackstone in April, and a A$3.08 million bid in May, is regarded a particularly valuable because it is the largest office owner not diversified into the weaker-performing residential or industrial sectors. 
Before Oxford emerged as a spoiler two days before shareholders were set to vote on Blackstone's buyout, the private equity giant had already lifted its bid once. It raised it three times before Oxford beat it out by A$48 million.
Investa shares closed 0.36 percent lower, in a flat market, at A$5.55, just below the Oxford offer price of A$5.60.
Oxford's offer will be voted on by shareholders at a meeting to be scheduled in December. Investa must also pay a break fee of about A$32 million to Blackstone.

546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 02:00AM ET</span>",China's New Strategy for Curbing World's Worst Stock Slide,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s efforts to arrest destabilizing declines in domestic stocks in recent years have become so well recognized that market players coined the term “the national team” to describe buying by state-owned funds. In the latest bout of turmoil, there’s been a twist.
It’s local authorities who have been most active to cushion what’s been a near-30 percent plunge in the Shanghai Composite Index from its January high. Officials in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Shunde as well as Beijing’s Haidian district have moved to help listed firms from their areas, according to local authorities and media reports.
Rather than the across-the-board purchases seen in efforts led by the central government in the wake of a $5 trillion sell-off in 2015, this time around aid appears to be channeled to specific companies in need of liquidity support. Many are linked to share pledging -- the practice of taking out loans using stocks as collateral. Stock slides spur brokerages to dump the collateral, in turn worsening the market rout and making it all the tougher for the companies involved to find financing.
Tech-hub Shenzhen, in China’s south, allocated tens of billions of yuan to reduce risks from share pledging and help liquidity of publicly listed companies registered in the city, according to Shanghai Securities News. Shenzhen H&T Intelligent Control Co. and Hybio Pharmaceutical Co. confirmed that they are among the beneficiaries of the support.
Triple Whammy
“It’s likely that this is guidance handed down by the central government,” said Yin Ming, vice president of investment firm Baptized Capital. While the intervention of national-level state-run funds spurs “broad-based gains in both good and bad firms and inflates valuation bubbles, this is more targeted,” he said.
Yin said the approach “kills three birds with one stone.” It avoids the more wasteful nation-wide approach pursued in 2015, when efforts included asking brokerages to contribute 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) to a market-rescue fund. It also supports employment amid China’s economic slowdown, and may help local stocks.
Equities traders may not be warming up to the idea. At least, it’s not offering much solace for the broader market.
Worst Performance
The Shanghai Composite headed for a fresh four-year low on Thursday, cementing its position as the worst global benchmark. China’s market capitalization is down some $3 trillion, knocking it down one notch to number three in global rankings.
Shenzhen’s Hybio closed up 0.7 percent Wednesday, while Shenzhen H&T dropped 3.5 percent. Some local stocks fared better after the Beijing branch of the China Securities Regulatory Commission set up a 10 billion yuan fund to support private-sector, publicly listed technology firms in the city’s Haidian district. Beijing Wanji Technology Co. and China National Software & Service Co. both jumped by the 10 percent daily limit.
Targeted rescues have also looped in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest lender by assets. ICBC expanded a debt-to-equity swap program this week for a clutch of private firms. And the securities regulator has separately advised creditors of Beijing Orient Landscape & Environment Co. not to engage in forced sales of pledged shares.
Still, traders remain jumpy. Lighting maker Sanan Optoelectronics Co. suddenly plunged by the maximum allowed in morning trading on Wednesday. About 30 percent of the company’s shares have been pledged as collateral for loans, according to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp. data.
The bottom line: it remains uncertain whether the local-led approach will reverse the downtrend in China’s domestic market, says Bifan Shen, chief strategist at Shenzhen Spruces Capital Management Co.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 12:44AM ET</span>",Dividend windfall: Santander latest target in Germany's giant fraud probe,"By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) is the latest bank to be caught up in Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation involving a share-trading scheme that the authorities say cost taxpayers billions of euros.
In June, prosecutors in Cologne opened a tax investigation into Santander, confidential documents relating to a state prosecutors' investigation seen by Reuters and other European news organizations reveal for the first time.
Santander's role in the scheme was to carry out trades, the prosecutors say, as one of many parties involved. They are also looking at Australia's Macquarie Bank (AX:MQG) and Germany's  Deutsche Bank , (DE:DBKGn) as part of the broader investigation.   
A letter from prosecutors to Santander's lawyers sent on June 4 shows that they suspect the bank of having ""planned and executed trades"" that facilitated ""severe tax evasion"" from 2007 through 2011.
A Santander spokesman said that the bank was ""fully cooperating"" with German authorities and conducting its own internal investigation. The bank ""doesn't tolerate behavior"" that fails to comply with the rules and laws in the market where it operates, he said, adding ""if our investigations do identify misconduct, we will take appropriate action.""
Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as part of a European media investigation called the ""cum-ex files"" coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv.
The prosecutors say the players in the cum-ex scheme misled the German government into thinking a stock had multiple owners on its dividend payday who were each owed a dividend and a dividend tax credit. 
The prosecutors say the scheme was illegal and misled the government into paying tax refunds. A spokesman for Santander declined to comment on whether it had broken the law while a spokesman for Macquarie, which is also under investigation, said it had believed the practice to be legal. 
The documents show that the Cologne prosecutors closed in on Santander and other banks this year as the investigation, which began in April 2013, rapidly accelerated.
The models were designed to generate multiple tax rebates, prosecutors say. In essence, here is how it worked, according to the documents viewed by Reuters:
A bank would agree to sell a company stock, for example to a pension fund, before the dividend payout but delivered it after it had been paid. The bank and the fund would both reclaim withholding tax. 
Sometimes banks sold shares they did not own and agreed to buy them later in a practice known as short selling. The stock was traded rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, prosecutors say. The profits from the deals were shared.
To generate bigger profits, the pensions funds could also buy large volumes of stocks, using loans from banks.
The German tax office wrote to the Cologne prosecutors to say there were ""concrete indications"" that Santander had acted as a short seller. Three pension funds had also used loans from Macquarie, people with direct knowledge of the matter say. 
""Macquarie will continue to cooperate fully with the German authorities,"" a Macquarie spokesman said. ""It has already resolved its two other matters involving German dividend trading that took place between 2006 and 2009.""
The spokesman declined to say how they were resolved.
Similar investigations have been opened in Frankfurt and Munich, but Cologne, whose prosecutors specialize in international tax crime, made a breakthrough when at least six people involved in the trading gave detailed evidence, according to the documents.
Other banks, including Unicredit's German arm, have acknowledged they were also involved in such trading. 
A spokeswoman for UniCredit (MI:CRDI) said its German unit had been involved in cum-ex trading but that all criminal proceedings had since been terminated after, among other things, the payment of fines. She declined to comment further.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said it had not participated in an “organized cum-ex market” but that it had been “involved in some of its clients’ cum-ex transactions.” It said it was cooperating with the authorities.
Referring to all the banks involved, Norbert Walter-Borjans, the former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, which includes Cologne, said:  ""They grabbed the kitty that had been paid for by ordinary tax payers.""
""It is clear that it was against the law...How can it be legal to get something back twice or three times that has been paid only once?"" he said. 
    
MISTAKES
According to the prosecutors, the scheme was promoted by German tax inspector-turned-tax adviser Hanno Berger and others.
He advised Macquarie on cum-ex trading, according to a letter seen by Reuters which was sent by Berger to a Macquarie employee in March 2008. 
Berger told Reuters he also provided advice to Macquarie on the scheme in later years but he said he was not paid for it. The Macquarie spokesman declined to comment on Berger or the letter. 
Macquarie said last month its incoming and outgoing chief executives are expected to be named as suspects by prosecutors. The pair were aware of the reputational risk to the bank of the trades, the documents show. 
Berger, the central suspect in the investigation who is living in exile in the Swiss Alps, said the banks used a legitimate loophole, which was closed in 2012, and did not break the law.
""They (the German state) cannot punish others for their mistakes,"" he told Reuters.
Some German officials and prosecutors refute this claim, noting that Germany made attempts to stamp out the practice by changing and clarifying the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012. One top German official, who asked not to be named, said those efforts made clear the trading was illegal.   
German authorities estimate the scheme cost the state 5.6 billion euros in tax rebates that should never have been paid, while some experts believe the damage could be 10 billion euros.
The state prosecutor in Cologne declined to comment. 
    
""REPUTATIONAL RISK""
The documents show that the prosecutors in Cologne made a major breakthrough last year when a group of bankers, including a former Macquarie employee, offered information that showed Santander, Macquarie and others profited from the scheme. 
Macquarie estimates that it may have to pay 100 million euros in total legal settlements from the trades, roughly half of which it has already paid, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Internal Macquarie emails show that outgoing CEO Nicholas Moore and his successor in waiting, Shemara Wikramanayake, were aware of the reputational risks of the trades and involved in discussions about the funding.  A spokesman for Macquarie said Moore and Wikramanayake would not comment. 
In October 2010, Wikramanayake and three other executives sent a memorandum seen by Reuters to Macquarie's board of directors. It outlined a funding opportunity that would earn Macquarie between 15 and 20 million euros on each of three 1.1 billion euro loan facilities.
It earned a fee for these loan facilities.
""There is a risk that German revenue authorities may seek to deny tax reclaims and take some other action against the parties involved,"" they wrote.
They said the ""anticipated returns"" should be weighed against the negative ""reputational risk"".
Wikramanayake and Moore attended part of a meeting of directors on October 28 2010 in Sydney, when the deals and the ""reputation risk"" were discussed, according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters. 
The conditional approval for the funding was given at that meeting before the formal signoff in early 2011, according to the documents. 
The Macquarie spokesman said the bank lent money to a group of investment funds in 2011 which traded shares that sought to ""obtain the benefit of dividend withholding tax credits"" but he said the German authorities refused those claims. 
The German authorities declined to comment. 
""Macquarie received extensive external legal advice in relation to its involvement and believed that it was acting lawfully,"" he said.
    
SANTANDER LINK
Prosecutors wrote in letters to Santander's lawyers that they believe the Spanish bank, and its UK subsidiary Abbey National Treasury Services, were actively involved in ""a large number"" of deals involving short sales - a critical part of the cycle that created the impression of multiple share owners.
The Santander spokesman said that to the bank’s understanding, the investigation was focused on three former employees. 
“To date we have not identified any evidence that the activities under investigation involved senior management or that any of Santander’s or its subsidiaries' governing bodies were aware of these activities,” said the spokesman.
The bank executed transactions for a number of U.S. pension funds and its customer Macquarie, prosecutors said, which allowed the funds to make what tax investigators say are ""illicit"" tax reclaims. The prosecutors do not say how many pension funds.
Those services were lucrative for both Santander and Macquarie, the documents show.
For example, on May 13, 2011, the New York-based Sander Gerber pension plan received dividends of almost 162 million euros as a result of the trades supported by the two banks, according to the documents.
Macquarie charged a fee of 4 percent, or 6.5 million euros, to the pension plan for its services. Santander received an additional 400,000 euros in fees  for the 'futures facility' it provided.
A spokesman for Sander Gerber said that its investment decision relied on the ""reputation and integrity"" of the banks and that Gerber had understood the investment products to be ""legitimate"".
Germany wants the banks to repay the 5.6 billion euros, the German official told Reuters. Banks have already repaid 2.3 billion euros in settlements, the official said.
Frankfurt prosecutors this year filed the first criminal charges against Berger and five others who are all former employees of the German unit of Unicredit, according to court documents seen by Reuters. Unicredit declined to comment.
Although the investigation has gathered pace and some of the banks have repaid money, pursuing them and other suspects has been difficult, some lawmakers say. This is because, like Berger, several have moved abroad.

One German prosecutor admitted it would take years to bring those involved to justice but that the prosecution sent a clear signal that such wrongdoing would not be tolerated.

Nine West, which owns brands such as Anne Klein and Gloria Vanderbilt, said it will also receive a three-year purchase commitment from Belk Inc for an assortment of merchandise across the company's businesses.
A hearing has been scheduled for Nov. 7 to consider approval of the terms of the amended Chapter 11 plan, following which it will be passed on to voting creditors for their consideration.
The company filed for bankruptcy protection in April and sold its Nine West and Bandolino footwear and handbag businesses at a court auction to Authentic Brands Group for $340 million in June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Commerce Committee's Republican chairman and ranking Democrat said on Wednesday they had asked top U.S. executives at  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) to testify at a Nov. 14 hearing on reports of engine fires involving vehicles from the Korean automakers.
The call to testify comes after safety advocates raised concerns about fires in vehicles not involved in collisions. The non-profit, consumer advocacy group Center for Auto Safety said last week that 103 fire complaints had been filed with U.S. safety regulators since June 12 and urged an immediate recall of nearly 3 million vehicles.
Hyundai said in a statement it had received the request to appear ""and is currently reviewing it."" The company added it ""actively monitors and evaluates potential safety concerns, including non-collision fires, with all of its vehicles and acts swiftly to recall any vehicles with safety-related defects.""
Kia did not comment. 
Shares of Hyundai Motor fell as much as 3.8 percent in Seoul trading on Thursday. Kia Motors stock also slid 3.7 percent, while the wider market (KS11) was down 0.6 percent as of 0232 GMT.
In May 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation, opened a formal investigation into the recall of nearly 1.7 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine defects.
A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three recalls carried out in the United States and whether they covered enough vehicles.
Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, said a non-collision fire death had been reported last year in a 2014 Kia Soul. ""We’ve got to get to the bottom of what's causing these fires,"" Nelson said in a statement Wednesday. ""Car owners need to know if their vehicles are safe.""
The letter to the automakers also signed by Senator John Thune, who chairs the committee, said the hearing will also ""examine efforts to mitigate vehicle fires and promptly identify and respond to defects that may pose a fire risk"" and invites the chief executives of Hyundai and Kia's U.S. units to testify or their designee. 
In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At that time, affiliate Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same ""Theta II"" engines.
In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with ""Theta II"" engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris, NHTSA said. 
On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,160 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles - all of which use the same engine.
The recall, which was also conducted in Canada and South Korea, cost the automakers an estimated 360 billion won ($319.30 million).
The Center for Auto Safety filed a petition in June seeking a defect investigation over engine fires in 2011-2014 Kia Optima and Sorento vehicles and Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe vehicles from the same model years.
In response, NHTSA said in August that the majority of the fires cited in the petition ""appear to be related to the engine failures"" covered by the investigations announced in May 2017.

NHTSA said Wednesday the petition remains under consideration, but did not comment on the hearing.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela is tapping at least five new top executives to state oil company PDVSA, six sources said on Wednesday, but the changes are unlikely to halt the unraveling of the OPEC member's oil industry under military management. 
The new executives are relative unknowns in the energy sector, with at least one of the appointees hailing from the military, according to industry sources briefed on the shake-up. PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo, a general under whom production has fallen to a six-decade low since he was appointed late last year, was ratified, however.
PDVSA is under pressure from a major cash crunch that has stymied investments, a brain drain that is depriving it of engineers, and a new military management that has clashed with workers. 
Leftist President Nicolas Maduro put the company under military management in what he said was a bid to rid it of corruption and inefficiencies. 
Two sources said the changes had been made earlier on Wednesday. There was no official comment, however, and neither PDVSA nor the Information Ministry responded to a request for comment.
Among Maduro's latest changes to the company, Nelson Ferrer, an engineer who was one of the few executives who survived a sweep of detentions at PDVSA last year, was removed as the head of the exploration and production, the sources said. He was replaced by Miguel Quintana, previously vice-president for planning and engineering at PDVSA, but whom two of the sources said was an architect by training. 

A general from the National Guard, Jose Rojas, was tapped to lead PDVSA's trade and supply department. Rojas previously held jobs at the Defense Ministry and the Housing Ministry, which Quevedo led before surprisingly being appointed to lead PDVSA.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to turn up sanctions pressure on Venezuela but sees less need to immediately target its energy sector, given sagging production from the OPEC member's state-run oil company, a senior U.S. administration official said on Wednesday.
The U.S. government has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan military and political figures close to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who it blames for trampling on human rights and triggering the country's economic collapse.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration had weighed escalating sanctions by targeting a Venezuelan military-run oil services company or restricting insurance coverage for oil shipments.
The actions would have built upon last year's ban for U.S. banks from any new debt deals with Venezuelan authorities or state-run oil giant PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].
Asked by reporters whether the U.S. government had slowed down on its push for sectoral sanctions, the senior official described them as some of the many ""tools"" it is keeping in reserve. ""With regards to Venezuela, all options are on the table,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""The fact is that the greatest sanction on Venezuelan oil and oil production is called Nicolas Maduro, and PDVSA's inefficiencies,"" the official said.
Venezuela's crude oil production hit a 28-year low in 2017, a slump blamed on poor management and corruption.
""At the end of the day, Nicolas Maduro has taken care of really running PDVSA to the ground, and essentially more and more making it a non-factor,"" he said.
Almost 2 million Venezuelans have fled since 2015, driven out by food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime. The exodus has overwhelmed neighboring countries.
Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by U.S.-backed adversaries.
The Trump administration also plans to ramp up economic pressure on Cuba's military and intelligence services, the official said.
In his speech last month to the United Nations, President Donald Trump linked Venezuela's crises to ""its Cuban sponsors.""
""That is a message that we will continue to put out, but frankly its a message that the region needs to talk about,"" the official said, noting John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, is expected to elaborate on the issue publicly soon.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>","Alcoa's profit beat fueled by rising alumina prices, shares rise","By Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Top U.S. aluminum producer  Alcoa  Corp (N:AA) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as a series of supply hits boosted alumina prices.
Shares of the company rose almost 5 percent to $38.49 in after-hours trading, also helped by the announcement of a $200 million share repurchase program.
Alumina prices spiked during the year, largely due to supply disruptions such as lower production at Norsk Hydro's (OL:NHY) Alunorte, the world's largest alumina refinery, a strike at Alcoa's Australian operations and U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486).
Chief Executive Roy Harvey said on a post-earnings call with analysts that while increased alumina prices represented an added cost, the company benefited from strength in third-party alumina sales.
Third-party alumina sales, or supplies to other smelters, surged 54.4 percent to $1.10 billion in the third quarter, the company said.
Alcoa said it had a net benefit of $27 million in the third quarter from U.S. tariffs as they helped push up the Midwest regional premium.
President Donald Trump in March imposed tariffs on imported aluminum aimed at boosting domestic aluminum makers against the backdrop of overcapacity in China. 
The tariffs, which came into force in June, also extended to products from allies such as the European Union and Canada.
Alcoa in August asked the U.S. Commerce Department to exempt from tariffs its purchases of 40,000 metric tons of aluminum from Canada, and is awaiting the government's response. 
Excluding certain items, Alcoa earned 63 cents per share, easily topping expectation of 36 cents, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
Peter Ward, an analyst at Renaissance Macro Research, said the quarter was ""okay"" given the competitive challenges in the market. ""The Street had recently cut estimates way too much."" 
The company tightened its 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) forecast to range between $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion, raising its midpoint slightly, compared with its previous expectation of $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion.
Net loss attributable to Alcoa was $41 million, or 22 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $113 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.
The results include a charge of $160 million mainly from the transfer of certain of the company's U.S. pension and retirement benefits.

Revenue rose 14.4 percent to $3.39 billion, topping analysts' average estimate of $3.31 billion.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 06:35PM ET</span>","Corona maker's CEO Rob Sands to step down, insider to replace him","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc's (N:STZ) Rob Sands is stepping down as CEO, ending an era in which the family-backed alcohol producer became one of the biggest beer brewers in the United States and placed a multi-billion dollar bet on the cannabis industry.
Constellation, the maker of Corona beer and Svedka vodka, said Bill Newlands, an industry veteran and Constellation's current president, will succeed Sands as CEO. Newlands will become the first person outside the Sands family to take the role.
Sands, 60, will become executive chairman in March, replacing his brother Richard.
Sands, who became CEO in 2007, led Constellation through some of its most transformative years, during which it bought the U.S. rights to sell Mexican-made Corona beer and saw its shares multiply almost tenfold.
The Victor, New York-based company, one of the first major alcohol companies to invest in the marijuana industry, made a further $4 billion bet on Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth Inc (TO:WEED) in August this year.
As chairman, Sands will focus on Constellation's investment in Canopy Growth, he told the Wall Street Journal.
The investment came two months before Canada became the first industrialized nation to legalize recreational cannabis, a burgeoning industry that many say has potential for massive growth.
Wall Street analysts were largely unsurprised by Sands' move.
Consumer Edge's Brett Cooper said the move was in line with Constellation's broader strategy of being controlled by the Sands family and managed by outsiders, a plan also adopted by other alcohol producers including Jack Daniels whiskey maker Brown-Forman (N:BFb).
""The Street may welcome a non-family CEO, although this does mark the end of an incredibly successful tenure for Rob Sands,"" analysts at Macquarie Research said in a client report. ""Newlands has a strong team reporting to him, so we expect no changes in Constellation's strategy.""

Constellation shares were slightly higher at $228.57 in extended trading on Wednesday.

MADRID (Reuters) - Seven banks, including HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create a global digital network in trade finance aiming at allowing cheaper and easier funding for corporates, a Santander manager said on Wednesday.
The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ (AX:ANZ),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Citibank (N:C),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) also agreed to join the digital trade information network expected to be operational by the third quarter of next year.
""It is the first time that these banks come together to set a standard (...) that will allow cheaper access to finance because the risks are going to be reduced,"" Rogier Schulpen, global head of trade and working solutions at Banco Santander, said in a phone interview.
In trade finance, banks provide funding and other services to importers and exporters to facilitate commerce but each lender deals separately with clients and employs different standards.
By linking corporates, suppliers and banks through a standardized digital platform, the network aims to lower costs as small and midsized companies will be able to submit and verify purchase orders and invoices to request trade financing from the banks of their choice.
As those banks will have access to trusted trade information, the network expects to mitigate the risk of double financing and fraudulent trade information across the industry.
Schulpen said a further 20 banks were helping to develop the network and were ready to join and 60 big corporates had been approached to participate.
Schulpen did not set a target for the size of the platform but said he hoped it could finance a ""significant"" part of the $1.5 trillion demand per year for trade finance from small and medium sized companies that is currently not met by the industry due to higher costs and risks.
The network has an open architecture and standardized connectivity based on a governance model similar to SWIFT.

SWIFT is a messaging system used by banks over the world to send information and instructions in an encrypted format through a secure channel.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories rose by much more than expected and exports fell, while the dollar added to gains after minutes showed Federal Reserve policy makers largely united on the need to raise borrowing costs further.
A gauge of stocks across the world dipped, tracking Wall Street's reaction to the Fed minutes, while the outlook on earnings soured after a warning on the European auto sector and a revenue miss from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
WTI crude touched its lowest price in a month after U.S. stockpiles rose by 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast. This happened even as U.S. crude production slipped last week, partly as offshore facilities closed temporarily for Hurricane Michael.
WTI fell 2.63 percent to $70.03 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.32, down 1.34 percent on the day.
""A tick higher in refining activity and a drop in production due to hurricane activity in the Gulf was not enough to halt a fourth consecutive climb in (inventories)- and a solid one at that,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky.
MORE ASSERTIVE FED
Every Federal Reserve policy maker backed raising interest rates last month in a meeting where they also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, according to the minutes from the meeting.
The dollar index hit session highs after the Fed minutes were released, although the bulk of Wednesday’s leg up came before the news.
""There was a pretty well-formed expectation that it would more likely showcase a Fed that's more confident and assertive debating tighter policy,"" said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac Banking Corp in New York.
The euro fell 0.64 percent to $1.1499 and Sterling was last trading at $1.3115, down 0.52 percent on the day.
Lower-than-expected UK inflation data weighed on sterling, which gave up the previous day's gains.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.35 percent versus the greenback at 112.65 per dollar. The dollar index rose 0.63 percent.
On Wall Street, IBM fell 7.6 percent, dragging blue chips lower a day after the company missed revenue expectations. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 posted the biggest daily gain since late March.
Stocks extended losses when oil prices fell further, but the S&P 500 shifted in and out of losses after the Fed minutes and ended down less than a point.
""This is consistent with the Fed's rhetoric that they will continue to gradually raise interest rates. A lot has to happen for the Fed not to move again in December,"" said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""The stock market would have to go into a persistent, prolonged decline to change the Fed’s outlook on the economy.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 91.74 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,706.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,809.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.79 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,642.70.
European stocks hit a one-week high in early trade, but then were pulled lower by a 1.9 percent fall in an index of auto stocks. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said slow demand in China could hit earnings in the sector.
The pan-European STOXX 600 lost 0.40 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.08 percent.
Emerging market stocks lost 0.10 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.26 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 1.29 percent.
U.S. Treasury yields continued to trade in a tight range after a massive run-up last week, despite choppy trading after the Fed minutes were published.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 3.2031 percent, from 3.156 percent late on Tuesday.

The 30-year bond last fell 23/32 in price to yield 3.3695 percent, from 3.33 percent late on Tuesday.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Wall St. falls as investors eye a united hawkish Fed,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes edged lower after a choppy session on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve showed broad agreement on the need to raise borrowing costs further, cementing investor concerns that had helped cause a major sell-off the week before.
The S&P 500 (SPX) zigzagged furiously between positive and negative territory after the 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) release of the Fed's September meeting minutes. 
In defiance of sharp criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, policymakers showed agreement on the September hike and general anticipation that further gradual increases would be consistent with the economic expansion, labor market strength, and firm inflation that most forecast.
""In the past several years there's been a strong dovish component. Now even the doves are starting to roll over,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, in Waltham, Mass. ""The sense of the meeting was more hawkish than investors might have thought.""
(Graphic: Doves and Hawks - https://tmsnrt.rs/2dcNoCo)
The S&P has only partially recovered ground lost last week, when it marked its biggest decline since March as investors worried about rate hikes.
The prospect of a more hawkish Fed was exacerbating equity investor fears of uncertainties, ranging from the U.S.-China trade war and weakness in the housing market to the outlook for earnings, said McMillan.
""The market doesn't really know what to think at this point. That's why we're seeing these swings,"" he said. ""With interest rates higher there's a lot less cushion to smooth away those uncertainties.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 91.74 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,706.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,809.21 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 2.79 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,642.70.
Even before the minutes, trading was already choppy, and the S&P 500 struggled to build on the previous day's rally after disappointing housing data dragged down stocks such as  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) and homebuilders.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors, only four ended the day with gains. Financials (SPSY) was the biggest gainer, closing 0.9 percent higher. Materials was the biggest loser (SPLRCM), with an 0.8 percent drop.
Home Depot shares fell 4.3 percent while the PHLX Housing index (HGX) lost 1.87 percent. 
Among the brighter spots was Netflix (O:NFLX), which rose 5.3 percent, after reporting blowout subscriber addition numbers.
United Airlines Inc (O:UAL) shares climbed 5.95 percent after a solid third-quarter profit and again raising its 2018 outlook. That also lifted other airline stocks.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 12 new highs and 76 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.08 billion shares, compared to the 7.9 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

563,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 04:34PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Will Trump React to Fed Minutes?
The market failed to find direction at the end of trading today as the Federal Reserve’s conviction that the economy can withstand quite a few more rate hikes (as evidenced by the minutes) spooked buyers.
While not a rebuttal to President Donald Trump calling the Fed and its rate hikes his biggest “threat” -- these minutes are from a meeting last month, after all – it’s clear that policymakers and the chief executive are at loggerheads.
Another tweet or comment from the president against the FOMC could further dent market confidence tomorrow.
The longer-term concern for investors is that if the Fed changes course it will now be seen as bowing to pressure, leading to more uncertainty about future moves and who is really calling the shots.
And if the Fed pauses for a few more meetings, it runs the risk of having to slam on the brakes hard if overheating starts.
2. Travelers Headlines Before-the-Bell Earnings
In earnings ahead of trading tomorrow, Dow component Travelers (NYSE:TRV) is one of the bigger names reporting.
On average, analysts expect that the insurance company earned $2.26 per share on revenue of $7 billion.
As with all insurers, growth of premiums will be key to results. But with interest rates climbing and bond yields rising, it will be important to see if the company’s investment revenue comes in strong.
Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) also reports its latest quarterly numbers and investors will be looking for any sign that the company is moving closer into investing in the hot cannabis section.
Legalization of cannabis in Canada began today.
Meanwhile, more financial companies weigh in after the bell, with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) on tap.
3. Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Arrive
In economic indicators, the weekly jobless claims numbers come in at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that claims for first-time unemployment benefits dipped slightly to 211,000 from 214,000 the week before.
Labor numbers have been consistently good, with this week’s latest JOLTs report showing job openings at a record level.
At the same time the Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing index is issued. Manufacturing activity is forecast to have dipped in October to a measure of 19.7."

568,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Closes Flat as Fed Minutes, Energy Weigh","Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed flat on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's minutes pointed to further monetary tightening, while a slump in oil prices pressured energy stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.36%. The S&P 500 fell 0.03%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.04%.
Wall Street's attempt to extend its rally following its biggest one-day gain since March on Tuesday was undone by concerns that further Fed rate hikes could fuel a rally in U.S. government bond yields, denting investor appetite for risker assets like stocks.
The Federal Reserve's minutes showed that members remained committed to gradually raising interest rates as the economy was on pace to churn out ""strong"" growth in the third quarter of the year.
U.S. government bond yields surged following the release of the Fed's minutes as the 10-year Treasury note yield hit session highs.
Mostly upbeat corporate earnings, which have helped shift investor focus away from rising bond yields to corporate fundamentals, helped offset losses somewhat in the broader averages.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted third-quarter earnings postmarket Tuesday that handily beat expectations, as subscriber numbers came in well above analysts' estimates amid strong growth in both U.S. and overseas markets. Its stock closed 5.3% higher.
M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) results also topped estimates, adding to a recent wave of bullish earnings from banks, triggering broad-based gains across financials.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), both of which reported above-forecast earnings and revenue on Tuesday, rose nearly 3%.
But a weaker-than-expected report from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) saw its stock spiral 7.6% lower as the company struggled to maintain revenue growth, though its earnings came in above Wall Street's estimates.
Falling energy stocks inflicted much of the damage on the broader averages owing to a slump in oil prices after data showed a larger-than-expected build in domestic oil supplies.
The yo-yo day of trade on Wall Street, which was characterized by violent swings in both directions, was not helped by soft housing data, triggering a slump in homebuilders.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday U.S. homebuilding fell 5.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.201 million units in September. Building permits fell 0.6% to a rate of 1.241 million units.
Shares of  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH) and DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) slumped more than 2%.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 1.74% following reports that CEO Elon Musk had informed the electric car company that he intended to purchase $20 million of common stock during the next open trading window.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Trump pulling out of pact that discounted foreign postal deliveries,"By Jeff Mason and Chris Sanders
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will begin withdrawing from a United Nations pact that offered low rates for foreign postal deliveries of small packages in the United States, the latest move to challenge practices it sees as unfairly advantageous to China.
White House officials said on Wednesday the United States would start the process of leaving the Universal Postal Union (UPU), a Switzerland-based organization that connects postal services worldwide.
The White House said the UPU enables foreign postal services to take advantage of cheap shipments to the United States, creating an unfair cost advantage over U.S. companies that ship goods, and hurting the U.S. Postal Service.
Shares of internet-based mailing and shipping provider Stamps.com fell nearly 9 percent after the announcement. Online shoppers in the United States have often benefited from the arrangement, gaining access to foreign goods at little cost.
U.S. President Donald Trump is distancing the United States from international multilateral organizations and accompanying policies that he says hurt U.S. interests. Trump has announced U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement to mitigate climate change and an international deal with Iran to curb Tehran's nuclear program.
The White House will seek to renegotiate the terms of the UPU rules during the year-long withdrawal process, officials said.
""If negotiations are successful, the administration is prepared to rescind the notice of withdrawal and remain in the UPU,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
UPU Director General Bishar Hussein said he would seek meetings with U.S. officials to discuss the matter.
""The UPU remains committed to attainment of the noble aims of international collaboration by working with all its 192 member countries to ensure that the treaty best serves everyone,"" he said in a statement.
One senior White House said the treaty's ""subsidy"" had facilitated the transfer of a high level of counterfeit goods and the narcotic and fentanyl trade. 
Another official said the system allowed for a 40 to 70 percent discount on small packages arriving in the United States from China compared to what it would cost to send them domestically, costing $300 million. The official described it as an economic distortion that the administration wanted to correct.
A change could benefit U.S. merchants and shippers, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which have called on U.S. officials for years to address foreign postal services’ access to low rates. Amazon declined to comment.

The National Association of Manufacturers called the agreement ""outdated"" and said it ""contributes significantly to the flood of counterfeit goods and dangerous drugs that enter the country from China.""

The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14 after a U.S. district court ruled the deal was legal under antitrust law. The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to reverse that approval.
The core of the Justice Department’s concern is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner’s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more. The merged company includes CNN, a cable news station that is a frequent target of President Donald Trump's ire.

AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal.

575,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 03:16PM ET</span>","Senator McConnell says tariffs hurt, urges trade progress","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday prodded President Donald Trump's administration to quickly resolve festering trade disputes particularly with China, saying tariffs imposed by other countries in response to Trump's trade policies are starting to pinch the ""red hot"" U.S. economy.
While concurring with Trump's view that U.S. policy on global trade must be stronger, McConnell also voiced concern in an interview with Reuters about the impact of growing trade tensions, including on his home state of Kentucky.
Trump has taken a hard line on trade since becoming president last year, complaining that the United States is treated unfairly, abandoning some international trade deals while threatening to withdraw from others and from the World Trade Organization. He has repeatedly slapped tariffs on close allies and major trade partners, which have retaliated with duties of their own.
""The tariffs are beginning to have some impact in a negative way so I hope that we make some progress quickly on some of these other fronts, in particular with China,"" McConnell told the roundtable discussion with Reuters journalists, though he said of the overall U.S. economy: ""I think it's red hot.""
McConnell, Trump's fellow Republican, said he hopes the administration will avoid imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and SUVs, an issue that he noted has raised alarm among automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), which builds the Camry in Kentucky.
""I hope that we end up in a better place sooner and don't have to go down that path"" of additional tariffs on autos, McConnell said.
Trump's policies have deviated from Republican orthodoxy that had embraced international free trade agreements. McConnell had previously warned about the possible economic impacts of retaliatory tariffs imposed on the United States.
The United States has imposed hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In September, Trump slapped 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The European Union has imposed tariffs on Kentucky-made bourbon, among other products, while China has imposed tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. goods.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office on Tuesday formally notified Congress of plans to open trade talks early next year with the European Union, Japan and Britain.
'SOONER RATHER THAN LATER'
""If the end result of this is better trading relationships with all of these countries, particularly if it happens sooner rather than later, I think it would be great,"" McConnell said.
While some lawmakers have urged legislation to curb presidential authority on levying tariffs, McConnell said it is ""highly unlikely"" Trump or any president would sign a measure giving up such authority. Congress in past years gave ""pretty much all the ball control on trade"" to the White House, McConnell added.
McConnell said China ""has been eating our lunch for years"" on trade, adding that if Trump can reach a better deal on trade with Beijing than the status quo ""that would be a big step forward."" McConnell said he hopes ""we can end up sooner rather than later with a better relationship with China on the commercial side.""
New U.S. tariffs on the $200 billion in Chinese goods will jump to 25 percent on Jan. 1, coming after the administration previously slapped tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods.
McConnell on Tuesday said Congress will not vote until 2019 on a revised trade accord with Canada and Mexico. He said on Wednesday there was a ""palpable sense of relief"" after the deal on a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement was announced. Trump had criticized NAFTA as unfair to the United States.

Tariffs are having a mixed impact in Kentucky, McConnell said, adding, ""I've got a new aluminum plant coming in Kentucky and they think it's great. And then we have Toyota there and they think it isn't.""

Former CEO John Flannery warned French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in June that the target was ""out of reach"", and the government raised the possibility of fines worth 50,000 euros ($57,570) for each job not created.
GE's new CEO Larry Culp, who took up his post at the start of the month, told Le Maire in a meeting on Wednesday that France remained a strategic country for the company, the ministry said in statement.

The excess supplies from China that aren’t able to get into the U.S. make their way into other countries including Spain. After struggling to compete against cheaper Chinese aluminum, Alcoa said it’s shutting its “least productive” smelters, Aviles and La Coruna, which employ 686 workers and account for 6 percent of the Pittsburgh-based company’s total capacity. The Spanish government said the announcement took it by surprise.
The issues facing American aluminum producers, however, are decades in the making. The U.S. aluminum industry has repeatedly cited China’s overcapacity as the biggest culprit threatening the global industry. Despite the wide-ranging call to address China’s overproduction, the Trump administration applied 10 percent tariffs on imports from most countries, including key trade allies like Canada and the European Union.
Alcoa, which generated more than half its revenue outside the U.S. last year, has publicly said it doesn’t support the administration’s tariff decisions, and continues to say that Chinese overcapacity must be addressed. The company said rising raw-material and energy costs also contributed to losses from its Spanish operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a notice that it will consider seeking public comment on ways to ease the quarterly reporting burden on publicly-listed companies.
The notice, published late on Tuesday, comes two months after President Donald Trump asked the regulator to consider stepping back quarterly disclosures, saying on Twitter he had heard from business leaders it would ""allow greater flexibility & save money.""
The SEC said in a public notice that the Division of Corporation Finance was considering ""recommending that the commission seek public comment on ways to ease companies' compliance burdens while maintaining appropriate levels of disclosure and investor protection.""
However, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, last week told an audience in Washington that the regulator was in no rush to change quarterly reporting requirements for large publicly-traded companies.
""I don’t think quarterly reporting is going to change for our top names anytime soon,"" said Clayton. But he said the SEC could study the disclosure requirements for smaller firms.
A move to semiannual reporting would mark a significant shift from decades of quarterly reporting by American companies, and put the United States in line with European Union and United Kingdom rules. 
Less frequent reporting could result in lower costs for companies and remove short-term demands and expectations, according to some analysts. But others insist the quarterly system provides critical information to investors and reduces volatility in markets.

The notice does not commit the SEC to a policy change and any move to reduce disclosure would likely be hotly debated and may take months, if not years, to come to fruition.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Campbell heirs to vote for own board, Third Point calls move a 'stunt'","CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) said on Wednesday that four key shareholders, all descendants of the company's former chairman John Dorrance, have formally aligned themselves against hedge fund Third Point LLC's plans to oust the embattled soupmaker's entire board.
Third Point, which owns 7 percent of Campbell's stock, fired back hours later, accusing the heirs of trying to frighten smaller shareholders by suggesting that the outcome of a vote next month has been decided before it even takes place.
Campbell said Bennett Dorrance, Mary Alice Malone, Archbold van Beuren, Charlotte Weber and some other family members - who own a combined 41 percent stake in the company - plan to vote in favor of its existing board at a shareholder's meeting on Nov. 29.
This suggests it could be very difficult for Third Point, run by billionaire activist investor Daniel Loeb, to win board seats. 
""This group of billionaire heirs and heiresses are attempting to intimidate smaller shareholders by flaunting their inherited voting bloc as an impenetrable moat,"" Third Point said in a statement. 
Given that Dorrance, Malone and van Beuren serve on Campbell's board, it was widely expected that they would clash with Loeb's campaign, which alleges that the company has been mismanaged for years. 
Shares in Campbell were down 3.9 percent in morning trading. Third Point said the drop suggested shareholders were unhappy with these heirs' decision to back the current board.
The $18 billion hedge fund proposes replacing all directors with a 12 person-slate that includes George Strawbridge, another descendant of John Dorrance, who invented condensed soup and ran Campbell nearly a century ago.
Former Hostess Brands CEO William Toler and Third Point partner Munib Islam as well as marketing experts have also been nominated.
Each side is now fighting for shareholders' votes.
Campbell has said it does not endorse any of Third Point's nominees and is urging investors to re-elect its entire board, while Loeb is blaming the board for the stock's underperformance and is urging investors to back him.

The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",U.S. environmental agency says has been in talks with AB Volvo over emissions issue,"By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it has been in talks with Volvo over the last few weeks about an issue with their catalytic converters that was causing some vehicles to exceed nitrogen oxide emission limits.
Volvo warned a day earlier that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected.
The Swedish truckmaker said it could face material costs to deal with the issue largely affecting trucks and buses sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that it was working with authorities to find a solution.
A spokesperson for the EPA told Reuters via email on Wednesday that the body was aware of the situation, which it said involved Volvo heavy duty trucks.
""Over the last few weeks, EPA and the California Air Resources Board have been communicating with Volvo about the problem and are now continuing to meet with the company to develop plans to quickly address this situation.""
Asked why Volvo had waited a couple of weeks before informing the market, a Volvo spokesman said the company needed to see whether this would be a large issue and it was standard protocol to inform authorities first.
""Authorities and legal bodies are normally informed prior to the markets because we inform them even if the problem is very, very small,"" he said.
Volvo has not detailed when the affected trucks were sold or how many trucks are impacted, but has said only that all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery.
The company sold 51,693 trucks in North America last year and another 115,863 in Europe.
EPA and CARB declined to comment when asked how many trucks were involved, while a spokesman for Volvo said it was too early to know.
""We... are working with the company to more fully understand what's going on,"" a spokesman for CARB said in a brief separate comment, without giving more details.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",U.S. holiday hiring hits highest since 2014 as consumer confidence soars,"(Reuters) - Holiday hiring of more than 700,000 workers by U.S. retailers would be the largest since 2014, according to a report by a global outplacement firm, underscoring a robust economy that has seen consumer confidence at its highest in nearly two decades.
Retailers have said they would add 704,000 jobs in total to their rosters ahead of the important holiday shopping season, which is up 1.2 percent from the previous best figures in 2014, according to global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc in a report released on Wednesday. 
The firm began tracking holiday hiring data in 2012.
 Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Macy's lead the top retailers in hiring, signaling that sales at their stores would be charged by customers digging deep into their wallets. 
Overall sales for the holiday season - traditionally between Thanksgiving and Christmas - is expected to rise 4.3 to 4.8 percent to $717.45 billion and $720.89 billion, excluding autos, gasoline and dining out, according to the National Retail Federation.
""In a period of near full employment, retailers, logistics firms, transport, and warehousing are competing for talent and upping their employee offerings this holiday season to attract potential workers,"" said Andrew Challenger, vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.
Target boosted seasonal hires by 20 percent this year to 120,000, while Amazon expects to employ 100,000 workers. Macy's plans to employ 80,000 - the same as last year. 
Still, finding retail workers is proving to be difficult as unemployment rate hits a 49-year low and workers seek higher paying jobs. 
This resulted in Amazon announcing recently that it would raise the minimum wage for its U.S. employees to $15 per hour, a first among U.S. corporations. 

""All of this is good news for American workers, but it is not so good for retailers as some positions may go unfilled and retailers will have to offer more benefits and incentives to get people to work for them,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Gulfstream expects market growth in 2019 on new business jets: president,"By Allison Lampert
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Gulfstream Aerospace expects growth in both sales opportunities and deliveries next year, as the U.S. business jet maker brings two new large-cabin corporate planes to market, company President Mark Burns said on Wednesday.
Burns said in an interview that the entry into service of the company's new G500 and G600 business jets will drive market growth for Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics Corp. (N:GD) 
“I expect next year will be a growth year,” he said on the sidelines of the National Business Aviation Association annual corporate jet show in Orlando, Florida. ""We’re bringing two new airplanes to market at a time when the market is improving.”
After years of sluggish sales, potential buyers at the show are looking closely at new aircraft models with longer ranges and technology for smoother rides, while weighing the advantage of recent U.S. tax deductions. Hopes for new orders in the industry have also been underpinned by a dwindling supply of pre-owned aircraft.
Burns said he is confident that Gulfstream will meet its existing 2018 plans to deliver between 115 to 125 planes this year, although he could not be more specific ahead of the company's third-quarter earnings report next week. 
The G500 was certified in July and its first delivery was made in September. The slightly larger G600, which can fly nonstop from London to Los Angeles, is expected to be certified by year's end and enter service in 2019. 

A 10-year outlook by Honeywell Aerospace (N:HON) ahead of the convention forecasts up to 7,700 new business jet deliveries worth $251 billion from 2019 to 2028, up 1 percent to 2 percent from the 10-year forecast in 2017.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. watchdog threatens retaliation over EU clearing rules,"By Michelle Price and Huw Jones
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. banks and securities houses could be barred from trading on exchanges in the European Union if the bloc refuses to water down ""irresponsible"" proposals for regulating foreign clearing houses, a top U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.
Christopher Giancarlo, chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), gave his strongest warning yet on possible retaliatory measures if EU regulators insist on close supervision of U.S.-based clearing houses under new rules.
""In my talks with European authorities, I have asked them to reconsider such an expansive approach,"" Giancarlo told a derivatives industry event in Chicago in a rare direct attack on another regulator.
The new rules, which the bloc aims to approve before Britain leaves the EU next March, would mean that ""systemic"" foreign clearing houses could only serve customers in the EU if European regulators can jointly supervise them.
Giancarlo said the CFTC will not allow the firms it regulates to comply with conflicting and overly burdensome regulation from abroad.
""If a satisfactory resolution of this situation cannot be found, the CFTC will have no choice but to consider a range of readily available steps to protect U.S. markets and market participants,"" Giancarlo said.
The CFTC has ""strong and blunt"" tools it can deploy unilaterally as a last resort without new legislation, including the withdrawal of the exemptions that allow U.S. market participants to use trading platforms in the EU.
The watchdog has privately warned European officials that the bloc would suffer far more than the United States in an all-out clearing war because U.S. firms are much larger liquidity providers to European exchanges than vice versa, a person familiar with the discussions said.
The CFTC has so far received no indication from Brussels that it is willing to budge on its clearing proposal, despite the CFTC in recent weeks publicly pledging to move to a ""deference"" model of regulators accepting each other's rules to avoid duplication, this person added.
Retaliatory action would be a last resort, this person said.
TARGET LONDON
The proposed EU rules were prompted by Britain's decision to leave the bloc next March, targeting a core activity that helps make the City of London a top global financial center.
LCH, a unit of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), clears over 90 percent of euro-denominated interest rate swaps contracts used by companies to insure themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.
But U.S. clearing houses like CME and ICE clear transactions for EU customers as well. Giancarlo said this would mean on-going EU surveillance and on-site inspections, with the bloc ""dictating"" board composition and corporate governance.
EU officials have said they want similar access to foreign clearing houses that the CFTC and the U.S. Federal Reserve have with LCH’s dollar-denominated swaps clearing in London.
The CFTC has not given Brussels a deadline for responding but it does not anticipate that there would be much opportunity for the bloc to make changes once the EU legislation is passed in March, the same person said.

607,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>",Investors are doubling down on a trade that blew up in their faces earlier this year — here's what Morgan Stanley says they should do instead,"Sometimes old habits die hard.
That's definitely the case when it comes to one hot-button trade that still has legions of participants despite an ugly blowup earlier this year.
We're referring, of course, to volatility short selling. After a market shock in early February caught traders off guard and forced them to cover positions, billions of dollars were erased from popular investment products. Some even dissolved entirely.
That carnage, in turn, worsened widespread selling pressure as those investors covered shorts in droves. And all of a sudden, the market had a new black sheep.
Those traders don't appear to have learned their lesson. As the chart below shows, they've rebuilt a net short volatility position to rival the one seen before the February meltdown.
In fact, they went as far as to add to it during last week's market mayhem. The most recent weekly period in the chart ended Thursday, the day the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, reached a multimonth high.
Their hubris wound up costing them dearly last week, when the S&P 500 capped off a sharp six-day drop, pushing the VIX to 24.98, its highest since the mess eight months ago.
That cost volatility short sellers roughly $420 million, one expert told Bloomberg. It wasn't as bad as the February incident, which saw the VIX exceed 37, but it was still a tough pill to swallow for volatility bears.
Morgan Stanley is hardly a fan of the short-volatility trade. Strategists at the firm spoke out against it after last week's pan-market sell-off and accompanying volatility spike.
The firm argued that it could take five to six months to ""build up cushions"" against a reversion to the mean whenever there's a surge in price swings. Because of that, an increasingly volatile market can quickly undo progress.
Morgan Stanley is also cautiously watching the sudden rerating of so-called growth stocks — or companies seeing torrid earnings expansion. They say this is driving the ongoing uptick in volatility, which is hardly a fleeting trend, as traders increasingly pile into inexpensive value names instead.
These investors should instead be throwing in the towel on their beloved trade and going long volatility, Morgan Stanley says. The firm offers some specifics.
""Like in January, the equity market has been the most responsive to a sector rotation-driven drop,"" Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley's chief cross-asset strategist, wrote in a client note. ""We have liked owning hedges on Russell 2000, which tends to underperform S&P 500 in drawdowns. Credit vols have also risen but are still below average levels, again suitable for a long vol bias.""
That being said, common sense and expert advice haven't stopped short-volatility enthusiasts yet, and probably won't in the future. It's likely that they used the recent VIX spike to replenish their short positions — an inverse buy-the-dip strategy of sorts.
But their luck may soon run out, at least if a recent forecast from Bernstein comes true. Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, the firm's head of global and quantitative European equity strategy, thinks volatility will shift higher on a long-term basis.
It seems like a sound thesis based on how the past couple of years have played out. During 2017, the VIX averaged a record low of 11.10, implying that it had nowhere to go but up. Sure, it's still below its long-term average of 19.33, but any reversion to the mean would translate to more volatile conditions.
But if short-volatility traders have shown one quality over time, it's that they're a stubborn bunch. They're likely to go down swinging, no matter how dire the situation becomes."
608,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Big Netflix Beat Has Analysts Debating How High Stock Can Go,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is largely bullish on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).’s growth prospects as better-than-expected subscriber gains and an upbeat outlook reassured investors and sent the stock up as much as 9.7 percent. Many analysts boosted their price targets, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which said the shares should continue to outperform as the company’s cash burn approaches an inflection point. KeyBanc Capital Markets was less optimistic on the upside, noting that margin expansion and investment efficiency aren’t exceeding expectations.
Here’s what analysts are saying about the results:
Goldman Sachs, Heath P. Terry
“The correlation between content spend and subscriber net adds strengthened for the sixth consecutive quarter.”
“As Netflix subscriber adds continue to exceed expectations and it approaches an inflection point in cash profitability following the current investment period in advance of the loss of Disney content late next year, we believe shares of NFLX will continue to significantly outperform.”
Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $480, the highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, up from $430. The new price target implies 39 percent upside from the stock’s last closing price. The shares had already gained 80 percent on the year, through Tuesday.
Imperial Capital, David W. Miller
Netflix “easily surpassed its own bogeys” with third-quarter subscriber additions and fourth-quarter subscriber forecast that was well ahead of estimates.
“Overall technology-related expenses came in materially lower than we projected going in, and marketing expenses were $35.6mn below our estimates, which was one of the reasons for the mark-up after hours.”
Miller has an outperform rating on Netflix but trimmed his price target to $464 from $494, which had been the highest on Wall Street. He said the cut was due to a rate increase in his discounted cash flow analysis, “not because of anything fundamentally wrong” with Netflix.
Buckingham Research Group, Matthew Harrigan
“Increased spending largely offsets strong member momentum.”
Harrigan raised his price target on Netflix to $349 from $305 but maintained his underperform rating. “We feel that our revised price target generously accommodates a long arc for potential higher Asian growth while recognizing that 2019 operating margin and free cash flow burn actually worsens from our prior forecast off costs to achieve the incremental growth.”
KeyBanc, Andy Hargreaves
“Improving investment efficiency or significant ancillary opportunities” are required for Netflix’s stock to rise meaningfully from current levels, Hargreaves said in a report, cutting recommendation to sector weight from a previous overweight.
While the analysts continue to view Netflix’s strategic positioning favorably, they do not see either happening over the next year. Shares could reach fair value at $377, the report said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Benjamin Swinburne
Netflix is likely to see further growth in 2019 amid its successful expansion into new genres and growth in new geographies, analysts including Swinburne wrote in a report.
The company has “consistently reinvested its near-term success into deepening its competitive moat,” which has allowed it to find success in widely diverse markets around the world.
Netflix might add more than 25 million paid global subscribers again in 2019 and could become free cash flow positive in 2021. Morgan Stanley raised the price target to $475 from $450, just a day after cutting it from $480 before the earnings. The bank maintained its overweight rating.
RBC, Mark Mahaney
“Long-term fundamental trends remain very, very, very much intact,” Mahaney wrote in a report increasing the price target by $10 to $450, keeping the outperform rating. Netflix is about as close to an “open-ended growth” story as you can find in today’s market, he said.
Not only is the company’s consumer value proposition “compelling”, global subscriber additions and streaming revenue are “accelerating”, and it has pricing power and expanding corporate margins, the analyst said.
Cowen, John Blackledge
“Set-top box integrations and bundling deals that are likely aiding in increased uptake among late adopters,” analysts led by Blackledge said in a note. He raised the price target by $30 to $430, keeping his outperform rating.
Stifel, Scott Devitt
Stifel expects to get more granularity on Netflix’s 2019 expense plans by line item next quarter, while the company will see easier expense comparisons in 2019 given the push toward self-produced content and content-specific marketing ramp-up in 2018.
Devitt estimates steady domestic growth and accelerating international momentum will help attract 29 million clients also next year. He kept his buy rating, raising his price target to $474 from $395.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",Danske Bank forced to resume CEO search after regulator's rejection,"By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), reeling from a money laundering scandal, will resume its search for a new chief executive after a Danish regulator rejected its internal candidate for the job, and analysts said it would be forced to look outside the bank.
Jacob Aarup-Andersen, 40, the Danske board's choice to take over the helm of Denmark's biggest bank, was rejected by the country's financial regulator on the grounds that he wasn't experienced enough.
The previous CEO, Thomas Borgen, was ousted last month as the group struggles to deal with a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal that has prompted several criminal investigations and spooked investors.
Aarup-Andersen joined Danske from Danica Pension in 2016 as chief financial officer and has been head of wealth management since May.
While the regulator found he was ""well qualified in many areas"", it added ""longer experience, including within certain of Danske Bank's business areas, is needed,"" the bank said.
""The Board of Directors unanimously backed Jacob Aarup-Andersen as new CEO, knowing full well that longer experience in certain areas would have been desirable,"" said Chairman Ole Andersen in a statement, adding that the board was now talking to other potential candidates.
The financial watchdog's unusual move to block the decision raises the pressure on Danske Bank's board.
""This can't be interpreted as anything other than a slap in the face,"" said Per Hansen, economist at investment firm Nordnet. However, he did not think the chairman was likely to step down before a new CEO is found.
Danske Bank will now have to look for an external candidate, possibly from outside Denmark, said Sydbank analyst Mikkel Emil Jensen. ""There are no more internal candidates left,"" he said.
RISK HARD TO MEASURE
However, the task will be difficult as the full magnitude of the money laundering scandal and potential fines is yet to be uncovered.
""There is no one who can quantify the risk that Danske Bank is in and a future CEO won't be able to quantify the work-related risk either, that is a big challenge,"" said Peter Lundgreen, CEO of investment advisory firm Lundgreen's Capital.
Other names mentioned by analysts and media outlets as possible candidates are the CEO of Danish mortgage lender Nykredit, Michael Rasmussen; the head of European Fixed Income and Commodities at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Jakob Horder; and Annika Falkengren, who is the former CEO of Swedish bank SEB (ST:SEBa) and a partner in Swiss bank Lombard Odier.
Danske Bank shares hit a four-year low this month after the bank said it faced a U.S. criminal investigation into a money laundering scandal at its Estonian branch. The shares are down more than 40 percent this year.
Rating agency Moody's said last week it has downgraded all of Danske's long-term debt ratings because of the criminal investigation into the bank by the U.S. Department of Justice.
It followed similar moves by rating agencies DBRS, S&P and Fitch.
Jesper Nielsen, who was the head of Danske Bank's domestic banking business, will stay on as interim CEO.
Former CEO Borgen quit after an internal inquiry found that payments totaling 200 billion euros, many of which Danske Bank said were suspicious, had been moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.

Shares in Danske were trading down 2.1 percent at 138.7 Danish crowns at 1156 GMT on Wednesday.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 09:22AM ET</span>",Netflix shares jump as Wall Street applauds record subscriber growth,"(Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) soared 11 percent before the bell on Wednesday, after the company put fears of a slowdown in growth to bed by racking up seven million new subscribers between July and September.
The video streaming pioneer shocked Wall Street last quarter by falling short of new subscriber estimates, but Tuesday's figures put its total customer base at 137 million worldwide, two million more than consensus forecasts.
At least 15 brokerages raised price targets on the stock, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Raymond James, raising them just two days after trimming.
""We don't believe in 'open-ended growth stories.' But, darn, (Netflix) is about as close to one as you can find in today's market,"" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said in a note.
Goldman Sachs raised its price target by $50 to $480. The brokerage had earlier cut the price target to $430 from $470.
Netflix shares have gained about 81 percent this year and are worth six times what they were at the start of 2015, a reflection of the overwhelming faith investors have in the company's lead in video streaming. 
Some have begun to question, however, whether Netflix's business model is as durable as the share price action suggests, given the huge investments the company has begun to make in its own content, and burgeoning competition.
Analysts from U.S. financial group Keybanc downgraded their rating on Netflix to ""sector weight"" from ""overweight"", questioning whether the company was capable of improving investment returns and margins in years to come. 
Shares of the company were up 10 percent at $381.21 before the bell.
BIGGER PROFILE IN INDIA 
The company exceeded forecasts in both U.S. and international markets but the bulk of the new subscribers came from outside the United States, where the company has been investing aggressively. 
Analysts pointed to ""solid trends"" in India, where the success of homegrown shows like Sacred Games and Ghoul have helped raise its profile and hopes for future growth in the developing world's most populous markets.
""(Netflix) shies away from talking about any one international market too specifically, but it called out growth in Asia, and we believe India is becoming a bigger factor,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth.
""Traction in India for Sacred Games has been strong, along with additional local content Lust Stories, & Ghoul,"" he added.
Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter was another skeptic, saying he was ""mystified by the investor love affair with Netflix’s India opportunity"", pointing to price differences in Netflix's monthly plans versus cable TV in the country.

""We find it fascinating that investors expect Indian households to spend more on Netflix than they spend on cable TV or cell phones, and to spend nearly as much as they spend on broadband,"" Pachter said.

621,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Siemens may have to share big Iraq power contract with GE - Financial Times,"ZURICH (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) may have to share a multi-billion dollar deal with U.S. rival  General Electric  (N:GE) to improve Iraq's energy supply system following an intervention by President Donald Trump's administration, The Financial Times reported on Wednesday.
The U.S. government intervened in favor of GE and put pressure on the Baghdad government, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Although no decision has been made, Siemens had been the favorite to win the contract to supply 11 gigawatts of power generation equipment to Iraq in a deal reported to be worth around $15 billion.
But the Trump administration reminded the Iraqi government that 7,000 U.S. personnel had died since the 2003 invasion which overthrew Saddam Hussein, the people said.
GE, which has been battling a severe downturn in its power division, is now expected to take a substantial part of the sale, which could be included in its figures when it reports its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 30.
GE was not immediately available for comment. 
Siemens has not given up hope of gaining a slice of the contract.
""Our discussions with the government are continuing and we look forward to entering an official agreement to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for Iraq,"" a Siemens spokesman said.
Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser had traveled to Iraq in September and spoke with outgoing Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi about the contract.
Since then Abadi has been replaced by Adel Abdul-Mahdi. Meanwhile U.S. pressure in favor of GE has intensified, the report said.
In February Siemens made an offer to build new power plants in Iraq over four years with an output of 11 gigawatts. Such an increase in energy production would increase the number of Iraqis who have access to reliable electricity by 50 percent to 23 million.
The value to Siemens could be worth around 11 billion euros ($12.70 billion), and would support its ailing energy division, whose profit has slumped 60 percent in the first three quarters of this year.
""The Iraq Roadmap is a top priority for Siemens and we are fully committed to it,"" a Siemens spokesman said.
""We had submitted our roadmap document for repowering Iraq to the Iraqi government in February. Since then, we have had a series of meetings and positive feedback from the government for the development of power infrastructure in the country.""

624,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Express Scripts covers Amgen, Lilly migraine therapies, excludes Teva drug","By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX), one of the largest U.S. prescription benefits managers, will cover new migraine drugs from Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), but is excluding a rival medication made by Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) after price negotiations with all three manufacturers. The decision represents a setback for Teva, which is in the midst of a corporate restructuring and had hoped to capture a sizable stake of the multibillion-dollar migraine market. Express Scripts is also taking steps to limit use to the patients it says are most likely to benefit from the new Amgen and Lilly migraine drugs. 
Pharmacy benefits managers like Express Scripts are taking more aggressive action to lower the cost of prescription drugs for their clients, large employers who pay for health benefits for their workers. The new migraine drugs were approved for the U.S. market within a few months of each other this year. That gave Express Scripts more leverage in demanding a discount in exchange for putting a therapy on its “formulary,” or list of covered drugs. ""These products are fairly interchangeable,"" Harold Carter, clinical solutions director at Express Scripts, told Reuters. ""It comes down to manufacturers providing the best value to be on the formulary."" He acknowledged that price rebates played a role in determining coverage status, but declined to comment on the level of rebating.
In May, Amgen and marketing partner  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) won U.S. regulatory approval for Aimovig, an injected drug designed to interfere with a process that helps kick off migraine headaches. Teva's Ajovy and Lilly's Emgality were approved last month. The three drugs work in a similar manner and represent an improvement over existing treatments: in clinical trials they significantly reduced migraine frequency in about half of patients.
Wei-Li Shao, vice president of neuroscience at Eli Lilly, told Reuters last month that discounts and rebates for the migraine drug would be negotiated with insurers and other payers. Brendan O’Grady, head of Teva's North America commercial operations, declined to comment on talks with payers, while executives at Amgen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
All three drugs have a list price of $575 a month, or $6,900 a year. Geoffrey Porges, biotech analyst at Wall Street investment bank Leerink Partners, told Reuters he expects the drugmakers will need to offer rebates of at least 30 percent for the new migraine class to be covered by insurance. Express Scripts already lists Amgen's Aimovig as a preferred treatment on its largest formulary, but requires that patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs used to treat acute migraine. Lilly's Emgality will be covered under the same terms. Amgen and Lilly will also begin next April to refund part of the drug cost if a migraine patient stops treatment within 90 days, indicating that the medication does not work for them or causes too many side effects. That refund, between 25 and 30 percent of the drugs' list price, would be returned to clients of Express Scripts, and comes in addition to the rebates the pharmacy benefit manager has already negotiated.

39 MILLION MIGRAINE SUFFERERS ""Everyone in the chain is taking some accountability for the cost of the drug,"" Carter said, adding that the refund means the manufacturers are sharing financial risk if the drugs do not work as well as claimed. Around 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Worldwide migraine drug sales could reach $8.7 billion by 2026, according to analytics firm GlobalData. But Carter estimated that only about 128,000 of the 83 million people who get their prescription drug benefits through Express Scripts will be good candidates for the migraine-prevention drugs. Under the Migraine Care Value program that will launch next April, Express Scripts will have its specially trained pharmacists, nurses and other staff assess appropriate care and access to therapies for patients. The pharmacy benefit manager, which is being acquired by  Cigna Corp  (N:CI), created a similar program in 2015 that sharply limited the use of two novel, and expensive, cholesterol drugs - from Amgen and partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY). For the new migraine drugs ""the challenges will likely be right out of the gate, seeing if patients are responding to the therapy,"" Carter said. The drugmakers have already tried to pre-empt efforts to limit access to the new migraine treatments. Amgen and Lilly are providing two months’ supply of the drug for free directly to patients. All three companies have plans to pay nearly all of an individual’s out of pocket costs under a commercial insurance plan. In addition, Amgen and Lilly have temporary programs to supply the treatments to patients who are covered by commercial insurance, but are still having trouble getting reimbursed. Some large health insurers, such as Anthem Inc (N:ANTM), have similar coverage terms for Aimovig, requiring patients to document how they suffer from a defined number of headaches each month, and show that they have tried older migraine drugs first. Others, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in states like Pennsylvania and Kansas, only cover prescriptions for the new drugs from - or in consultation with - a neurologist or headache specialist, and not a primary care doctor. Some plans have not yet determined coverage terms, meaning each prescription has to go through a lengthy review process.

(Reuters) - Sprint Corp (N:S) has sold the mobile data and advertising company it created in 2012 to InMobi, which provides technology for marketers, in an all-stock deal, the companies said on Wednesday. 
The fourth-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers is selling the company called Pinsight Media as it awaits regulatory approval to sell itself to larger rival T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS). The value of the Pinsight deal was not disclosed. 
Pinsight uses data from wireless carriers to help companies better target ads on smartphones to the right audiences. That use of data was one major reason for AT&T Inc's (N:T) acquisition of media company Time Warner, which closed in June.
Pinsight will continue to work with Sprint after the deal, said Rob Roy, Sprint's chief digital officer, in a statement. 
Sprint's sale of Pinsight comes as mobile advertising in the United States is expected to surpass television ad spending by more than $6 billion this year, according to eMarketer. The research firm estimates the gap will widen even more by 2022, with mobile spending at $141 billion compared to $68 billion on TV. 
Former Pinsight Chief Executive Kevin McGinnis said in 2015 that the company hoped to grow to a $1 billion business.

InMobi and Pinsight did not respond to requests for comment on whether Pinsight had reached that goal. Sprint declined to comment.

629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Saudi Tensions Add to Dubai Stock's Worst Year Since 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders are running out of reasons to stay in Dubai’s stock market as it heads for its worst year since the 2008 debt crisis.
Dubai’s main equities gauge has lost 19 percent this year, pressured mostly by real-estate developers. The index is now caught between increasing geopolitical woes centering around its neighbor Saudi Arabia and those emanating from global emerging markets.
Saudi Arabia’s main index was up 1.8 percent for the week as of 1:26 p.m. in Riyadh on Wednesday. That followed a slump on Sunday amid the growing diplomatic row over the disappearance of Saudi column-writer Jamal Khashoggi, and analysts speculated that government-related funds were subsequently used to boost the securities. In Dubai, the benchmark is still down 0.5 percent for the week.
The recent events involving Khashoggi’s disappearance, “the strength of the reaction by the U.S., and also the market move, showed we are dealing with a totally different ball game,” said Ami Kemppainen, a money manager at Terra Nova Capital Advisors Ltd. in Dubai. When looking at the spillover effect from emerging-market woes and geopolitical matters in the region, Dubai could be caught “in a double whammy,” he said.
Saudi Arabia understands the need to conclude its investigation into the disappearance of Khashoggi in a timely and rapid fashion, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday.
Low Volumes
Economic activity in the emirate has been lagging as real-estate prices dropped and domestic demand faltered, prompting the government to announce measures to stimulate growth. A Dubai economy tracker index, compiled by Emirates NBD PJSC, showed in September the slowest rate of expansion since April.
“Traditional growth engines of the Dubai economy such as real estate, trade, transport and hospitality, have remained weak this year,” said M.R. Raghu, the head of research at Kuwait Financial Centre SAK, which manages more than $3 billion. “Business sentiment has remained subdued.”
Last month, S&P Global Ratings cut the creditworthiness of the emirate’s utility monopoly and a company that owns properties in the financial center, saying that deteriorating “credit conditions” may affect the ability to provide support to the firms.
Some other metrics of Dubai’s stock market at the moment:
Recovery Efforts
But there are signs of hope. The U.A.E. government has been stepping up attempts to foster longer-term growth, which could boost sentiment in the stock market. Last month, it said it would allow foreigners, who comprise the bulk of the population, to obtain extended residency visas after they retire.
The economy is likely to turn a corner next year with Dubai’s Expo 2020 infrastructure projects, changes to visa rules and increased government spending, according to Kuwait Financial Centre’s Raghu.
“Subsequent improvements in the earnings could “prop up the market,” he said.
Dubai’s market “has been a disappointment to investors so far in 2018,” said James Johnstone, the Miami-based co-head of emerging and frontier markets at RWC Partners, which invests in the sheikhdom’s stocks. “However, valuations look very attractive now in property and bank stocks, and I would expect to see the market recover sharply in 2019.”

630,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Cannabis Goes Legal in Canada as Investors Ride Stocks Higher,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s drive to legalize marijuana kicks off early Wednesday with store openings on the Atlantic Coast, giving the country a massive head start in developing a global pot market that some analysts peg at $150 billion.
Stores in St. John’s, Newfoundland are set to be the first to sell recreational cannabis, with some planning to open at 12:01 a.m. local time, followed by more than 100 outlets and websites opening across the country of 37 million people. It’s an historic moment for an industry that has rapidly moved from the fringe to the mainstream.
“The eyes of the world are on are Canada and Canadians should feel very proud, because people have been fighting for decades to make this moment a reality,” said Brendan Kennedy, chief executive officer of Tilray Inc., the largest cannabis company by market value.
Canada is the second country in the world to legalize recreational pot nationally after Uruguay. As a result, it has become thefront-runner in the global cannabis industry, expected to reach $32 billion in consumer spending alone by 2022, according to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. The entire global market, meanwhile, could eventually be worth $150 billion, according to estimates from Roth Capital Partners.
Medical marijuana has been legal in Canada since 2001 but it’s only been about four years since the first cannabis companies began to list on Canadian exchanges. In that short time, about 140 pot companies have gone public in Canada, with a combined market value of more than C$60 billion ($48 billion).
Parties are planned across the country to usher in the dawn of so-called Green Day. In small towns like Smiths Falls, Ontario, home to Canopy Growth Corp., executives and employees will celebrate together, while several events are being planned in Toronto, including smoke-outs, ""pop-up"" venues by marijuana companies, parties and other gatherings that start in the morning and carry into the evening.
In Quebec, the government-controlled Societe Quebecoise du Cannabis plans to offer about 110 products at the dozen stores that are ready for Day 1. The number of locations could grow to as many as 150 within three years, the company estimates.
“We are very ready,” Jean-Francois Bergeron, a vice-president at the liquor control board that’s overseeing the new entity, told reporters Tuesday. “We have inventory, we have the stock on site, we have all the points of sale ready to kick in, employees are trained.”He said Quebec is prepared because it signed its supply agreements six months ago and has about 90 percent of the products listed.
Because cannabis remains federally illegal in the U.S., Canada’s investment bankers do most of the industry’s deals and its stock exchanges list most of the industry’s stocks. This has been a boon for the country as cannabis stocks have rocketed higher, drawing comparisons to cryptocurrency and the dot-com bubble. Since Canopy Growth announced a $3.8 billion investment from alcohol giant Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ). in mid-August, investors have piled into the sector, sending the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF up by 70 percent.
Individual stocks have posted even more outsized gains, with investor darling Tilray gaining more than 800 percent since its July IPO. Tilray’s market value is almost $15 billion, bigger than Campbell Soup Co. and on revenue of just $9.7 million in its last quarter.
Whatever your view on pot stocks, the world seems fascinated by Canada’s legalization experiment.
“I think it’s a very important moment in the history of this movement,” Adam Bierman, CEO of U.S. cannabis retailer MedMen Enterprises Inc., said in an interview. “The whole nation is watching.”
Supply Challenges
Still, the rollout of legal cannabis sales isn’t expected to be totally smooth. Aphria Inc. CEO Vic Neufeld said he expects supply shortages in the early stages of adult use as licensed producers struggle to meet demand. Only a handful of retail locations were up and running on Oct. 17, including just one store in British Columbia and none in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province where only online sales will be allowed. And the black market is expected to stay in business, as the supply of legal pot will meet only 30 percent to 60 percent of demand after legalization, according to a study by researchers at the University of Waterloo and the C.D. Howe Institute.
Kennedy predicted that legalization in Canada will follow the same trajectory as in states like Colorado, Oregon and California, with inevitable supply shortages in the early days.
“We’ve seen that everywhere,” he said. “Most adult-use programs are supply constrained at the outset but ramp up and reach an equilibrium between supply and demand in the first 6 to 12 months.”
He also expects another country to follow suit with recreational legalization in the next year.

Europe's autos sector (SXAP) is already down 6 percent this month and is on track for its worst year since 2011 as a global trade dispute drove investors to dump a sector vulnerable to higher tariffs threatened by the United States.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares inched higher on Wednesday led by technology stocks, as some upbeat earning updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML buoyed sentiment following a turbulent start to the month.
Investors however remained cautious after the region's equities hit a 22-month low last week when jitters over rising U.S. bond yields, geopolitical worries and signs of an economic slowdown rattled global markets.
After hitting a one-week high in opening deals, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index pared some gains and was up only 0.1 percent by 0827 GMT. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) index turned negative, weighed by losses in the trade-exposed auto sector, which fell 1.2 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it viewed the third quarter as a challenging time for the industry. 
Disappointing results from Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) also weighed.
""We still have a lot of uncertainty... The situation is certainly not brilliant but probably not as bad as feared a few days ago,"" said Gerhard Schwarz, Head of Equity & Cross Asset Strategy at Baader Bank in Munich.
""We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift,"" he said. 
ASML (AS:ASML) shares rose 5.9 percent after the Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly earnings, easing worries over a slowdown in the semiconductor market. 
ING analysts called the results ""a very comforting update"". 
The company said demand for memory and logic chips remains healthy and it expects further growth in 2019. That helped to lift shares in other tech companies and sent their sectoral index (SX8P) up 1.8 percent.
Among top gainers following results were also UK publisher  Pearson  (L:PSON) and paints maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO), both up around 3 percent, while drugs giant Roche (S:ROG) was flat after a modest sales beat in the third quarter. 
Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) sank 15 percent after the German dialysis specialist cut its 2018 sales and profit targets following a poor performance at its US business. 
Yoghurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO) also disappointed. Its shares fell 3.5 percent after quarterly sales growth slowed sharply, reflecting falling sales of its infant formula products in China and troubles from a consumer boycott in Morocco.
In autos, shares in  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) fell between 2.3 and 1 percent.
Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES data, as analysts have been downgrading their forecasts. 

Euro zone earnings growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent.

The sprawling Tata conglomerate includes manufacturing, defense, aerospace, services and steel operations.
Tata bought ailing Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in 2008 and has plowed billions of pounds into the firm, making it Britain's biggest automotive company producing nearly one of three cars made in the country.
However in recent months the company has seen its sales hit by a weakening performance in major market China and a crackdown on diesel in Europe, prompting it to cut output. 
Chief Executive Ralf Speth has also warned about the risks of Brexit, saying a bad deal could cost around 1.2 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) annually and warning he did not know whether his plants could operate after Britain's exit from the bloc in six months' time.
""Ratan, the PM and Greg met about three weeks ago,"" a British government source told Reuters.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 02:07AM ET</span>",Fujifilm wins appeal in battle with Xerox over aborted merger,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) has won an appeal in its legal battles with  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX), with a New York court overturning preliminary injunctions requested by an activist investor that had blocked their planned merger.
Xerox in May scrapped a $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also handed control of the U.S. photocopier giant to new management.
The ruling by the New York State Appellate Court could give the Japanese firm leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table. Fujifilm is also suing Xerox in a separate U.S. suit that seeks well over $1 billion, accusing it of breach of contract in abandoning the deal.
Its chances of success are, however, unclear as Xerox's new management, backed by Icahn and Deason, is opposed to the proposed merger. Analysts have said the only way for Fujifilm to gain any traction with Xerox now is to raise its offer.
Fujifilm said in a statement it stands by its view that the original planned merger remains the best option for the shareholders of both companies.
""(The) Court's decision will allow us to discuss with Xerox the fulfillment of the original agreement. All Xerox shareholders ought to be able to decide for themselves the operational, financial, and strategic merits of the transaction to combine Fuji Xerox and Xerox,"" it said.
The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U.S. firm was being undervalued, to launch a proxy fight.
Representatives for Xerox, Deason and Icahn were not immediately available for comment.
The New York court found in its Oct. 16 ruling that Xerox's former CEO Jeff Jacobson, accused by Deason of negotiating the deal to save his own job, had neither misled or misinformed the board.
""The board, which engaged outside advisors and discussed the proposed transaction on numerous occasions prior to voting on agreeing to present it to the shareholders, did not engage in a mere post hoc review, nor was the transaction unreasonable on its face,"" the ruling also said.
The bitter legal wrangling has created much uncertainty for the two firms which are seen by many analysts as inextricably intertwined through their Fuji Xerox joint venture.
The venture accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm's revenue while Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox.
Xerox has said it would start sourcing products from new vendors for sale directly to customers in Fuji Xerox's primary Asia-Pacific market.
The U.S. firm is now led by John Visentin who worked as a consultant to Icahn in the proxy fight and just this month it appointed Louie Pastor, previously deputy general counsel at Icahn Enterprises, as general counsel. 
Fujifilm Chief Executive Shigetaka Komori said in June the company was ""not opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board"" but added many of its shareholders were demanding that its money would be better off spent on its healthcare businesses.
""The latest ruling is a step forward for Fujifilm to make the deal happen,"" said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan who believes Fujifilm should focus on healthcare. ""But concerns remain about whether taking over Xerox is the right step for the company.""

Fujifilm's shares were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trade, in line with the broader market.

The Partnership on AI (PAI), which counts Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) as members, is a body that develops ethical guidelines for AI research, including ensuring research does not violate international conventions or human rights.
Last year China's industry ministry named Baidu as one of four national AI champions, and the search firm has invested heavily in autonomous driving and deep learning in recent years.
""Baidu's admission represents the beginning of PAI's entrance into China. We will continue to add new members in China and around the world as we grow,"" said PAI in a statement on Tuesday.
The inclusion of Baidu in the group comes as Chinese and U.S. companies are looking to ramp up cooperation on AI, despite a looming political scuffle between the U.S. and China over technology transfers. 
Last year China laid out a roadmap to become a world leader in AI by 2025, with plans to invest roughly $400 billion in the industry in the coming years.
The ambitions have rankled the U.S. government, which has discussed plans to bolster security reviews of cutting-edge technology, including AI, over fears that China could access technology of strategic military importance.
China's AI roadmap encourages technology sharing between private, public and military research groups. 
Despite the clash, U.S. companies have expanded their AI presence in China while Baidu and other Chinese firms have launched AI research labs in the United States. 
Last month China's cyber ministry hosted Google, Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) at its annual AI forum. All three companies have launched AI research labs in China over the past year, despite tightening censorship and data restrictions that limit the companies' involvement in the market.

At the forum, top government officials stressed that China's development of AI technology would be ethically conducted, adding that they have plans to retrain workers who lose their jobs to AI.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 12:33AM ET</span>",U.S. oil service firms face tough quarter despite high crude prices,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Even as crude prices hover near four-year highs, U.S. oilfield service firms' third-quarter results due out in coming days will reflect a shaky recovery, as their customers face drilling constraints and pressure to hold down spending.
Oil producers are holding off finishing new wells, and cost pressures from tight labor markets and U.S. tariffs on imported steel are driving up service firms' costs.
Meanwhile, shale producers including  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN) and  Oasis Petroleum  Inc (N:OAS) are doing more work traditionally handled by service companies.
The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region's infrastructure with oil production -driving up costs, depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of production growth.
""The risk for a number of (oilfield service) firms is to the downside,"" said Brad Handler, a Jefferies equity analyst in New York who follows the oilfield service sector.
Wall Street is trimming earnings forecasts for oilfield market leaders' Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) and  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), and for pressure pumper  Keane Group Inc  (N:FRAC) and sand provider  U.S. Silica Holdings Inc  (N:SLCA). Schlumberger kicks off third-quarter reporting by the sector on Friday.
The cuts are coming despite third-quarter oil prices (CLc1) that are up more than 40 percent from a year earlier.
Schlumberger is expected to report a profit of 47 cents a share, up from 39 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Halliburton's per share profit is expected to be 49 cents, compared with 42 cents a year ago.
(For a graphic of oilfield service shares compared with the U.S. crude benchmark, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PAkhe3 )
Weakness in completing wells is worrisome because such services have carried the day for firms still waiting for offshore drilling to pick up.
Completing a well by fracking and tying it to pipelines represents about 60 percent of onshore well expenditures. With producers holding off completions until new pipelines start up next year, there is less demand for services.
""The market for frac spreads is very soft, below even what we started in 2018,"" Bill Thomas, chief executive of EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG), told investors at a New York conference last month.
The number of active hydraulic fracturing spreads or fleets in the Permian, the largest oilfield in the United States, has fallen to 172 from 192 earlier this year, and such fleets active across the U.S. have dropped to 460 from a peak of 480, according to data provider Primary Vision.
""Lower utilization and increased completion efficiencies is creating more slack in the system, with pressure pumpers most at risk heading into year end,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note this month.
Producers' unwillingness to raise spending despite higher oil prices also is taking a toll. Analysts at Barclays estimate that more than 80 percent of producer upstream budgets soon will be tapped out if third quarter spending was similar to the second quarter's.
Bernstein analysts estimate there could be a 15 percent further decline in fracking activity, but they expect the market to bottom early next year.

""There is still risk of further declines as we approach winter and roll into the new E&P (exploration and production) budget cycle,"" Colin Davies, a senior analyst for Bernstein wrote in a note.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - SoftBank Group (T:9984) Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure said on Tuesday it is ""business at usual"" at companies backed by its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund despite a tense situation with Saudi Arabia, which provided nearly half of the fund's capital.
Claure spoke at a technology conference in San Jose, California for British chip design firm Arm Holdings, which was acquired by SoftBank Group in 2016 for $32 billion. Claure said SoftBank is ""anxiously looking at what is happening"" regarding the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week.
""We, like most parties in the world, are watching events unfold,"" Claure said. ""We are just monitoring.""
SoftBank's $93 billion Vision Fund has become one of the primary funding vehicles for technology companies around the world. Saudi Arabia provided $45 billion for the fund, and unease over SoftBank's ties to the kingdom dragged down its shares earlier this week.
The shares recovered 2.88 percent to 9,862 yen by midday on Wednesday, but were still down around 8 percent from a month earlier.
SoftBank is also raising a second $100 billion Vision Fund. Earlier this month, Saudi Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg that the country's Public Investment Fund would contribute $45 billion to the second Vision Fund. Claure declined to comment to reporters on whether SoftBank would accept the capital if it were offered.
""There's no certainty,"" he said. ""We don't have a date"" for the closing of the second Vision Fund, he said.
The Vision Fund acquired a 25 percent stake in Arm from SoftBank last year, among the fund's largest deals to date for SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son. The British chip design firm licenses its technology to chipmakers such as  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and phone makers such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to power mobile devices and other technologies. The companies' chip designs have begun working their way into data centers, where they compete with  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).
Arm Chief Executive Simon Segars said the company has been able to expand rapidly under SoftBank's ownership, hiring 2,000 people in the past two years for a total of 6,000 employees.
He said Arm was still profitable but less so than when it was a public company and was working with other SoftBank Vision Fund Firms, for example by striking a deal with SoftBank-backed Sprint Corp (N:S) around so-called internet of things technology. 

""That saves Sprint from engineering something very similar to what we already had. That lets us both go faster,"" Segars said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers from across the world have called for amendments and a two-year delay to a change in accounting rules aimed at increasing visibility of how they earn their money.
Nine national and regional insurance industry bodies from Europe, Canada, Korea, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa want the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to amend and delay its ""IFRS 17"" book-keeping rule by two years to January 2023.
Twenty years in the making, the rule seeks to make it easier for investors to compare how much insurers earn from policies by prising open a ""black box"" of opaque national practices. IASB rules are used in over 100 countries, though the United States has its own accounting standards.
The industry bodies said in a letter to the IASB that preparatory work has confirmed that a number of important issues need to be resolved to make the new rule practical.
""As a result, we strongly believe a two-year delay in the effective date of the standard is required,"" the letter to IASB chair Hans Hoogervorst said.
""There is no expectation that a delay will result in insurers stopping or slowing their implementation project.""
The CFO Forum of chief financial officers from major European insurers like Allianz (DE:ALVG),  Aviva  (LON:AV), Generali (MI:GASI) and Axa has said the new rule leads to inconsistent reporting, and requirements that are unnecessarily complex.
Implementation costs range from 50 million euros to 320 million euros per CFO Forum member, it said, with ongoing operational costs expected to be significantly greater than for applying existing insurance book-keeping rules.
The IASB board will discuss staff reports about a potential delay and amendments next week, but no decision is expected at that time.
""In determining what amendments, if any, to make to IFRS 17, the board will need to balance the potential benefit of any amendments against the effect of an undue delay to a standard that is needed to address many inadequacies in the existing wide range of insurance accounting practices,"" an IASB staff paper for the meeting said.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 08:32PM ET</span>",Netflix record subscriber growth dispels Wall Street worries,"By Lisa Richwine and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) hooked 7 million new streaming subscribers from July to September, a third more than Wall Street had expected, reassuring investors who had worried the company was facing a slowdown in its fast-paced growth.
The record number of additions in the third quarter brought Netflix's customer base to 137 million worldwide, confirming its rank as by far the world's biggest online subscription video service. 
Netflix shares, already up about 78 percent so far this year, jumped 14 percent to $394.25 in after-hours trading, and boosted other high-tech stocks. 
The leap in subscribers marked a sharp turnaround from three months ago, when investors sent Netflix shares tumbling 14 percent after it missed Wall Street's subscriber growth targets. 
""The question at the end of Q2 was whether that miss was an aberration or signs of a longer-term slowdown in the business,"" said Forrester Research analyst Jim Nail. ""The answer: an aberration, likely the results of a somewhat low volume of new content last quarter.""
Netflix's results sent shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) up about 1 percent higher in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies that in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years. 
HIGH CONFIDENCE 
Netflix is investing more than $8 billion in entertainment programming this year to lure new customers around the world. In the third quarter, it released its largest slate of original TV shows and movies to date, including new seasons of hits such as ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""BoJack Horseman."" 
That paid off in terms of new subscribers. Wall Street analysts had expected Netflix to add about 5.2 million streaming customers in the quarter. 
The company exceeded forecasts in both U.S. and international markets. Netflix said it signed up roughly 1.1 million subscribers in the United States, above analysts' estimate of 674,000, according to Refinitiv. Its international business added nearly 5.9 million subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 4.5 million.
In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it saw ""strong growth broadly across all our markets including Asia.""
Executives said audiences welcomed shows tailored to specific markets, such as ""Sacred Games"" in India, which the company identified as key to its expansion.
""We feel like we have a long, long runway ahead of us in India,"" Greg Peters, chief product officer, said in a post-earnings video interview.
For the current quarter, Netflix forecast it will add 1.8 million customers in the United States and 7.6 million in international markets.
""We want to assure investors that we have the same high confidence in the underlying economics as our cash investments in the past,"" Netflix said in its letter. 
COMPETITION 
During the September quarter, Netflix added about 676 hours of original programming in the United States, a 135 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Cowen and Co analysts.
Netflix has been borrowing heavily to fund such rapid growth in TV shows and movies. It has issued a net $7.5 billion of bonds in less than three years, though that could carry a cost in a changing economic environment.
""Rising interest rates could make Netflix increasingly vulnerable to higher cost of capital,"" CFRA research analyst Tuna Amobi said.
At the same time, Netflix faces competition from deep-pocketed companies such as Amazon and new streaming services from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) that are expected late next year.
Netflix said it expects operating margins at the lower end of the 10 percent to 11 percent range for the full year 2018. It cut its projection of negative cash flow to closer to $3 billion. The company had previously projected $3 billion to minus $4 billion. 
Neil Begley, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, estimated that Netflix may spend closer to $9 billion on content this year, but he said keeping negative free cash flow to about $3 billion would not change the company's capital needs.
""It’ll probably still be the case that they’re going to stick to raising debt twice a year,"" he said.
Netflix's net income rose to $402.8 million, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $129.6 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat analysts' average estimate of 68 cents, according to Refinitiv. 

Total revenue rose to $4 billion, in line with analysts' expectations, from $2.98 billion a year earlier.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 07:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. Steel workers set to get biggest pay raise in years - sources,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United States Steel Corp (N:X) workers are set to get the biggest wage jump in at least six years under a new deal negotiated with the company, providing early signs that gains from U.S. President Donald Trump's clampdown on foreign imports are finally trickling down. 
The agreement, reached on Monday, proposes a cumulative 14 percent wage increase over a four-year period, three sources familiar with details of the negotiations told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Wages were frozen in the last contract, which ended on Sept. 1, as the Pittsburgh-based company was suffering losses from a slump in the domestic steel prices. The 2012-2015 agreement raised wages by an average of about 1.5 percent per year over three years, according to the workers' union. 
Trump's restrictive trade policy, coupled with a strong economy, has sent domestic steel prices soaring, helping U.S. Steel post a near 60 percent increase in pretax profits in the June quarter. 
The deal, which needs to be ratified by 16,000 workers across the country, comes days after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called steelmakers to share the profits from high steel prices with their workers. 
It comes at a time when U.S. wages are growing at the fastest pace in more than nine years. 
The new contract also proposes a lump sum bonus and a share in the company's profits, the sources said on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential deal. The workers will retain healthcare benefits from the last contract, which did not require them to pay a premium. 
A company spokeswoman did not respond when asked to comment on the deal, whose details have not been made public. 
The United Steelworkers (USW) union, which represents U.S. Steel workers, began negotiating a new contract in July. But the company's push to pass along some of the healthcare costs led to a standoff.
Scott Cranor, a union official in Gary, Indiana, said on Monday that higher healthcare costs would have effectively wiped out any pay increases proposed by the company. He said affordable healthcare and no premiums were among the reasons why workers preferred to work at U.S. Steel despite lower wages. 
""We have an excellent benefit package,"" Cranor said in an interview at his office, hours before both the parties reached a tentative deal. ""That's why we have settled for lesser wage.
""UNDERLYING PROBLEMS 
While the import curbs have helped turn around U.S. Steel's fortunes, they have not resolved the company's competitive problems. The company's operating profit margin is below the industry average. And its revenue per employee pales in comparison with that of rival steelmaker  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE).
Financial markets worry that U.S. Steel's plans to spend $2 billion through 2020 to add capacity to meet increased demand could further delay any potential dividend or share buyback. 
The company has the lowest dividend yield among major rivals."" Investors remain worried that because U.S. Steel is focusing on capex, shareholder returns remain on the backburner,"" said Seth Rosenfeld, a metals & mining analyst at Jefferies.
The new deal could inflate its cost structure, piling pressure on the company's stock which has lost nearly 40 percent since March 1 when Trump decided to impose the metal tariffs. U.S. Steel's shares fell 1.2 percent on Tuesday to close at $27.63.
Domestic steel prices have fallen about 10 percent since early June, raising concerns that prices have peaked. Demand from the auto industry, the company's biggest customer, is also widely expected to slow down."" The auto industry is dealing with lots of cost pressures because of trade wars, rising raw materials costs and declining sales volumes,"" said Rosenfeld. 

""Therefore, we have a somewhat conservative outlook with regard to contract hikes in 2019.""

653,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 07:28PM ET</span>",Railroad operator CSX's quarterly profit tops Wall Street target,"By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - CSX Corp (O:CSX) on Tuesday reported quarterly profit that topped Wall Street's view and raised its full-year revenue forecast, as the No. 3 U.S. railroad operator benefited from ongoing cost-cutting and higher prices for moving freight.
Shares in CSX, which forecast 2018 revenue growth of 6 percent to 8 percent, largely due to unexpected strength in exports of coal, were up 1.7 percent at $73.40 in extended trading.
Wall Street was watching for signs that looming threats, such as tariff-driven trade disruptions and rising fuel costs, are hitting the sector's profitability.
Third-quarter net income at CSX almost doubled to $894 million, or $1.05 per share, topping the average estimate of 94 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
Interruptions from Hurricane Florence, which included the loss of five miles of track due to flooding and revenue losses due to transit disruptions, reduced earnings by 2 cents per share during the latest quarter.
CSX executives also said they expect no significant financial impact from Hurricane Michael, a fast-moving storm that slammed Florida's Panhandle last week. CSX and other U.S. transportation providers are widely seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy.
Third-quarter revenue increased 14 percent from a year ago to $3.13 billion. 
""The price increases that CSX receives for shipments are picking up"" due to the tight trucking market that benefits both the Jacksonville, Florida-based company's container and general merchandise businesses, Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman said in a client note. 
Expenses fell 2 percent from a year earlier to $1.84 billion, as costs associated with increased volume and higher fuel prices were more than offset by efficiency gains. CSX has already hit its target of reducing headcount by 2,000 and executives vowed to make further cuts next year.
CSX Chief Executive James Foote told Reuters that tariffs on aluminum, steel and soybeans have had minimal to no impact on the railroad and that a simmering trade war with China has not been a negative for the U.S. economy.
CSX hit its turnaround goal of driving down operating expenses as a percentage of revenue earlier than analysts expected, and Foote said the railroad has more opportunities to reduce overhead and boost revenue. 

""We have a ton more to do"" to continue to improve efficiency and grow the business, Foote told Reuters.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Honda Aircraft expects higher light jet deliveries in 2019,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Honda Aircraft Co chief executive Michimasa Fujino said on Tuesday he expects deliveries of the HondaJet to rise in 2019 above the estimated 50 aircraft customers will take this year, as the light business plane maker targets Asia for growth.
In 2017, the division of Honda Motor Co (T:7267) delivered 43 of the six-seater light business jets, which competes against planes like Embraer SA's (SA:EMBR3) popular Phenom 300.
Honda Aircraft has recently introduced a longer-range version of the plane called the HondaJet Elite and announced a new performance package this week to owners who want to upgrade the original HondaJet. 
In an interview on the sidelines of the world's largest business jet show this week in Orlando, Fujino said he was targeting growth in the fledgling Japanese market, which he said did not ""know"" business jets and had a low market penetration.
He is also eying sales in China, which is currently dominated by larger executive planes and where tight government controls over airspace have hurt growth of the private jet market, analysts say.
Honda Aircraft does not publish order figures. The last time it did so, in 2006, it said it had received orders for well over 100 jets.
""We have a very good, healthy backlog,"" said Fujino, without providing a specific number.
Fujino said the company has delivered a total of 92 HondaJets. 

According to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers' Association (GAMA), Honda Aircraft delivered 17 HondaJets during the first half of 2018.

(Reuters) -  IBM  Corp reported a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue on Tuesday, hit by slowing software sales and wavering demand for mainframe servers, pointing to a bumpy recovery for the technology services giant that is in the midst of a turnaround.
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has been refocusing International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp toward faster-growing cloud and analytics services to lower dependence on its traditional hardware products and reverse years of revenue declines.
The Armonk, New York-based company's overall revenue slipped 2 percent in the third quarter ended September, with almost all of its businesses missing Wall Street's revenue estimates.
Revenue at its systems unit, which includes mainframe servers and data storage systems sold to large organizations, climbed only 1 percent, compared with a 25 percent jump in the previous quarter.
Sales growth of z14 mainframe servers, introduced about a year ago, have slowed as customers await the launch of new machines before they upgrade.
IBM's cognitive software business, which houses artificial intelligence platform Watson, analytics and cybersecurity services, had sales of $4.15 billion, down 6 percent from a year earlier.
Seasonal factors affecting demand for software such as transaction processing platforms hurt revenue, IBM Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said in an interview, adding that there were signs demand was recovering.
""We have a good pipeline in transaction processing software as we enter the fourth quarter,"" he said.
IBM, which gets over 60 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, said a stronger dollar also weighed on results.
The company said it made $39.5 billion in revenue over the last 12 months from its ""strategic imperatives"" — high-growth businesses including cloud services that are spread across its divisions.
Overall revenue slipped to $18.76 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $19.10 billion, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Net income fell to $2.69 billion, from $2.73 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $2.94 from $2.92 due to a lower number of outstanding shares.
Excluding one-time items, IBM earned $3.42 per share, while analysts had expected $3.40.

IBM shares were down 4.7 percent to $138.29 in extended trading. The Dow component has fallen about 8 percent this year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) posted solid third-quarter profit on Tuesday and raised its 2018 outlook for the third time this year, helped by its strategy to add flights at three mid-continent U.S. hubs: Chicago, Denver and Houston.
United, the third-largest U.S. airline, announced the plan to expand its domestic network last January. Since then it has added more than 40 domestic routes, and on Monday it announced additional U.S. flights starting next year.
The growth, coupled with tighter cost control and higher ticket prices and fees, have helped the Chicago-based carrier counter a surge in crude oil prices. 
United earned $3.13 per share, excluding the impact of tropical storms, which the carrier said diluted earnings per share by about 7 cents in the quarter. Analysts were forecasting $3.07 per share in the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of United, which have risen 25 percent this year compared with an 11 percent fall in the S&P 500 Airlines stock index <.SPLRCAIR>, gained 4.2 percent after the bell.
Total operating revenue rose 11.2 percent to $11 billion year-on-year, underpinned by booming global travel demand.
The company forecast adjusted profit for the full year at between $8.00 and $8.75 per share, up from its previous range of $7.25 to $8.75 per share.
Under its network expansion strategy, United grew capacity by 5.1 percent in the third quarter and expects between 5 and 6 percent growth in the fourth quarter. Total 2018 capacity is seen rising about 4.9 percent from a year ago.
United paid $2.6 billion for aircraft fuel in the third quarter, up 42 percent from a year earlier, but said it expects to recapture approximately 90 percent of the estimated year-over year growth in its 2018 fuel bill. 

Last week Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) also posted solid quarterly profit thanks to strong demand and cost controls. Rivals  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) are to report their quarterly results next week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged more than 2 percent on Tuesday after upbeat earnings reports from major companies including UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and solid economic data, as equities rebounded from a recent sharp sell-off.
Wall Street's three major indexes tallied their biggest one-day percentage gains since March. The small-cap Russell 2000 recorded its biggest single-session gain in nearly two years.
Technology, which sold off heavily in the recent pullback, led the gains as all 11 major sectors were positive.
Investors are expecting another strong quarter of corporate profits, hoping the reports can calm nerves following concerns over global trade tensions and rising bond yields. Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have climbed 21.8 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
“The corporate profits have certainly been the biggest prop for this market, and so a lot of weight is going to be given to how those corporate profits come out,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""We are early in the season, but so far so good, especially today.""
The gains marked a partial recovery from Wall Street's recent steep pullback from record levels. The S&P 500 last week posted its biggest weekly drop since March, and some market-watchers said it was not clear that the recent volatility was over.
""It’s mostly an oversold bounce,"" Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee, said of Tuesday's gains.
""The degree of the move is a function of the moves we have seen already this month more than anything else.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 547.87 points, or 2.17 percent, to 25,798.42, the S&P 500 gained 59.13 points, or 2.15 percent, to 2,809.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 214.75 points, or 2.89 percent, to 7,645.49.
The technology sector gained 3.0 percent while healthcare rose 2.9 percent. Those two groups have led the S&P 500's advance this year.
Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reported better-than-expected quarterly profits, helped by strength in stock trading and equity underwriting, wrapping up a strong quarter for the big U.S. banks. Goldman shares rose 3.0 percent, while Morgan Stanley shares gained 5.7 percent.
In healthcare, shares of diversified product company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose 1.9 percent, while insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) gained 4.7 percent following their respective quarterly reports.
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares jumped 9.5 percent following the software company's analyst meeting, adding to the day's upbeat sentiment for tech.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares rose 2.1 percent as its chief executive urged investors to revise their view of the company's business.
After the market closed, shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), one of the closely watched group of FANG momentum stocks, jumped following the streaming video company's report. 
On the downside, BlackRock shares dropped 4.4 percent after the world's biggest asset manager reported its lowest sales of equity, bond and other long-term investments since the second quarter of 2016.
Shares of industrial distributor W W Grainger (NYSE:GWW) tumbled 11.9 percent after its report.
In economic data, U.S. industrial production increased for a fourth straight month in September, boosted by gains in manufacturing and mining output, while other data showed job openings hit a record high in August.
About 7.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges. That was below the 7.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions, and well lower than busier trading days last week when the market was sliding.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 76 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which have lobbied Congress to lift a cap on electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, could get their way for up to four years under a new proposal from a Republican senator.
On Thursday, Senator Dean Heller proposed legislation that would lift the current cap on electric vehicles eligible for tax credits. Reuters obtained a copy of the text of the previously unreported bill, which has not been posted on the Senate website.
Under current law, once a manufacturer hits 200,000 EVs sold, the tax credit phases out starting in the following quarter. Heller's bill lifts the individual manufacturer cap but would phase out the credit for the entire industry in 2022.
Last week, Tesla said orders for cars placed by Monday would be eligible for a full federal tax credit of $7,500 and these customers will get their cars delivered by the end of the year. Tesla said in July it had hit the 200,000 vehicle threshold, which under law will result in the tax credit being reduced by 50 percent for six months and then cut to $1,875 for another six months until it ends. 
GM has said it expects to hit the 200,000 threshold by the end of the year.
Both GM and Tesla have lobbied Congress on the issue, according to federal disclosure reports and interviews with lawmakers. Tesla declined to comment.
GM declined to comment on the Heller bill but said it is important ""to provide a federal tax credit for consumers to help make electric vehicles more affordable for all customers."" GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has called for lifting the cap.
Other automakers are split over whether to back the effort. Some automakers think the credit should be limited to vehicles below a certain price, while others argue Heller's bill would penalize automakers that have not started selling EVs in big numbers.
Last week, Senator John Barrasso a Republican who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, proposed legislation to end the EV tax credit entirely and impose a new tax on EVs to fund highway repairs.
Senate Democrats are opposed to Barasso's measure. ""Repealing a policy that helps combat climate change is the absolute wrong decision,"" said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax-writing Finance Committee.

Last month, seven Democratic senators introduced legislation to lift the EV cap and extend it for 10 years. It would also allow buyers to use the tax credit as a ""point of sale rebate.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A panel of U.S. regulators is seen as likely to relieve  Prudential  Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) from stricter oversight when it meets on Tuesday, in a move that could reduce the insurance company's regulatory costs. 
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which convenes top market and bank regulators, is set to vote on whether to remove Prudential's label as a ""systemically significant financial institution,"" according to a person familiar with the matter.
The review of Prudential's systemically risky tag, which adds an extra layer of oversight by the Federal Reserve, is part of a push by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to ease regulatory powers created after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
In announcing Tuesday's meeting, the Treasury Department said the agenda included ""an update on the annual reevaluation of the designation of a nonbank financial company."" Prudential (LON:PRU) is the only designated nonbank financial company in the United States.
The panel is chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and nine of its 10 voting members were appointed by Trump, who has made easing regulations on businesses a top priority.
A Prudential spokesperson declined to comment.
In November, the Treasury Department recommended regulators focus on activities across the financial system, rather than singling out individual firms for tougher scrutiny. The Treasury said FSOC only designate firms as a last resort, and rely on sector-specific regulators for most oversight. 
The FSOC, which is charged with monitoring broad threats to the financial system, was given the ability to identify firms as systemically significant as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. 
Prudential had been the lone remaining nonbank institution to wear the label after the FSOC moved to remove American International Group (NYSE:AIG) from the designation in 2017, and MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) defeated their label in court.

General Electric's GE Capital financial services unit shed the label in 2016, after it had drastically overhauled its operations.

On Tuesday,  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) showed gains from investment banking and trading businesses that outstripped those of traditional rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
However, Goldman's equity trading and underwriting revenue was better than that of Morgan Stanley in a quarter marked by uncertainties in global financial markets stemming from an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, said on Friday its third-quarter profit jumped nearly 25 percent, with each of its four business units generating higher revenues.
Also on Friday,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets, reported a 12 percent rise in profit, driven mostly by lower taxes and cost savings, while  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), reported a strong quarterly profit on the back of healthy demand for auto, small business and personal loans.

702,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 01:37PM ET</span>","U.S. judge approves SEC settlement with Tesla, Musk; shares jump","By Nick Carey and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday approved a settlement between a federal regulator, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and its chief executive officer, Elon Musk, over his tweets promising to take the company private, signaling an end to a tumultuous period for investors. 
Tesla shares rose as much as 5.5 percent to $273.88 before easing to $271.63 in early-afternoon trade on Nasdaq. Despite the gains, the stock is still down more than 20 percent since Aug. 6, the day before Musk said on Twitter he would take the company private and claimed he had secured funding to do so.
Judge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a motion filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission outlining the agreement with Tesla and Musk.
A Tesla spokesperson confirmed the settlement, but said the automaker would make no further comment on the matter. 
Under an agreement with the SEC, Musk has agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as Tesla's chairman for three years to settle charges that could have forced his exit from Tesla. 
The company will also pay a $20 million fine, despite not being charged with fraud.
The government lawsuit threatened Tesla and Musk with a long fight that could have undermined its operations and ability to raise capital.
Under the settlement announced on Sept.29, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board committee to control Musk's communications.
Musk must comply with procedures set by the committee, including preapproval of ""any such written communications that contain, or reasonably could contain, information material"" to Tesla or its shareholders.
Twitter has frequently been Musk's go-to venue for freewheeling communications and confrontation with Tesla's critics.
The stock dropped last month after the SEC accused Musk, 47, of fraud over his ""false and misleading"" tweets on Aug. 7.
On Oct. 4, just hours after Nathan ordered him and the SEC to explain why their settlement was fair and reasonable, Musk appeared to mock the SEC on Twitter.
""Just want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,"" Musk, a frequent critic of the investors who have bet against the company, wrote. ""And the name change is so on point!""
The day after the tweet, Tesla's shares fell 7 percent when billionaire investor David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund criticized the electric carmaker, saying Musk had been deceptive and the carmaker's woes resembled those of Lehman Brothers before its collapse.
Musk has gained legions of fans for his bold approach to business and technology, using his 23 million Twitter followers to promote Tesla, his rocket company SpaceX, and tunnel venture Boring Co.
But the Aug. 7 claim that he had the funding to take Tesla private, and a subsequent U-turn, stunned Wall Street and came as Musk was filmed briefly smoking marijuana during a live Web show and when he called a British diver in the Thai cave rescue a ""pedo."" 
The Financial Times reported last week that outgoing Twenty-First Century Fox Inc CEO James Murdoch, a son of Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, was the lead candidate to replace Musk as chairman. Musk called the report ""incorrect."" Tesla has until Nov. 13 to appoint an independent chairman.

Thanks to Musk's vision and showmanship, Tesla's valuation has at times eclipsed that of traditional, established U.S. automakers that make millions of vehicles and billions of dollars in profits annually, and the company has garnered legions of fans despite repeated production issues.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) has agreed to pay $480 million to resolve civil claims by the U.S. government that it misled investors in marketing residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. authorities said on Tuesday.
Nomura knowingly bundled defective mortgage loans into marketable securities from 2006 to 2007 and misled investors about their quality, authorities said. The settlement stems from an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York.
""This settlement holds Nomura accountable for its fraudulent conduct in connection with its residential mortgage-backed securities offerings, which caused substantial harm to investors and contributed to the financial crisis of 2008,"" said Richard Donoghue, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, whose office conducted the probe.
Nomura said in a statement it did not admit any wrongdoing in connection with the settlement, and disputed the allegations.
Authorities accused Nomura of falsely telling investors that it conducted extensive due diligence on the home loans that it securitized, when in fact they did not comply with underwriting guidelines or relied on fraudulent appraisals.
Nomura continued the practices despite warnings from its due diligence staff, who warned that Nomura was ""turning into the lemming of the mortgage business"" and dealing with ""extremely dysfunctional"" loan originators, authorities said.
Nomura's misconduct caused ""significant losses"" for its investors, including retirement funds and university endowments, according to Donoghue's office.

Nomura was previously ordered to pay a total of $839 million together with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (L:RBS) in a lawsuit brought by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which has acted as conservator of mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since their 2008 takeover by the federal government after the collapse of the U.S. housing market.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>","Walmart warns it will 'test a lot, fail a lot;' cuts profit forecast","By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) chief executive officer on Tuesday urged investors to rethink the company's business, touting its various tech investments to grow online sales at a time it is battling Amazon.com (O:AMZN) for market share.
The retailer also lowered its earnings forecast for the year and said its e-commerce growth next year would be slower than in the current fiscal year ending in January.
""I want to challenge your thinking about Walmart,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon told the Bentonville, Arkansas, company's annual investor meeting, which was webcast. ""We are getting to reimagine retail and our business ... expect us to test a lot and fail a lot.""
McMillon highlighted the company's patents in last-mile delivery, biometrics and augmented reality, as well as investments in machine learning in areas like merchandising, blockchain to improve food safety and traceability. He also cited pickup towers in stores to boost online sales and various e-commerce delivery options.
Grocery sales make up 56 percent of Walmart's revenue and McMillon emphasized Walmart's advantage in the food category, an area rival Amazon is trying to crack. He said Walmart can offer fresh food within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population. 
Walmart is doubling down on online grocery delivery and pickup options. By the end of the year, 800 U.S. stores will offer grocery delivery and more 2,000 will offer a pickup service.
Investors shrugged off the company's guidance and Walmart's shares, which fell more than 2 percent in pre-market trading, were up 2.1 percent at $95.85 per share in early afternoon trading.
E-COMMERCE GROWTH TO SLOW
Walmart's earnings next year will be eroded by its $16 billion acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart in May, its largest-ever deal, to compete with Amazon in an important growth market. The company at the time had indicated the deal would lead to a per-share earnings hit of 25 to 30 cents this fiscal year and 60 cents next fiscal year.
The lower forecasts for earnings and online sales come after Walmart posted its best quarterly U.S. sales growth in a decade in August, helped by lower unemployment and tax cuts that boosted consumers' spending power.
Walmart now expects to earn between $4.65 and $4.80 per share for fiscal 2019, down from an earlier forecast of $4.90 to $5.05 per share.
Walmart also estimates a 35 percent growth rate for its online business in the year ending in January 2020, against expectations for 40 percent growth in the current year. Walmart said the 35 percent growth will be off a bigger base. The retailer also expects its e-commerce business to post a slightly greater operating loss next year, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said.
The company has made several efforts in the past year to boost online traffic. These include a website redesign, more online grocery offerings and acquisition of fashion brands to improve its appeal to millennial shoppers, who typically have avoided purchasing on the retailer's websites.
Walmart has been on an acquisition spree in the U.S. online fashion space, buying online lingerie retailer Bare Necessities last week after purchasing plus-sized clothing startup Eloquii a week earlier.
Over the years, Walmart has worked to use physical locations as distribution points for online orders of groceries and other goods in order to retain buyers who increasingly expect quick, cheap shipping.
With a steady rise in online shopping, Walmart's e-commerce sales growth has been outstripping brick-and-mortar sales, leading the company to slash new store openings. The retailer plans to open fewer than 10 U.S. stores in the next fiscal year. 
For fiscal 2020, Walmart expects comparable sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. That follows expected growth of about 3 percent this year, which would be the fastest pace since 2008.
Overall sales growth during fiscal 2020 is likely to be 3 percent or more but could be negatively impacted by the sale of operations in Brazil and a planned reduction in tobacco sales at Walmart-owned warehouse chain Sam's Club.

Walmart also expects earnings to decline by a low single-digit percentage range compared with fiscal 2019 due to the Flipkart deal. Excluding the impact, it is expected to rise by a low- to mid-single digit percentage range.

Much of the market’s attention was on the big investment bank earnings ahead of trading. But a closer look at Domino’s is warranted in light of recent worries about the stamina of the consumer.
Retail sales came in much lower than anticipated in September and the pizza delivery chain’s results did little to allay fears, despite a strong beat on profit.
Domino’s (NYSE:DPZ) stock lost about 5% at 11:55 AM ET (15:55 GMT).
The company said same-store sales rose 4.9% at U.S. company-owned restaurants, while franchise sales rose 6.4%. Those were both below consensus forecasts. Overall sales of $786 million were also below estimates.
The numbers are particularly disappointing given all the optimism on Domino’s being at the forefront of food delivery technology. Investors will now be looking to see if this is part of a pullback in spending overall by the consumer or more other food delivery companies taking share from Domino’s.
The company was also expected to take advantage of diners switching from Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) following its acrimonious split from its founder.
But Domino’s CEO Richard Allison downplayed that in the conference call, saying that Papa John’s market share is “relatively small,” Restaurant Business Magazine reported.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 11:52AM ET</span>",Huawei launches new flagship phones in bid to keep No. 2 spot,"By Eric Auchard
LONDON (Reuters) - Huawei [HWT.UL] unveiled new flagship smartphones with novel smart camera and video features on Tuesday, as it seeks to sustain momentum among price-conscious consumers.
The Chinese company, which overtook Apple (O:AAPL) this year to become the No. 2 smartphone maker by units - behind South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) - introduced its Mate 20 phone series using Leica camera technology.
Huawei’s new premium phone line-up has four models available around the world, expect in the United States where sales are effectively banned over whispered national security concerns. 
The new line-up includes the Mate 20, with list prices ranging from 799-849 euros ($925-$983), depending on memory configuration.
The fuller-featured Mate 20 Pro, is priced as low as 799 pounds at some UK retailers and list priced at 849 pounds or 1,049 euros across Europe. A comparable iPhone X Max from Apple costs 1,099 pounds in the UK. 
The new phones include a new ultra-wide angle lens, as well as a 3x telephoto lens and a macro that shoots objects as close as 2.5 centimeters (1 inch).
Mate P20 models take advantage of artificial intelligence features built into Huawei's own Kirin chipsets. 
Features available to Mate 20 users include being able to isolate human subjects and desaturate the colors around them in order to highlight people against their backgrounds.
Huawei incorporates bigger light-sensing chips than rival phones to take better pictures in low-light conditions.
Gartner analyst Roberta Cozza said that in a highly commoditized smartphone market of look-alike phones, Huawei is managing to differentiate itself with camera and personalization features.
""With the Mate 20, Huawei is setting the bar for what users can expect from photography using a smartphone,"" Cozza said.
The Chinese phone maker managed to surpass Apple to take the No. 2 spot in the second quarter, industry data shows, despite being effectively excluded from the U.S. market.
However, Apple commanded 43 percent of the premium market and a lion's share of profits, CounterPoint Research estimated.
""Huawei is clearly ticking all the key boxes needed to displace rivals – and not just Android-powered rivals,"" said Ben Wood, research chief of mobile industry consulting firm CCS Insight.
Wood said Huawei's move to match Apple iPhone's characteristic swipe gestures and face unlock features on its Mate 20 Pro could, in theory, make it easier for committed Apple buyers to switch, although he said that was unlikely near term.
""But it's clear that Huawei has an eye on the future and is ready to take share from Apple if the time comes that a loyal iPhone owner decides to try something else,"" he said.

The new premium phone line-up from the world's biggest telecom equipment maker includes four models, the Mate 20, Mate 20 Pro, Mate 20 X, with a 7.2 inch display screen, and a Porsche Design limited edition phone.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on Tuesday that he would not cut ties with Saudi Arabia even as pressure mounts on the country to explain the disappearance of a prominent critic.
Fink is one of several top business executives, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Jamie Dimon and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) plc CEO John Flint, who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who has been critical of the country's policies, went missing.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, vanished after entering the consulate. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered there and his body removed, which the Saudis strongly deny.
Asked on CNBC if he would cut off all business ties with Saudi Arabia if it became clear that King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi's murder, Fink said, ""No.""
BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager with oversight of more than $6.4 trillion in assets, is widely followed by investors and economists for its influence at many of the world's public companies and it also has a foothold with governments around the globe.
Fink has long had relationships with Saudi officials and one year ago announced plans to open offices within the country. Relationships with the business and investment community are essential to the country's Vision 2030 push to diversify the economy away from oil. The plan has grabbed attention for its big-ticket initiatives, such as a $500 billion business zone and a plan, now shelved, to sell part of the state oil firm.
But the journalist's disappearance on Oct. 2 created a complex calculus for BlackRock, whose chief executive has worked to present it as socially conscious.
In a letter to top corporate executives earlier this year, Fink wrote that to ""prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.""
Fink told CNBC he wanted the conference delayed until the end of an investigation into the journalist's disappearance but that he had not been successful. At that point, he said, he had only one choice and that was to withdraw.
""We needed to be thoughtful and mindful how to navigate this,"" Fink said.

""I wanted to preserve the relationships that we'd worked so long for.""

744,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 10:27AM ET</span>",Sears faces tough foe: an unforgiving bankruptcy code,"By Tom Hals and Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - When Sears Holdings Corp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday, it said it would close another 142 unprofitable Sears and Kmart locations and seek to reorganize around financially healthier stores. It also triggered a ""time bomb"" that retailers have had a tough time surviving.
Over the last dozen or so years, bankrupt retailers have had less time to make major strategic decisions for their survival and landlords and lenders have had more leverage in the process.
The change stems from a 2005 legislative overhaul of the bankruptcy code that forced companies to find an agreement within seven months on its real-estate leases, or allow landlords to walk away from the agreement. Previously, companies would spend a year or two working out a viable survival plan.
Restructuring specialists blame the shorter timeframe for the rapid liquidations of chains such as Circuit City, Linens 'n Things, the Borders book store chain and Toys 'R' Us.
The law intensifies the pressure on Sears and Chairman Eddie Lampert to restructure the company and turn it into a relevant, viable business.
""They have less money and a shorter period of time to make decisions,"" said Ted Gavin of the Gavin/Solmonese restructuring advisory firm. ""There's more transactional risk.""
Sears did not respond to requests seeking comment. A spokesman for Lampert declined to comment.
To be sure, jeans company True Religion Apparel Inc, Perfumania Holdings Inc, Payless ShoeSource, Gymboree Corp and Harry & David in recent years have all successfully navigated Chapter 11. They did so within the tighter timeframe that Sears now confronts.
Many of the chains that successfully reorganized in recent years were able to negotiate lower rent payments from landlords, who were willing to work with a troubled company rather than risk finding another tenant amid a surge of store closings.
On Monday, Reuters reported that many large U.S. malls and shopping centers that are controlled by real estate investment trusts have waited years for Sears' demise. They will now be able to raise rents on contracts, some of which were signed more than 20 years ago.
Earlier in the day, a bankruptcy judge approved $300 million in financing to keep Sears open through the holiday season. Sears is also considering the sale of ""a large portion"" of its stores and said they could be bought by Lampert's hedge fund in a bankruptcy auction.
Prior to 2005, retailers approached bankruptcy differently. Chains, such as R.H. Macy & Co, would typically pile up cash at the year-end, seek protection from creditors in January and then spend at least a year or two working out a viable business plan.
After landlords complained to Congress about bankrupt ""ghost tenants"" that tied up key locations in a mall or strip center, lawmakers responded by adding the time limit on leases in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Act of 2005.
This seemingly simple change has been blamed for plenty of failed retail turnarounds and had an immediate impact on the length of cases.
Half of bankrupt retailers reorganized successfully prior to the 2005 law, but just 12 percent did so afterwards, based on a 2014 study by Lawrence Gottlieb, a bankruptcy lawyer with Cooley.
Gottlieb also found the average case was cut to three months from 12 months prior to 2005 law. More and more retailers began liquidating, or quickly closing weak stores and finding a buyer for the much smaller chain that emerged from bankruptcy, something Sears is considering.
Lenders that provide money to carry a retailer through its restructuring have been the drivers of the compressed timeframe for bankruptcies. Lenders generally use a company's inventory as collateral, so they demand short cases to ensure the inventory can be sold before the retailer is kicked out of its store locations.
For example, Sears' lenders are providing $300 million for its restructuring and demanded the company has a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court in less than seven months.
One question is how well Sears and Kmart will manage to scrape by in the forthcoming holiday season. 
When Toys R Us went out of business earlier this year, its liquidation left a large gap in the toy retail marketplace, which competitors like Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and others rushed to fill.
Sears share of the overall retail industry has shrunk to about 0.4 percent from 5.4 percent a generation ago, said Craig Johnson, president of consultancy Customer Growth Partners.
Appliances, electronics and home improvement products make up the bulk of Sears' revenue and generated about $7.2 billion in annual sales last year.
According to a study led by UBS analyst Michael Lasser in February, some appliance sales could leak to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as it now carries the Sears Kenmore appliance range, he said.
Eighty percent of Sears stores are within a 15 minute drive of  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe's and Best Buy, and 71 percent of Kmart stores are located within 15 minutes of a Walmart Inc supercenter, he estimates. The retailer has shut down several stores since then.
Todd Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School, said getting ailing stores out of anchor locations and replacing them with an exciting new concept benefits an entire shopping center.

""There was a built-in time bomb,"" he said of the 2005 law. He said a chain does not need years to decide to keep a store location. ""A lot of times you're delaying the inevitable.""

745,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>",Global investors haven't been this bearish on the economy since the financial crisis — and Bank of America says there's only one way to play it,"As  global markets try to recover from the sharp drop earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is urging investors not to immediately go on buying sprees. 
Its view is informed by investors themselves. The bank's monthly fund-manager survey for October was conducted in the  thick of the sell-off, from Oct. 5-11. And it showed that global growth expectations plunged to their lowest levels since November 2008, when the US economy was stuck in its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. 
By one gauge, their caution on the economy is breaking records that go further into the past than the most recent recession: a record 85% of the investors surveyed said they think the global economy is late-cycle. That's even higher than its previous peak in December 2007.
Bank of America received responses from 231 investors who collectively manage $646 billion in assets. 
Investors saw a  trade war as the global economy's biggest tail risk for a fifth straight month, amid the dispute that has seen the US slap tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.
But the share of investors citing this concern fell in October, as another risk became more prominent: quantitative tightening. 
In fact, the fear of higher  interest rates and how they could crimp company borrowing was largely cited as a major trigger for the sell-off that has sent the  S&P 500 down 5% this month.
With all of that in mind, Bank of America has an idea of how investors can be proactive and fight slowing growth.
""We sell Q4 rallies,"" Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist, said in a note on Tuesday. 
BlackRock, the $6 trillion investing giant, also sent a version of this message to clients, urging them to focus on  portfolio resilience for the rest of the year. 
Hartnett's note further showed that going long or betting on the S&P 500, the big US and Chinese tech stocks (FAANG + BAT (LON:BATS)), and betting against US Treasurys were considered the most crowded trades. In other words, these could be most vulnerable in the event of a major sell-off. 
Investors' contrarian trades included going long China via the  IShares China Large-Cap exchange-traded fund, short the  SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), and short cash. "
746,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 10:13AM ET</span>","Equity trading strength boosts profits at Morgan Stanley, Goldman","By Aparajita Saxena and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) - Wall Street's top investment banks reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Tuesday, helped by strength in stock trading and equity underwriting, wrapping up what has been a strong quarter for the big U.S. banks.
Morgan Stanley's (N:MS) gains from investment banking and trading businesses outstripped those of traditional rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), which reported its last results under long-time Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein.
However, Goldman's equity trading and underwriting revenue came in much better than that of  Morgan Stanley  in a quarter that was marked by uncertainties in global financial markets stemming from an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington.
Talking to analysts on a post-earnings call, Morgan Stanley's Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said he expects the firm to be the leader in equities trading by market share globally this year.
Strength at equity trading desks of both banks dwarfed weakness in bond trading, in line with a broader trend across the industry during the third quarter.
Both banks lack big consumer lending units that have fueled profits at rivals such as  Citigroup  (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), and instead rely heavily on their trading desks.
To offset the ups and downs of the trading business, Morgan Stanley and Goldman have been trying to diversify into lending and wealth management.
Shares of Morgan Stanley were up 2.4 percent, while those of Goldman were up about 1 percent in early trading.
Bank stocks have been under pressure this year as investors and analysts have questioned their future growth strategies.
The S&P Financial Index (SPSY) has fallen 6 percent this year, vastly underperforming the broader market. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman have lost more than 15 percent of their value this year, making them the two worst performing stocks among the big six banks.
EQUITY UNDERWRITING SHINES
Investment bankers helped the banks bring in big gains during the quarter. Goldman's investment banking revenue rose 10 percent to $1.98 billion as advisory revenue hit its highest in three years, and the bank earned more from helping companies go public.
This compares with a 15 percent jump in Morgan Stanley's revenue from the business to $1.46 billion.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts had expected investment banking revenue at Goldman and Morgan Stanley to be $1.73 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively.
Equity trading desks at both the banks also booked gains of between 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
Bond trading business, however, did not fare as well.
Morgan Stanley's bond trading revenue rose just 1 percent, but outperformed Goldman, which reported a 10 percent fall in revenue from the business.
""Pretty good results considering the choppy backdrop and we like how Morgan Stanley continues to produce strong results,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note.
Overall, Morgan Stanley reported net profit of $1.17 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.01 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

Goldman's per share profit came in at $6.28, compared with the estimate of $5.38.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>","Investors gloomiest on world growth in decade, cut U.S. equity holdings - BAML poll","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors have the most pessimistic outlook on the world economy since the 2008 financial crisis, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey, which also showed a sharp fall in U.S. equity allocations.
The survey, released on Tuesday was conducted Oct. 5 to 11 and canvassed investors managing $646 billion. It showed investors remained overweight equities overall, though the 22 percent overweight was just marginally off the recent record low of 19 percent.
But in a sign of caution, they held cash at 5.1 percent -- a net 36 percent overweight -- and well above than the 4.5 percent 10-year average.
The poll showed that a net 38 percent of respondents expected the global economy to slow, the worst outlook on global growth since November 2008. A net 35 percent of participants identified trade war as the biggest risk. 
Investors were also gloomy on corporate earnings, with a fifth of respondents expecting global profits to deteriorate in the coming year, BAML said, noting that in January a net 39 percent of investors had predicted an improvement.
Focusing investors' minds is the rise in U.S, Treasury yields -- 10-year yields hit seven-year highs recently -- expectations of more policy tightening and signs the U.S. economy and company earnings could slow from the sugar-rush provided by tax cuts.
All those fears were among factors which triggered a sudden selloff on Wall Street last week, putting the S&P500 on track for its biggest monthly loss since mid-2015 (SPX).
There are also concerns about the overwhelming popularity of big tech, with the BAML poll showing U.S. and Chinese tech stocks remained the ""most crowded"" trade for the ninth consecutive month.
The poll showed a dramatic 17 percentage-point drop in U.S. equity allocations to a net 4 percent overweight, with Japan ousting the United States as investors' most favored market with an 18 percent overweight.
The decline in European equity holdings too continued, falling six percentage points in October to the lowest since December 2016.
Investors remain reluctant to give up on higher-risk assets however, holding on to an overall underweight position on bonds.
""Investors are bearish on global growth but not bearish enough to signal anything but a short-term bounce in risk assets,"" BAML chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said.
The poll found also that the yield level at which investors would rotate from equities to bonds was seen at 3.7 percent on 10-year U.S. Treasuries -- the highest since March when the question was first asked.
Yields are currently around 3.17 percent (US10YT=RR), almost 10 bps off recent highs.
In an interesting turnaround, a net 51 percent of poll participants named the dollar as overvalued, ""notably against emerging market currencies which are seen as never having been more undervalued in survey history,"" BAML said.

The San Francisco-based bank, whose purchase of a high-profile location near the Bank of England two years ago was seen as a vote of confidence in the Brexit process, said it would continue to service UK and non-EU clients from London.
It said its new subsidiary based in Paris would provide capital markets and investment banking services for European and international customers who require access to the EU and the European Economic Area. 
The company gave no indication whether the move would lead to job cuts in London or how many it would employ in Paris. A spokesperson did not immediately provide details on how many employees Wells Fargo has in London.
""With Brexit on the horizon, Wells Fargo is committed to providing a transition, which is as seamless as possible, for its markets and investment banking customers,"" said Alicia Reyes, head of Wells Fargo Securities for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The new Paris-based unit will be called Wells Fargo Securities Europe S.A.
French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in July that the country would ease financial regulations to EU minimums and introduce new tax incentives to make Paris a more attractive finance hub. (https://reut.rs/2PCDGek)
Paris is competing with the likes of Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg to win over finance jobs in the wake of Britain’s departure from the EU next March.
The Paris Europlace financial sector lobby said in July that Paris was set to win 3,500 financial sector jobs leaving Britain due to Brexit.
HSBC (L:HSBA) would make up the bulk, with 1,000 jobs, while French banks moving posts back to their base in Paris would add another 1,000 jobs. The rest would come from a host of Wall Street banks and other financial firms, the lobby had said.
Companies from across the EU use London for currency trading, derivatives and managing investment funds. 
Some EU policymakers want parts of these activities shifted to the continent after Brexit to avoid relying on what will then be a foreign financial center.
Wells Fargo said it will make more announcements on its Brexit strategy in the near future.

The board had been discussing Small's planned retirement with him for the past few months, it said. The company's valuation has risen over 5,000 percent during Small's tenure.
The shares slipped as much as 5 percent on Tuesday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised concerns over the acquisition this year of U.S. chain Finish Line.
JD Sports, which operates around 1,500 outlets in 16 countries, has been focusing on growing its international operations, after saying its home market was saturated. 
It has opened 39 new stores in international markets this year. In March it paid $558 million for Finish Line, a big bet that it can replicate a model based on tight relationships with  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGN).

776,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 08:19AM ET</span>","Qualcomm, FTC ask judge to delay ruling to pursue settlement","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday asked a federal judge to delay a preliminary ruling in an antitrust case U.S. regulators brought against the mobile chip company in order to pursue settlement talks.
In a joint filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, they asked a judge to delay ruling on the FTC's motion for partial summary judgment for 30 days.
The FTC originally filed the lawsuit in early 2017, alleging Qualcomm used anti-competitive practices to maintain a monopoly on the market for mobile phone chips.
Qualcomm declined to comment beyond the filing. 
Settling with U.S. regulators would be a turning point for the San Diego company, which has been defending its business model amid a barrage of lawsuits from large customers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Inc, as well as dealing with regulatory challenges to its practices around the world.
At issue in the civil litigation and regulatory disputes is whether Qualcomm's patent licensing practices, when combined with its chip business, constitute anticompetitive behavior. Regulators in South Korea and Taiwan initially ruled against Qualcomm, but it has appealed the rulings and settled some of them. 
In Taiwan in August, Qualcomm settled with regulators for $93 million and an agreement to invest $700 million in the country over the next five years.
Settling legal disputes will also be critical if Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf wants to meet the company's ambitious financial goals. 
Facing a hostile takeover bid earlier this year from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Mollenkopf said Qualcomm aimed to earn up to $7.50 in adjusted earnings per share by the company's fiscal 2019, a goal that hinges on cost cutting and patching up relations with customers and regulators.
Qualcomm has been able to keep the core of its patent licensing model intact, reaching deals with regulators and big customers like Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd to continue allowing its practice of taking the cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone in exchange for the use of Qualcomm patents.

The company has yet to smooth over relations with Apple, whose antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm was filed early last year and has yet to go to trial.

This is Goldman's last quarterly results under Lloyd Blankfein, who led the company as chief executive for 12 years before handing over the reins to David Solomon in October.
The bank said fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue fell 10 percent to $1.31 billion.
Goldman is typically more sensitive to swings in market volatility than its peers because its large trading business overshadows its other banking units.

Revenue from Goldman's investment banking business rose 10.2 percent, while its overall net revenue rose 3.8 percent to $8.65 billion.
Net earnings attributable to common shareholders rose to $2.45 billion, or $6.28 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.04 billion, or $5.02 per share.

Equity trading revenue rose 7 percent in a quarter marked by uncertainties in global financial markets stemming from an ongoing tariff war between the United States and China.
Morgan Stanley's bond trading revenue rose 1 percent, outperforming traditional competitor  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc, (N:GS) which reported a 10 percent fall in revenue at the business.

Morgan Stanley's overall revenue rose a better-than-expected 7.3 percent, also helped by a 62 percent jump in equity underwriting revenue.
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has restored Morgan Stanley to health since taking over in 2010, when the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis.
His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and focusing on steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue.
However, some analysts now question the bank's future growth strategy. Its shares have fallen 17 percent this year, underperforming the S&P Financial index (SPSY), with lackluster trading also weighing on the stock. The shares were up 2.4 percent before the opening bell.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>","German carmakers have 50:50 chance of facing Detroit's fate, VW says","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers only have a 50 percent chance of surviving as leading players in the auto industry unless they transform their businesses to meet new regulations and adapt supply chains, Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) chief executive said on Tuesday.
Car manufacturers have complained about new regulations, including bans on older diesel vehicles in German cities and broader EU measures to cut car emissions, saying they will hurt Europe's car industry and cost jobs.
""If you look at the former bastions of the auto industry like Detroit, Oxford-Cowley or Turin, you understand what happens to cities when once-powerful corporations and leading industries falter,"" CEO Herbert Diess told an auto suppliers' conference in Wolfsburg, VW's manufacturing base.
Germany’s auto industry association VDA has said a ban on combustion engine-powered vehicles in 2030 would threaten more than 600,000 German industrial jobs, of which 436,000 are at car companies and their suppliers. 
Tougher rules could push some carmakers out of business due to the pace of reforms required to shift production to electric cars and to tackle new geopolitical threats, said Diess.
""From today's point of view the chances are perhaps 50-50 that the German auto industry will still belong among the global elite in 10 years' time,"" he said, referring to leading players Volkswagen Group, BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn).
European Union lawmakers have agreed to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, a higher level than Germany had sought, after a U.N. report called for dramatic steps to slow global warming.
Germany's BMW, Audi and Mercedes brands command around a 90 percent market share in the premium auto segment, but a push to cut emissions hurts high horsepower vehicles and therefore German brands in particular.
Volkswagen is already struggling to overcome its emissions cheating scandal. Its premium unit Audi was fined 800 million euros ($926 million) on Tuesday for emissions violations. 
""We are all used to the fact that we have flourishing industrial metropolises around the central manufacturing plants of German carmakers and their suppliers, places where people like to live and work, but that's not guaranteed for eternity,"" Diess said. 
OVERHAULING BUSINESS
To cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide in Europe by 30 percent by 2030, Volkswagen needs to raise its share of fully electric vehicles to 30 percent of new car sales, or to half in the event of a 40 percent cut, Diess said.
The push to cut vehicle carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming, is costly and would ultimately lead to a rise in CO2 pollution in Germany given the country's dependence on generating electricity from brown coal, he said. 
The shift from combustion engines to electric cars would also cost 14,000 jobs at VW by 2020, Diess said, requiring an overhaul of the carmaker's in-house components business.
""It is clear to us all that the structural shift will lead to fewer auto industry jobs in Germany. The question is, how quickly do we need to implement this structural change?,"" he said.
Jobs will disappear because it takes less time to build an electric car than a conventional one and because jobs will shift overseas to makers of batteries. 
A combustion engine-powered car has 1,400 components in its motor, exhaust system and transmission. An electric car’s battery and motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING. 
In Europe there are about 126 plants making combustion engines, employing 112,000 people. The largest engine plant in Europe is Volkswagen's factory in Kassel. 
So far German carmakers have sourced battery cells from Asian suppliers like LG Chem and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI, which are currently supplying Audi and BMW.
VW is overhauling its in-house components division, which eats up the lion's share of the 170 billion euros ($197 billion) spent on procurement, develops and builds car parts at 56 sites across the globe, and employs about 80,000 people.
""From Jan. 1 onward, Volkswagen components will act as an economically independent entity,"" Diess said.
Each of the 56 plants would be free to evaluate partnerships and even to build components for other carmakers, Diess said.

""We are investigating further and will provide further updates,"" the bank said on Twitter after a number of customers used the social media platform to flag problems accessing HSBC's site. 
The bank's mobile banking app also suffered a brief glitch in September, one of a series of outages at Britain's biggest lenders in the past few months.
Technical problems at banks have prompted criticism from customers and from lawmakers, who in September called on Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) to explain what caused the problems and how they would compensate affected customers.
Outages can cause significant disruption to customers, who are increasingly reliant on digital services as banks close branches and encourage clients to move online.
The impact of a severe outage was brought into sharp focus earlier this year, when mid-sized lender TSB was plunged into chaos after a botched IT migration saw some customers locked out of their accounts for over a week. 

The outage tarnished TSB's brand just as it was gearing up to try and win more market share from Britain's biggest banks, cost hundreds of millions of pounds and prompted the resignation of the bank's CEO Paul Pester.

In a paper on the Chinese market presented at its annual conference in Berlin, the VDMA also urged the German government to maintain political pressure on Beijing, saying this was the only way to secure the future of German companies in China.
""The Chinese market is primarily a politically-driven market that is shaped, controlled and steered through the intervention of the state,"" the paper said. ""All signs suggest that this tendency will strengthen in the coming years."" 
Under pressure from the United States and Europe to open up its market to foreign investment, China has taken a number of steps in recent months, including allowing Germany's BASF (DE:BASFn) and U.S. giant ExxonMobil (N:XOM) to invest in major chemical sites.
Last week, German's BMW (DE:BMWG) announced that it would take control of its main joint venture in China, a first for a foreign carmaker.
But foreign companies remain concerned about what they see as a growing state role in the economy under President Xi Jinping, including the introduction of a Social Credit System using big data to monitor, shape and rate individuals and businesses.
The VDMA said it saw ""significant challenges"" for all companies in China resulting from this system.

Still, the association said that China remained a major market, with Chinese imports of foreign machinery totalling $76.8 billion in the first half of 2018.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Softbank pushes link-ups as insurance strategy takes shape,"By Eric Auchard and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Softbank's Vision Fund plans to pump more money into insurance, a sector it sees as both ripe for disruption and a potential booster for its bigger bets in cars, health and financial services, a Vision Fund executive told Reuters.
In the past year, the world's biggest private technology investor has backed China's largest online insurer ZhongAn (HK:6060) as well as PolicyBazaar, India's biggest online insurance distributor, and app-based U.S. home insurer Lemonade.
And these and other insurance bets totaling nearly $3 billion are just the start, Vision Fund dealmaker David Thevenon said. The Vision Fund has raised nearly $100 billion, almost half of it from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.
""We believe that technology and how data is used, processed and collected is going to transform insurance,"" Thevenon said. 
Softbank believes a new breed of ""insurtech"" companies can work with other firms within its portfolio such as local transport juggernaut Uber and office sharing firm WeWork to roll out new products and services to their massive base of clients.
Three of the 10 biggest investments in new digital insurance firms over the past year -- PolicyBazaar, Lemonade and Nauto -- were led by Softbank, according to data from Willis Towers Watson and CB Insights. 
Including its stakes in ZhongAn and two units of China's biggest insurer, Ping An (SS:601318), it made half the dozen biggest insurance investments in the year to June. 
""We are going to have to place several bets,"" said Thevenon, a former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) executive. ""The nice thing about insurance is that this is so big, it's not exactly a market where you make one investment and you suddenly have 90 percent market share.""
Insurtech will represent just under 10 percent of the global insurance market by 2023, or more than $400 billion in premiums, against just 4 percent in 2018, according to a recent Jupiter report.
SEEKING SYNERGY
At his annual SoftBank World event in July, CEO Masayoshi Son told an audience of its portfolio company executives to imagine a world in which customers of Paytm, a Vision Fund Indian payments company with more than 300 million users, could receive real-time insurance quotes from China's ZhongAn.
""Imagine how wonderful, how innovative,"" Son said.
Vision Fund investments range from chip design firm ARM to ride-sharing giants including Uber, DiDi, Grab and Ola and new financial and business services like WeWork. 
But its willingness to make huge bets in areas like commercial real-estate and its close ties to Saudi Arabia have put parent company Softbank under pressure, and its shares have fallen 16 percent this month. 
Son talks about how new artificial intelligence and big data technologies will tie his disparate investments together, though concrete examples are scarce.
An early example of insurance synergy could involve India's PolicyBazaar, which raised $200 million in June in an investment round led by Softbank. 
The decade-old company is investing in new services including lending for medical and death expenses and subscription-based healthcare. It hopes these businesses will help it glean deeper insights into consumer behavior that in turn could be used by the companies that sell insurance on its platform to better package and price their products.
PolicyBazaar Chief Executive Yashish Dahiya said he's keen to work with Softbank's network of companies to develop these businesses.
The company is already working with Ping An Good Doctor, operator of a one-stop medical services portal with 200 million users in China, to develop an Indian version it calls DocPrime.
Initially this amounts to knowledge-sharing, but could eventually lead to a full-blown partnership or joint venture.
Ping An Good Doctor (HK:1833) has meanwhile formed a joint venture with ride-sharer Grab to expand its online healthcare services across six countries in southeast Asia. 
Softbank's global tie-up this month with Toyota (T:7203) to develop driverless vehicle services, including ones they say could function as mobile shops or even hospitals, gives another glimpse of how its insurance investments could play out.
Announcing the venture, Son cited insurance as a plank in its broader transportation offering. Autonomous driving is still a legal no man's land where basic liability questions need to be settled, and new types of insurers could thus play a big role. 
One such insurtech company is Nauto, a Silicon Valley-based start-up whose vehicle safety technology helps insurers assess how commercial fleet drivers handle their vehicle. Softbank and venture firm Greylock led a $159 million funding round for Nauto in July 2017, joining existing investors BMW, GM and Toyota.
WINNING OVER INSURERS
Softbank has also been in discussions with big insurers about partnerships or other tie-ups that could see them supply underwriting and regulatory know-how to the new-model insurance companies in its portfolio.
Reinsurers act as insurers to insurance companies, and their expertise in areas like mortality and longevity tables remains unmatched, industry experts say. Their vast reserves of capital act as a backstop to insurers, enabling them to shoulder the risks of hard-to-price markets.
In January, Softbank sought to take a stake worth as much as $10 billion in global No. 2 reinsurer  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH). Those talks ended in May, and Softbank and Swiss Re declined to comment on the reasons.
But Thevenon said Softbank continues to hunt for ways to accelerate the digital upheaval in the insurance industry, including tie-ups with unspecified reinsurance players. 
""We have talked to big insurance groups to figure out where we can play, what might be interesting,"" he said. ""There are several similar combinations and permutations about a bet we could place.""

805,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Standard Chartered sees increased China-Africa trade due to U.S. trade war,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - China is likely to boost imports from African countries as it seeks new sources of commodities in the wake of a trade war with the United States, a senior executive of  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank [STANB.UL] in China said. 
Trade links between the Asian economic powerhouse and African nations like Kenya have been growing robustly in recent years, offering opportunities to lenders who serve Chinese clients doing business on the continent like Standard Chartered. 
Carmen Ling, Standard Chartered's global head of the internationalisation of the Chinese currency renminbi (RMB), cautioned there would be no winners from the trade war in the short term, but added some African nations could gain in the long term. 
""We believe that countries like Kenya and Nigeria will benefit because China will look to import more from Africa; some agricultural products from Kenya, some oil products from Nigeria,"" she told Reuters late on Monday.
""Trade flow patterns will change because China will need to look for new trade partners."" 
Kenya's trade with China grew 59 percent in the four years to 2017, to a total of $5.2 billion, Standard Chartered said, boosting the bank's business from Chinese clients operating in Kenya by ""double digits"".
The East African nation turned to China over the past few years for funds, technology and equipment to develop its infrastructure, including its biggest project since independence, a $3.2 billion railway linking Mombasa to Nairobi, which was opened last year.
""We see more and more Chinese clients coming to Kenya, we have seen Kenya grow in importance to become a belt and road hub. This is the gateway ,"" said Ling.
She was referring to China's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, a multi-billion dollar series of infrastructure projects upgrading land and maritime trade routes between China and Europe, Asia and Africa.
The initiative has caused anger in some quarters with critics saying it increases China's loans to African nations, placing a debt burden on future generations. 

Ling decried the slow adoption of the RMB in trade settlements for deals between China and Africa, partly blaming the problem on lack of adequate clearing houses for the currency.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 05:56AM ET</span>",Volvo warns some vehicle engines may exceed emission limits,"By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Volvo (ST:VOLVb) warned on Tuesday that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected, sending its shares lower.
The company, which makes trucks, construction equipment and buses, said the largest volume of potentially affected engines had been sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that costs to fix the problem ""could be material"".
The issue could become an added headache for Volvo, which has been working hard to protect profitability after a surge in demand in Europe and North America caused supply chain bottlenecks, inflating costs for raw materials and labor.
Several countries have in recent years set ambitious goals to cut carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, bringing carmakers and truckmakers under greater scrutiny.
The car industry was rocked by the 2015 ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal after Germany's Volkswagen was forced to pay hefty fines after admitting to systematic emissions cheating. Volkswagen, which has pegged the financial toll at over $18 billion, is still dealing with the fallout of the scandal. 
There was no indication on Tuesday that Volvo had cheated or hidden any emissions related information from authorities.
Volvo said all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery and that its probe so far indicated that the degradation was not affecting all vehicles and engines in the same way and to the same extent.
The company had begun speaking to relevant authorities in Europe and North America, where emission regulations are strictest, a spokesman said.
An European Commission spokeswoman said the body would contact the Swedish authorities to gather more information, while Reuters was not immediately able to reach North American authorities outside of regular business hours. 
EXTERNAL FAULT
The problem was with a catalyst converter sourced from an external provider, Volvo investor relations director Anders Christensson said, declining to name the provider or say whether Volvo would terminate the relationship.
""In certain applications when the engine is not running hot enough you get condensation water in there and that causes this problem. You get a warning signal in the dashboard saying you're running above nitrogen oxide levels,"" he explained.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Mats Liss said the question was whether the whole catalyst needed to be replaced or just one component, estimating the total cost for Volvo would be at least ""a couple of thousands (of crowns) per truck instantly"".
The Volvo spokesman said there were no plans yet to recall any vehicles and had not been asked by authorities to do so. Volvo sold 143,373 trucks in Europe and North America last year and reported operating income of 30.3 billion Swedish crowns.
The company's shares were down 5.3 percent at 134 pence on 0917 GMT, making it easily the biggest lower on Stockholm's bluechip index <.PL.OMXS30> on Tuesday. 
It is due to report third-quarter results on Friday.

Analysts also speculated that an external supplier could mean that the problem was widespread and hit German truck rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). Volkswagen and Daimler did not immediately return calls seeking comments.

Volkswagen Group received a similar 1 billion euro fine in June when prosecutors in Braunschweig also used a so-called administrative order to punish VW for oversight problems which allowed millions of polluting cars to hit the road.

BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - The new chief executive of  Clariant  (S:CLN), which has Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE:2010) as its anchor shareholder, said rising tensions surrounding the disappearance of a Saudi Arabian journalist could hit the Swiss speciality chemicals maker and its rivals.
""If there is a major trade disruption involving Saudi Arabia, Clariant will be affected and many others I may say even possibly more than Clariant will be affected,"" Ernesto Occhiello told reporters on Tuesday.
""If there is no trade disruption the competitive scenario will remain untouched. We will see,"" said Occhiello, who was head of specialities at SABIC before taking charge at Clariant on Tuesday. 
""I wouldn't consider the fact that Saudi Arabia is going through a lively few days in the media as having an impact on the ability of Clariant to compete with other parties.""
Saudi Arabia's riyal rebounded against the U.S. dollar after CNN reported Riyadh was preparing to acknowledge the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched interrogation.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks nudged higher on Tuesday, as focus turned to earnings season and a rebound in Italian assets helped battered equities find firmer ground for now.
In Europe, shares rallied 0.4 percent and pulled back from Monday's 22-month lows. That followed gains in some Asian markets, led by Japan's blue-chip Nikkei index, which was up over 1 percent after a decline of nearly 2 percent the previous day.
Gains in Italy's bond and stock markets after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the country's expansionary budget helped lift sentiment. The euro also firmed.
Calm in Italy -- a major source of turbulence in world markets in recent weeks -- helped explain the recovery in risk appetite on Tuesday, said Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at Jefferies in London.
Stock market sentiment in Europe also got a boost from expectations that earnings season will deliver double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter.
""If you look at what's happening here and now, it is an improvement from what was happening a week ago,"" Alexandrovich said. ""How long the stability lasts is anyone's guess.""
(GRAPHIC: World stock markets - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OtmFHc)
Calmer equity markets took the shine off safe-haven assets.
Japan's yen was down a third of a percent against the dollar, the Swiss franc edged away from almost two-week highs against the greenback and gold dropped from Monday's 2 1/2-month high as tension between the West and Saudi Arabia triggered a fresh exit out of risk assets.
The disappearance in Turkey earlier this month of a Saudi journalist critical of Riyadh has provoked an international outcry against the oil-rich kingdom.
Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched interrogation, CNN and the New York Times said on Monday.
That backdrop, together with nagging concerns about the economic outlook, global trade tensions and higher U.S. interest rates, meant a degree of caution prevailed.

Italian government bond yields fell as much as 12 basis points across the curve, narrowing the spread over German peers, after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the country's deficit-hiking budget.

Huarong’s shares fell 3% on Monday after China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) issued a statement on its website announcing that Lai had been expelled from the CPC for corrupt practices.
Huarong’s shares have lost 62.47% of their value since the start of this year, according to a Reuters’ report.
Lai was alleged to have taken part in political opportunism and careerism as well as accepting entertainment from private business owners. The Chinese authorities said he “seriously polluted the political ecosystem” by employing only his relatives and friends. The Chinese publication Caixin reported that authorities had found more than RMB270 million in cash in various residences linked to Lai.
Lai may be the latest casualty of an ongoing anti-graft campaign that started in 2012 and has so far led to the punishment of more than one million party members."

826,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>","Ford unveils new China SUV, eyes sales boost next year","By Norihiko Shirouzu and Yilei Sun
BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) unveiled a new China sport utility vehicle (SUV) on Tuesday, and said its plan to release a spate of new models will help turn around tumbling sales in the world's top auto market from the start of next year.
Ford, fighting to recover from a severe sales slump in China, will start selling the entry-level SUV, called the ""Territory"", early next year. The car is jointly developed with local partner Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) (SZ:000550).
The car, based on a no-frills model from JMC, is aimed at appealing to consumers in China's smaller, so-called lower-tier cites, which have been a major engine of growth in the market over the last decade. It would compete with models from local firms like Geely (HK:0175) and Great Wall Motor (SS:601633).
The SUV is one of the 50 new or redesigned vehicles Ford has said it plans to launch in China starting this year and through 2025, which include the redesigned Ford Focus car due to hit showrooms later in 2018.
""All these vehicles - the Ford Territory, the Ford Focus and the Ford Escort... they will all start to make their volume retail contributions in the first quarter (of 2019)"", Peter Fleet, Ford's China and Asia chief, told reporters on a call.
Still, Ford's new SUV hits the market at a time demand for such cars in smaller cities across China has started to cool. China's car sales fell the most in nearly seven years in September, hit by cooling economic growth.
Ford's vehicle sales fell 43 percent in September from a year earlier and are down 30 percent in the first nine months of 2018 from the same period last year. Ford blames its weak China business on an aging model lineup that is awaiting an overhaul.
Fleet, talking from the Chinese port city of Qingdao where he was showing off the new SUV for the first time, brushed off concerns about slowing growth in small cities, and said Ford's 650 local dealers would help the model succeed.
""It's still of course an enormous industry. With Ford's relatively low market share it still presents an enormous opportunity for Ford,"" he said.
He added the firm was not currently seeing any impact from a blistering trade war between China and the United States, which had seen some imported Ford and Lincoln brand cars held up at Chinese ports earlier this year.

""We did earlier in the year (have) some slowdown which was reported. We have none of those issues currently on customs clearance.""

829,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 08:28PM ET</span>",Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen dies of cancer complications at 65,"By Bill Rigby
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen, the man who persuaded school-friend Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard to start what became the world's biggest software company, died on Monday at the age of 65, his family said.
Allen left Microsoft in 1983, before the company became a corporate juggernaut, following a dispute with Gates, but his share of their original partnership allowed him to spend the rest of his life and billions of dollars on yachts, art, rock music, sports teams, brain research and real estate.
Allen died from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer, the Allen family said in a statement.
In early October, Allen had revealed he was being treated for the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which he also was treated for in 2009. He had an earlier brush with Hodgkin's lymphoma, another cancer, in the early 1980s before leaving Microsoft.
Music-lover Allen had a list of high-profile friends in the entertainment business, including U2 singer Bono, but preferred to avoid the limelight at his compound on Mercer Island, across Lake Washington from Seattle, where he grew up.
Allen remained loyal to the Pacific Northwest region, directing more than $1 billion to mostly local philanthropic projects, developing Seattle's South Lake Union tech hub that Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) calls home and building the headquarters of his Allen Institute for Brain Science there.
Gates described Allen as following the Microsoft partnership with a ""second act"" focused on strengthening communities and in a statement said, ""I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends.""
Current Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Monday called him a ""quiet and persistent"" man who changed the world.
“He is under-appreciated in Seattle,"" said David Brewster, founder of local news website Crosscut.com and the Seattle Weekly newspaper. “He’s remote and reclusive. There’s too much Howard Hughes in the way he behaves for Seattle truly to appreciate a lot of the good that he does.”
Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, the son of a librarian father and teacher mother. He was two years older than Gates but when they met in the computer room at the exclusive Lakeside School in Seattle in 1968, they discovered a shared passion.
""In those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought,"" Gates recalled in his 1985 book ""The Road Ahead.""
FROM BOSTON TO ALBUQUERQUE
Allen went on to Washington State University but dropped out in 1974 to take a job with Honeywell (NYSE:HON) in Boston. While there, he pestered Gates, who was studying at nearby Harvard, to quit school and join the nascent revolution in personal computing.
Gates finally agreed and in 1975 the two jointly developed BASIC software for the Altair 8800, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form.
The pair moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, close to the Altair's maker, and formed a company. It was Allen's idea to call it Micro-Soft, an amalgam of microcomputer and software. The hyphen was later dropped.
Allen was in charge of Microsoft's technical operations for the company's first eight years, making him one of the handful of people who created early software such as MS-DOS and Word that enabled the PC revolution and thrust Microsoft to the top.
But he had ceased to be on the cutting edge of software development by the early 1980s. He never displayed the commercial instinct of Gates, who generally is credited with powering Microsoft's rise to ubiquity in the 1990s.
Allen left Microsoft in 1983 after falling out with Gates and his new lieutenant, Steve Ballmer, in December 1982, only months after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. As he recalled in his 2011 memoir ""Idea Man,"" he overheard Gates and Ballmer secretly plotting to reduce his ownership stake.
""They were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,"" Allen wrote.
Gates and Ballmer later apologized but the damage was done and Allen left Microsoft, although he remained on the board until 2000.
CANCER BATTLES
Allen recovered from his cancer after radiation treatment but in 2009 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, another form of blood cancer. He went into remission in April 2010 but the disease resurfaced in 2018.
Allen held onto his share of the company. His 28 percent stake at Microsoft's initial public offering in 1986 instantly made him a multi-millionaire.
His wealth peaked at about $30 billion in late 1999, according to Forbes magazine, but Allen was hurt by the sharp decline in Microsoft stock after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 and some unprofitable technology investments.
In October 2018, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $21.7 billion and said he was the 44th richest person in the world.
Allen, the owner of 42 U.S. patents, liked to cast himself as a technology visionary who drove Microsoft's early success and saw the future of connected computing long before the Internet.
""I expect the personal computer to become the kind of thing that people carry with them, a companion that takes notes, does accounting, gives reminders, handles a thousand personal tasks,"" Allen wrote in a column in Personal Computing magazine as far back as 1977, long before portable computers became a reality.
In the same year, he outlined an early vision of what turned out to be the Internet to Microcomputer Interface magazine. 
""What I do see is a home terminal that's connected to a centralized network by phone lines, fiber optics or some other communication system,"" he said. ""With that system you can perhaps put your car up for sale or look for a house in a different city or check out the price of asparagus at the nearest grocery market or check the price of a stock."" 
Allen later called this sweeping idea the ""wired world,"" which has broadly come to fruition. He was not alone in predicting connected computing but was one of the most prominent.
Yet Allen's technology ventures after Microsoft, which focused on areas he thought would grow with the advent of the ""wired world,"" were not as successful. He lost $8 billion in the cable television industry, chiefly with a bad bet on cable company  Charter Communications  (O:CHTR), while technology ventures he bankrolled such as Metricom, SkyPix and Interval Research were costly failures.
SPORTS TEAMS, A YACHT AND HENDRIX
He had better luck in sports and real estate. Allen bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team in 1988 and became a local hero in 1997 when he purchased the Seattle Seahawks football franchise after the previous owner had tried to move the team to California. The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in February 2014 and both franchises are now valued at many times what Allen paid for them.
Allen also made hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping South Lake Union, a shabby area of downtown Seattle that became a gleaming technology Mecca and site of Amazon.com's glass ""spheres"" headquarters.
All the while, the never-married Allen pursued myriad personal projects and pastimes. He owned one of the world's biggest yachts, the 400-foot (122 meters) Octopus, which was the venue for many lavish parties and the base for scuba expeditions. 
A rock 'n' roll aficionado, Allen had a band on call to jam with when he wanted, and spent more than $250 million building a museum devoted to his hero, Jimi Hendrix, which morphed into a music and science fiction exhibit designed by Frank Gehry.
He spent millions more on a collection of vintage warplanes and funded the first non-government rocket to make it into space. He also collected priceless antiquities and works by Monet, Rodin and Rothko to put in his extensive art collection.
Like Gates, Allen was a dedicated philanthropist, giving away more than $1.5 billion in his lifetime and pledging to donate more than half his wealth to charity.

Through various vehicles, Allen focused his giving on brain science, motivated by the loss of his mother to Alzheimer's disease, along with universities and libraries.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen dies at 65,"(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen, who had been suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer, passed away at the age of 65 on Monday, his family said.
Allen had said earlier this month that he had started treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the same type of cancer he overcame nine years ago. 
Born in Seattle, Allen attended Washington State University for two years before dropping out to co-found Microsoft in 1975 with Bill Gates, a friend of his from high school.
Allen, who left Microsoft in 1983, set up investment firm Vulcan Inc in 1986 to manage his multibillion-dollar portfolio.
""Paul Allen's contributions to our company, our industry and to our community are indispensable,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in a statement. ""As co-founder of Microsoft, in his own quiet and persistent way, he created magical products, experiences and institutions, and in doing so, he changed the world.""
Allen, who ranked 44th on Forbes magazine's 2018 list of billionaires with a $20.5 billion fortune, was a major benefactor in Seattle, funding everything from libraries and universities to brain research.

His investments include ownership stakes in several professional sports teams, including the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, NFL's Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer.

Curtiss-Wright did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) has improved the design of its Silvercrest engine to prevent a repeat of factory delays and plans further testing in the second quarter of next year to confirm the breakthrough, the head of its engines division told Reuters on Monday. 
Safran has suffered delays and penalties over the small new engine, but won a vital reprieve on Monday when business jet operator NetJets agreed to buy up to 150 future Cessna Citation Hemisphere jets powered by the French-designed powerplant.
""NetJets is the market leader and gives a great deal of credibility to the aircraft and the engine,"" Olivier Andries, chief executive of Safran Aircraft Engines, told Reuters.
Development of the already-delayed engine was thrown off course last year when Safran reported a problem with a compressor during certain types of high-altitude test-flying, prompting one planemaker to cancel plans to use the engine.
But NetJets and Cessna parent Textron (N:TXT), the sole planemaker still committed to the engine, reviewed the program in France last week and announced the major launch order at the world's largest business jet expo in Florida on Monday.
Safran has started producing redesigned parts and will start assembling them in early 2019, followed by ground tests during the second quarter to ensure the solution is working.
""We are very confident in the new high-pressure compressor, and the second-quarter tests will allow us to confirm that,"" Andries said in a telephone interview.
He declined to say when the Silvercrest engine would be certified since Textron wanted to keep this under wraps. 

Amid fierce rivalry to enter a rebounding market for luxury jets, experts say rival planemakers can work out details of the entry into service of a plane from engine certification details.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","Textron, NetJets strike deal for more than 300 Cessna planes","By Allison Lampert
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - NetJets, the luxury plane unit of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Monday announced a deal to purchase up to 325 Cessna Citation business jets from Textron Inc's (N:TXT) aviation unit, one of the biggest orders unveiled at a major jet show this week in Orlando, Florida.
Rob Scholl, a spokesman for Textron Aviation, said he expects NetJets to firm up the orders for up to 175 super-midsize Cessna Citation Longitude aircraft and up to 150 Cessna Citation Hemisphere aircraft in the coming weeks.
Deliveries are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In a statement, NetJets said the Textron agreement could increase its Cessna Citations fleet, which it has operated since 1984, to more than 800 aircraft over the next 10 to 15 years. 
The Longitude will compete with the new longer-range, midsized Praetors launched by Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) on Sunday and Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) Challeger 350 and 650 aircraft. 
Planemakers and buyers were buzzing about the deal as they arrived in Orlando, Florida, for the National Business Aviation Association's flagship annual corporate jet show, which begins on Tuesday.
Demand for luxury aircraft is seen rising thanks to a strong economy and tax cuts in the United States, the world's largest market for private planes.
The NetJets agreement boosted shares of Textron and also came as a relief to French engine maker  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), which has relied on sales of Cessna's Hemisphere aircraft, the newest member of the Citation jet family, for its troubled Silvercrest engine.
The deal could increase confidence in the Silvercrest engine made by Safran, which last month reached a financial settlement with Dassault Aviation SA (PA:AVMD) over the engine's production delays. 
French planemaker Dassault recently scrapped plans for a new aircraft that was due to have been powered by Silvercrest and replaced it with a new model, the Falcon 6X, powered by engines built by Pratt & Whitney Canada, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).
Dassault unveiled further details of the relaunched Falcon 6X in Orlando on Monday.
Shares in Textron gained 1.64 percent $66.14 in U.S. trade on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower in a choppy trading session on Monday, dragged down by technology stocks amid lingering worries over interest rates and corporate earnings.
The benchmark S&P 500 index teetered between positive and negative territory for much of the day but moved definitively lower in the last half-hour of trading. The Dow, which was positive for most of the session, reversed course.
The technology index (SPLRCT) fell 1.6 percent, weighing the most on the S&P 500, while defensive sectors such as real estate <.SPLRCR>, consumer staples (SPLRCS) and utilities (SPLRCU) led the S&P's major sectors in percentage gains.
The major stock indexes sold off sharply last week, which led to their sharpest weekly percentage declines in seven months. Investor concerns have mounted about the impact on corporate profits of tariffs and rising borrowing costs as the third-quarter earnings season kicks into high gear this week.
S&P 500 companies on average are expected to report 21.6 percent year-over-year profit growth, a decrease from the previous two quarters, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Also, the Treasury Department released data on Monday showing that the U.S. federal government closed the 2018 fiscal year with the biggest deficit since 2012. It ended the 12 months through September $779 billion in the red as tax cuts hit revenues and the government paid more to service a growing national debt.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note were at 3.1557 percent, holding above September's levels but below the levels that prompted last week's sell-off.
""The market is in wait-and-see mode,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""It's waiting for earnings, waiting for the Fed, and waiting for economic data from China to see if things are stabilizing.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 89.44 points, or 0.35 percent, to 25,250.55, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 16.34 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,750.79, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 66.15 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,430.74.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) shares dropped 1.9 percent after loan growth at the second-largest U.S. bank lagged rivals and fees from advising on deals and underwriting bonds fell in the third quarter.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares fell 2.1 percent and weighed the most on all three of Wall Street's major indexes after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said there were multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China, which could affect demand for iPhones this fall.
The top gainers on the S&P were L3 Technologies Inc (N:LLL), which jumped 12.8 percent, and Harris Corp (N:HRS), which climbed 11.9 percent, after the military communication equipment providers announced an all-stock merger to create the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 14 new highs and 145 new lows.

The broader averages struggled for direction as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 2%. Goldman Sachs warned that slowing consumer demand in China could weigh on Apple's earnings. But the bank stopped short of lowering its estimates on iPhone shipments, reiterating its December-quarter forecast for shipments to reach 80 million.
""Though most of the smartphone weakness was in the mid and lower range, we find it hard to believe that this general environment is going to be helpful to Apple unless things improve late in the year,"" Goldman said.
Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed down.
Falling energy stocks also limited upside momentum despite a rise in oil prices in the wake of rising tensions between the West and Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of a  prominent Saudi journalist.
In a sign of risk-aversion, defensive corners of the market were in favor as consumer staples rose 1%, with Walgreen's Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) closing 2% higher.
Financials closed lower as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) came under pressure despite posting earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates.
Bank of America reported earnings of $0.66 per share on revenue of $22.78 billion, beating Wall Street estimates for earnings of $0.62 a share on revenue of $22.62 billion.
There was little reason to cheer on the economic front after retail sales rose just 0.1% in September, missing economists' estimates for a 0.7% gain.
In other economic news, the U.S. deficit jumped to $779 billion, a six-year year high, according to a statement from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.
A 6% rise in defense spending, which accounted for about 4.1% of the total budget, drew a muted reaction in military names as General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) rose 0.4%, while  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  Corporation (NYSE:NOC) closed up about 1%.
Wall Street's timid start to the week comes on the back of its worst week since March as investors worried that rising bond yields would increase borrowing costs, stifling global growth. Concerns over a prolonged U.S. and China trade war also soured sentiment on equities.
""Our base case calls for prolonged trade tensions between the two countries that will weigh on investor sentiment,"" BlackRock said. ""The resilience of U.S. equity markets and economic activity may only further encourage the U.S. to increase pressure on China.""
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
L3 Technologies (NYSE:LLL), Harris (NYSE:HRS) and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

The allegation is that former BRF Chairman Abilio Diniz and former Chief Executive Officer Pedro de Andrade Faria did not disclose damaging information when they were at the company.
Diniz did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Faria declined to comment.
It will be up to federal prosecutors whether to file a complaint based on the police findings, whether to ask for additional investigation or whether to end the inquiry based on a lack of evidence for criminal charges.
Allegations have been made against 41 other people in the investigation known as ""Weak Flesh."" The scandal disrupted production and caused the temporary closure of export markets to certain Brazilian meat producers early in 2017.
Diniz's asset management firm Península Participações did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

Diniz is now a board member at  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR). Carrefour in Brazil could not immediately be reached for comment.

854,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 03:37PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Banks, Health Care Feature in Earnings
Banks and health care highlight earnings before the bell tomorrow.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) will issue quarterly results, as will Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH).
Bank earnings have been mixed so far. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported a better-than-expected profit, but the stock sold off as investors focused on sluggish loan growth. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported a rise in loans on Friday.
Also weighing in will be Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), That stock could get some extra scrutiny now after the latest retail sales numbers came in much weaker than expected.
2. JOLTs, Industrial Production Numbers Arrive
On the economic calendar, the latest reading on job openings arrives, with the August JOLTs report coming at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the job vacancies rose to 6.945 million in August from 6.939 million in July.
Before that, at 9:15 AM ET, the September figures on industrial production and capacity utilization are due.
September industrial production is expected to have risen 0.2%, compared with a 0.4% rise in August.
3. Khashoggi Disappearance Still Front of Mind for Oil Traders
Oil trade will likely be volatile again, as speculation about the fate of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi continues.
President Donald Trump relayed a denial by the Saudi monarch that the government knew what happened to Khashoggi. Trump speculated that he may have been targeted by “rogue killers.”
That seemed to calm the oil markets, as any direct tension between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, up to and including sanctions, could mean a sharp curtailing of Saudi oil production as a response.
The market is already jittery about supply as U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude go into force on Nov. 4.
Media organizations are still pulling out of Saudi’s Future Investment Initiative, dubbed Davos in the Desert, over concern about Khashoggi’s fate."

The Global Institute is a research organization owned by KKR that supports its investment committees and portfolio companies.

The two men are just the latest senior U.S. corporate executives to decide to not attend the high-profile conference amid concerns about missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom and a U.S. resident.

The rout in markets last week continued to funnel investor appetite for defensive sectors of the market, boosting consumer staples, which includes makers of household needs like food, beverages and personal care products.
Walgreen's Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) rose 2% following its mixed fiscal fourth quarter results released last week. The company posted sales that missed expectations, while earnings came in ahead.
Walgreen's struck a partnership with Kroger last week and said that further tie-ups with other retailers were in pipeline in a bid to improve traffic.
Kroger (NYSE:KR) rose 2%, clawing back some of the losses from last week, which had followed a bearish report from Deutsche Bank arguing the retailer was in a “position of weakness,” and needed to speed up its push into e-commerce to compete with rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
 Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) rose 2.4% despite ongoing struggles to appeal to younger consumer base amid flagging sales. The company said in a regulatory filing Friday it will name the next chief executive officer by year-end.
The consumer staples sector was up 1.08% at the time of print, but remained down 7.2% year to date."

(Reuters) - French planemaker Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) will nudge up production rates on certain business jet models, including its Falcoln 8x and 2000 jets, Chief Executive Eric Trappier said on Monday, a sign of broader industry demand for corporate aircraft.
“We are at the moment increasing a little bit our rate of production,” Trappier told reporters ahead of a major industry aviation show in Orlando. He would not give specifics.
Trappier said Dassault expects to deliver 40 business jets in 2018. Trappier said he would increase production of certain models in 2020.

After years of sluggish sales, potential buyers are looking closely at new models of business jets with longer ranges and elements like high-speed WiFi, planemakers and forecasters said at the executive aircraft industry's largest convention in Orlando.

863,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",The Treasury 10-Year Yield May Not Be Above 3% for Long,"(Bloomberg) -- The days of a 10-year yield above 3 percent may already be numbered, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc.
Rates strategist Rajiv Setia’s call for the 10-year to reverse course comes less than a month after it surged above this psychological threshold. In his view, underlying economic activity in the U.S. can’t support the 10-year at its current 3.16 percent, and he’s targeting a decline to 2.95 percent.
This may seem aggressive given the recent spike higher in yields, and when most of Wall Street sees the benchmark comfortably above 3 percent by year-end. The fate of those forecasts looks shakier, however, in the wake of last week’s equities sell-off, which pulled 10-year Treasury yields down from seven-year highs.
“The adverse reaction of the broader financial markets to the move higher in real yields suggests that unless data surprise to the upside of rather lofty expectations, any further sell-off is likely to be limited,” Setia wrote in a research note dated Oct. 11.
Investors’ conviction in higher long-term rates has proven lacking for much of this year -- the 10-year made several failed attempts at 3 percent before it vaulted over the hurdle in September.
The latest U.S. economic data have also worked in Barclays’ favor: Monday’s retail sales release showed an increase of 0.1 percent in September from the prior month, below the 0.6 percent consensus forecast. The case for inflation to support higher yields is also lacking, in Barclays’ view, and for the Treasury bulls at Bank of Montreal. BMO strategist Jon Hill noted that despite some encouraging wage-growth data, there’s still little evidence of broader price pressures, judging by the latest, weaker-than-expected consumer price index reading.
“It would be less of a massive narrative shift to go back to a sub-3% 10-year than I think some of the market really realizes,” Hill said.
By contrast, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and NatWest are among teams sticking to their calls for the benchmark yield to end the year higher, based on growth momentum and the risks of demand falling behind the increase in Treasury issuance.

865,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Why Hedge Funds Will Stick With Ever-Risky Short Volatility Trades,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s a familiar spectacle on Wall Street: the short-volatility complex takes a beating -- and prophets of doom warn money managers the strategy is running out of steam.
But while assets in passive products that bet against equity-price swings have shrunk to their smallest since 2013 and late-cycle bears are sharpening their claws, the trade isn’t going to be pounded into submission.
Market and technical forces practically guarantee hedge funds will keep calm and carry on -- setting the stage for the next wash-out, say volatility speculators.
“There are monetary conditions still supporting the trade,” said Yannis Couletsis, director at volatility hedge fund Credence Capital Management Ltd. “As long as central banks take a gradual and incremental pace of deleveraging, and their rhetoric continues to actually function as a volatility absorber, the short-vol carry will still make money.”
The VIX experienced its most violent shudder since February on Oct. 11, on the heels of a two-day 5 percent rout in the S&P 500 Index. That left short-sellers holding the bag, as the price of near-term futures surged above those further out on the curve.
Lincoln Edwards of Houndstooth Capital Management LLC, a $9 million hedge fund in Austin, Texas, that reaped 6,000 percent in February’s meltdown, estimates the losses on some of those short futures positions to be around $420 million.
But, in relative terms, the pain is limited.
The breakout in the VIX this month is less extreme than the February tumult and fewer funds are “leveraged to the hilt,” suggesting short-sellers are “sitting tight,” according to Tobias Hekster, co-chief investment officer at hedge fund True Partner Capital. “Their choking levels simply were not reached.”
The take-away? It’s likely ""business-as-usual for the short-vol trade -- and thus setting us up for the next hiccup somewhere down the road,” Hekster said.
Pretty Premium
The classic version of the strategy depends on the shape of the futures curve, and the tendency of implied volatility to be more elevated than its realized counterpart -- a dynamic some say is exacerbated by the tide of central-bank liquidity.
Sellers of volatility expose themselves to the prospect of unlimited losses in tail scenarios, while the pain for option buyers is limited to the premium paid. That asymmetry keeps the difference between future expectations of volatility and what actually comes to pass at a persistent spread, all but guaranteeing short-sellers make money -- except when the VIX suddenly surges as per moves seen last week.
One key reason for the likely lack of lasting pain is the absence of the short-volatility exchange-traded products said to have exacerbated the hurt earlier this year.
According to the now-famous theory, volatility-related ETPs scrambling to rebalance their holdings snapped up VIX futures in the grip of February’s meltdown, effectively pushing up the price of the contracts -- and eventually the underlying index.
“The AUM of these products is a ghost of what it once was,” said Houndstooth’s Edwards. “That’s actually a really good thing for short-volatility speculators since they’re less likely to get squeezed like they did on February 5th.”
More to the point, data suggests short-sellers were sticking to their guns despite ominous signs like the inversion of the VIX futures curve. Speculators were net short some 113,000 VIX futures contracts on Oct. 9, four days after the curve inverted, CFTC data show.
“Given the degree to which volatilities were depressed going into this, there is no doubt in my mind that the volatility short trade was alive and kicking,” said Hekster.
These investors have developed nerves of steel in recent years, thanks to the frequency of outsized VIX spikes.
“Sudden bursts of volatility have become a more frequent phenomenon in the past few years,” Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities, wrote in a note. He points out that since 2007, there have been six such events, compared with five in the preceding 50 years.
Such bursts can be lethal for the short-volatility punt, unless traders have had the foresight to implement hedges. In a twist that further feeds the volatility complex: Large VIX moves create yet-another opportunity to short the index on the way down.
Regardless, it is the investing strategy’s bread-and butter -- the tendency of longer-dated futures to be more expensive than shorter-dated contracts -- that will feed hedge funds and retail investors anew.
“Although large VIX spikes create the best opportunity to short volatility, I still believe that over 70 percent of the short-vol income comes from the futures curve roll-down,” said Couletsis. "

GENEVA (Reuters) - Global foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by 41 percent to $470 billion in the first six months of this year, the lowest since 2005, preliminary figures from the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD showed on Monday. 
President Donald Trump's U.S. tax reforms were the main cause of the slump, which followed a 23 percent fall in 2017, as American firms repatriated a net $217 billion from foreign affiliates, UNCTAD investment chief James Zhan said.
""The investment flows are more policy-driven and less economic cycle-driven,"" Zhan told a news conference, citing the U.S. tax reform and economic liberalization in China. ""Overall the picture is gloomy and the prospect is not so optimistic.""
FDI, comprising cross-border corporate takeovers, intra-company loans and investments in start-up projects abroad, is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of growth of corporate supply chains and future trade ties.
But it can also go into reverse as companies pull out of foreign projects or repatriate earnings. Such reversals could erode the importance of international supply chains, which became an increasingly important driver of international trade until 2011 and subsequently stagnated, Zhan said.
""If there’s a lack of FDI for expansion of the value chains then of course it will impact on global value chains and therefore impact on global trade,"" he said. ""It’s difficult to tell whether we are at a turning point (in globalization) or if this is only a slowdown.""
As U.S. firms pulled money out of their investments in the first half of the year, China became the top destination for FDI, with $70 billion of inflows, a 6 percent rise.
Developing countries attracted twice as much FDI as developed countries overall. Flows into Europe fell by 93 percent, as traditional inflows to Ireland - the European base of a number of U.S. multinationals - flipped to a negative $81 billion and Switzerland saw $77 billion pulled out.
But Britain jumped to second in the global rankings, with $66 billion of inflows, as international companies shifted money into Britain with intra-company loans, reversing a relative drought in 2017.
The United States was the third biggest destination, with $46.5 billion of inflows.
Despite the overall slowdown, money going into newly announced start-up projects, so-called greenfield investments, rose 42 percent, providing a glimmer of hope that more money will follow and drive more spending and trade in future.

Greenfield investments in Asia hit a record, driven by China's $41 billion crop and a surge of southeast Asian projects, especially in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Disney submitted its proposal on Friday, according to a filing on the EU competition enforcer's website which however did not provide details. 
The Commission extended its deadline for reviewing the deal to Nov. 6 from Oct. 19. It is now expected to seek feedback from customers and rivals before deciding whether to accept the concessions or demand more.
Disney secured approval from the U.S. Justice Department for the deal in June on condition after agreeing to sell Fox's 22 regional sports networks. 
The deal would expand Disney's unrivalled portfolio of some of the world's most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox's X-Men, ""Avatar"" and ""The Simpsons"" franchises.
Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox's stake in Hulu.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Bank of America's lagging loan growth overshadows profit gains,"By Imani Moise and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's (N:BAC) loan growth lagged rivals and fees from advising on deals and underwriting bonds fell in the third quarter, sending its share price 1.7 lower even as profit beat expectations.
The No. 2 U.S. bank's profit rose 35 percent, helped by cost controls, but investors focused on the underlying businesses.
""It was definitely a surprise when some of the other banks had better-than-expected loan growth,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Bank of America's total loan book grew 0.3 percent to $930 billion during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period. Declines in mortgages and loans to customers of its markets business offset gains in consumer banking, wealth management and commercial loans.
By contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) reported a 6 percent rise in loans and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) reported a 4 percent increase.
Bank of America shares were 48 cents lower at $27.98 shortly after midday.
The fees it generates from advising on mergers dropped 26 percent in the quarter, as did those from underwriting bond offerings. Its sales and trading revenue fell 5 percent.
On a conference call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said Bank of America is working to repair its M&A business after losing market share. At year-end Matthew Koder takes over as head of the corporate and investment bank from Christian Meissner, who announced his plans to leave last month.
""I know we can do better,"" said Donofrio.
Still, third-quarter profit showed the rewards of cost controls Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan has put in place. By reducing staff, closing unprofitable branches and putting old technology systems to rest, it has eliminated billions of dollars from its annual expenses.
Lenders in general are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy. Rising interest rates, lower taxes, buoyant deposits and healthy loan demand have boosted the industry this year, with some big banks reporting record profits quarter after quarter.
Bank of America's third-quarter profit jumped to $6.7 billion from $5 billion a year earlier. Excluding special items, the bank earned 67 cents per share, compared with an average analyst estimate of 62 cents per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
""Overall trends continued to look strong,"" Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said in a report. ""Underlying core results (are) not necessarily as strong as headline number though.""
Revenue rose 4 percent as non-interest expenses fell 2 percent. Thanks to its efficiency efforts, Bank of America's costs have been rising less or falling more than revenue for the past 15 quarters.
The bank plans to keep annual costs at roughly $53.5 billion through 2020, Donofrio said in a separate call with analysts. That compares with more than $80 billion in costs representing 85 percent of revenue in 2011, the year Moynihan first unveiled an efficiency program dubbed ""Project New BAC.""
In the first nine months of this year, Bank of America's ratio of costs to revenue was 59 percent. That compares with 57 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), 58 percent at Citigroup Inc (N:C) and 65 percent at  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).

Asked on the call whether Bank of America can get its cost ratio to the mid-50s in percentage terms, Moynihan said: ""We should keep pushing it down.""

873,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Burberry joins luxury sector's race to refresh products monthly,"PARIS (Reuters) - Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) said on Monday it would start releasing limited edition clothes and products every month, joining a growing number of rivals in the luxury sector trying to churn out collections more frequently to keep clients hooked. 
High-end fashion labels are experimenting with ways to square the long production cycles often required to bring complex catwalk looks into stores, and the needs of clients increasingly used to finding what they want instantly online. 
Burberry, which is hoping to revitalize its sales growth after hiring designer Riccardo Tisci, said in a statement that from October new items would be available on the seventeenth of every month, ""as part of its plans to excite customers"".
The first release, which follows a similar one around Tisci's debut runway show last month, will feature unisex white T-shirts and sweatshirts with the brand's new monogram, available for 24 hours on a handful of social media channels like Instagram.
The method echoes the so-called product ""drops"" popularized by U.S.-based streetwear brand Supreme, which helped turn its hoodies into highly-coveted collector items, and which more than one luxury firm is now emulating as they chase a younger generation of shoppers.
Italian puffer jacket maker Moncler (MI:MONC) announced last year it was ditching the world of runways to focus on monthly launches in its own stores of coats designed in collaboration with a roster of trendy designers. 
It still has a more permanent offering of jackets, but has said it wants to shift its entire production process to a monthly cycle.
Burberry will still produce regular summer and winter catwalk collections and other in-between ones. 
The company, which is looking to reposition itself as a more upmarket brand, said in September that a plan to create more targeted collections would help it limit waste, after it came under fire for destroying almost $40 million in stock last year. 
It has previously been one of the big advocates of a ""see-now, buy-now"" approach, which cuts out the six-month delay in delivering a runway collection to stores, but requires taking a punt in terms of forecasting what will do well off the catwalk. 

It has since tweaked the format, delivering in recent shows only a selection of items that were immediately available.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major stock markets slipped on Monday as rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to concerns over economic growth, with investors flocking to traditional safe havens like the Japanese and Swiss currencies, as well as gold.
Oil prices were little changed as the Saudi-West rift more than offset concerns over slowing demand for oil in the long term.
The yen  touched a one-month high versus the greenback and the Swiss franc  rose for the fourth session in five [FRX/] while gold  hit its highest since late July. [GOL/]
Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Monday ordered an internal probe of the unexplained disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi as a joint Turkish-Saudi team was expected at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where the journalist and dissident was last seen on Oct. 2.
Turkish police have audio showing Khashoggi was killed at the consulate, sources told Reuters.
Over the weekend, prominent business people, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Ford Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend an investor conference later this month in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 0.32 percent to $71.11 per barrel and Brent (LCOc1) was last at $80.15, down 0.35 percent on the day.
""People had thought the Saudis would make up for the fall in Iran's output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter,"" said Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, a think-tank affiliated with the Japanese government.
On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed after soft U.S. retail sales data. Apple (O:AAPL) was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) regarding overall consumer demand from China.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 59.82 points, or 0.24 percent, to 25,280.17, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.97 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,768.1 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 25.43 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,471.47.

Emerging market stocks rose 2.66 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed 2.35 percent higher.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) slumped 1.8 percent after Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan.
DOLLAR WEAKENS
The dollar softened against major currencies after the weak U.S. retail sales data for September while Treasury yields were little changed after last week hitting their highest level in over seven years.
The euro (EUR=) rose 0.26 percent to $1.1592.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37 percent versus the greenback at 111.81 per dollar, while Sterling  was last trading at $1.3161, up 0.05 percent on the day.
The Swiss franc rose 0.4300 percent versus the greenback at 0.99 per dollar.
Turkey's lira  jumped 1.5 percent to its strongest since mid-August after U.S. President Donald Trump cheered the release of a U.S. pastor who had been under house arrest in Turkey. Investors hope his release can lead to an improvement in strained U.S.-Turkey relations.
Saudi Arabia's riyal currency  was still testing the boundaries of its peg at 3.7514 to the dollar - its weakest spot rate since June 2017.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 5/32 in price to yield 3.1576 percent, from 3.141 percent late on Friday.
Last week, the 10-year yield reached 3.261 percent, which was last seen in May 2011, while the 30-year yield (US30YT=RR) hit a four-year peak at 3.446 percent. 
""This (Treasury) market sell-off is far from over. The economy is still very strong,"" said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors LLC in Minneapolis.
Spot gold  added 0.9 percent to $1,227.84 an ounce. U.S. gold futures (GCc1) gained 1.17 percent to $1,232.30 an ounce.

It was the eighth-straight day that the Nasdaq Composite was down more than 1% at some point in trading. The index was down about 0.8% at 12:14 PM ET (16:14 GMT).
The S&P Tech Sector index was the weakest among the sectors, falling about 1.3%.
Heavyweights Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were all lower in midday trading.
Netflix struggled the most, falling about 2.3%, but it’s not just the company’s shares that are struggling. The company’s junk bonds are facing lots of pressure from short-sellers, Reuters reported.
Bearish bets against the company's $8.4 billion of junk-rated bonds have more than tripled this year to $347 million, an all-time high, according to data from Samuel Pierson, analyst at IHS Markit, Reuters said.
""The short balance in the actual bonds reflects a view that (the bonds) will decline in value if or when they issue more debt,"" Pierson told Reuters.
Among other struggling equities were Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), off about 3.5%, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which sank about 3.6%, and  Autodesk Inc  (NASDAQ:ADSK), which lost 2.3%."

The comments add to pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May to rethink her plan for leaving the EU after Brexit talks reached a stand-off at the weekend over arrangements for the UK border with Ireland.
""If a transition deal does not make clear what will happen in the future, we will maintain our decision not to invest,"" Leif Johansson told France's Le Monde newspaper.
""A Brexit agreement will need to ensure that Britain does not become an isolated island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,"" he added.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said Johansson was referring to a freeze on investments in manufacturing announced in 2017.
""There has been no change to our investment plans in the UK,"" the spokesman said. 
AstraZenca has already spent 40 million pounds ($53 million) stockpiling medicines in Britain and continental Europe to prevent supply disruptions if the two sides fail to reach a withdrawal agreement. 
Some pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca have warned of medicine shortages in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit.
More than 2,600 drugs have some part of their manufacturing carried out in Britain. Britain exports some 45 million medical packs to EU countries each month, industry figures show, while 37 million flow to Britain from the EU.
France's largest drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) said in August it would increase medicine stockpiles in Britain, echoing moves made by GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), Roche (S:ROG) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN).
""In business, uncertainty often forces you to make decisions. But what is frustrating is to have to do so when the existing system works very well,"" Johansson said. ""This is costing us money and brings us no benefit.""

German motor vehicle authority KBA found four software programs capable of altering vehicle emissions in 2015, and ordered Opel to implement a software update in cars to remove them, Germany's Transport Ministry said in a statement.
""After a fifth software device was discovered in early 2018, which KBA found to be illegal, there is currently an official hearing going on with the goal of imposing a mandatory recall for the models Cascada, Insignia and Zafira,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
Opel said it was fully cooperating with authorities but that it could not comment on details of the investigation.
""Opel reaffirms that its vehicles comply with the applicable regulations,"" it said.
The transport ministry said Opel had dragged its feet on the hearing. The KBA had told Frankfurt prosecutors about the software device in April, it said.
""The official recall of the affected roughly 100,000 vehicles will take place shortly,"" it added.
German prosecutors searched offices at Opel's sites in Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern earlier on Monday. 
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office said it was probing 95,000 vehicles equipped with Euro 6d engines.
PSA Group, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, declined to comment. 
The Opel Insignia, Zafira and Cascada were developed when Opel and its sister brand Vauxhall were still owned by General Motors (NYSE:GM). General Motors sold Opel to PSA Group in 2017.

Opel admitted in 2016 that its Zafira model contained engine software which switched off exhaust emissions treatment systems under certain circumstances. Opel insisted at the time that it was making use of a legal loophole.

Now, a growing pack of them are eyeing their return in the place vilified for zero rates.
High-grade bonds in euros are dangling the highest yield relative to U.S. counterparts in at least five years on a swapped basis, thanks to angst over Rome’s fiscal stance and premiums for currency hedging.
That’s sparking something of a ‘comeback trade’ enticing large money managers.
Hague-based NN Investment Partners BV with the equivalent of $280 billion in assets has closed its overweight on American credit, as it awaits opportunities to add corporate obligations in the single currency. BlueBay Asset Management LLP, meanwhile, now favors euro high-yield credit over U.S. counterparts, dubbing investors “too gloomy” on Europe’s economic and political prospects.
“There is scope for some modest spread tightening by year-end,” said David Riley, chief investment strategist at BlueBay.
High-grade dollar credit pays 0.9 percent for hedged buyers, compared with 1.1 percent for euro-denominated peers. Similarly for speculative-grade bonds, those in euros yield almost 4 percent versus 3.3 percent for notes denominated in the greenback swapped back into the single currency.
“Any easing of risks in Europe and emerging markets could lead to a comeback in performance relative to the U.S.,” Pieter Jansen, senior multi-asset strategist at NN Investment Partners, wrote in a note Monday. “Investment grade and high yield bonds in Europe and emerging markets have strong potential to catch up on their U.S. counterparts.”
Still, the fund is keeping its powder dry until political risk in Italy eases.
With JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). warning last week’s equity meltdown underscores the risk U.S. markets are gripped by “late-cycle vulnerabilities,” European buyers may have an extra incentive to stay closer to home."

 General Electric 's (N:GE) GE Aviation unit has completed initial designs for a purpose-built engine for Aerion's AS2 jet, which could be flying in five years, the companies said on the eve of the world's largest business jet show.
""We're on track to fly in 2023, and before that year is out cross the Atlantic at supersonic speed, which will be the
first supersonic crossing since the Concorde’s retirement 20 years earlier,"" Aerion chief executive Tom Vice said ahead of the Oct. 16-18 NBAA event in Orlando, Florida.
A push by American start-ups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace to re-introduce supersonic passenger travel, for the first time since Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003, has triggered a debate over noise even at the subsonic level.
Until now, supersonic designs have struggled to meet current subsonic noise standards due to engine constraints.
GE said the engine would enable supersonic flight over water and subsonic flight over land without regulatory changes.
""In the last 50 years, business aircraft speeds have increased by less than 10 percent,"" said GE vice-president Brad Mottier. The next step, he said, ""is speed.""
Honeywell Aerospace (N:HON) will develop the cockpit for the AS2 and is ""talking with everybody that’s making supersonic aircraft,"" Carl Esposito, president of the company's electronic solutions business, said in an interview.

The stock had trimmed its losses, and was down about 12% at 8:24 a.m. ET. 
The iconic American retailer, which has seen sales cut in half since 2014, announced it would close 142 stores before the end of year and that CEO Eddie Lampert will step down. Lampert will remain the company's chairman. 
""Over the last several years, we have worked hard to transform our business and unlock the value of our assets,"" Lampert said in a statement on Monday.
""While we have made progress, the plan has yet to deliver the results we have desired, and addressing the company's immediate liquidity needs has impacted our efforts to become a profitable and more competitive retailer.""
After topping out at more than $122 a share in 2007, Sears' stock has lost nearly all of its value as it has struggled with shifts in consumer spending, and the rise of e-commerce, among other things. "

Adding to market concerns, diplomatic tensions escalated over the weekend between Saudi Arabia and the West over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was a prominent critic of Riyadh's policies.

925,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Schwarzman and Fink Said to Shun Saudi Investment Conference,"(Bloomberg) -- The heads of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). are the latest global business leaders to cancel plans to attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia in the wake of the mysterious disappearance of a prominent government critic in Turkey, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Neither Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman nor BlackRock CEO Larry Fink will now attend the event, dubbed “Davos in the Desert,” the people said, asking not to be identified. Executives including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Jamie Dimon and Uber Technologies Inc.’s Dara Khosrowshahi have also dropped out.
Turkish officials allege Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who lived in self-imposed exile, was murdered in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul after entering the building on Oct. 2. They now say they have audio and video recordings that show a Saudi security team detained Khashoggi in the consulate before killing him and dismembering his body, the Washington Post reported. Saudi officials say Khashoggi left the building unharmed.
The withdrawals will come as a blow to Saudi Arabia, which has built up close ties with the Wall Street executives. A year ago, Fink was one of the attendees at the first event of its kind where he publicly praised the direction of the Saudi economy. In July, BlackRock received licenses to conduct arranging and advising activities in the securities business in the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, agreed to commit as much as $20 billion to an infrastructure investment fund with Blackstone during a visit to Riyadh last May from President Donald Trump and business leaders, including Schwarzman.
The Blackstone and BlackRock cancellations came just hours after JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti said Dimon won’t attend the conference in an emailed statement, declining to comment on the reason.
President Trump said in a tweet on Monday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman denied knowing what may have happened to Khashoggi and that he is “immediately” sending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet the king. King Salman ordered the Saudi public prosecutor to investigate the fate of Khashoggi, a Saudi official told Bloomberg earlier Monday. The probe could result in people being held accountable if the evidence warrants it, the official said.
Drop Outs
The finance-industry executives join a range of business leaders to back away from the three-day Future Investment Initiative event, which is intended to showcase Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s modernization plan for the desert kingdom. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also facing calls to skip the conference scheduled for Oct. 23-25 in Riyadh.
“Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world,” a spokesperson for the Future Investment Initiative said in an emailed statement.
Herman Narula, CEO of startup Improbable Worlds Ltd., won’t be attending, according to spokesman Daniel Griffiths. Improbable last year raised $502 million from investors led by SoftBank Group Corp, whose planned $100 billion Vision Fund is backed by Saudi Arabia and other investors.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Chairman Bill Ford canceled a multi-stop trip to the Middle East including a planned appearance at the investment conference, Reuters reported, citing the company.
Billionaire Richard Branson sees the case as a potential game-changer for companies doing business with Saudi Arabia, halting Virgin Group’s talks for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to invest in a space venture.
“What has reportedly happened in Turkey around the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi government,” he said last week.
Viacom, Uber
Other confirmed drop-outs now include:
The event, unofficially tagged with the “Davos” title, features chief executives like Siemens AG’s Joe Kaeser -- whose engineering behemoth is a “strategic partner” for the conference -- and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s John Flint. The gathering is co-hosted by the kingdom’s massive sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, and the crown prince, who gave a speech at the event last year and took selfies with attendees. Uber got a $3.5 billion investment from the PIF two years ago.
The Riyadh event is not related the World Economic Forum which holds its annual gathering in Davos.
Siemens’ head of financial media relations, Philipp Encz, said that for now there are no changes to Kaeser’s plans, but the company is “following the situation closely.”
The New York Times, which was a media sponsor of the conference, has pulled out. CNN announced on Friday that it’s withdrawn its participation, while the Financial Times said it wouldn’t partner with the event while Khashoggi’s disappearance remains unexplained. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has also pulled out of the event as a media partner, a spokesperson said.
‘I Am Horrified’
President Donald Trump, who has forged a close relationship with the Saudi rulers, has said the U.S. is investigating the case and lawmakers have threatened to take action against the kingdom. Trump said he’s disinclined to block arm sales to the Saudi government, as senators in his own party have suggested.
Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would retaliate against any punitive measures with even “stronger ones,” according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. In a subtle reference to the kingdom’s oil wealth, the statement noted how the Saudi economy “has an influential and vital role in the global economy.”
Mnuchin and International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde told reporters in Bali, Indonesia, on Saturday they still plan to attend. So too does Moelis & Co.’s Ken Moelis, a representative for the boutique investment bank said.
“Horrifying things have been reported, and I am horrified. But I have to conduct the business of the IMF in all corners of the world,” Lagarde said in Bali, where the annual IMF meetings took place.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>","Bond bears stalk a FANG, short Netflix debt","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In March, noted short-seller Andrew Left took a swipe at Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Inc's stock, calling the online video company's aggressive spending on content acquisition ""unsustainable.""
The stock took a brief dive on the Citron Research chief's assertion, but the volume of bets against it has since dropped to the lowest in at least half a decade.
Netflix bonds are a different story.
Bearish bets against the company's $8.4 billion of junk-rated bonds have more than tripled this year to an all-time high of $347 million, according to data from Samuel Pierson, analyst at IHS Markit.
""The short balance in the actual bonds reflects a view that (the bonds) will decline in value if or when they issue more debt,"" he said.
That is likely with growing competition between video-streaming services. Such platforms, including deep-pocketed rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's HBO Go and Hulu - whose biggest backer is Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co - have spent billions to acquire the rights to TV shows and movies and to make their own.
In 2017, Netflix spent $7 billion on content and has estimated an increase to $8 billion in 2018. ""We'll continue to finance our capital needs in the high-yield market,"" Chief Executive Reed Hastings wrote in his second-quarter shareholder letter.
A Netflix spokesman declined to comment. 
Even debt investors with long positions in the bonds agree the short-sellers have a case.
""There is money to be made in the short-term"" by betting against Netflix debt, said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital, who is long the debt.
Those bets appear to be paying off. 
The two most shorted of Netflix's bonds - $2.9 billion of paper maturing in 2026 and 2028 - hit record low prices last week, with the November 2026 bond dropping below 92 cents on the dollar. Their yields, which move in the opposite direction, have risen above their coupon rate.
Bonds can be shorted, or bet against, in much the same way as stocks. The short-seller borrows the securities from a bondholder and then sells them, hoping they can be bought back later at a lower price and returned to the original owner, pocketing the difference as profit. 
Still, short-selling bonds - as opposed to betting against them in derivative markets such as credit default swaps - is far less common than shorting stocks, largely because bonds are far less liquid than stocks. They can also be pricey to trade because the short seller must pay interest to the securities' lender and pay any scheduled interest and principal payments owed to the bondholder.
Short positions in the U.S. high-yield market total about $28.5 billion, according to IHS Markit, a fraction of the $980 billion of shorted equities.
A FANG IN BONDLAND
Netflix, one of the so-called FANG stocks alongside  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, has a relatively new but hefty presence in the high-yield bond market.
""Netflix is the highest quality business that's ever been in high yield,"" said McClain, adding he did not believe the short positions have anything to do with credit fundamentals.
Moody's Investors Service earlier this year upgraded its rating one notch to ""Ba3,"" three notches into junk territory. It is rated ""B+"" by Standard & Poor's, four notches into junk.
Netflix, which went public in 2002, had a modest debt load in its early years, but it has issued a net $7.5 billion of bonds in less than three years. Its long-term debt as a percentage of total capital has roughly doubled to 65 percent since the end of 2014.
More is likely to come. Netflix will have $14 billion in debt by 2020, Jason Kim, senior analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), estimated, making it one of the largest issuers in the high-yield market.
""We expect the next capital raise to come in the fourth quarter of 2018,"" Kim said. 
Netflix is likely to be pressed on its issuance plans by Wall Street analysts on Tuesday when it reports third-quarter earnings.
Investors are also betting that Netflix bonds will fall because they are expensive compared with similarly rated companies. The yields on its two most shorted bonds are as much as 70 basis points below the average yield in the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch BB-B High Yield Index.

""Netflix bonds are trading well above their credit rating,"" said Neil Begley, senior analyst at Moody's. Their implied credit rating, based on Moody's analysis of the trading data, went up to investment grade in 2016. On average, the bonds have traded three or four notches above their credit rating for the past two years.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 07:59AM ET</span>",Carl Icahn boosts stake in Dell IPO standoff,"By Munsif Vengattil and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn reported an increased 8.3 percent stake in Dell tracking stock on Monday, as he looks to block a proposed plan by the computer maker to return to the public market without an IPO.
Dell Technologies in July said it would pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back shares tied to its interest in software company VMware Inc. 
Icahn and other hedge fund investors have resisted the plan, saying the proposed deal massively undervalues the tracking stock. 
""I intend to do everything in my power to STOP this proposed DVMT merger,"" Icahn said in an open letter to stockholders. ""It is better to have peace than war, but be assured, I still enjoy a good fight for the right reasons.""
Dell said earlier this month that it had met with some investment banks to explore an initial public offering if its plan to buy the tracking stock of VMware falls through.
Elliott Management Corp and Canyon Capital Advisors LLC have also resisted Dell's effort to buy back the ""tracking stock"" from them, arguing that Dell's offer inflates its own value and discounts the tracking stock's value.
A tracking stock tracks, or depends, on the financial performance of a specific business unit or operating division of a company, rather than the operations of the issuer as a whole.
""The Dell Tracker currently sells for approximately $92 per share but is worth on a pure mathematical basis approximately $144 per share,"" Carl Icahn said.
Dell and Silver Lake did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Icahn previously owned 1.2 percent in Dell tracking stock, and the latest stake would make him the second largest shareholder in the Dell tracking stock. 

Icahn said the best way forward would be to offer a competing partial bid that provides partial liquidity without forcing a merger, adding that he was looking at interested parties, including financing sources, who may want to finance such a bid.

The works council cited CEO Werner Baumann as he spoke to staff at a gathering at the group's Leverkusen headquarters on Sept 28. Reuters reported last month that considerable restructuring efforts at drug research and development, including outsourcing, were underway. 
""Werner Baumann spoke about the prospect of weaker growth at the pharmaceutical business and mentioned considerations that some expenditures on pharma research could be outsourced,"" the works council said in a statement. 
A person familiar with the company told Reuters last month that Bayer, which bought  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion this year, is considering job cuts and outsourcing as part of a wide-ranging review of drug research and development that will last until at least November.
The savings that Bayer - the inventor of aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth control pills - could make as part of the overhaul would give it financial wiggle room as it competes with larger rivals to buy the right to promising treatments from biotech firms.
Revenues from the drug unit's top products, blood thinner Xarelto and eye drug Eylea, will peak over the next six years.
A Bayer spokesman said Baumann's remarks were in reference to plans to intensify external collaborations, which had previously been communicated. 
The works council said it wanted more information and demanded wider-ranging job guarantees, beyond a pact that was previously agreed with the company.

931,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Bank of America’s Lending Business Boosted by Higher Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). got another boost from rising interest rates in the third quarter.
The firm’s lending business produced the most interest income since 2011 and its net interest margin climbed to 2.42 percent, better than analysts estimated. That helped propel profit to a record.
The results follow similar good news from Bank of America’s biggest competitors on Friday, when JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said their consumer-lending businesses were thriving. The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate seven times in the last two years, giving banks room to boost what they charge on loans more quickly than what they pay their depositors.
“Responsible growth, backed by a solid U.S. economy and a healthy U.S. consumer, combined to deliver the highest quarterly pretax earnings in our company’s history,” Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said Monday in a statement announcing the results.
Net income jumped 32 percent to $7.2 billion, or 66 cents a share. Analysts had predicted 62 cents, according to the average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net interest income rose to $11.9 billion.
Shares of the company, which dropped 3.6 percent this year through Friday, were little changed in early trading in New York.
The firm’s investment-banking unit posted an 18 percent revenue decline for the third quarter as the firm got more selective in taking on potentially troublesome deals. That compares with a mixed picture for rivals that reported results on Friday.
The change in risk appetite came after the firm lost roughly $300 million related to South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The strategy shift has spurred departures, including the firm’s head of corporate and investment-banking division, Christian Meissner.
Bank of America’s trading revenue fell 2.5 percent as the fixed-income unit posted a bigger drop than analysts expected. JPMorgan said Friday that its equity-trading revenue jumped 17 percent, helping to offset a 10 percent tumble on the fixed-income side.

938,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",SoftBank Slide Owes More to Chips Than Saudi Links,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Shares of SoftBank Group Corp. were down 13 percent in the two weeks to last Friday.
Nvidia Corp., in which the Japanese technology company’s SoftBank Vision Fund is a major investor, plummeted 12.3 percent over the same period.
That’s not a coincidence, though it makes more sense to look at the connection in reverse. On Monday, SoftBank fell a further 7.3 percent while the U.S. chip designer’s European shares were trending lower in early trading.
SoftBank’s dive has also been linked to an outcry against the Saudi Arabian government after the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is a major investor in the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund and earlier this month announced plans to invest $45 billion more for another fund.
The optics of being connected to the Saudi regime are bad for SoftBank – especially given the parade of organizations that have pulled out of a Saudi forum scheduled for later this month because of Khashoggi’s disappearance (the list includes Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News).
Realistically, investors are more swayed by the market downturn. Technology stocks are among the worst hit by a global slide since Oct. 1, with consumer discretionary and materials being the biggest drags on MSCI’s World Index.
For SoftBank, a Japanese telco-cum-VC, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that exposure to swings in global equities isn’t a bug but a feature.
Also quite telling is the fact that the company’s recent decline is more correlated to that of Nvidia than broader Japan or U.S. indices. Look at the chart for the past two weeks and you can see how closely they track.
Back in May, I noted that the meteoric rise in Nvidia’s share price was the major factor driving SoftBank’s operating profit last fiscal year. The Japanese company is a key shareholder of Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Vision Fund, which bought $5 billion of shares in Nvidia last year.
The chip designer is the third-largest holding of the Vision Fund, according to Bloomberg data, behind only Uber Technologies Inc. and a holding company that owns ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) Plc, neither of which are listed. By my calculation, Nvidia accounts for 18.5 percent of the Vision Fund’s deployment as of June 30 when measured by acquisition cost.
That proportion may well be higher if measured by market value, given that Nvidia stock has climbed. But maybe valuations of Uber as well as other unlisted investments such as GrabTaxi Holdings Pte and WeWork Cos. have also gone up.
Which is kind of the problem.
Investors in SoftBank, the Japanese telco, can build models to guesstimate the value of its holdings – an increasingly important factor in valuing the company. But Nvidia is one of the few where we can measure changes in real time. For better or worse, Nvidia’s position as a semiconductor company selling chips for AI and self-driving cars makes it a rough proxy for the Vision Fund’s two other major investments, ride-hailing giant Uber and chip-technology developer ARM.
Nvidia’s recent fall not only hits the value of SoftBank and its Vision Fund directly, but amplifies sentiment for other investments that are heavily concentrated in chips and transport (a truck-hailing company is among its biggest bets).
When I wrote about the Nvidia deal, I gave kudos to SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son for picking a winner. But investors need to remember there’s a flip side when investments decline. With so much of the portfolio hidden from view, any swings in publicly traded shares may exaggerate the outlook for SoftBank itself.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares failed to rebound and hit a 22-month low on Monday after their worst week since a correction in February as threats such as trade wars, rising U.S. yields, Chinese growth, Brexit and the Italy/EU budget row continued to weigh on markets.
For European bourses there was no wind of optimism from Asia where stocks suffered as rising diplomatic tensions between Riyadh and the West over the disappearance of a journalist pushed oil higher.

London and Brussels hope to reach a deal by next month but automakers have triggered contingency plans for any lack of agreement including changing their shutdown periods, stockpiling parts and certifying models in the European Union. 
Automakers generally sign two-year pay deals with their staff. Nissan was due to start negotiating with its workforce this autumn. 
""In agreement with our employee representatives, the 2019/2020 pay negotiations in our UK plant and technical center will commence in 2019 when we have better clarity on the future business outlook,"" a spokesman said. 
The firm, which built nearly one in three of Britain's 1.67 million new cars last year at its Sunderland plant, warned this month that a 'no-deal' Brexit would have ""serious implications"" for British industry. 
Carmakers are worried that port and motorway hold-ups could slow the movement of components and finished models, crippling output and adding costs, if Britain fails to reach agreement with the EU over its departure from the bloc on March 29.

Nissan said in 2016 it would build two new models at its Sunderland site after what a source said was a letter from the British government promising extra support if Brexit hit the competitiveness of the factory.

The Chapter 11 filing to reorganize debts of the parent of Sears, Roebuck and Co and Kmart Corp follows a decade of revenue declines, hundreds of store closures, and years of deals by billionaire Chief Executive Officer Eddie Lampert in an attempt to turn around the company he bought in 2004.
Lampert had pledged to restore Sears to its glory days, when it owned the tallest building in the world and companies that included a radio station and Allstate insurance.
But the company has not turned a profit since 2011, and critics say Lampert let the stores deteriorate over the years, even as he bought the company's stock and lent it money. It has sold off the legendary Craftsman brand and is considering an offer from Lampert for the Kenmore appliance name. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2A3giRQ
The company listed $6.9 billion in assets and $11.3 billion in liabilities in documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York.
The bankruptcy filing was sparked by a standoff between Lampert, the company's biggest shareholder and lender, and a special board committee, over a rescue plan proposed by Lampert.
Under the bankruptcy plan, Lampert's executive role will be replaced by a three-person committee, though he will remain as chairman of the board. Mohsin Meghji, a managing director of the M-III Partners corporate advisory firm, was appointed chief restructuring officer.
Shareholders generally lose their investment when a company files for bankruptcy, and the fate of Sears itself will depend on the willingness of creditors and suppliers to keep the company afloat.
The largest U.S. toy retailer, Toys 'R' Us, tried to emerge from its 2017 bankruptcy filing but was forced to liquidate six months later after creditors lost confidence in its turnaround plan. 
STORE CLOSURES, ASSET SALES
Sears said it will sell assets and begin closing 142 unprofitable stores by year-end with the aim of reorganizing around a smaller platform of around 700 of its best stores.
It is also weighing the sale of ""a large portion"" of its stores and said they could be bought by Lampert's hedge fund in a bankruptcy auction. 
Meanwhile, Sears and Kmart stores are open for business. The company said it is continuing to pay employees' wages and benefits and is working with its vendors to ensure its shelves remain stocked. 
""The company believes that a successful reorganization will save the company and the jobs of tens of thousands of store associates,"" Sears said in a statement.
The retailer employed about 89,000 workers in the United States as of February, compared with 246,000 people five years ago.
Sears said it has received a $300 million financing package to fund its operations during the bankruptcy proceedings and was negotiating an additional $300 million. 
Sources told Reuters over the weekend that Lampert was expected to contribute towards a financing package of between $500 million and $600 million. 
Shares in Illinois-based Sears closed at about 41 cents on Friday, down from over $100 in the years after hedge-fund star Lampert, once hailed as another Warren Buffett, merged it with discount store Kmart in a $11 billion deal in 2005.
Sears dates back to the late 1880s and its mail-order catalogues with merchandise from toys, medicine and gramophones to automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) of its time. 
Chicago's Sears Tower was the world's tallest building when it was completed in 1973, but in the following decades consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce and brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Lampert and his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc own just shy of 50 percent of Sears' shares and are its biggest creditor, with about $2.5 billion owed to the executive and funds he controls.
LAMPERT'S INVESTMENTS
One of the lingering questions for investors has revolved around the value of Sears' assets, which include prime real estate. 
The company sold 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to a Lampert-created company, Seritage Growth Properties. Lampert also became Land's End Inc's biggest shareholder when the clothing manufacturer was spun out of Sears in 2014.
Those deals could be subjected to new scrutiny by Sears' creditors in bankruptcy court.
""When you go into a bankruptcy, you're living in a fish bowl and every transaction will be looked at and examined,"" said Corali Lopez-Castro, Managing Partner at law firm Kozyak Tropin & Throckmorton. 

In an earlier attempt to avoid bankruptcy, Sears last year sold its Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) for $900 million. It also signed a deal to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 02:54AM ET</span>",JP Morgan and Ford cancel plans for Saudi investor event,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan & Chase Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend a Saudi investor conference, the companies said on Sunday, the latest such high-profile announcements after the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
The cancellations could add pressure on other U.S. firms like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), Mastercard Inc (N:MA) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) to reconsider their plans to attend the investor event.
Neither JP Morgan nor Ford would elaborate on the reasons for the decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh's policies, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that.
The investment summit in Riyadh typically attracts executives from some of the world's largest companies and media organizations. But it has rapidly become a vehicle for those firms to express their concerns over Khashoggi's disappearance.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, although he said Washington would be ""punishing"" itself if it halted military sales to Riyadh.
Major news organizations such as CNN, the Financial Times, the New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg have pulled out of the conference. The Fox Business Network, the lone Western news outlet still heading to the conference, told Reuters on Sunday it was reviewing that decision.
Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) CEO Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, said they were no longer going .
Goldman Sachs, Mastercard and Bank of America did not respond to requests on Sunday on whether they were still attending the event. 
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) declined to comment on Sunday on their plans.
Bill Winters, CEO of Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) was still planning to go, the company said on Sunday.
The absence of media and technology executives is likely to case a shadow over the three-day event, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert."" It has become the biggest show for investors to promote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision. 

""Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh,"" a Future Investment Initiative representative said last week.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>","Korean Air chief indicted on embezzlement, other charges: prosecutors","SEOUL (Reuters) -  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) Chairman Cho Yang-ho was indicted on Monday on charges including embezzlement and breach of trust, South Korean prosecutors said, adding to a string of woes at the country's biggest airline group.
Cho is the latest head of a big business group, or chaebol, to face legal challenges in South Korea since President Moon Jae-in took office in 2017 with a pledge to curb the excessive power of family-owned conglomerates and improve their governance.
Earlier this month, an appeals court found the chairman of retail-to-chemicals conglomerate Lotte Group, Shin Dong-bin, guilty of charges including bribery and breach of trust for his role in an influence-peddling scandal that led to the ouster of the country's former president, Park Geun-hye.
Samsung (KS:005930) Group's de facto leader Jay Y. Lee was also convicted of corruption in the same bribery scandal. Both Lee and Shin are currently awaiting rulings from the country's top court after their jail terms were suspended by a lower court.
A Seoul prosecutors' office on Monday said Cho took 19.6 billion won ($17 million) commission from 2003 through 2018 by setting up a trading company to broker aircraft equipment and in-flight duty-free goods purchase deals for Korean Air, causing the same amount of loss to the airline. 
Korean Air declined to comment and did not make Cho available for comment.
Also on Monday, Emily Cho, the chairman's youngest daughter, was cleared of all charges related to her allegedly throwing a drink at two business meeting attendees in April, because the attendees did not want to press charges, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' office said.
That incident re-ignited public resentment toward the perceived unchecked behavior of some chaebol family members, leading to investigations of alleged wrongdoing by other family members.
Chairman Cho's elder daughter, Heather Cho, was jailed in 2014 for demanding a Korean Air Lines plane return to its gate at a New York airport due to the way she was served nuts in first class.
Shares in Korean Air fell 0.6 percent on Monday, while its parent Hanjin Kal Corp (KS:180640), in which chairman Cho has a 17.84 percent stake, lost 2 percent.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:59AM ET</span>",SoftBank's Saudi ties unnerve investors as shares drop 8 percent,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) saw its shares drop on Monday as fallout from the disappearance of a Saudi journalist spread to the Japanese conglomerate, whose nearly $100 billion Vision Fund is almost half financed by Saudi Arabia.
SoftBank's Vision Fund is the world's largest technology investment vehicle, and represents one of a number of deals group Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has sealed with the Saudi government.
But the oil-rich kingdom has found itself threatened with ""severe punishment"" by U.S. President Donald Trump over the disappearance this month of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critical of Saudi authorities. Turkey said Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, while Saudi Arabia said the journalist left unharmed.
Concern over the disappearance has seen a growing number of attendees pull out of the ""Davos in the Desert"" investment conference, which has become the biggest show for investors to promote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision.
With SoftBank's Saudi ties causing jitters, the share sell-off is ""more psychological than anything related to worries on its fundamentals,"" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management.
SoftBank stock was down almost 8 percent in early afternoon trade. With further investor concerns including a Sino-U.S. trade dispute and possible slowdown in China's economy, the benchmark Nikkei share price index (N225) was down 1.7 percent. Meanwhile, crude oil prices rose as concerns over the missing journalist stoked worries about supply.
A SoftBank spokesman declined to confirm whether SoftBank executives will attend next week's conference. Son, Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra and ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) CEO Simon Segars were listed as attendees on a conference webpage that is no longer available.
Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] - in which SoftBank is the largest shareholder - said last week he would no longer attend. Saudi Arabia also has its own investment in the ride-hailing firm.
SAUDI TIES
Under Son, SoftBank built its global influence through tech investments and raised over $93 billion last year to create its Vision Fund - with $45 billion coming from Saudi Arabia.
That tech exposure saw SoftBank caught up in a broader sell-off of technology stocks, with Monday's decline exacerbating a two-week slide in SoftBank shares that is nearing 20 percent.
Ties to the Gulf Kingdom extend beyond tech investment. SoftBank and Saudi Arabia said in March they would build the world's biggest solar power generation project.
The kingdom has appointed Son as an advisor for its planned $500 billion NEOM high-tech city, and in October last year, it said it was considering selling a large stake in Saudi Electricity Co to the Vision Fund.

The increasingly high-stakes announcements - and lack of detail on related costs and implementation - have left analysts struggling to calculate potential impact on SoftBank finances.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:56AM ET</span>",China's ruling party expels Huarong ex-chairman over suspected graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The former chairman of  China Huarong Asset Management  Co Ltd (HK:2799), Lai Xiaomin, has been expelled from the Communist Party and will be prosecuted for suspected corruption, China's top anti-graft agency said on Monday.
Lai, one of the most senior executives to be brought to book in China's anti-corruption campaign, was accused of a long list of wrongdoings, from cronyism and taking bribes, to the embezzlement of public property, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said in a statement on its website.
Lai, in violation of political disciplines and the central government's financial policy, was accused of ""blindly and disorderly"" expanding Huarong away from its core business, causing adverse impact, the commission said.
It was not possible to reach Lai or a representative for comment.
Lai engaged in political opportunism and careerism, exchanged power for sex with several women, and flouted frugality rules by frequently accepting entertainment from private business owners in private clubs and high-end restaurants, it said.
Lai had also arranged company-paid travel for relatives and allowed them to use his influence to seek profit, the CCDI said.
President Xi Jinping has presided over a far-reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power in 2012, punishing more than a million party members, jailing top military figures and retired security tsar Zhou Yongkang, the most senior official toppled for corruption since 1949.
As a senior official of the Communist Party, Lai had lost his belief in communism and had practiced ""superstitious activities"", the CCDI said. 
He had been expelled from the party, it said. His illegal gains would be confiscated and the case would be transferred to judicial bodies for investigation, it added.
Lai was removed in April from his post as party chief and chairman of Huarong - one of China's big four state-owned bad loan managers, and replaced by Wang Zhanfeng, a senior official at the banking regulator.
The next likely step against Lai will be to put him on trial.
Huarong's Hong Kong-listed shares (HK:2799), which have a market value of HK$56.65 billion ($7.23 billion) dropped 3.45 percent around midday on Monday. The shares have lost 62.47 percent in value since the beginning of the year.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:55AM ET</span>","Exclusive: HNA held talks with Ant, others as it weighs options for IT unit Pactera - sources","By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's HNA Group is exploring an outright sale and other options for its IT outsourcing unit Pactera and has held talks with investors including Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], people with knowledge of the situation said.
The discussions on Pactera, which HNA bought from Blackstone (NYSE:BX) in 2016 for $675 million in cash, come amid a series of sales by the heavily indebted Chinese conglomerate and show the extent of its financial crunch following a $50 billion acquisition spree.
Since January, HNA [HNAIRC.UL] has sold or agreed to sell over $20 billion worth of assets around the world, according to Reuters calculations and media reports.
Beijing-based Pactera, which too has struggled with its finances, caused a stir last year when Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suspended early-stage work on its U.S. initial public offering after the deal did not pass the bank's internal due diligence standards.
HNA has approached several potential investors about an outright sale of Pactera, two of the people told Reuters. The group is also considering a spin-off of Pactera's financial services business for a separate listing, said one of them.
Ant Financial, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce firm  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) and operator of China's biggest online payment platform, is among investors weighing a deal with Pactera, two of the people said.
Terms of any deal under discussion between the two were not immediately clear. The identity of other potential investors was not known. It was also not clear how much a sale of Pactera might fetch.
Pactera did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. HNA declined to comment. Ant Financial declined to comment on what it said were market rumors. The sources declined to be named as the information is confidential. 
The discussions follow unsuccessful efforts by Pactera to secure financing via convertible bonds. Late last year it tapped CLSA, the Hong Kong brokerage owned by CITIC Securities (SS:600030), to arrange a deal worth up to $200 million with an eye also to a future listing in Hong Kong.
Despite discussions with potential investors it failed to reach an agreement and the deal was called off around late June, sources said. A spokeswoman for CLSA said it does not comment on individual deals.
In an Oct 1 letter to its bondholders, Pactera's parent, HNA Ecotech Panorama Cayman Co, said it has obtained a $80 million secured term loan facility for general working capital, which two of the people said was an alternative to the failed bond sale. 
HNA Ecotech did not mention any sale plans for Pactera in the letter.
Founded in 1995, Pactera offers digital marketing, big data analysis and other services for companies across a wide range of sectors, with offices worldwide, according to its website.
The company works with banks, securities firms and insurance companies. It was also recently ranked by IDC Financial among the world's top 50 fintech businesses.
In July Pactera was downgraded by ratings agency Moody's to Caa1 from B3, pushing it deeper into junk-rated territory. Moody's, which said the company's weak liquidity position was its main concern, also maintained a negative outlook on the ratings. 

Pactera reported revenues of $872 million in 2017. Moody's also noted the company had provided interest-free loans to HNA Group and its affiliates, resulting in a net cash outflow of $44 million in 2017.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:22AM ET</span>",Bear or bull? Five reasons to claw or thunder,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sharp pullback in stocks last week, including the S&P 500's (SPX) biggest single-day drop since a market correction in February, has left investors questioning whether this could signal danger for the longest-ever bull run for U.S. equities.
The following are five arguments on either side of the debate:
REASONS TO BE BULLISH
PROFITS, PROFITS, PROFITS: Strong growth in U.S. corporate profits underpins the case for the bull market continuing its run. S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise 23.1 percent this year, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
“If you still think the corporate profit story is intact, you should be owning stocks here,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said the outlook for the U.S. economy is ""remarkably positive,"" and strategists are quick to note that it is rare to have a bear market when the economy is expanding. 
""When you don’t have a recession, typically pullbacks can be sharp, but they tend to be short,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.
HIGHER INTEREST RATES - NO BIG DEAL: The spike in U.S. Treasury yields spooked stocks but rising rates are less concerning if they are gradual.
""We believe we are in a reflationary environment ... and hence, rising rates tend to be associated with rising stock prices,"" Thomas Lee, Fundstrat's head of research, said in a note.
MARKET CORRECTIONS - THEY'RE A GOOD THING: Sharp market pull-backs are viewed positively in the context of a long bull run because they rid the market of complacent investors and shake off pricey valuations.
""You need these periodic cleanses to kind of refresh and then allow the market to move higher,"" Carlson said.
THE BUYBACK IS YOUR FRIEND: Some market-watchers have pointed to a recent ""quiet period"" preventing corporate stock buybacks as a potential reason for a lack of support during the volatility. But companies are expected to keep using their cash to repurchase their stock, keeping demand for equities high. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists expect S&P 500 buybacks to climb by 22 percent to $940 billion in 2019.
Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management, said that buybacks are ""sustainable:"" ""You've got companies generating a higher level of cash flow based on the tax cuts that are in effect now, and that cash flow has to go somewhere.""
REASONS TO BE BEARISH:
EARNINGS - SHAKIER THAN THEY SEEM: After this year's tax-fueled boost, S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to step down to 10 percent in 2019. Some investors worry that even that rate may be too high, given pressures from rising wages and other increasing costs.
""The bull case is predicated on earnings being OK and if we actually see earnings estimates roll down ... that's a big risk,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
THE FED DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BACK: Powell's recent comments that rates need to continue to move toward an estimated neutral level and even a bit beyond are a concern for investors who believe the central bank may increase rates too quickly.
""The Fed could tighten too much, especially given that it is using two tools at the same time - rate hikes and balance sheet normalization,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""That has the potential to choke economic growth and create disruption and volatility in the stock market.""
POLITICS - CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON: Investors point to risks from increasing tensions over trade between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies. 
""The growing tariff wars have the potential to negatively impact economic growth,"" Hooper said.
Turmoil in Washington also creates unease on Wall Street, and volatility could rise ahead of the November congressional elections.
BONDS ARE ENTICING: Key to the run in stocks has been their relative yield advantage over other assets, namely bonds. But the rise in bond yields means they are increasingly attractive and may start to lure away investor resources from stocks. 
""If bond yields start offering competition to equities, then the favorable case for equities versus bonds is adversely affected and that is the key thing to watch out for,"" said Vinay Pande, head of short-term investment opportunities at UBS Global Wealth Management.
TECH WRECK: Shares of technology and other Internet-related companies have led the stock market's ascent to record highs in recent years, but those shares have particularly suffered in the recent pullback. 

If tech continues to stumble, some investors are concerned that other sectors will fail to pick up the slack in any market rotation.

(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp CEO Eddie Lampert has stepped in to contribute toward a financing package of between $500 million and $600 million that the U.S. department store operator was close to securing on Sunday to fund operations during bankruptcy proceedings, people familiar with the matter said.
Lampert, who is also the company's largest shareholder and lender, is hoping the deal, combined with a program of divestments, will give Sears a fighting chance to escape liquidation ahead of the key holiday shopping season, the sources said. Big banks, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), are expected to provide significant portions of the financing, the sources added.
The bankruptcy filing is expected in New York early Monday, according to the sources.
The sources cautioned that there was always a chance that the negotiations could collapse at the last minute and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
A spokesman for Lampert declined to comment on details of the bankruptcy financing, while a Sears spokesman and spokespeople for the banks didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Sears, once the largest retailer in the United States, hopes to sell stores and other assets, including its Kenmore appliances brand and home services business, in court-supervised auctions while under bankruptcy protection, sources have previously said.
Lampert is also exploring bidding on the assets as a so-called stalking horse bidder, setting a floor with offers that other possible buyers could then attempt to top, Reuters reported last week.
He could help finance his bids for the assets by forgiving some of the money Sears owes him, as opposed to putting in more cash, the sources have said.
Lampert, a billionaire who also runs hedge fund ESL Investments, has invested in and lent to Sears many times over the years, giving him and ESL ownership of about half the company, as well as $2.5 billion of Sears' debt.
Sears plans to close about 150 of its 700 stores in malls across the United States as soon as it files for bankruptcy, Reuters reported on Friday. It intends to keep another 300 open moving forward, and place the remaining 250 under review. It is unclear how the closures would impact Sears' almost 70,000 employees.

At its peak, Sears sold everything from toys to auto parts to mail-order homes, and was a key tenant in almost every big mall across the United States. But it has struggled to reinvent itself in the face of competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.

U.S. stocks recovered on Friday and gained the most in six months as technology shares rebounded and pushed major indexes higher.
However, investors remained cautious over concerns on rising interest rates and a possible economic slowdown.
In the annual International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting that wrapped up in Bali over the weekend, Brazil’s central bank President Ilan Goldfajn and Bank for International Settlements General Manager Agustin Carstens pinpointed global trade tensions as one of the biggest threats to emerging economies.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite both slipped 0.01% by 9:45PM ET (01:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.8%.
Yi Gang, governor of the People’s Bank of China, said over the weekend in the IMF meeting that the central bank still has “plenty of room” for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), if trade tensions with the United States continue to intensify.
""We still have plenty of monetary instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of required reserve ratio. We have plenty of room for adjustment, in case we need it,"" he said, adding that China still wants a ""constructive solution"" to the ongoing trade disputes.
In an interview with CBS that aired on Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was considering imposing more tariffs on China.
“I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us. I want them to open their markets like our markets are open,” said Trump.
The U.S. has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports totalling $250 billion so far this year.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.2% as  Softbank Corp.  (T:9984) plunged as much as 5% in the morning over concerns of the company’s ties to Saudi Arabia, which was under pressure on fears of sanctions following the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent journalist and former Saudi government adviser who was a critic of the administration.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 1.1%.
South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.2%.
Looking ahead, the Federal Open Market Committee will release minutes from its most recent policy meeting on Wednesday. Chinese inflation figures are due Tuesday while the third-quarter GDP, industrial production, retail sales are expected to take centre stage on Friday."

Docherty's is the eight appointment to the executive leadership team at Australia's largest bank since a money-laundering scandal last year triggered the departure of its former chief executive officer, Ian Narev.
Docherty had been acting CFO since May 2018, following the unexpected departure of Rob Jesudason from the post as a financial sector inquiry revealed socking instances of wrongdoing at CBA and in the broader industry. 
Previously, he had been the CFO of the Institutional Banking and Markets unit, the bank said in a statement. 
CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn, who replaced Narev after his departure in April, said the appointment followed a thorough global and local search for a candidate.
""Alan has already made a significant contribution to the Executive Leadership Team over the past five months as we have made changes to become a simpler, better bank,"" Comyn said in the statement.
On Friday Comyn told a parliamentary committee the bank had fired 41 staff for misconduct this year, while nine more had resigned under investigation for matters likely to result in termination. 
Not all were directly linked to the powerful Royal Commission inquiry that has unearthed widespread misconduct in the financial services sector, including at the bank.
In June, the bank announced it would spin off most of its wealth management and mortgage broking businesses next year, and revamped its executive leadership team with six appointments, including new institutional and retail banking heads.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Embraer SA is adding two longer-range business jet variants to its mid-sized Legacy line, featuring revamped cabins and technology that reduces turbulence to create smoother flights, the Brazilian plane maker said on Sunday.
The launch of the two Praetor models - named after Ancient Roman officials - coincides with the business jet industry's flagship show in Orlando from Oct. 16 to 18 and comes as Embraer pursues a broader strategy to revitalize its loss-making executive jet division.
When the Praetor models hit the market in 2019, they will join a fiercely competitive space that includes Bombardier's Challenger 350 and Gulfstream's G280, along with Textron's upcoming Cessna Citation Longitude. 
Embraer's corporate jet push is important because the company will no longer be able to count on its best-performing commercial division if its deal to merge that business with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. goes forward.
Embraer and Boeing announced the $4.75 billion commercial jet alliance in July. If the Brazilian government agrees the deal with Boeing, Embraer will be left with two remaining divisions, both in the red: executive jets and defense.
Embraer chief executive Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva said on Sunday the deal with Boeing would also deliver advantages in materials purchasing for Embraer's business jet division, but that it was too early to say how much it would save. 
""It's under discussion,"" he said. ""I think the partnership with Boeing will help with Embraer's whole business.""
The business jet division has about a 22 percent market share in terms of units, he added.
The Praetor launch comes under the direction of Michael Amalfitano, who took over Embraer's executive jet division in 2017 with a plan to deliver new features that generate higher margins.
""The customer appreciates that value and therefore that value allows us to maintain prices,"" Amalfitano said at the launch.
Amalfitano said Embraer has already secured firm orders for the Praetor planes, although he declined to give figures.
The super-midsized Praetor 600 can fly four well-heeled travelers nonstop between London and New York, or eight passengers on that route at a slower speed. 
For years, Embraer grew market share by offering hefty discounts on its corporate planes.
But Amalfitano has told investors he will avoid discounts in a push to grow margins to the mid-single digit by year-end.
""They are in a transition right now,"" U.S. aviation analyst Rolland Vincent said of Embraer's business aircraft.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>",UK automation picks up as flow of European workers slows ahead of Brexit,"By David Milliken
REDDITCH, England (Reuters) - At Muller Precision Engineering's plant in Redditch, south of Birmingham, James Gibbs is in charge of three clattering pieces of machinery older than he is.
His two co-workers - one Polish, the other Hungarian - place semi-finished metal parts on plastic spindles every 20 seconds and hold them between grinders for another 15 seconds, then check their dimensions before dropping them into a tray.
""It's a very repetitive job,"" said Gibbs, 27. ""You've got to keep your concentration for however many hours you're on there, so that you don't misload it.""
By the middle of next year, the work of two of the staff will be done by sensors and robotic arms.
British manufacturers have long lagged behind their developed country peers on automation, thanks in part to a seemingly inexhaustible pool of workers from Europe.
The flow of low-cost labor has become less reliable since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, however. Net migration from eastern Europe hit an eight-year low in the 12 months to March, official data shows, and industry groups fear the situation will only get worse.
Unlocking automation investment could have big implications for the economy. If companies tilt away from labor, economists say, it could boost productivity and take the lid off wage increases that have languished at around 2 percent in recent years.
Muller is already heavily automated, with covered conveyors feeding parts to computer-controlled lathes. The 150,000-pound ($196,000) investment in Redditch will automate processes to make components for Volvo truck brakes.
Manual work at the site can be boring and dangerous, which can make it hard to find staff, said Adam Cunningham, managing director at the plant, which employs around 130 people.
""That, along with a Brexit that reduces the amount of labor coming into the country, made us say we need to look at automation in that particular area,"" he said. ""Basically, we're going to be replacing humans with robots.""
The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) says British factories are less likely to use industrial robots than any other leading economy and even some countries in eastern Europe.
Bank of England (BoE) officials and industry experts say they may finally be catching up.
""Firms are increasingly investing in automation, substituting capital for labor, as workers become more scarce and costly,"" central bank officials Will Holman and Tim Pike wrote in July on a BoE economic research blog. 
While the blog did not specifically mention Brexit, it referred to problems with recruitment in sectors that rely heavily on migrants. 
Last year Britain's statistics agency cut its long-run forecast for immigration compared with before the referendum, and the central bank said a Brexit-related slowdown in labor supply was reducing the rate at which the economy could grow.
British businesses are investing in robots for factories, meat processing plants and warehouses, as well as self-service checkouts in supermarkets and automated check-in for hotels, research by the BoE's regional staff, or ""agents"", showed. The bank's 30 agents visit 9,000 businesses a year to spot trends. 
Businesses were focusing on investment in automating labor-intensive processes rather than boosting production more than ever before, the research indicated.
Some catch-up on automation had been expected after several years of falling unemployment. But the fact it is happening now is notable, given that economists believe Brexit is likely to dampen business investment overall.
ROBOT IMPORTS ON THE RISE
The trend is also showing up in official indicators. 
Customs data shows imports of multi-purpose industrial robots, which can be reprogrammed to perform new tasks and usually have arms capable of moving in three dimensions, rose to a record 83.2 million pounds in the year to the end of July, up by 72 percent on the previous 12-month period.
These are the types of robots the Frankfurt-based IFR is talking about when it says Britain is behind on automation.
Manufacturers used just 71 multi-purpose industrial robots per 10,000 factory workers in 2016, compared with 132 in France, 309 in Germany and 631 in South Korea, the world leader, according to IFR data. 
Partly this reflects the smaller size of the UK's automotive sector, as car companies make particularly high use of robotics. But even stripping out carmakers, British manufacturers are far behind their peers.
The BoE study said historically lower labor costs in Britain compared with continental Europe was an important factor. UK unemployment is currently at a 43-year low.
""But with the gap in relative labor costs starting to close, some of those contacts are now actively looking to deploy the same technologies in the UK as they do overseas,"" it said.
The BoE agents' report for September's Monetary Policy Committee meeting said a significant slowdown in migration from elsewhere in the EU ""was reported to have exacerbated skills shortages in agriculture, manufacturing and hospitality"".
""Post-referendum, certainly we don't have the surplus available low-cost, lower-skill labor that was there previously,"" said Tony Hague, chief executive of PP Control & Automation in Cheslyn Hay, a former mining village north of Birmingham.
Hague said his business, designing control panels for robotic and automated systems, was booming.
""The market is really buoyant. Everyone's got a full order book,"" he said. 
JOBS AT RISK?
BoE Governor Mark Carney said last month that one in 10 British jobs was at risk over the long term from automation, including artificial intelligence and robotics. On Wednesday, the bank's chief economist Andy Haldane cited research that suggested if UK automation caught up with that of the United States, annual wage growth could fall by 0.4 percentage points.
Guy Michaels, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, said his study of trends across 17 countries suggested rising automation had not cut factory jobs significantly so far, however.
Part of that is due to retraining that kept people in work even after they were replaced by robots, strengthening the case that automation could increase UK productivity, which lags more than 20 percent behind the United States, France and Germany.
""Overall we don't find a particularly significant effect of robot adoption on overall employment in the adopting industry,"" Michaels said.
British workers at the lower end of the pay scale are most at threat because they tend to find it harder to move up the skills ladder and because that is where costs per worker are rising most steeply, thanks to the fact the minimum wage is increasing faster than average wages.
Muller pays about one pound an hour above the minimum wage for basic factory jobs, Cunningham said. 
""We like to keep the differential in place if we can.""
Poultry processing company Avara Foods, a joint venture between U.S. agrifoods giant Cargill and British firm Faccenda, said years of increasing automation had not reduced headcount but did change its focus to training and recruiting higher-skilled workers.
Automation at Avara's plant on the edge of Telford, 40 miles (64 km) northwest of Redditch, allows it to handle twice the volume of poultry possible seven years ago for the same 1,000 workers, said operations director Philip Davidson.
""We process 21,000 birds an hour on that system,"" he said. ""You can't have people do that, that's impossible.""
This year, for the first time, Avara has recruited apprentices on a training program that will ultimately lead to a food science degree, Davidson said. 
The plant's high productivity allows salaries to be in the top quartile for the sector, he said. 
While British workers have always been hard to find, laborers from elsewhere in Europe were becoming scarcer, Davidson, Hague and Cunningham agreed.

""Clearly Brexit has had an impact,"" Davidson said.

The Tadawul All Share Index sank as much as 7 percent, the most since 2014, before trimming its decline to 3.5 percent at the close. All but seven of the gauge’s 186 members fell, led by Saudi Telecom Co. and Jabal Omar Development Co. The number of shares exchanged was more than double the 30-day average.
President Donald Trump said the U.S. could take “very, very powerful, very strong, strong measures” against the country if its leaders are found responsible for the Saudi citizen’s fate. The kingdom, which denies its involvement in Khashoggi’s disappearance, announced it would retaliate against any punitive measures with an even “stronger” response, the Saudi Press Agency reported, citing an official it didn’t identify.
The escalation in tension between the two allies, and growing calls for Saudi Arabia to explain what happened to the missing writer, have raised concerns whether the kingdom can attract foreign investors needed to overhaul its economy. The nation has been reforming its financial markets and has won inclusion in FTSE Russell and MSCI Inc. indexes for emerging markets.
“You are talking about a geopolitical situation becoming even worse and Saudi Arabia is going to show its stubborn attitude again,” said Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at Think Markets UK in London. “This is not going to sit well with foreign investors. From where we sit, we don’t see any demand for Saudi equities at all.”
Some company leaders have backed away from the “Davos in the Desert” event later this month intended to showcase Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s modernization plan for his nation. Still, Trump said the U.S. would be “foolish” to cancel large arms deals with the Gulf state.
The Tadawul’s main index has almost erased its year-to-date gain amid a four-day sell-off, sinking to the lowest level since January. Saudi Telecom declined 6.2 percent, Jabal Omar lost 6 percent and Saudi Basic Industries Corp. retreated 1.9 percent.
“Saudi is one of the world’s top oil producers, so one can’t sanction Saudi in the same way that one could sanction Iran,” Richard Sneller, the head of emerging-market equities at Baillie Gifford & Co. in Edinburgh, said last week. “Having said that, there are aspects of the Saudi regime that some people find less palatable and there are competing interests within Saudi as well. This is a very complicated country.”

Relations between the two NATO allies have been strained by U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, Turkey's plans to buy a Russian missile defense system, and the U.S. jailing of an executive at a Turkish state bank in an Iran sanctions-busting case. Brunson, who met with Trump in the Oval Office soon after he arrived in Washington with his wife on Saturday, knelt next to the president in the Oval Office and said a prayer for him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the United States would be ""punishing itself"" if it halts military sales to Saudi Arabia, even if it is proven that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the country's consulate in Istanbul. 
Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Riyadh and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the consulate. Turkey's government believes he was deliberately killed inside the building and his body removed. 
Trump has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and is under international and domestic pressure to help determine what happened to Khashoggi and punish Saudi Arabia if investigations show its government had him killed. 
Some U.S. lawmakers have said Washington should block military sales to Riyadh if the allegations are proven. But Trump is opposed.
""I actually think we’d be punishing ourselves if we did that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday. 

""There are other things we can do that are very, very powerful, very strong and we’ll do them,"" he added, without saying what those measures might be.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) is ""actively working"" on options for its stake in Indonesia's PT Bank Permata tbk (JK:BNLI), the British lender's Chief Executive Bill Winters said on Saturday.
StanChart and Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International (JK:ASII) jointly control the Indonesia bank, each owning 44.56 percent. There has been persistent speculation in the last few years that the ownership structure of Bank Permata could change.
""It is something we are actively working on ... finding a solution for Permata,"" Winters told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance on the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
""But frankly the bank is doing well,"" he said. ""The bank needed to be fixed up, it's now fixed up. Now we can talk about what we need to do."" 
StanChart reported a $215 million loss in 2016 from its stake in Permata, due to rising bad loans and restructuring costs. The lender's financial performance has improved since then, however.
Winters also said that StanChart, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, is adding more people and investing more in bolstering the infrastructure of its wealth management business, which, he said, was the bank's fastest growing business.
StanChart counts the Asian wealth hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore as its biggest wealth management markets, and Winters said there were opportunities to increase its market share in China, India and the rest of Southeast Asia.

The number of high net-worth individuals – or those with at least $1 million to invest – rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to CapGemini.

978,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 10:09PM ET</span>",New communication sector's shine could soon wear off,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The mash-up of old and new media may not be a winning combination for the new S&P communication services sector index (SPLRCL) as its highest fliers face regulatory threats and challenges to user growth.
The reconstituted sector, which debuted at the end of September, includes telecom, internet, media and entertainment companies such as AT&T Inc (N:T), Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR). 
Three of the five momentum stocks collectively known as FAANGs -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google parent company Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - make up roughly half of the new sector by market capitalization.
Facebook and Alphabet moved to communication services from the technology sector (SPLRCT). Netflix was previously in the consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD). The other FAANG stocks, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), remain in the consumer discretionary and technology sectors, respectively.
The addition of several FAANG stocks, among the fastest-rising shares on the S&P 500 (SPX), has brought more attention to the once-sleepy sector, formerly known as telecom. Indeed, so far communication services has closely tracked the technology sector. Both have slid significantly during sell-offs in October, including a 5.3-percent drop for the S&P 500 over Wednesday and Thursday. 
The two indexes recovered somewhat in trading on Friday. The communication sector was last down 5.3 percent month-to-date, ahead of tech's 6.0 percent slide.
On one hand, the communication sector's old-media names have cushioned it somewhat in comparison to tech's steeper plunge, but those less growth-oriented companies also limit the sector's upside potential. 
Also, several of the sector's growth companies - Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter - face regulatory risks that tech companies do not. Recent disclosures of privacy breaches have increased concern among some investors that the U.S. government could soon target internet companies with new regulations.
""The regulatory pendulum tends to swing from 'not enough' to 'too much,' and it will take time to balance,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""In the meantime, we have to think about overregulation.""
As a result, market strategists have been less than enthused. On Monday, Wells Fargo Investment Institute gave the sector an ""unfavorable"" rating. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and RBC Capital Markets rate the sector ""underweight.""
On Monday, Google announced that private data from 500,000 users of its Google+ social network, whose consumer version is being shut down, may have been exposed to external developers. On Sept. 28, Facebook said that hackers had stolen digital login codes allowing them to take over user accounts. Some 29 million accounts were affected, the company said in a update on Friday. [nL4N1WS51H]
Executives from Facebook and Twitter had testified before Congress in September on their companies' data security practices.
Another communications high-flier, Netflix, faces a separate challenge. Netflix's shares dropped 5.2 percent on July 17 after the company's rate of international subscriber growth in the second quarter underwhelmed investors. Another disappointing number for international growth could alarm investors, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta.
""That would be a concern because Netflix is so dependent on the international side in terms of its growth,"" Morgan said. ""The domestic side has become pretty mature.""
Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter results on Tuesday.
Given the risks to the communication sector's internet stocks, the sector is less attractive than technology or consumer discretionary for investors seeking growth, said Wren. At the same time, the sector's relatively high price-to-earnings ratio and low yield make it unsuitable for value-oriented investors.
Also, two communication stocks, Netflix and Alphabet, are among the most trade-sensitive within the 100 largest U.S. stocks by market cap, according to an Oct. 4 note from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
Both have been more reactive to Chinese market assets relative to other large-cap stocks since March, when U.S. President Donald Trump first announced tariffs on Chinese goods, said Brian Hayes, quantitative analyst at Morgan Stanley, in an email to Reuters.
To be sure, the FAANG stocks remain among the most popular buys on Wall Street. The NYSE FANG+TM <.NYFANG> index, which holds those stocks along with several other growth stocks, including Twitter, is up 15.1 percent year to date, well above the S&P 500's 3.6-percent advance.
But with that popularity also comes outsized potential for downside in the sector they dominate.

""The level of valuation tends to be quite high,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""That's the primary issue here and the primary risk.""

979,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 09:19PM ET</span>","Mnuchin to attend top Saudi event, media exit over missing journalist","By Saeed Azhar, Lawrence White and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Wall Street bankers will show up at an elite Saudi investment conference this month despite a growing exodus of top media companies and business leaders after the disappearance of a Saudi journalist.
Mnuchin's plan to attend the high-profile Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh follows U.S. President Donald Trump's comments that he saw no reason to block Saudi Arabian investments in the United States despite concern over the welfare of Jamal Khashoggi.
""I am planning on going at this point. If more information comes out and changes, we can look at that, but I am planning on going,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Friday.
In a letter to Trump, the leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee said Mnuchin should cancel plans to attend the conference unless Saudi Arabia fully discloses what it knows about Khashoggi's disappearance.
""We urge you to use all pressure necessary to encourage greater Saudi cooperation in the investigation into this incident,"" said the committee's chairman, Republican Ed Royce, and its top Democrat, Eliot Engel. 
Pressure has mounted on U.S. ally Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policies, went missing. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Turkish officials have said Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate. Riyadh has said the claims are baseless.
CNN, the Financial Times, the New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg, as well as reporters and editors from the Economist, said they were no longer participating in the conference, which relies heavily on journalists to moderate top sessions.
CNBC and Bloomberg, along with Fox Business Network, were among media partners with a big role at the event, which begins on Oct. 23.
Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi, U.S. mass media conglomerate Viacom Inc CEO Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, said they were no longer going. Entrepreneur Arianna Huffington will also not participate and has resigned from the conference advisory board, her company Thrive Global PR said.
The absence of media and technology executives is likely to cast a shadow over the three-day conference, known as ""Davos in the desert"", which has become the biggest show for investors to promote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision.
It has attracted some of the world's business elite, including Wall Street's top bosses and executives from multinational media, technology and financial services companies.
On Friday, conference organizers removed all the names of attendees from its website as the number of cancellations grew.
""Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh,"" a Future Investment Initiative spokesperson said.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, listed as a speaker, will not go to Riyadh due to a scheduling conflict, a World Bank official said on Friday. 
Asked about business leaders' doubts about the conference, a Saudi diplomatic source said late on Thursday that he hoped a joint Turkish-Saudi investigation into the affair could reach a conclusion before the event began.
However, the fallout over Khashoggi's welfare shows signs of extending beyond conference participation.
British billionaire Richard Branson said his Virgin Group would suspend discussions with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment in the group's space ventures.
On Wednesday, former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said he had suspended his role on the board of Saudi Arabia's planned mega business zone NEOM - another of Prince Mohammed's large projects - until more is known about what happened to Khashoggi.
TOP GUNS
While many media and technology executives have abandoned the conference, the financial industry showed no signs of doing so.
None of the financial firms whose senior executives were scheduled to speak said they had made any changes to those plans when contacted by Reuters.
Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, declined to comment on whether CEO John Flint is still attending. HSBC is a 'strategic partner' of the event, along with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), whose CEO Tidjane Thiam is still planning to attend, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Bill Winters, CEO of Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) is likewise still planning to go, a spokeswoman at the lender told Reuters. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon was scheduled to speak, as was Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) CEO Ajay Banga. Representatives for those companies, as well as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) did not respond to requests for comment.
 Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) said CEO Joe Kaeser still planned to attend.
High-profile investors also steered clear of announcing plans to abandon the conference. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said it was ""closely monitoring the situation.""
Private equity company Blackstone (NYSE:BX) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether CEO Stephen Schwarzman would still speak at the event.
A spokesman for the London Stock Exchange, whose CEO David Schwimmer is also a speaker, declined to comment. The exchange has been working for years to attract the listing of Saudi state oil major Aramco.

The City of London, Britain’s financial district and one of the main lobbyists for the country's finance sector, said it is urgently seeking more information on Khashoggi. Its leader Catherine McGuinness is due to attend the conference.

The settlement involves no determination of liability, the DOJ said, adding that the settled claims relate exclusively to conduct by M&I Bank prior to its acquisition by BMO Harris.
""While we dispute the allegations in this matter, we're pleased that it has come to a conclusion. We note that the allegations related to activity that ended before we acquired M&I in 2011,"" BMO Harris, whose parent company is Bank of Montreal (TO:BMO), said in an e-mailed statement.
""M&I co-operated fully with law enforcement, and no charges were brought against the bank,"" it said. 
A federal jury in 2009 found Petters guilty of orchestrating a $3.65 billion Ponzi scheme, and he was sentenced to 50 years in prison. 
Prosecutors alleged that Wisconsin-based Marshall & Ilsley Bank staff knowingly made false promises to Petters' investors that they would monitor and protect accounts holding proceeds from their investment. This facilitated Petters' scheme and resulted in millions of dollars in losses to investors, the DOJ said

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Friday it has acquired online lingerie retailer Bare Necessities for an undisclosed amount, its second apparel-focused acquisition in less than two weeks as it seeks deeper inroads into the online fashion space.
Walmart last week acquired Eloquii, a fashion startup that sells plus-sized clothing. 
The company also tied up with comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres to launch a women's fashion line in August.
In 2017, the Bentonville, Arkansas based retailer partnered with department store chain Lord & Taylor and started offering its products on Walmart.com. Lord & Taylor is owned by Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC).
Walmart also last year bought ShoeBuy, which specializes in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; Bonobos, which sells men's clothing and ModCloth, an online seller of women's apparel.
Walmart's string of small fashion-company acquisitions is designed to help the retailer access younger, millennial customers who do not normally shop on its website, and recover ground lost to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and others.
The deal also reflects a sense of urgency to defend market share. According to a report from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Walmart had 8.6 percent of the U.S. apparel market in 2017, followed by Amazon at 7.9 percent and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) at 4.8 percent.
The report estimated Amazon will overtake Walmart as the leading retailer in the apparel category in 2018.
""The acquisition of Bare Necessities fits well into our broader acquisition strategy, which includes two different types of companies: category leaders ... and digital brands that offer unique products,"" Denise Incandela, head of fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce, said in a blog post.
Bare Necessities will continue to operate its site as before and will run as a standalone brand, she said. The company was founded in 1998 and offers more than 160 brands, including bras, swimwear, shapewear and sleepwear.
Walmart did not offer additional details on the impact of the acquisition to earnings and did not comment on how this buy will bolster its market share in the category.
Noah Wrubel, co-founder and chief executive of the lingerie retailer, will oversee the intimates category on Walmart.com and Jet.com, which Walmart acquired in 2016. Wrubel will also continue to run the Bare Necessities business. 

The deal closed on Friday, Walmart said. The retailer's shares ended up 0.95 percent at $94.81 per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three of the largest U.S. lenders reported double-digit profit increases on Friday, helped by an expanding economy and lower taxes, and forecast more growth ahead as long as current trends continue.
Banks benefited from strong loan demand in the latest quarter, with lending rates rising faster than funding costs, stock market activity boomed and the Trump administration provided a business-friendly environment in Washington.
As a result, banks' net interest margins - the difference between what they pay for deposits and what they charge for loans - widened. Other key businesses, like managing customers' wealth or providing treasury services for corporations, generated consistent fees that padded the bottom line.
Banks also got a lift from cost-cutting programs they implemented after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, as well as tax cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump last year. Combined, those factors are saving the industry billions of dollars each quarter.
""Wages are going up. Participation is going up. Credit that's been written is pristine. Housing is in short supply. Confidence - both small business, consumers - is extraordinarily high, and that could drive a lot of growth for a while despite some of the headwinds out there,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts on a conference call.
While the rising economic tide is lifting all banking boats, some benefited more than others in the latest quarter, according to results released on Friday.
'GOOD TIME' FOR BANKS 
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said its third-quarter profit jumped nearly 25 percent, with each of its four business units generating higher revenue.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets, reported a 12 percent rise in profit, driven mostly by lower taxes and cost savings.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, the fourth-largest in the sector, reported a 32 percent gain in profit. The bank cited strong demand for auto, small business and personal loans, as well as cost cutting.
""It is a good time for the banks,"" said Allen Tischler, a bank analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.
Loans are performing well and banks do not seem to be stretching to make riskier ones to generate growth, he said. Credit conditions are strong enough to allow banks to trim capital cushions to increase shareholder payouts, something investors have enjoyed, he added.
DIMON SEES SOME RISKS 
Although the industry is prospering, third-quarter results did not uniformly impress analysts and investors.
Wells Fargo, for instance, is still struggling with the effects of a wide-ranging sales scandal that erupted more than two years ago, and its mortgage business is suffering from a sharp downturn in refinancing. Even as it reported a substantial rise in profits, its earnings per share missed estimates by a penny.
JPMorgan's bond trading business suffered a 10 percent decline in revenue compared with the year-ago period. The business has been challenged across Wall Street for several years due to new regulations and changing customer preferences. JPMorgan's finance chief, Marianne Lake, said increased competition has made it harder to hold onto market share at a time when margins are thinning.
Dimon discussed several issues that could dent the industry's profitability, ranging from geopolitical tensions to Brexit and inflation.
Short-term interest rates could go up to 4 percent as central bankers try to prevent higher inflation, and investors may not be ready for that, Dimon said. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points, with analysts citing concerns about U.S. Federal Reserve policy.
""The market may not take it that well if rates go up,"" Dimon said.

Wells Fargo shares closed up 1.3 percent at $52.11, Citigroup shares closed up 2.1 percent at $69.84 while JPMorgan shares fell 1 percent to $106.95.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 05:09PM ET</span>",Englander's Millennium hires portfolio manager from Citadel: sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Millennium Management, the $36 billion hedge fund run by Israel Englander, has hired a portfolio manager from rival Ken Griffin's Citadel, two people familiar with the situation said on Friday.
Neel Parekh is moving to Millennium where he will be an equity portfolio manager, said the sources, who are not authorized to speak publicly about the private fund's hirings.
Parekh traces his roots to legendary stock picker Julian Robertson. He moved to Citadel's Aptigon stock unit in 2017 after he shut down Night Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Partners, a hedge fund he had run with Michael Berkley who also moved to Citadel. Berkley will now be Aptigon's sole portfolio manager for the consumer team.
Millennium operates a multi-strategy fund and employs about 200 investment teams. The firm stopped taking in new capital in 2015 and plans to return some capital at the end of this year. Millennium's fund has gained 8.3 percent in the first nine months of 2018.
A Millennium spokesman declined to comment and Parekh could not be reached for comment.
Parekh is leaving Citadel, which manages $30 billion in assets, a few months after the firm laid off more than 40 people from its Aptigon unit, one of its biggest shakeups in years.
Most of the layoffs, which included portfolio managers, analysts, associates and ancillary staff, occurred in February and March.
Another former portfolio manager at Aptigon, Matthew Oak, also moved to Millennium recently, the sources said.
Citadel declined to comment.
Aptigon manages money for Citadel's main multi-strategy Kensington and Wellington funds which are up roughly 14.75 percent this year.
Citadel said earlier this year it was committed to Aptigon's success and made changes to strengthen the platform. 
Several people who were unaffected by the layoffs have since left the firm. Lucy DeStefano, former head of trading at Aptigon, resigned in May and is set to join Soros Fund Management later this year. Joe Sinopoli, who worked on Parekh's team, also recently left Aptigon, the sources said.
Sinopoli did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman said Citadel has hired 25 people at its Aptigon unit since February. Andrew Schoff, a member of the investment team at hedge fund Tide Point which shut down in September, will join Aptigon as a portfolio manager next week, the spokeswoman confirmed.. Vivek Mehta, who previously worked at Viking Global Investors and then ran his own firm, joined as a portfolio manager in September.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index snapped a six-day losing streak on Friday as technology stocks recovered after a week of losses, with investors looking for bargains ahead of the third quarter earnings reporting season. 
Even the hard-hit S&P500 energy and financial sectors managed to close the session with slight gains after a late afternoon rally.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) gained 3.2 percent on the day, showing its strongest one-day gain since March 26, although it still registered its biggest weekly drop since March 23.
""People are starting to buy in, thinking the higher flying growth stocks were oversold. They wanted to get in before next week when earnings start coming,"" said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
But until the U.S. and China reach a trade deal, the rebound in the stockmarket could be vulnerable as investors are anxious about the impact of tariffs on corporate profits.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As Wall Street steadied on Friday after its worst two-day slide in eight months, the U.S. stock market remained fragile, with nearly three quarters of the S&P 500's (SPX) components in correction territory, or worse.
Following Wednesday and Thursday's 5-percent rout on the S&P 500, the leading benchmark index is down nearly 7 percent from its record high close on Sept 20. Within the index, most stocks are doing much more poorly. 
About 380 S&P 500 stocks have fallen 10 percent or more from their 52-week highs, as of midday trading, putting the vast majority of the index squarely within correction territory. Of those, 164 stocks have fallen by 20 percent or more from their highs, establishing them in a bear market, by many investors' definitions.

On Feb. 6, 713 NYSE-listed stocks closed at 52-week lows and 36 reached new highs. During the selloff between Jan. 26 and Feb. 9, the S&P 500 lost as much as 11. 8 percent. It took until August to recover.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 03:02PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo profit rises, cost cuts paying off","By Imani Moise and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) posted a 32 percent jump in quarterly profit on Friday, as the bank made headway in its cost-cutting plan and worked to put past misdeeds behind it.
Non-interest expenses in the third quarter fell 4.1 percent to $13.8 billion, in the first year-over-year decline this year.
Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. lender by assets, has vowed to chop billions of costs over the next several years. But costs for repaying customers it had previously overcharged and marketing costs to re-brand the company after a string of scandals have kept costs stubbornly high.
Wells has promised to reduce about $3 billion in expenses by 2020. It is closing roughly 800 branches and cutting up to 10 percent of its workforce over the next three years.
Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told reporters on a conference call that other opportunities to reduce costs include scaling back call center operations and non-customer-facing office space. 
But even as profits soared due to the cost cuts and a lower tax rate, analysts raised concerns about the company's sluggish revenue and shrinking loan book.
Total loans fell 1 percent to $942.3 billion, and revenue inched 0.4 percent higher during the quarter. By comparison JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) reported a 5.2 percent increase in revenue and a 6 percent jump in average loan balances on Friday. 
""Loan and revenue growth remains challenged,"" said Kyle Sanders, an Edward Jones analyst, in a research note. ""This trend could linger in the near term as Wells works to emerge from the Fed's asset growth cap and repair its reputation with consumers.""
The Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells to keep its assets below $1.95 million until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals.
Chief Executive Tim Sloan said on a call with analysts he was hopeful that the bank would not have any new issues. 
Analysts said the quarter's results show that Wells is making progress on cleaning up its previous scandals, though worries linger. 
""While these results were less noisy than previous quarters, more fallout from prior misdeeds cannot be ruled out,” Allen Tischler, senior vice president with Moody’s Investors Service, said.
Wells Fargo ended the quarter with $1.88 trillion in assets. Its average total deposits declined 3 percent to $1.27 trillion, well under the Fed's $1.95 trillion asset cap.
The bank's executives expect the cap to be lifted in the first half of next year.
Net income applicable to common stockholders rose to $5.45 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.13 billion, or 83 cents per share, a year ago.

On an adjusted basis, the company narrowly missed analysts' estimates, earning $1.16 per share, compared to estimates of $1.17, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 03:02PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears aims to close up to 150 stores in bankruptcy - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp is planning to close up to 150 of its department and discount stores and keep at least another 300 open as part of a plan to restructure under U.S. bankruptcy protection, people familiar with the matter said Friday.
The plans, which remained in flux on Friday afternoon, would leave the fate of Sears' remaining roughly 250 stores uncertain, the sources said. The future of the stores could hinge on Sears' negotiations with landlords over their leases. 
In total, Sears has about 700 stores and roughly 90,000 employees. 
The beleaguered 125-year-old retailer, once the largest in the United States, hopes to sell stores and other assets, including its Kenmore appliances brand and home services business, in court-supervised auctions while under bankruptcy protection, the sources said. 
Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert, also the company's largest shareholder and creditor, is exploring bidding on the assets as a so-called stalking horse, setting a floor with offers that other possible buyers could then attempt to top, the sources said. 
Reuters first reported on Thursday that Lampert was exploring bidding for some Sears assets. Such a plan could potentially keep a slimmer Sears alive as a going concern, the sources said. 
Sears was making progress in its negotiations with banks on Friday for financing to keep it afloat through the holiday season while in bankruptcy court, with lenders expected to provide several hundred million dollars, the sources said. The bankruptcy loan amount is unlikely to significantly exceed $400 million, though it could end up being less, the sources said. 
A key unresolved aspect of Sears' negotiations with lenders involves setting deadlines for Sears to achieve specific business goals while under bankruptcy protections, the sources said. 
Sears is planning to seek bankruptcy protection in New York as soon as Sunday night, though a court filing could slip into Monday, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.
Sears did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sears shares were trading up 20 percent at 41 cents on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of $40 million. 
Lampert could help finance his bids for the assets by forgiving some of the money Sears owes him, as opposed to putting in more cash, Reuters reported on Thursday. 
At its peak in the 1960s, Sears sold everything from toys to auto parts to mail-order homes, and was a key tenant in almost every big mall across the United States.

But it has struggled to reinvent itself in the face of competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.

1019,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",A Looming Bear Market in Stocks? Don’t Bet on It,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The meltdown in stocks this week that saw the S&P 500 tumble 5.28 percent over the course of two days sparked an outpouring of views on how rising interest rates are bursting a bubble that drove equity prices to unrealistically high levels. Most of this so-called logic is hyperbole. Market corrections, as opposed to bear markets, happen all the time and this one is still within the range of normal volatility. Bear markets largely occur when the economy lapses into recession, yet most economists don't see that happening until 2020, if then. 
Rising interest rates do hurt valuations, especially when valuations are high, but that's not the case currently. The S&P 500 Index trades at just over 13 times projected earnings, excluding the very expensive ""FAANG"" group of stocks consisting of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. The FAANGs account for about 10 percent of the weight of the S&P 500 and sport a multiple of 49 times next year’s earnings estimates. So when they run up sharply, they move the entire S&P 500, even if much of the rest of the market has remained little changed for 2018, becoming materially cheaper in the process.
Corporate profits, interest rates and market sentiment -- especially in the short-run -- are the key determinants of stock prices. Even so, it is dangerous to focus on any one of these by itself. Corporate profits are rising very sharply, driven by the strong performance of the economy and reinforced by the cut in corporate tax rates. Companies are beginning to report earnings for the third quarter and it is reasonable to expect gains of 20 percent or more. The same is forecast for the fourth quarter. And even if the economy slows next year, profits should easily rise by a still healthy 10 percent. This is not the kind of environment that leads to a bear market.
Rising interest rates are inversely related to stock valuations. In the 1970s and 1980s when inflation and interest rates were historically high, earnings multiples were historically low. But even with the recent rise, prevailing interest rates are still quite low historically, justifying earnings multiples that are well above current levels.
So, why aren’t stock prices even higher? Investors haven’t gotten over the devastation that occurred a decade ago in 2008. This can be seen by comparing the safer to the riskier parts of the stock market. Companies with more regulated or stable businesses such as utilities, real estate investment trusts and consumer staples trade at above average multiples. These stocks are somewhat more vulnerable to rising interest rates. In contrast, sectors that are more volatile tend to trade at lower multiples, including energy, financial (ground zero for the 2008 meltdown) and consumer discretionary firms. Broadly speaking, these low valuations make these groups much safer.
It is the sudden realization that interest rates were moving up far more than investors had anticipated that prompted the sell-off in stocks. But as long as the economy and profits move up roughly as anticipated, stocks should soon find support and could easily rebound to new highs. This should happen within coming weeks in response to the flood of second-quarter earnings reports.
Longer-term, the jury is still out on whether the rise in interest rates will truly undermine either the economic expansion or the stock market. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is moving slowly because it doesn’t want to scare markets or undermine the expansion with inflation fairly benign. It is premature to judge whether the Fed is moving too slowly, as I do, or too quickly, as others suggest. We will find out soon enough, but it is even more premature to write the stock market’s epitaph."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Faced with a proliferation of new electronic cigarettes and a sharp rise in teen vaping, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday sent letters to 21 electronic cigarette manufacturers seeking information to assess whether the products are being marketed illegally. 
An FDA rule banned the sale of new e-cigarette products after August 2016 without regulatory approval. In September, Reuters reported that startups and big tobacco firms launched more than a dozen new high-nicotine e-cigarette products mimicking the popular Juul devices after the FDA imposed the deadline https://reut.rs/2PwFgOX.
The agency on Friday sent letters to companies including Reynolds American Inc (NYSE:RAI), a unit of  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc, which makes the Vuse Alto device, asking for evidence that the products were on the market before the August 2016 cutoff. 
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency ""will not allow the proliferation of e-cigarettes"" being sold without proper approval.
The agency also sent letters to Fontem Ventures, a unit of Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) Plc, seeking information about its myblu e-cigarettes, as well as smaller companies including Kandypens, Myle Vapor and VGOD. 
Shares of British American Tobacco on Friday were down 3.9 percent and Imperial Brands fell 6 percent in London. 
A spokesman for British American Tobacco said the company will provide to the FDA information to show it is in compliance with the rule. He said the company notified the FDA in May that the product was a ""repackaged and re-branded"" version of a product that was on the market before August 2016.
A spokesman for Imperial Brands said the myblu products are in compliance with FDA rules, adding that the company will provide the requested documentation soon. 
Representatives for the other companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
If the FDA determines the e-cigarettes were introduced after the August 2016 deadline, companies could face fines or have their products seized from store shelves. Gottlieb said the agency was concerned about sweet flavors in several of the products, which he said are “one of the principal drivers of the youth appeal of e-cigarettes.” 
POPULAR AMONG TEENS
The FDA has faced increased pressure to act as the sleek Juul e-cigarettes have surged in popularity among U.S. teenagers. Juul Labs Inc's share of the e-cigarette market rose to more than 70 percent now, up from 13.6 percent in early 2017, according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysis of Nielsen retail data that does not include online sales.
Juul sales grew from 2.2 million devices sold in 2016 to 16.2 million devices last year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many high schools have resorted to locking bathrooms – jokingly called ""Juul rooms"" by students.
The Juul design mimics a flash drive - with plug-in cartridges of concentrated nicotine juice. It is far more compact than earlier vaping devices and produces less vapor, making it easy to use without being detected - an attribute some health advocates say attracts teenagers.
Juul was on the market before the August 2016 FDA deadline, but other companies have introduced new copycat devices after the cutoff date without regulatory consequences.
Anti-smoking advocates including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids complained about the Juul lookalikes in an August letter to the FDA, saying the companies that had ""evaded the review process.""

The FDA has recently cracked down on what it calls an ""epidemic"" of youth e-cigarette use, threatening last month to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers take steps to prevent use by minors.

1024,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Banks See Consumer Loan Costs Drop Despite Rising Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- When interest rates tick higher, consumers carrying too much debt start to default. It’s the natural assumption, but Americans keep meeting their obligations.
Three of the largest U.S. banks -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). -- announced Friday that their costs for bad loans are falling. The same strong economy pushing the Federal Reserve to raise rates is helping households keep current on their growing mound of debt.
JPMorgan’s provision for bad loans was half-a-billion dollars less than analysts estimated as one measure of trouble in its consumer portfolio fell to the lowest level in more than a decade. Wells Fargo and Citigroup both cut the amounts they set aside for consumer loan losses by at least 13 percent.
“Most of the consumer credit written since the great recession has been pretty damn good, and our book is extremely good,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told journalists on a conference call. “Of course, one day there’ll be a cycle, one day credit losses will be going up.”
A year ago, many observers thought the tide already was turning as four of the largest consumer lenders boosted provisions. Analysts and investors worried that mom and pop would struggle to keep up with bills accruing higher interest, or that they would default on car loans as resale values slumped. But restraint in lending, improvement in the labor market and tax cuts held those scenarios at bay.
“It’s a combination of people being more disciplined and banks better managing their balance sheets,” said Mark Doctoroff, co-head of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.’s financial institutions group. “It’s much harder now to get a consumer loan.”
The boon in credit quality is perhaps the most direct way banks are benefiting from the latest stages of the economic recovery. Industrywide loan growth hasn’t been as strong as expected in the wake of corporate tax cuts, and higher interest rates have been a mixed bag as a flattening yield curve -- narrowing the difference between short- and long-term interest rates -- limited the boost to margins.
Some analysts still see credit costs creeping up next year.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., which jumped into the consumer space with online personal loans, recently tapped the brakes on that fast-growing business on concern that delinquencies would rise.
Cracks in Card
And to be sure, banks said that within retail businesses, they’re bracing for more defaults on credit cards.
JPMorgan’s allowance for consumer loan losses, meant to cover write-offs over coming quarters, dropped to $9.1 billion, less than half what it was six years ago. Within that, the bank increased the amount set aside for credit cards to $5.03 billion, the highest since 2012.
Citigroup’s net credit losses in its branded card business increased 5 percent to $644 million, or 2.9 percent of the portfolio. The bank has warned that metric could climb to 3.25 percent over the medium-term as new customers begin to default. Still, it’s a far cry from 2009, when the company wrote off more than 10 percent of its portfolio.
Shares of  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)., which both collect fees for handling transactions, were up more than 3 percent as of 12:40 p.m. in New York. Analysts pointed to spending levels, with KBW’s Sanjay Sakhrani telling clients in a note that volume trends from the three banks were in-line to better than expected for the card networks.
Holiday Season
The question now is whether Americans will keep shopping responsibly and paying their bills.
“The consumer has to be watched, but I think we are going to go into a very good retail season in the holidays,” with banks benefiting, Doctoroff said. “Hopefully this will correct some about the consumer being stressed.”

Veritas Investment Research analyst Stuart Rolfe initiated coverage Friday on four of Canada’s largest cannabis stocks, carrying the only sell rating on each, saying “the market still lacks perspective when it comes to the size, shape and sustainability of Canada’s proverbial pot of gold.” He initiated coverage of Aphria (price target C$19), Aurora Cannabis (C$13), Canopy Growth (C$30) and Cronos (C$4.50) giving them all sell recommendations.
Rolfe cites structural problems facing producers as the reason for his bearish view and points out uncertain pricing in the sector. “Canada’s eight largest listed firms are trading at more than 21x forward sales,” he writes, “assuming a 50 percent EBITDA margin, their multiple reaches an incredibly expensive 42x 2020 EBITDA.”
With the anticipated legalization in Canada next week, there will be steady price declines, low black market conversion rates and supply pressures, Rolfe warns. He sees the need to “crowd out a hyper-competitive black market” as a major risk. The firms are already overbuilding capacity and Rolfe predicts 2020 capacity could exceed demand by 70 percent or more.
The sell ratings are doing little to dampen market enthusiasm, however. Canopy, Cronos and Aurora all traded about 5 percent higher on Friday, while Aphria fell less than 1 percent after the CEO cautioned producers may not be immediately able to keep up with demand.

1036,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Week That Spooked Bond Markets Sent Traders Scrambling for Exits,"(Bloomberg) -- Volatility in the U.S. Treasury market appears to have forced traders out of what just a week ago appeared to be surefire wagers on higher yields and a flatter curve.
Flight-to-quality as U.S. stocks slumped pulled the 10-year note’s yield from a four-year high of 3.259 percent on Tuesday to as low as 3.124 percent on Thursday. Apparently that was enough for one trader to abandon a $2.5 million wager targeting a move to 3.60 percent by December. Placed last week, the bet took a loss of close to $1 million.
Specifically, a block trade of 18,000 put options on the 10-year futures contract, expiring in January 2019, was bought for 9 ticks on Oct. 4. Thursday, an identical-sized block was sold at 5 ticks, and CME data suggest it was liquidation -- open interest in the strike declined by 17,999.
The Treasury curve also put positions to the test, as the spread between 5- and 30-year yields briefly topped its 200-day moving average on Oct. 9 for the first time in more than a year.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) abandoned long-held (and previously profitable) flattener calls, and a derivatives trader appears to have also thrown in the towel.
Wednesday, a pair of large block trades in 2- and 10-year Treasury futures appeared consistent with a partial unwind of a flattener initiated in August after a $13 million hit. To be sure, the remaining position may yet pan out. Flattening bets still enjoy broad sponsorship, based on the outlook for Fed rate increases and subdued growth and inflation.
In the meantime, the wound-licking can commence.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","With risky bets back in play, stock selloff revives 'Volmageddon' memories","By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Months after he lost millions when an esoteric corner of financial markets cratered in February, former  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) store manager Seth Golden is betting against volatility again.
Golden, who says wagers on market calm earned him millions in the past six years, is among the investors who have kept trading complex financial products linked to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) - Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" - in the months since some of those products blew up.
""The majority of 'vol sellers' were not damaged in February. It was the Johnny-come-latelies and people who shouldn't have been trading volatility in the first place,"" Golden said.
This market is back in focus after another rapid stock market slide pushed VIX to as high as 29 from early October lows under 12, and given a gradual rebuilding of trades betting the volatility will not last.
While many investors smarted, others kept coming and between March and September, more than $1.2 billion rolled into U.S.-based exchange-traded volatility products, according to Reuters calculations based on data from FactSet Research Systems Inc, which tracks the investments.
That compares with $1.7 billion the month before the early February ""Volmaggedon"" when stocks sold-off briefly on fleeting inflation fears, the VIX shot up to 50 on Feb. 6 from 18 the day before, and some investors lost over 90 percent of their investment.
Golden, who gained prominence after the New York Times profiled him in 2017 and now runs a website that offers advice to traders, said that he had already more than recovered his February losses as he kept borrowing VIX exchange-traded products, selling them and buying them back when the price goes down. Reuters could not independently verify his accounting.
Golden said he cashed in some of his profits before the latest volatility spike and now was waiting for the market to reverse to get back in.
""These are the days I live for,"" he said during the market selloff this week. (N)
The February crash sparked a debate whether the VIX index and the related products were prone to manipulation and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by U.S. regulators.
LESS LEVERAGE
Since then, both the Cboe exchange (Z:CBOE), which owns the VIX index, and issuers of some of the related products have made changes they say should make the market less prone to violent, hard-to-anticipate swings.
The exchange has modified its auctions that determine the price of VIX futures to boost liquidity while the backers of some of the volatility products tweaked them to reduce leverage.
For example, ProShare Capital Management LLC, backers of the widely used ProShares-brand vol products, restructured one product so it would aim to move less in response to changes in the market, losing 0.5 percent, instead of 1 percent, when the index it tracks increases by 1 percent.
So far, those steps seem to have worked.
The $370 million ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:SVXY), which tumbled over 80 percent in a single day in February, sank 8.3 percent on Wednesday, lost 4.6 percent on Thursday and rebounded 3 percent on Friday morning.
Early this month,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc analysts who argued the February plunge was ""technical in nature"" wrote that a strong U.S. economy and so far limited economic impact from trade conflicts, emerging market currency declines and upcoming congressional elections should support the short-vol trade.
This week, however, they said their views have changed given an increased chance of a Federal Reserve policy misstep and investors' increased focus on the effects of a trade war between the United States and China.
""We expect volatility to remain elevated in the short term and do not recommend buying this dip,"" they wrote. 
""The difference is that this time there are some genuine catalysts we can point to,"" one of the authors, Maneesh Deshpande, told Reuters.
While investors trade VIX futures to guard against market declines and turmoil, those derivatives have a tendency to lose value in steadily rising markets as demand for such protection declines. Inverse-vol products launched and listed on exchanges after the 2007-2009 financial crisis allowed investors to take advantage of that and profit during extended spells of market calm.
(Graphic: VIX futures and ETPs - https://reut.rs/2yxZZun) 
Originally designed as a sophisticated hedging tool for professional investors to help manage their daily market exposure, inverse-volatility products became popular among small investors when the products listed on exchanges and took on a new life as a lucrative bet on market calm.
Gains of nearly 600 percent over two years up to February vaulted the products onto various lists of top performing investments and made them the subject of excited conversation on social media and financial websites.
""The pros, a lot of them were right back in there a week or two after February,"" said Russell Rhoads, head of derivatives research at TABB Group LLC.
""There's lots of people trying to pick stocks. The major hedge funds are all doing the same thing, and the volatility space has opened things up for people that are willing to do the work to find a new way to speculate on the market.""
Some analysts blamed the severity of the crash in part on excessive leverage and over-confidence of ill-prepared retail investors.
""It's more or less a substitute for going to Las Vegas - you can do it from your home office,"" said Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt University who developed VIX.
Whaley stands by VIX as a market gauge but is concerned that volatility-themed exchange-traded products pose risk to retail investors.
There is no record of how many retail investors are in the trade, but available data suggests they still play a sizeable role in the market.
Institutions required to report certain holdings, typically traders and fund managers overseeing more than $100 million, account for between 3 percent and 62 percent of U.S. volatility exchange-traded funds' assets, with the balance held by those who do not make such filings, including smaller funds and retail investors, Refinitiv data shows.
Stuart Barton, managing partner at Invest in Vol LLC, an investment adviser, which uses the products, said those investors are taking big risks again. 

""The moves by the surviving products to lower their leverage has been a good move but that's only half the story,"" he said. ""People just take twice the position.""

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>","Citigroup profit beats on higher bond trading, lower costs","By Siddharth Cavale and David Henry
(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, helped by lower expenses, higher bond trading revenue and strength in its consumer banking business in Mexico.
Operating expenses declined 1 percent, surprising analysts and indicating that the company was on the way to meeting financial targets for this year.
The company also showed an improvement in the yield from its North America Citi-branded card business, which analysts were watching closely, adding another argument for its profit outlook. 
Citigroup's shares rose 1.6 percent to $69.48. 
Investors have been waiting to see how trading revenue fared at the five big Wall Street banks, due to an escalating U.S-China trade war and executives warning that the business's growth would be muted.
Citigroup reported a 9-percent jump in bond trading revenue, outperforming bigger rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which reported a 10 percent drop in fixed-income trading revenue.
Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach had previously said Citigroup expected total fixed income and equity trading revenue to be ""flat to slightly higher"" in the third quarter.
In a conference call with reporters, Gerspach said that the expense savings showed that the company is improving its efficiency as executives had projected.
Citigroup is in the midst of a drive to save $2.8 billion in costs by 2020 as it spends $1.5 billion on technology and other productivity improvements.
Citigroup reported a 2-percent rise in global consumer banking revenue. The bank recently restructured its U.S. consumer business to operate more like those in Asia and Mexico, where it has been seeing better results.
Consumer banking revenue in Latin America rose 8 percent, excluding a one-time gain and on a constant-currency basis.
Yields from the North America branded card business turned up as more promotional credit card loans, which charge no interest for as long as 21 months, converted to interest-earning.
Gerspach said the promotional strategy was paying off as interest-earning balances grew 7 percent and net interest revenue as a percent of loans in a core portfolio rose to was 8.51 percent from 8.28 percent in the second quarter.
""That is a good indicator of the future for this business,"" Gerspach said.
Net income for the third-largest U.S. bank by assets rose to $4.62 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.13 billion a year earlier. 
Earnings per share rose to $1.73 from $1.42, helped by buybacks that reduced shares outstanding by 8 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected earnings per share of $1.69, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Total revenue was slightly lower at $18.39 billion, from $18.42 billion a year earlier. 
Citigroup's provision for income taxes fell by $395 million following changes in the U.S. tax code, which reduced the bank's tax rate to 24 percent in the quarter from 31 percent a year earlier.
The bank's return on tangible common equity was 11.3 percent in the quarter, inching closer to Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat's goal of 13.5 percent in 2020.

Up to Thursday's close, Citi shares have lost 8 percent of their value for the year, compared with a 5-percent drop in the broader KBW Bank Index.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>",JPMorgan's consumer banking strength offsets bond trading weakness,"By Sweta Singh and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as gains from higher interest rates and growth in loans helped the bank offset weakness in bond trading revenue.
The largest U.S. bank by assets, whose results are often seen as a barometer of the economy, has benefited from a tax windfall and a strong economy that has led to higher interest rates and kept loan defaults in check.
All four of JPMorgan's main businesses recorded a rise in revenue, with the consumer banking unit notching the biggest jump in revenue due to a healthy appetite for borrowing. Trading was the only weak spot in the results.
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon praised President Donald Trump's tax cuts and deregulatory efforts, but cautioned on inflation and ""geopolitical issues bursting all over the place.""
""The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy,"" Dimon said.
JPMorgan's shares rose about 1 percent in early trading. Worries about lackluster trading and weak loan growth have weighed on bank stocks this year, with the S&P Financial index falling about 5 percent and underperforming the broader S&P 500 index.
JPMorgan is the best performing stock among the big six U.S. banks. Including losses from the market carnage over the past two days that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop more than 1,300 points, the stock is the only one among the big banks to be in positive territory for the year.
The bank's average core loan book rose 6 percent in the third quarter and outperformed Citigroup's 4 percent growth even as higher rates crimped borrowing in areas such as mortgage loans.
Trading revenue fell 2.5 percent amid an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington and worries about slowing global growth.
Bond trading revenue fell 10 percent - in sharp contrast to Citigroup's 9 percent increase - while equity trading revenue was up 17 percent.
JPMorgan's total revenue rose 5.2 percent to $27.82 billion. Net income rose 24.5 percent to $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.25 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
""Everything looks nice and steady for JPMorgan,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas said. ""This portends well for the rest of the US banking industry.""
Net interest income - the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pay on deposits - rose 7 percent to $14.1 billion as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates four times since the third quarter of last year, bringing it to 2.25 percent.
JPMorgan's non-interest expenses were $15.6 billion, up 7.2 percent. Analysts had expected about $15.7 billion of expenses in the quarter.

Operating costs have risen across the industry as banks are spending more on technology and expanding their business amid a strengthening economy.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Your Money: What is the best play for your money right now?,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When the stock market has suffered a couple of really big slides in a row, like it did this week, the financial advice to those who are freaking out is always: Do not look at your account balances. But maybe, just this once, you should peek. 
The advice still stands not to change anything in your portfolio; trying to time the market is a fool's errand. What you need to look at is your cash. 
The Federal Reserve's most recent rise in interest rates and the flattening of the bond market means that there are better short-term options for your money than just a regular savings accounts. Also, a market dip is simply a good reminder that you should be looking at your accounts periodically to make sure you are sticking to the balance you want. 
You might, for instance, look at your retirement or brokerage accounts and find that you have several thousands of dollars in dividends and yields that have not automatically reinvested. You might also have cash on hand in a savings account that has built up past the level you need for a buffer or for an emergency account. 
How much cash is too much? While some financial advisers go with a percentage, like 10 percent of your net worth, Adam Grealish, director of investing for Betterment, prefers to look at it more like an equation. 
""Make sure expenses are covered, then have a buffer, then an emergency fund, and then, after that, invest for time horizons,"" he said. 
For excess cash you need to keep on hand and safe, shopping is finally good for high-yield savings accounts and CDs. 
""The sweet spot is one-year or two-year CD,"" said Greg McBride, chief economist at Bankrate.com. Top rates are around 2.65 percent currently.
Anything shorter than a year CD is not that much different than a savings account, and anything longer is not giving rewards for tying up your money longer. 
To create a laddering strategy, which pairs CDs of various durations, McBride recommended starting now with the shorter-duration CDs and then waiting until rates climb again to buy longer term. 
Jeffrey Levine, a certified financial planner in New York, also recommended keeping excess cash in 3-month Treasuries, at around 2.26 percent, which have comparable rates to a one-year CD. You can buy those through your brokerage account. 
What both Levine and McBride do not recommend right now are bonds, usually a safe harbor in a portfolio. 
""I like cash better than I like bonds right now because of rising interest rates,"" said McBride. 
BUY THE DIP
If you have cash that you do not need to keep on hand, market dips are a good time to invest in stocks. 
Cash that has accumulated in your retirement accounts is ripe for putting back in the mix, either all at once or spaced out over a period of time. 
Inside of a retirement account, target-date funds will do this for you automatically. If you pick out your own mix of investments in your retirement accounts, most custodians will have an easy button to click to do automatic reinvestments and also automatic rebalancing so cash does not build up again. 
For cash in brokerage or savings accounts, ""Now's a great time to put money to work,"" said McBride, noting that on Thursday, stocks were 7 percent cheaper than they were two days earlier.
Betterment's Grealish even recommended investing your emergency fund in a mix of stocks and bonds, because people tend not to touch that money for years.
But this runs contrary to most financial advice. 
""If you don't have adequate savings, then your cash needs to stay in cash,"" said Greg McBride, chief economist at Bankrate.com. 
As always, market dips should not cause panic. If you have a plan set up for your money, then just let it ride. 

""This is why we diversify,"" said McBride.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","PNC expects small rise in quarterly loan growth, shares fall","(Reuters) - U.S. regional bank PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) on Friday reported disappointing quarterly loan growth and said it expected only a small improvement in lending for the final three months of the year, sending its shares down 5 percent.
The company's performance comes against the backdrop of heightened expectations for business borrowings as companies take advantage of lower taxes to boost investments.
However, PNC's loan growth rose a meager 2 percent in the third quarter, slower than the 4 percent increase it generated in the second quarter. The bank's loan growth was also well below JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's 6 percent rise and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s 4 percent.
""Investors want to see the benefits of tax reform and a strong economy materialize into loan growth at the banks. In that regard, we didn't see that happen for PNC this quarter,"" Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said.
The bank said loan growth was likely to be up modestly, with increase in both its net interest income and fee income coming in low single digits.
Besides competition from bigger banks, regional lenders are also battling online lenders, asset managers and insurers for a piece of the lending business, Sanders said.
To counter the threat, the bank has been spending heavily to boost its online banking business, while trying to attract customers with reward schemes.
That drove a 6.2 percent jump in PNC's total non-interest expense, also pressured by higher employee wage bill.
A number of brokerages had previously said they were expecting roughly no change in the company's non-interest expenses.
Net interest income rose 2 percent to $2.4 billion, helped partly by higher interest rates, which allow banks to charge more on loans.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since the third quarter last year, bringing the short-term overnight funds rate to 2.25 percent.
The bank's net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, also rose.
PNC's net income rose 26 percent to $1.32 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share came in at $2.82, compared with the average analyst estimate of $2.72 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
The regional bank's shares are down 9 percent this year.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",World markets stress indicators still relatively calm,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets suffered their worst tumble this week since February's violent shakeout with some $2.6 trillion of investor wealth lost, but there was no clear trigger apart from long-brewing worries on U.S. interest rates, trade wars, China and emerging markets.
Whatever the precise cause of this week's reversal, many investors are now wondering whether the confluence of all the negative factors means a prolonged correction of some sort is now inevitable.
For different segments of the market, that's already well underway. Down 25 percent from January's peaks, emerging market equity indices are already deep in a bear market. The MSCI World index (MIWO00000PUS) has broken below a key moving average for the first time since 2016.
(Graphic: MSCI World Index breaks below 200-DMA for first time since 2016 - https://reut.rs/2yIoplh)
So what sort of stress is being registered on investors' dashboard? Surprisingly perhaps, many 'early warning' signals from the financial system are still relatively calm.
Here are 11 charts capturing some of those measures of tensions in the banking system or investor risk aversion.
1) U.S. YIELD CURVE
(Graphic: Yield curves - https://reut.rs/2OpxBFS)
The gap between 10-year and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields is seen a bellwether of recession risk and turning economic cycles. A ""flattening"" curve is often considered a portent of slowing economic activity. An outright inversion where long-term interest rates fall below short-term rates has been a reliable red flag for recession in the past.
The U.S. curve has flattened significantly over the course of this year, but has actually steepened recently as yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond hit 7-year highs.
While rising Treasury yields are cited as one cause of the equity shakeout as credit tightens and changes in the relative attractiveness of debt over equity, the steeper yield curve suggests the U.S. expansion at least has further to run than many had feared only a short time ago.
2) VIX
The benchmark measure of U.S. stock market volatility, sometimes referred to as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"". The index registered its second-biggest one-day rise this year as stocks sold off, but it remains well below levels seen in February.
Treasury bond volatility has also jumped to its highest since June, but remains far below February peaks. Currency market aggregate volatility gauges are firmer too but some distance from the early year highs.
(Graphic: VIX - https://reut.rs/2Om1JBF)
3) DOLLAR/YEN
The Japanese yen often appreciates in times of world market stress or risk aversion amid expectation of some repatriation of Japan's huge surplus savings from overseas markets. So far this year, the dollar has actually gained ground against the yen as the Fed tightened and Bank of Japan stood pat.
Even though the yen rallied during the latest selloff, it broke little new ground and merely returned to levels of a few weeks back against both the dollar and the euro.
(Graphic: Dollar/yen - https://reut.rs/2Opdd7x)
4) EURO ZONE SPREADS
The premium investors demand for holding Spanish or Italian sovereign bonds over benchmark German debt. Wider spreads indicate a greater degree of risk aversion with the euro zone and world markets.
The Italian-German spread has surged in recent months to its widest level since the 2011/2012 euro-zone debt crisis as investor took fright at the new Italian coalition government plans to boost its budget deficit. However, signs of contagion elsewhere in the euro zone, such as Spain, have been relatively limited.
(Graphic: Euro zone spreads - https://reut.rs/2yA4IvP)
5) FINANCIALS CDS
Worries over Italy as well as a currency crisis in Turkey have seen a noticeable tick-up in the prices of credit default swaps - or debt insurance - on European banks - the stocks of which have also been pressured due to their exposure to both countries' sovereign debt and domestic banking systems.
But these CDS levels remain well below the highs of early last year.
(Graphic: Financials CDS - https://reut.rs/2OlSguo)
6) GLOBAL HIGH YIELD BOND SPREADS
Merrill Lynch's global index of high-yield bonds, reflecting credit risk in the so-called ""junk"" market, a sector that will attract huge inflows of cash in good times but often one of the first sectors investors will flee from in bad. The real yield on the index has climbed steadily this year, hitting its highest since late 2016.
(Graphic: Global high yield bonds - https://reut.rs/2OlLKUt)
7) ITRAXX CROSSOVER
An index of sub-investment grade – or ""junk"" rated - European credit default swaps, effectively a measure of investors’ perception of credit risk and corporate borrowing costs.
(Graphic: iTraxx crossover - https://reut.rs/2yzDF3z)
8) INVESTOR DEMAND FOR CASH
A measure of cash holdings in U.S. retail investors’ portfolios, according to the American Association of Individual Investors monthly asset allocation surveys. High cash balances reflect investors’ preference for safety over risk. Demand has ticked up steadily in 2018, but is nowhere near levels seen during crises.
(Graphic: Investor demand for cash - https://reut.rs/2OlExnd)
9) ST. LOUIS FED FINANCIAL STRESS INDEX
The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress index https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI measures the degree of financial stress in the markets. According to the St. Louis Fed, the average value of the index since its inception in 1993 is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions.
Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress. The index rose considerably during the Feb selloff, but has since retreated.
(Graphic: St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index - https://reut.rs/2OjX6YV)
10) LIBOR/OIS
The gap between short-term U.S. interbank lending rates and overnight money market rates, reflecting perceived stress in the banking system and the corporate world.
(Graphic: LIBOR/OIS spread - https://reut.rs/2OoLW5r)
11) TED SPREAD

GDYNIA/LONDON (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, has agreed the sale of plants in the Czech Republic, Romania, Macedonia and Italy to Liberty House to satisfy regulatory requirements for its acquisition of Italian steelmaker Ilva.
The announcement by ArcelorMittal on Friday did not disclose the value of the disposals, though investment bank Jefferies said they are unlikely to achieve a book value it estimates at $1 billion.
The sales satisfy part of an agreement with the European Commission, which approved the acquisition of Ilva - Italy's largest steel plant by capacity - after ArcelorMittal pledged to sell a string of businesses across Europe to address competition concerns.
ArcelorMittal said talks were ongoing for the sale of ArcelorMittal Dudelange in Luxembourg and several finishing lines in Liege, Belgium, which were the other assets included in the agreement with the European Commission.
""Given a poor recent earnings track record, all disposal assets (including Dudelange and Liege) would be worth circa $750 million to $950 million on a peer-based EV/EBITDA basis,"" said Jefferies in a note that reiterated its 'buy' rating on the stock. 
""While there remains a wide range of expectations for disposal proceeds, this is sure to surpass the 180 million euros per annum that ArcelorMittal is paying the Italian state to acquire Ilva.""
SALZGITTER INTEREST
ArcelorMittal signed a preliminary agreement to pay 1.8 billion euros over 10 years for Ilva. It also promised to invest 1.2 billion euros to boost productivity and 1.1 billion euros to reduce pollution.
German steelmaker Salzgitter said it has submitted an offer for ArcelorMittal assets, while there is talk in the market that Russian steelmaker NLMK is also in the running. 
ArcelorMittal said the closing of the deal with Liberty House, one of the world's largest privately owned industrial groups with operations covering more than 30 countries, is subject to completion of the Ilva acquisition.
Liberty House, which has been snapping up distressed steel and aluminum assets, said the deal more than doubles its worldwide steel-rolling capacity to 15 million tonnes.
Jefferies said the sale to Liberty reduces market concerns that the ArcelorMittal furnaces would fall piecemeal into the hands of several smaller players, which could weigh on steel prices by increasing the number of competitors in the market.
""The sale to Liberty assuages fears that these assets could be acquired by potentially more disruptive Ukrainian/Russian peers, as previously rumored,"" it said.
ArcelorMittal had been due to take control of Ilva on July 1, but the deal met with resistance from Italy's new government, which questioned its validity.

In September, however, the company reached agreement with trade unions, prompting Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio to say he would no longer oppose the takeover.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>","Retirement target-date funds stung by emerging markets, U.S. bonds","By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - The largest target-date funds for U.S. investors nearing retirement are reporting their worst performance since 2008, as bets on Chinese stocks and Treasuries produced negative returns.
Target-date 2020 funds run by American Funds, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group Inc and Vanguard Group are all in the red amid this week's stock market rout. The group accounts for about three-quarters of the $164 billion invested in 2020 funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
The Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund is down 1.89 percent year to date, the biggest decline among the four. Retail 2020 funds run by T. Rowe and Vanguard each are down 1.5 percent while American's fund has fallen 1 percent.
Six percent of Fidelity's 2020 fund is invested in an emerging markets stock fund, whose value has fallen 18 percent this year. And its 5 percent stake in a long-term U.S. Treasury bond index fund is down 7.5 percent, hurt by rising rates.
Morningstar's Moderate Target Risk benchmark is down 2 percent. It has had one down year (minus 1.79 percent in 2015) since the 2008 financial crisis, when it fell 22 percent that year.
Target-date funds are popular in 401(k) plans because they do the work of allocating worker and employer retirement contributions into stocks and bonds. Funds with distant retirement dates typically allocate about 90 percent of their portfolios to stocks, with that percentage declining as retirement nears.
""The target date series is built for the unengaged investor,"" said Jacob Gerber, an investment specialist at Capital Group, the Los Angeles-based parent of American Funds.
Investors nearing retirement, he said, pay more attention to their target-date funds, concerned they could potentially run out of money before they die.
That's one reason why capital preservation is not yet the primary focus for managers running 2020 funds.
The T. Rowe Price Retirement 2020 Fund, for example, has 56 percent of its $21 billion in assets invested in domestic and international stocks, according to fund disclosures. That allocation has paid off for investors, generating a 10-year annualized return of 10.22 percent.
The Fidelity fund's annualized 10-year return of 8.7 percent lags that of its big rivals but is better than 65 percent of peers, according to Morningstar.
American Funds, meanwhile, has slashed its exposure to stocks in its 2020 portfolio to 47 percent, from 75 percent just five years ago.
Many target-date funds give their portfolio managers discretion to change pre-set allocation schedules if they see a turn in the market. The moves can amplify returns and risk.
The stock allocation in T. Rowe target date funds, for example, is about 3 percentage points below the pre-set level, said Joe Martel, a T. Rowe Price portfolio specialist. Morningstar's Moderate Target Risk benchmark allocates 60 percent to stocks.
To be sure, significant risk remains in 2020 portfolios.
""We strive to balance the need for capital appreciation in the working years with the need for capital preservation and retirement income after the target retirement date,"" Fidelity spokesman Adam Banker said.
""You can accept volatility as an accumulator,"" Gerber said. ""But it is not your friend as you approach retirement.""

The U.S. Treasury Department in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including aluminum exporter Rusal, citing ""malign activities"" by Russia.
Deripaska also held a controlling interest in EN+, which in turn controls Rusal, the world's biggest aluminum producer outside China.
However, the sanctions have been postponed several times since then as the United States considers removing Rusal from the U.S. blacklist if Deripaska drops his control over the company.
""EN+ and RUSAL have approached the U.S. Government about substantial corporate governance changes that could potentially result in significant changes in control. As the review of these proposals is ongoing, OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) is extending the expiration date of related licenses until December 12,"" Treasury said in a statement. 
The previous deadline was Nov. 12. 
Rusal and En+ on Friday declined to comment. 

Shares of Rusal extended gains in Moscow after Treasury's statement and were up 3 percent by 9:11 a.m. EDT (1311 GMT).

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Justice official says lawyer vowed 'personal attacks' over AT&T deal,"(Advisory: Note language in paragraph 5)
By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's top antitrust lawyer said Time Warner's general counsel threatened to ""employ personal attacks"" if the agency tried to block the company's $85.4 billion merger with AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), according to a court filing made public on Thursday.
The merger, which was announced in October 2016 and closed on June 14, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, the cable news station that is a frequent target of Trump's ire. The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to reverse a lower court's approval of the deal.
In the court filing, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim denied that the government's lawsuit was motivated by animus toward CNN. He also said that Trump's opposition was not a factor.
According to the filing, Delrahim said the exchange with the Time Warner general counsel, Paul Cappuccio, occurred during a Nov. 8, 2017, meeting that included the company's chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, and Time Warner board member William Barr, a former U.S. attorney general.
Delrahim said that Cappuccio stood up, ""wagged his finger at me, and said that if the Antitrust Division goes through with this, the case will be 'a sh*tshow like you've never seen,' and that it would be like 'Jimmy Hoffa and the firing of Jim Comey,'"" referring to the missing former Teamsters president and the former FBI director fired by Trump.
""I interpreted Mr. Cappuccio's comments to mean that if we brought this enforcement action, defendants would employ personal attacks to denigrate the integrity of the Antitrust Division and myself,"" he added.
Delrahim's deputy, Andrew Finch, filed an affidavit with a nearly identical recollection.
Barr filed a declaration that the Justice Department officials' recollections were ""incorrect"" and that Cappuccio did not wag his finger at Delrahim or make reference to Hoffa or Comey.
He added: ""No reasonable person could have misinterpreted Mr. Cappuccio's comments as a threat that the companies would personally attack Mr. Delrahim or anyone else in the event of litigation.""
Barr said Cappuccio was suggesting instead that the government's challenge of the deal would cause a ""public political and media frenzy"" because of Trump's animus toward CNN.
Cappuccio could not immediately be reached, but AT&T said in a statement on Thursday that ""our opinion of the government’s lawsuit is no secret"" and that the company appreciated ""Barr stepping forward to provide his first-hand account of DOJ’s interactions with us.""
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The previously secret declarations were made in February when AT&T unsuccessfully sought court approval to see any White House communications that could have shed light on whether Trump pressured the Justice Department to block the Time Warner deal.
Last month, AT&T asked a federal appeals court to reject the Justice Department's challenge, saying the government had offered no basis for second-guessing key conclusions of a ruling upholding the transaction.
On Thursday, the Justice Department said the lower court had made an ""illogical conclusion that the merger will
lead to no change in bargaining leverage"" and erroneously concluded that consumers would not be harmed.

The core of the Justice Department’s concern is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner’s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported quarterly profit and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations. Citigroup (NYSE:C) also beat profit forecasts, but its revenue was a tad below expectations. And  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) missed on earnings estimates, but its revenue topped the consensus estimate.
Bank stocks have been unimpressive over the last three months. The shares looked to be on a comeback as bond yields rose, helping net interest margins, but the bullishness was short-lived as financials joined the broader recent selloff.
JPMorgan Chase
JPMorgan said it earned $2.34 cents per share in the third quarter. On average, analysts predicted that JP Morgan would earn $2.27 per share.
Shares of the Dow component were up about 1.8% in premarket trading, compared with a gain of about 2.5% before the results were released.
The bank posted managed revenue of $27.8 billion, which was above forecasts. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $27.58 billion.
Services revenue gained thanks to higher interest rates, which helped counter flat investment banking revenue. The company also benefitted from lower taxes, noting its effective tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, compared to 29.6% in the year-ago period.
Citigroup
Citi reported earnings per share of $1.73 on revenue of $18.39 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected a profit of $1.67 a shares on revenue of $18.45 billion.
The stock dipped immediately in premarket trading after the numbers came out, but recovered strongly, climbing around 3%.
With revenue basically flat from the year-ago period, Citi's profit beat was driven by a lower tax rate. Its effective tax rate fell to 24% in the third quarter from 31% in the same quarter a year ago.
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo reported earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $21.94 billion. The Street was looking for EPS of $1.19 on revenue of $21.82 billion.
That compared to EPS of $1.04 on revenue of $24.51 billion in the same period a year earlier. The rise in profit in the year-ago period was evidence that the company had made some progress in its efforts to cut costs, although a drop in total loans offset some of those gains.
The bank, which has been hit by scandal recently, also noted it is making progress in its commercial banking segment and in ""customer remediation.""

After Asian shares rose overnight, European stocks opened higher, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) up 0.7 percent. (EU)
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up half a percent while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) gained 0.7 percent.
S&P stock futures pointed to a rebound in U.S. stocks later in the day (ESc1) (N), while the VIX volatility index (VIX) climbed down from an eight-month high. 
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up half a percent on the day.
""Some traders are cautiously buying back into the market today, but the underlying issues which brought about the sell-off are still relevant,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.
The biggest market shakeout since February has been blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the impact of a U.S.-China trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings season.
(Graphic: Latest selloff among 2018 outliers - https://reut.rs/2OlBtHS)
Trade figures from China on Friday showed China's trade surplus with the United States hit a record high in September, providing a likely source of contention with U.S. President Donald Trump over trade policies and the currency.
The data showed solid expansion in China's overall imports and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States.
That added to bullish sentiment on Friday, CMC's Madden said, noting the decision by U.S. Treasury staff to refrain from labeling China a currency manipulator as a positive for stocks.
Shanghai shares bounced 0.9 percent (SSEC), recouping early-session losses of 1.8 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 2.06 percent, the biggest one-day gain for more than two years.
The bounce came after the index fell 3.6 percent on Thursday to hit a 1-1/2-year low, and it is still on track for a weekly loss of 3.6 percent.
Japan's Nikkei average (N225) rose half a percent.
So far this week, Chinese and U.S. shares are among the biggest losers, a sign investor worries about the trade war are growing.
MSCI's U.S. index (MIUS00000PUS) has shed 5.5 percent, compared with a 4.9 percent fall for MSCI's gauge of stock performance in 47 countries (MIWD00000PUS). China A shares <.MIXNAPUS> are still down 8.7 percent.
""We're still left with the sense that there has been a significant shift that markets now have to take stock of,"" Daiwa Capital Markets head of economic research Chris Scicluna said.
Gold , which had risen to a 10-week high on the back of the sell-off, fell half a percent on Friday to $1.217.31 an ounce. 
The yield on 10-year U.S. notes edged up in Europe to 3.170 percent (US10YT=RR), reversing early-session falls on flight-to-quality bids.
It is off its seven-year Tuesday high of 3.261 percent but a further rise in U.S. borrowing costs might hurt risk sentiment.
Online broker XM investment broker Marios Hadjikyriacos said the pullback in yields was a major comfort factor for investors.
""This can be seen as a self-correcting mechanism, where stocks begin to sell off as bond yields rise, leading investors to shift back to bonds amid the risk-averse environment, hence driving yields back down and calming the stock market,"" he said.
Adding to the confusion for investors, Trump launched a second day of criticism of the Federal Reserve on Thursday, calling its interest rate increases a ""ridiculous"" policy.

The bank has spent the past ten years trying to return to its roots as a prudent lender following its near-collapse during the financial crisis, a process that has involved hefty restructuring costs and years of losses. 
The bank's CEO Ross McEwan said the dividend was a small return for many years of patience from its shareholders, which still include the UK government after it bailed the bank out with 45.5 billion pounds at the peak of the crisis. 
""This is another important milestone in our turnaround, almost ten years to the day that RBS was rescued by the British taxpayer,"" he said in a statement. 
UK Government Investments, which manages Britain's remaining 62 percent stake in RBS, will receive around 240 million pounds from the payout, which was announced at the bank's half-year results. 
The government resumed sales of its shares in the bank earlier this year, after RBS settled an investigation by U.S. authorities into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run up to the crisis for $4.9 billion. 
Even after this payment, the bank has a healthy level of excess capital which it plans to return to investors, including possibly via a special dividend or share buy back.

(Reuters) - Sandy Hetrick drove 15 miles from her home to a Sears in Media, Pennsylvania on Wednesday to buy folding chairs and clothes. 
Her local Sears in Wilmington, Delaware, the 54-year-old retiree said, was so poorly stocked that she stopped going there, even though there is no Delaware state sales tax.
""It's really going down,"" Hetrick said about Sears, which is weighing whether to file for bankruptcy protection in the coming days. 
""You can't find any help. The stores have minimal items,"" she said as she shopped at the store in Media. 
A change in sentiment among previously loyal shoppers like Hetrick contributed to the retailer's sharp decline in sales. Sears losses have continued to mount to over $11 billion from its last annual profit in 2011. 
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2A3giRQ
On Thursday, Reuters reported Sears CEO Eddie Lampert is exploring a bid for some of the retailer's businesses and real estate once it files for bankruptcy.
Sears did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In September, the retailer said it is cutting down on lower-performing products and becoming more aggressive in clearing out seasonal merchandise. It also expanded the assortment on its online marketplace, which allowed it to add more popular brands. 
Sears also said it continues to take steps to improve its in-store experience for shoppers, without offering details. 
It has made attempts to sell its products like tires and Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) website to offset the decline in traditional shoppers by acquiring new customers online. 
Even so, its annual sales have dropped nearly 60 percent to $16.7 billion.
The retailer's problems, according to shoppers, former employees and vendors interviewed by Reuters, range from its limited assortment of merchandise to poor customer service. In addition, some said, the retailer abandoned basic shop-keeping standards such as clean stores. And Lampert's leadership over the years to save the chain hurt it more than helped. 
The retailer, which for decades was considered the Amazon.com of its time, branched into industries as diverse as insurance, real estate and even broadcasting. A sign of its corporate power was the 110-story building called the Sears Tower, once its corporate headquarters in Chicago and the world's tallest building for a period of time.
Hetrick shopped at Sears since she was a child, and said she recalls looking forward to its Christmas catalogs. But nostalgia for the Sears hallmarks, from the catalog to Craftsman tools, has not helped the 125-year-old department store bring customers through its doors in recent years. 
The retailer lost its allure with shoppers after shrinking its total store locations by over 70 percent in less than a decade. Sears runs nearly 900 stores, including the Kmart chain. As of February 2018, the retailer said it employed about 89,000 workers in the United States compared to the same period five years ago, when it employed 246,000 people.
Over that time, the number of consumers open to shopping at Sears dropped to 14 percent on June 1, 2018 from 28 percent on June 1, 2013, according to data from YouGov BrandIndex, a company that tracks public perception of brands. 
Only 9 percent of U.S. millennials - aged between 22 to 37 years in 2018 - said they would consider buying goods from the retailer, it said.
KMART EFFECT
Some former employees said the retailer started going downhill in 2005 when it merged with Kmart, a deal engineered by Lampert. In 2004, when the retailer announced the merger, it was the third-largest in revenue behind Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT). 
Customers used to be able to check out in any department in the store, and there was always someone to ask for assistance, said Judy Davis, 81 of Banning California, who retired from Sears in 1999 after working at the Cerritos, California, store for 27 years. But after the Kmart merger, the checkouts were placed in one corner near the store exit, and cashiers could not leave their registers, she said. 
""They really used to promote customer service. That went out the window,"" Davis said. 
At the Pennsylvania store John Fullerton, a 60 year-old truck driver who visits Sears to buy clothes, tools and appliances, could not find a salesperson to check him out. 
""There's no traffic coming through here,"" he said referring to the store's empty aisles.
Lampert's lack of experience in the retail business was the biggest reason Sears' fortunes took a turn for the worse, said Chad Brand, president of Peridot Capital Management, which holds Sears bonds. 
""What I think he missed was realizing that when your competitors are investing that capital and you are not, you are going to lose customers to your competition,"" he said. 
Lampert and his spokespeople were not available for comment.
Ray Wimer, assistant professor of retail practice at Syracuse University's Martin J. Whitman School of Management, said the story of Sears over the past year has been about trying to rework the $134 million debt payment coming due. But the bigger issue is how bad merchandising hurt performance, he said. 
""Look at J.C. Penney (that has some similar financial issues) - launching a new brand Peyton & Parker on Oct. 19. I can't remember the last time Sears launched a new brand to excite the customers to shop,"" Wimer said. 
The inability to hold onto customers is also tied to Sears' inability to keep its shelves stocked. Reuters reported a year ago how many vendors started pulling back shipments and began demanding stricter payment terms.
Brett Rose, CEO of United National Consumer Suppliers, a wholesale distributor of overstocked goods such as garden tools, beauty products and toys, stopped shipping to Sears and Kmart about three months ago. 
""If you can't go into Sears and buy Levi's or Dungarees that used to be there, why are mom and dad still going there,"" Rose said, highlighting that its store shelves are occasionally empty. ""If they don't have the products their core customers need, they lose them."" 
A spokeswoman for Levi Strauss & Co, which owns Levi's, said it still supplies to Sears. VF Corp (N:VFC), which owns Lee Dungarees, did not respond to requests for comment.
Dennis Gansemer, 77, who worked at the Dubuque, Iowa, store for 27 years before retiring, said it was a good company ""until they had people running it that didn't know what they were doing."" 

""How do you go from being number one to being 'Who?',"" Gansemer said.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Door opens for UBS to take majority ownership of China JV,"By Alun John and Shu Zhang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) may have moved a step closer towards becoming the first foreign bank to hold majority ownership of its Chinese investment banking operations, after two of its joint venture partners said they had put their stakes up for sale.
UBS would own 51 percent of its joint venture, UBS Securities, if it purchases the holdings. That would make it the first global investment bank to secure majority ownership since a surprise decision by China late last year to open the sector to foreign control.
A UBS spokesman declined to comment.
Agribusiness conglomerate COFCO Group said in a statement to the China Beijing Equity Exchange on Thursday that it would sell its 14 percent stake in UBS Securities for at least 461.72 million yuan ($66.77 million).
The state-run exchange handles deals in unlisted company stakes.
In a separate statement, investment manager China Guodian Capital said it would sell a 12.01 percent stake in the joint venture for at least 396.09 million yuan ($57.30 million).
The filings said that the two stakes should be purchased together. Neither filing disclosed a buyer.
UBS currently owns 24.99 percent of UBS Securities, according to the joint venture's website, but in May it applied to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to raise its stake to 51 percent.
""One of the challenges for the foreign investment banks is negotiating with their joint venture partners over the purchasing of their stakes,"" said Ben Quinlan, chief executive of consultancy Quinlan & Associates.
Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and Japan's Nomura Holdings (T:8604), have applied to the CSRC to take majority control positions.
But, unlike UBS, neither currently has a mainland joint venture and would need to start any such operation from scratch.
The CSRC has not announced any decision about UBS' application, nor those of the other banks. The regulator did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment about the UBS application.
UBS, unusually for a foreign investment bank, already has effective management control over UBS Securities but it and other banks have long been keen to also hold voting control.
Foreign firms have struggled to gain market share of China's potentially lucrative securities market, in part because of their lack of control of their operations and because of the difficulty of integrating their mainland ventures with their global operations.

Last year, HSBC launched its own 51 percent-owned joint venture, but did so under rules allowing Hong Kong-based companies special access. ($1=6.91 yuan)

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 05:13AM ET</span>",Explainer: What are risk-parity funds?,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The market's quick and hard-to-explain declines this week led some investors to point fingers at number-crunching fund strategies designed to control and balance risk.
The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index (SPX) marked its biggest one-day fall since February on Wednesday and added to losses the day after.
The order of events, rising bond yields followed by a stock market selloff, recalled a similar event in February and also placed the focus on mechanical investment strategies sensitive to volatility, including risk-parity funds.
WHAT ARE RISK-PARITY FUNDS?
Risk-parity funds refer to a set of rule-based investment strategies that combine stocks, bonds and other financial assets. They are a counterweight to traditional portfolio investment strategies where investors are split between equities and bonds but equities end up carrying more of the risk. 
In most multi-asset portfolios, equities tend to determine an investors' return because their price moves up and down more than other assets. 
The goal of risk parity is to build a ""diversified"" portfolio in which each group of assets contributes an equal amount of risk so that the return is not primarily determined by stocks. The formula is based on historical research on how each asset performs and relates to the other groups over time.
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?
The strategy came into being in the 1990s but drew increased attention after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis refocused investor attention on risks in the stock market, and on hedge fund strategies to minimize those risks.
WHY DO THEY MATTER?
Risk-parity strategies are a poster boy for a whole set of investment strategies that are sensitivity to volatility and have a potential to trade after major moves in the market. Yet backers of such funds say they often trade against the trend in the market.
WHO ARE THE BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE MARKET?
The strategy is most associated with Bridgewater Associates LP, the world's largest hedge fund, which launched its risk-parity All Weather Fund in 1996. Bridgewater's founder, Ray Dalio, and the company are well known for a unique culture of ""radical truth and radical transparency"" whereby intellectual conflict is encouraged to promote a meritocracy of ideas, avoiding traditional office politics. Other major investors in the space include AQR Capital Management LLC, whose founder Cliff Asness is also a well-known investor.
WHAT ARE THE ASSETS IN RISK-PARITY STRATEGIES?
Estimates vary, but AQR put the figure at $70 billion in equity assets in February. A 2017 paper by LongTail Alpha LLC chief investment officer Vineer Bhansali and USC Marshall School of Business professor Lawrence Harris estimated that total assets under management in a set of strategies that respond to risk inputs is about $1.5 trillion, including risk-parity funds, and a variety of other strategies, including volatility targeting funds, and trend followers.
HOW ARE RISK PARITY FUNDS HOLDING UP?
Mutual funds using a risk parity strategy reported narrower losses than the S&P 500's 3.0 percent tumble on Wednesday, but the losses nonetheless compounded their negative returns for the year. Low-cost shares of the AQR Risk Parity Fund declined 1.7 percent on Wednesday and are down 4.2 percent this year. Yao Hua Ooi, a principal the global asset allocation team at AQR, said certain commodities and other exposures held by the fund have helped offset losses from U.S. Treasuries and global stock markets.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 04:38AM ET</span>",Tesla says orders placed by Oct 15 eligible for full tax credit,"(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said orders for cars placed by Oct. 15 will be eligible for a full federal tax credit of $7,500 and these customers will get their cars delivered by the end of the year.
Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year, incentives in the way of tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.
In July, Tesla said it delivered 200,000 electric cars to buyers in the United States, meaning tax credits will now begin to be lowered while rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG and Audi AG will bring electric models to the market with a full tax credit in place.
Buyers of electric cars get full tax credit for the quarter in which the company hits the 200,000 delivery mark and the next, according to Internal Revenue Service regulation This means Tesla has until the end of the year to hand out full tax credits, which could invite a further rush of orders and hit the company's already strained production and delivery chain. Tesla has scrambled to deliver the Model 3 - a mass-market sedan that it hopes is the key to success - and many customers have been waiting since early 2016. Vehicles have piled up in lots around California awaiting transport, and Musk said last month that Tesla had moved from ""production hell to delivery logistics hell."" Friday's news confirms that many customers may still have to wait three months or more. Musk said earlier this month that a surge in third-quarter production had driven it to the verge of profitability. The declining tax credit is likely to put Tesla at a disadvantage as rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG and Audi AG bring electric models to the market with a full tax credit in place. It also adds to what's been a bad month for Tesla, which has seen increased investor calls for stronger oversight of Musk, whose recent erratic public behavior raised concerns about his ability to steer the money-losing company through a rocky phase of growth. The company recently settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a lawsuit that had threatened to force him out. Electrek, which earlier reported on the deadline on new orders, described the company's latest move as an attempt to boost sales.  
However, the incentives could go if a new bill, introduced by a Republican senator to end the federal tax credit for electric cars altogether, is passed, Electrek reported.

1094,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Risks Central Bank Can't Ignore in India's Low Inflation Spell,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s headline inflation data may be subdued for now, but there are mounting risks that are difficult to ignore: a record-low currency, high oil prices, and a looming election that’s prompting the government to raise food prices to placate farmers.
Data due Friday evening will probably show consumer prices rose 4 percent in September, according to the median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That pace is faster than the previous month’s, but bang on the target set by the Reserve Bank of India.
Inflation within target and signs that demand may be cooling in the world’s fastest-growing major economy prompted the central bank to keep interest rates on hold last week, and lower the forecast for gains in consumer prices. The RBI expects inflation in the range of 3.9 percent to 4.5 percent in the second half of the fiscal year to March 2019, down from 4.8 percent projected earlier.
While headline inflation has eased in recent months, the core measure, which strips out volatile fuel, food and electricity prices, has been sticky at around 6 percent.
“We expect core inflation to stay sticky at 5.87 percent due to the steady build up of demand-pull price pressures,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with L&T Finance Holdings Ltd. in Mumbai. “Moreover, sustained spikes in Brent crude prices and massive rupee depreciation have clouded the outlook for inflation despite a favorable statistical base.”
That’s reflected in the Monetary Policy Committee’s change in policy stance to “calibrated tightening” from neutral, signaling it’s not done with rate hikes yet. It said that while low food inflation provided comfort, surging oil and volatile financial markets could lead to higher price pressures.
India, which imports more than 80 percent of its oil needs, is vulnerable to increasing crude prices. Together with the rupee, Asia’s worst-performing major currency this year, this worsens the outlook for inflation and the current-account gap. Besides, the government’s move to raise support prices for farm produce will add to the inflationary pressures.
According to the central bank, a 20 percent increase in the price of the Indian basket of crude to $96 a barrel would dent growth by 30 basis points and stoke inflation by 40 basis points. The price of Brent crude, the benchmark for half the world’s oil, is hovering above $80 per barrel as impending American sanctions squeeze Iranian exports and an economic crisis in Venezuela disrupts supplies.
“We do not think that the RBI’s rate-hike cycle has come to an end,” said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd. “Yet, with the real policy rate at 250-300 basis points, headroom for the RBI to carry out rate hikes is limited unless inflation crosses 5 percent consistently.”

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 10:46PM ET</span>",Australia's ANZ fired 200 staff due to bad banking behavior: CEO,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) fired over 200 staff for wrongdoing, including senior executives, due in part to issues raised at a public inquiry into financial sector misconduct, ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliott said on Friday.
In his first public comments addressing criticism stemming from the quasi-judicial inquiry, Elliott said the country's third-biggest bank would take a tougher approach to punishing bad conduct.
""We should dismiss people when they are grossly negligent or when they do things that are clearly bad and cause customer harm,"" Elliott told parliament's House Economics Committee. 
""My commitment is to make sure that I do hold people to account.""
In the past year, about 10 senior ANZ executives had been dismissed for issues related to misconduct, Elliott said. 
The comments reflect the pressure Australia's highly profitable major banks are under to improve their governance and public image since the inquiry, called a Royal Commission, exposed widespread misconduct across the financial sector.
The heads of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) were also apologetic before the committee on Thursday, in contrast to the industry's defiant tone before the inquiry began in February.
ANZ said on Monday it would take a A$711 million ($506.59 million) hit to profit due to higher costs including compensation for customers stung by poor bank practices. The bank's full-year results are due Oct. 31.
Other banks and wealth managers are setting aside cash to restructure their businesses, defend lawsuits and compensate customers, while bracing for tougher regulation and tighter profit margins.
The year-long Royal Commission has received over 9,000 submissions by aggrieved customers and scrutinized a handful of specific cases that have shocked the country.
In almost 60 public hearings, the inquiry has exposed systemic problems in incentive arrangements used to reward staff for selling products to people who did not need them or could not afford them. All four major banks also charged customers for services-not-rendered and some took fees out of dead client accounts.

Elliott said he had ordered a review of how ANZ had treated a number of customers mentioned at the inquiry.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 08:18PM ET</span>",Machines take the blame as U.S. stock market sells off,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors searching for perpetrators and victims in this week's U.S. stock market selloff pointed to a familiar source: number-crunching fund managers and machines.
The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index (SPX) marked its biggest one-day fall since February and added to those losses on Thursday. 
The carnage followed a debt market selloff this month driven by expectations that U.S. inflation will be strong enough to warrant further rises in interest rates the Federal Reserve, but not all investors think the selling made sense.
""Warren Buffett made his fortune by buying low and selling high,"" said the billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman, founder of Omega Advisors Inc. ""Machines buy strength and sell weakness and aggravate the moves. There was no reason for that kind of a move yesterday.""
The order of events, rising bond yields followed by a stock market selloff, recalled a similar event in February and also put focus on a host of mechanical investment strategies from risk-parity funds to commodity trading advisers (CTAs) and trend followers. 
A 2017 paper by LongTail Alpha LLC chief investment officer Vineer Bhansali and USC Marshall School of Business professor Lawrence Harris estimated that total assets under management in a set of strategies that respond to risk is about $1.5 trillion, including risk-parity funds, volatility targeting funds, and trend followers.
""When there's $1 trillion in mitigating the downside, there's a good argument to be made that it actually creates more downside because now they're all selling at the same time,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. 
""When everyone does it, they create the problem they're trying to avoid.""
Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co, said the market action suggests rules-based, volatility-contingent investment strategies adjusted to the sharp selloff in long-term Treasuries.
""When massive elephants move stuff around it can drive a lot of violence,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean equities are broken but it means in the medium term they get spicy.""
A strategy popularized after the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis, ""risk parity"" often sees itself blamed when stocks see steep selloffs. Risk parity funds themselves, however, said they were not to blame.
Bob Prince, the co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater, said the world's largest hedge fund's All Weather strategy, which launched the risk-parity movement in 1996, does not actively trade and, while it does periodically adjust, has not done so since the market selloff began. 
When those adjustments happen, they are generally restoring the fund to its original balance, buying those assets that have gone down and trading against the trend.
""Risk parity didn't have anything to do with yesterday's market movement,"" said Prince. ""We're getting closer to the point that earnings growth could disappoint. As people get an inkling of that, probably the smart money's getting out first.""
The strategy is an attempt to balance risk or volatility in asset prices across equity, debt and other assets, instead of a more traditional approach based on allocating capital across asset classes.
Investors often combine multiple assets within a portfolio but, risk parity backers argue, they do so in a way that still exposes them to too much equity risk and with too little a reward for doing so.
U.S.-based mutual funds using a risk parity strategy reported narrower losses than the S&P 500 index's 3.0 percent tumble on Wednesday, but the declines nonetheless compounded their negative returns for the year. 
Bridgewater's All Weather Fund is down 0.6 percent this year, through September 30, the most recent data available, according to a person familiar with the fund but not authorized to discuss the performance publicly.
Risk parity funds often take a ""leveraged"" position in assets other than stocks, including bonds, borrowing money to increase the return, and they benefit from the fact that stock and bond prices often move in opposite directions. Now they, and all, investors face the prospect of declines in prices across many assets at the same time.
Yao Hua Ooi, a principal on the global asset allocation team at AQR Capital Management LLC, said losses in U.S. Treasuries and stocks have been partially offset by gains in commodities and other positions the fund holds, and that they do not expect a significant adjustment given the changing risk in the market.
""The response to these changes are more gradual in nature,"" he said. ""They do not typically result in a knee-jerk reaction.""

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:28PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears CEO Lampert explores bidding for assets in bankruptcy - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp Chief Executive Officer Eddie Lampert is exploring a bid for some of the cash-strapped U.S. retailer's businesses and real estate once it files for bankruptcy, an alternative to a traditional court-supervised reorganization, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Under this scenario, the 125-year-old department store operator, once the world's largest retailer, would initially avoid an outright liquidation, but would have to navigate the bankruptcy process without some of its key assets. At stake is the future of roughly 90,000 employees and 900 stores, including Kmart, which Sears also operates. 
Lampert, a billionaire who is also Sears' biggest shareholder and lender, is considering bidding for its Kenmore appliances brand and its home services business, in addition to some real estate, the sources said. 
Sears is also weighing a traditional bankruptcy reorganization, and no final decisions have been made, the sources added.
Lampert had already offered as much as $480 million for the Kenmore and home improvement unit of the home services businesses as part of an out-of-court rescue plan, and is mulling trying to buy these assets and more through bankruptcy auctions under this option, the sources said. The auctions would be executed under Section 363 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. 
The exact assets that Lampert might buy in bankruptcy remained in flux, the sources said. 
Lampert could help finance his bids for the assets by forgiving some of the money Sears owes him, as opposed to putting in more cash, one of the sources said. 
Sears is still negotiating potential financing to keep it afloat while under bankruptcy protection after discussions with banks on Wednesday night failed to result in an agreement, the sources said. 
Another meeting with potential financing sources was planned for Thursday, the sources added.
The sources declined to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A Lampert spokesman declined to comment while a Sears spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""There are assets he can buy that are underpriced,"" said Carlos Castelan of retail consulting firm The Navio Group. ""If his hedge fund is at the top of the list from a creditor perspective, (he) should be able to have first rights on the business.""
Sears shares ended trading on Thursday down 30 percent at 34 cents, giving the company a market capitalization of just $37 million. Sears' borrowings totaled $5 billion as of Aug. 4.
Sears faces a key $134 million debt payment on Monday that Lampert has refused to fund from his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc unless a special committee formed by the Sears board of directors accepts his rescue plan.
The committee has declined to do so amid concerns over a backlash from other Sears creditors and shareholders, leaving bankruptcy as the company's only option.
Sears has started to miss payments to vendors, adding to concerns about its future, Reuters reported.
FALLING SALES
At its peak in the 1960s, Sears sold everything from toys to auto parts to mail-order homes, and was a key tenant in almost every big mall across the United States.
But it has struggled to reinvent itself in the face of online competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer has posted seven straight years of losses and its sales have not grown since the 2008 financial crisis.
Lampert has invested and lent to Sears many times over the years, giving him an equity stake just shy of 50 percent. The retailer also owes about $2.5 billion to Lampert or funds he controls.

In an earlier attempt to avoid bankruptcy, Sears last year sold its Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) for $900 million. It also signed a deal to sell Kenmore appliances on e-commerce site Amazon.com.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Abbvie settles Humira patent disputes with Novartis unit,"(Reuters) - Abbvie Inc said on Thursday it settled all patent disputes with Novartis AG, granting it a non-exclusive license to manufacture and sell a copycat version of blockbuster drug, Humira.
Abbvie, however, did not disclose details regarding the royalties it will receive from Novartis generics unit, Sandoz, as part of the agreement.
Shares of Abbvie rose 2.39 percent to $92.87 in after-market trading. 
The license period will begin on Sept. 30, 2023 in the United States and on Oct. 16 in most countries in the European Union, Abbvie said in a statement.
Sandoz received marketing approval for its Humira biosimilar from the European Commission in July and had submitted its application to the U.S. health regulator early this year.
Last year, Abbvie reached a settlement with  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), delaying Amgen's cheaper biosimilar version of Humira until Jan. 31, 2023.
Humira is the world's best-selling prescription medicine and has long buoyed AbbVie's business, raking in $5.19 billion in second-quarter sales.

But as cheaper biosimilar versions come closer to entering the market, the company has been trying to grow sales from its other medicines, including cancer treatment Imbruvica.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 05:45PM ET</span>",U.S. tightens controls on China imports of nuclear components,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
(Reuters) - The United States is tightening controls on China's imports of civil nuclear technology to prevent use for military or other unauthorized purposes, the U.S. Department of Energy said on Thursday amid increased trade tensions.
Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly $200 billion of Chinese imports and then threatened more levies if China retaliated. China then hit back with tariffs on about $60 billion of U.S. imports.
Washington announced the nuclear technology controls a day after the U.S. Justice Department said it had arrested and indicted a spy for China's Ministry of State Security on charges of economic espionage. Chinese operative Xu Yanjun also attempted to steal trade secrets from U.S. aviation and aerospace companies, the department said. China rejected the allegations.
""The United States cannot ignore the national security implications of China’s efforts to obtain nuclear technology outside of established processes of U.S.-China civil nuclear cooperation,"" U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said in a statement.  
Beginning last year, the National Security Council led a review of China's efforts to obtain nuclear material, equipment and advanced technology from U.S. companies, government officials said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday. The review was prompted by China’s accelerated efforts to acquire U.S. intellectual property to the detriment of U.S. businesses and military interests, they said.
The officials said the indictment in 2016 of a Chinese-American nuclear engineer, Allen Ho, was one of the factors that led to the review.
Ho, a naturalized U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to produce ""special nuclear material"" in China in violation of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act. The state-owned China General Nuclear Power Company (CGNPC) was also charged.
The new policy goes into immediate effect, and sets guidelines for reviewing all existing and future technology transfers into China, the officials said. The vast majority of existing technology transfers approved before Jan. 1, 2018 are unlikely to be altered, the officials said.
There will be a presumption of denial to new license applications or extensions to existing authorizations related to the CGNPC, the energy department said. Officials declined to comment on whether China is already using this technology. 
The development of nuclear technology to power small reactors in the South China Sea and for submarines and icebreakers are of concern, officials said. They also expressed concern about use of the technology in weapons.
The government is also concerned about diversion for use of technology by other countries, one of the officials said. They declined to comment on the specifics of these concerns.

U.S. nuclear exports to China amounted to $170 million in 2017, the officials said.

1. Big Bank Earnings Highlight Pre-market
Earnings season picks up tomorrow as three big-name banks report. And with the volatile market desperate for some positive news, there’s a lot riding on the numbers.
Dow component JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is on the docket, expected to earn $2.27 per share on revenue of more than $27 billion.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) will also report. On average, analysts predict a profit of $1.67 a share on revenue of around $18.5 billion.
And  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) is expected to come in with earnings of $1.19 per share, with revenue of about $22 billion.
Investors will be focusing on possible weak spots in the results, which include slowing loan growth and pressure on net interest margins.
Citi and J.P. Morgan stocks are slightly down in the last three months, while Wells Fargo is off more than 8%.
2. Import/Export Prices and Michigan Sentiment Arrive
Economic indicators keep coming tomorrow.
The latest numbers on import and export prices arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with economists predicting a 0.2% September increase for both.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of October consumer sentiment.
On average, economists are predicting a slight rise to 100.4.
Also at the University of Michigan you’ll find Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who is speaking at 9:30 AM ET. Evans will give a speech at the ENGAGE Undergraduate Investment Conference.
And Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will be talking at 11:30 AM ET, participating in an armchair chat on recruitment and economics at the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs and Administration Conference in Atlanta.
3. Gold Finally Shines
The deep selling on Wall Street has finally piqued some interest in gold as a hedge.
Gold jumped nearly 3% today, its biggest one-day gain in more than two years, as the safe haven looked more attractive. A weaker dollar on the tame CPI number also helped.
The yellow metal settled above $1,200 an ounce today, a key level of late.
A steady rise in gold in the next few trading session could mean even less buying interest for equities.
“The next potential resistance is $1,238,” Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at forex.com, said."
1104,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 05:02PM ET</span>",Wall St. extends slide with trade and rates in focus,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street indexes continued their slide in Thursday's volatile session as investors worried about rising interest rates and braced for a trade war hit to corporate earnings a day ahead of the quarterly reporting season kickoff. 
In its sixth consecutive day of declines, the S&P closed down 2.1 percent after shedding 3 percent in Wednesday's session. But at its session low the benchmark fell 2.7 percent to its lowest level since early July. 
The Nasdaq narrowly avoided confirming a correction. During the session it fell as much as 10.3 percent from its Aug. 29 closing record high but ended the day 9.6 percent below the record. 
Investors worried that equity markets would have trouble recovering as rising interest rates coincide with uncertainty about how much earnings growth would be hurt by a U.S. trade war with China. 
""People fear that it will be harder to snap back if we’re seeing a cyclical top in earnings with those two headwinds, which are not going away,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 545.91 points, or 2.13 percent, to 25,052.83, the S&P 500 lost 57.31 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,728.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 92.99 points, or 1.25 percent, to 7,329.06.
After hitting an intraday high of 28.84, the CBOE Volatility Index, popularly known as the ""fear gauge,"" ended the day up 2 points at 24.98, its highest close since Feb. 12.
""We saw a rally this morning, and that ended up being a suckers' rally. Then you had buy-the-dippers coming in here saying this was too much too fast,"" said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading Llc In Las Vegas.
""Are we out of the woods here? I don't think so,"" he said. ""You're going to see a lot of volatility in the next week or so.""
The energy sector, pressured by a drop in oil prices, was the lead decliner, while insurers were some of the biggest losers in the financial sector a day after powerful Hurricane Michael slammed into Florida.
The S&P's 11 major sectors all ended the day in the red with only the communications services sector managing a decline of less than 1 percent. 
Energy was the biggest loser with a 3.1 percent drop as oil prices hit two-week lows after an industry report showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories.[O/R]
The financial sector fell 2.9 percent, also hurt by a 2.7 percent drop in bank stocks a day before three of the biggest banks were to report quarterly results. 
Wall Street expects S&P 500 companies to report third-quarter earnings growth of 21.3 percent for the third quarter according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
The technology sector, the biggest loser in Wednesday's sell-off, closed down 1.3 percent on Thursday.
Stocks had seen some support earlier in the session from U.S. data showing a smaller-than-anticipated rise in consumer prices as it helped ease fears of increasing inflation pressures. 
The data helped push U.S. Treasury yields to a one-week low, further soothing equity investors.
But investors still faced a sea of worries, including uncertainty ahead of U.S. midterm congressional elections on Nov. 6, and hawkish comments last week from U.S. Federal Reserve officials. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 62 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 6 new highs and 291 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.44 billion shares, its highest level since Feb. and compared with the 7.65 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. safety agency OKs advanced headlights for road use,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Thursday said it was moving to allow advanced headlights known as ""adaptive driving beams"" to be used in vehicles on U.S. roads that could help prevent nighttime crashes.
The agency said it was acting in response to a petition filed by Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) in 2013 to allow the lights, which provide more illumination than existing lights without a glare to oncoming motorists by using additional sensors to automatically adjust lights. 
NHTSA said the lights offer ""potentially significant safety benefits in avoiding collisions with pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and roadside objects.""
The headlights have been permitted in Europe for more than a decade and are also allowed in Japan and other countries.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) also petitioned the agency in 2016 to allow the lights on its Audi A7 luxury cars, while BMW AG (DE:BMWG) filed a similar petition in October 2017.
The problem is the lights ran afoul of U.S. rules setting maximum levels for lower beams. 
The agency noted that a recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that pedestrian deaths in dark conditions jumped 56 percent from 2009 to 2016.
At the direction of Congress, NHTSA began extensive research into the impact of nighttime glare in 2005.
Unlike some automatic headlight switch systems from high to low beams, adaptive headlights use sensors, cameras, data-processing software, and headlamp hardware to detect oncoming and preceding vehicles and automatically adjust the headlamp beams.
NHTSA said it was proposing to amend current safety rules that bar the advanced lights but will still need to take final action after receiving public comment before it can the allow the new lights. The agency is also proposing new test measures to ensure the systems work as planned.

NHTSA has received thousands of complaints about headlight glare over the last four decades, especially with the introduction of halogen lights in the late 1970s and then high-intensity discharge lights in the 1990s.

1110,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Sinks as Rout in Financials, Energy Rattles Investors","Investing.com - The Dow closed lower Thursday as investors shunned riskier assets, even as weaker inflation reined in high-flying bond yields.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 2.13%. The S&P 500 fell 2.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.25%.
Financials, mostly banks, fell victim to heavy selling ahead of their earnings slated for Friday. Bond yields fell sharply amid a slowdown in inflation. Falling government bond yields stifle banks' ability to generate net interest income.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), all of which report Friday, closed lower, dragging the broader market to a second-straight day of heavy selling.
The 10-year Treasury note yield fell more than 2% after the Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.1% last month and 2.3% for the year through September. That was below economists' forecasts for a 2.4% rise.
A plunge in energy stocks, meanwhile, also contributed to the carnage on Wall Street after oil prices fell 3% following a much-larger-than-expected build in U.S. oil inventories.
Corporate earnings season failed to shift investor focus, despite Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) reporting third-quarter earnings that beat expectations. It's stock closed 3.5% higher.
Some beaten-up techs, however, bucked the trend lower as Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended the day higher.
Snapchat rose 3% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reportedly said it still sees a potential for the company to deliver a ""Twitter-like turnaround,"" though the investment bank did cut its price target on the stock to $11 from $17. Facebook rose 1%.
In economic news, weaker labor market data gave investors little reason to return to risk assets as jobless claims rose more than expected.
The recent rout on Wall Street has drawn comments from President Donald Trump, who suggested late Wednesday the Federal Reserve was to blame for the weakness as the central bank ""has gone crazy"" with its approach to monetary policy tightening.
""I think the Fed is making a mistake. It’s so tight, I think the Fed has gone crazy,"" Trump said late Wednesday.

1114,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",FX Tranquillity Shows Faith in Fed Staying Course in Stock Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- The currency market has a message for global investors: Don’t assume the sell-off in U.S. stocks will knock the Federal Reserve off its tightening path.
Investors have refrained from piling into traditional haven currencies and foreign-exchange volatility has been held in check. While the U.S. share-market turmoil of the past few days has encouraged some trimming of bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, the current scale of the risk sell-off appears unlikely to derail the central bank’s plan to tighten policy. Some observers point to February, when a spike in equity volatility did little to deter the Fed from its path. That, along with the global nature of the stock-market rout, may be helping FX markets to remain relatively circumspect.
Appetite for the Japanese yen remained relatively muted even as the U.S. stock sell-off extended to equity markets in Asia and Europe, while the Swiss franc has actually fallen versus the euro. Showing how FX moves have been contained, a JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). index of G-7 volatility actually slid Wednesday and an equivalent gauge for emerging-market currencies is below last week’s closing level.
“The scale of the moves in FX is not remarkable, suggesting that investors don’t yet see the equity moves as a game-changer, ” Westpac Banking Corp. strategists including Sean Callow wrote in a note Thursday.
The euro is up more than 0.6 percent over the past two days against the franc at about 1.14724, while the yen is up less than 1 percent against the dollar. The Australian dollar cross rate against the Japanese currency, often viewed as a global barometer of risk, has recovered some ground after dipping Wednesday.
“We saw something similar in February where the spillover into currency markets from an equity-specific sell-off was limited,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV. “If this is just ‘deja vu’ when it comes to the equity market sell-off and VIX spike, then it’s just an equity-market correction that has a small and trivial spillover into FX and bonds.”
The current bout of equity turmoil is yet to match the February 2018 episode and “if anything, the Fed sounds even more confident” about the resilience of the U.S. economy than it did in the first quarter, according to the Westpac strategists. The Fed will probably regard the equity pullback as immaterial to the growth and inflation outlook, meaning there’s little prospect of policy makers stepping in with rate cuts to stem a slide in stocks, they wrote. “If that’s the case, it is probably wise for FX markets to not be aggressive in response to this bout of equity turbulence.”
Treasury Focus
ING’s Patel is watching haven bonds, as a continued stock sell-off that pushes yields down by 10 to 20 basis points could trigger a move in currency markets and see the yen appreciate to 110 to the dollar, he predicts. That would be the strongest level for the Japanese currency since Aug. 21.
Recent spreading widening in Treasuries could explain at least some of the quietude, according to Steve Barrow, head of currency strategy at Standard Bank in London. The risk-off flight to the yen is being counter-balanced by spread-widening in Treasuries, he said.
As for the rest of the market, Barrow wasn’t entirely certain, but pointed to correlation between global equities markets as a possible factor. “Stock markets move so much in tandem, they’re so highly correlated,” he said by phone. “It doesn’t give currencies as much room for variation than we would’ve seen in the past.”
Until recently, any market uncertainty has provided support for the dollar and traditional beneficiaries of risk-off sentiment haven’t been getting the usual traction, said Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
“The longer-term presumptions of risk-off tendencies benefiting the Swissie and the yen are going to come back into play,” Stretch said."

(Reuters) - A New Jersey jury on Thursday cleared Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) of liability in a case involving a woman who alleged that the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused her cancer.
After less than a day of deliberations, the jury in New Brunswick, New Jersey rejected claims by Rosalind Henry and her husband, who had alleged that Henry's mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure, was caused by the company's talc products.
J&J is facing some 10,600 liability lawsuits across the United States over its talc products, most involving claims that they caused ovarian cancer, and that the company knew of and concealed risks associated with the products.
The company, which is based just a few miles from the courtroom where the latest case took place, said it was pleased with the unanimous jury verdict.
""We have deep sympathy for anyone diagnosed with any form of cancer and appreciate that people are looking for answers. However, Johnson's baby powder is not the cause of this disease,"" the company said in a statement. It said decades of scientific testing by academic institutions and regulators have shown its talc to be safe and free of asbestos.
A lawyer for Henry did not immediately return a request for comment. During trial, Henry's lawyers said J&J had known for decades about asbestos fibers in its talc, but hid the evidence from regulators and consumers.
J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. 
Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.
In April, J&J lost the first trial over such allegations when a jury in New Jersey awarded $117 million to a man suffering from mesothelioma and his wife.
It lost another trial in May, when a California jury awarded $25.7 million to a woman diagnosed with mesothelioma. Both decisions are under appeal.
Since then, the company has had four mistrials in similar cases because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died.

In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",India to raise import tariffs on electronic and communication items,"By Sankalp Phartiyal, Nidhi Verma and Suvashree Choudhury
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India said on Thursday it will raise import tariffs on several electronic items and communication devices, in another move to rein in imports and bolster a falling rupee.
The tariff hike, the second such move by India in a two week span, was announced late on Thursday by New Delhi as it attempts to raise import barriers to curtail the import of goods it deems as ""non-essential"" items.
The latest set of increased tariffs could ratchet up trade tensions with the United States and China, among other countries and hurt the likes of network equipment makers such as Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO), Huawei Technologies Co, ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063), Ericsson (ST:ERICb), Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
The gambit is part of a plan to contain a slide in the rupee , which has weakened more than 14 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, hit by an rout in emerging markets and other domestic factors such as a widening current account deficit.
It was not immediately clear how much of a tariff increase is being levied on each specific item, but the Indian government listed several items that could be impacted including wearables like smart watches, Voice over Internet Protocol equipment and phones, and ethernet switches, among other items. 
The plan, which becomes effective on Friday, will potentially also hurt Indian telecoms carriers such as Reliance Jio Infocomm (NS:RELI),  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI) and Idea, said Neil Shah of tech research firm Counterpoint.
""This will slow down the roll out of high-speed broadband which uses optical fiber and LTE networks,"" Shah told Reuters, adding however that it could help local telecom equipment makers like Tata Teleservices that manufacture some of this equipment locally.
The move is the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's latest tilt toward protectionism, as it promotes its 'Make in India' program.
India announced higher import tax on electronics products such as mobile phones and television sets in December, and then on 40 more items in the budget in February. These included goods as varied as sunglasses, juices and auto components.

Last month, it raised import tariffs on 19 ""non-essential items,"" including air conditioners, refrigerators, footwear, speakers, luggage and aviation turbine fuel, among other items.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",SEC in no rush to change quarterly reporting: chairman,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday the agency was in no rush to change quarterly reporting requirements for large public companies, two months after President Donald Trump ordered his agency to study the matter.
""I don’t think quarterly reporting is going to change for our top names anytime soon,"" said Chairman Jay Clayton at an event in Washington, confirmed by an SEC spokeswoman.
In August, Trump tweeted the SEC should study a semiannual reporting requirement, saying he had heard from business leaders it would ""allow greater flexibility & save money.""
The day of Trump's tweet, Clayton said in a statement the president had raised a “key consideration” for U.S. companies and that the agency would continue to study ""public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting.”
A move to semiannual reporting would mark a significant shift from decades of quarterly reporting by U.S. companies, and put the U.S. in line with European Union and United Kingdom rules.
Some investors and analysts said less frequent reporting could result in lower costs for companies and remove short-term demands and expectations. But others insist the quarterly system provides critical information to investors and reduces volatility in markets.
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon wrote in the Wall Street Journal in June that companies should move away from quarterly guidance, but did not call for an end to quarterly reporting.

While Clayton threw cold water on the notion of less frequent reporting by large companies, he said the frequency of reporting for smaller companies may merit further study. Clayton has made attracting more companies to public markets a top priority since taking control of the SEC in 2017.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",U.S. banks need more than in-line third quarter to boost shares,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Major U.S. banks, beginning on Friday, are expected to report earnings growth that exceeds that of the broader market, but that may not be enough to impress investors, who have been unimpressed by loan growth and are anticipating higher deposit rates and credit costs.
Investors skepticism has been significant in 2018. The S&P 500 Banks Index <.SPXBK> has fallen 3.7 percent year to date compared with a 3.6 percent increase for the S&P 500 (SPX) even after a market tumble on Wednesday. 
Still, Wall Street expects S&P 500 banks to report third-quarter earnings growth of 26.5 percent compared with a 21.4 percent for the broader S&P 500, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will kick off the reporting season on Friday.
""It's going to be an OK quarter. Capital markets activity will be a little disappointing, "" said Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeffery Harte, referring to trading results. 
Even if earnings reports meet expectations, bank stock weakness may continue as analysts struggle to find the next positive catalyst but can easily identify risks such as rising deposit costs and a deterioration in credit quality.
“I don't think if the results are in line that it really gets us moving in the right direction ... you continue to have late cycle concerns weighing on the stocks,"" said Michael Cronin, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. 
One issue is how much bank costs will rise as banks feel pressure to raise interest rates paid on customer deposits since the U.S. Federal Reserve has already raised overnight rates eight times since late 2015 and has settled into a quarterly tightening cycle.
On top of this, credit costs are so low that analysts worry they will increase if the economy deteriorates because ""they can’t get much better from where they are right now,"" according to Cronin. 
Many investors had started out the year with high hopes for bank stocks as they had expected the Trump administration's slashing of corporate taxes to boost loan growth with the broader economy. But 10 months after the tax cut, this has yet to happen and investors seem to be losing hope.
""I'm starting to think it's not going to accelerate from here,"" said Sandler O'Neill's Harte, adding that ""it seems investors have adopted more of a ‘show me’ attitude in the face of recent trends.""
Those trends include concerns about macroeconomic growth and the trade war between the United States and China. 
""You've talks about tariffs and trade wars which continue to weigh on sentiment and can really impact companies decisions about whether to invest in longer term projects,"" said Aberdeen Standard's Cronin.
Investor concerns about loan growth are big enough they appear to be offsetting any boost from a recent spike in U.S. Treasury yields. Bank shares often rise on a steepening yield curve - when the gap between short and long dated bonds widens - as a steeper yield curve raise banks net interest income. 
But banks have already erased any gains they made last week in response to a sharp increase in Treasury yields as investors are looking at the longer term. 

""What's going to get incrementally better in the next year or two for bank earnings growth to accelerate?"" said Sandler O'Neill's Harte. ""That's what the market is wrestling with, not such much that there's a downturn looming but what's going to drive another incremental leg up in earnings growth.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tired of being cast as the poster child for big banks behaving badly,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co has been expanding its presence in the nation's capital to convince lawmakers it has changed and talking up its charitable work in their districts.
In the past the bank's lobbying efforts had been modest, but over the past 18 months, Wells Fargo has added more than 15 people to its Washington team, tripling its size, and is still hiring. The bank has also contracted big-name firms including Ogilvy and Federal Street Strategies, whose principals previously worked for powerful lawmakers, financial regulators or President Donald Trump, according to interviews and filings reviewed by Reuters.
Wells Fargo has also been highlighting millions of dollars spent on programs dedicated to homelessness, housing for veterans and financial literacy in key lawmakers' districts to win back their favor, bank representatives said. 
""We have a lot of projects in a lot of communities that we are proud of, and we do have those conversations with elected officials,"" David Moskowitz, head of government relations and public policy at the fourth-largest U.S. lender, told Reuters. ""Our plan is to engage with virtually everyone on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle.""
Moskowitz said he expected his team to meet with important government officials or staff almost every day.
Wells Fargo launched its charm offensive to limit the blowback from a sales scandal that erupted in September 2016, with revelations that employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers' names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.
In an unprecedented move in February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo. In April, two U.S. regulators jointly fined the bank $1 billion for mistreating auto borrowers. Authorities including the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are still conducting their own probes.
WHIPPING BOY
Each negative headline about Wells Fargo extends how long the bank will remain in the regulatory doghouse, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading.
""There's a belief among some policymakers that Wells Fargo wants to right the ship and that it will take time to do so,"" he said. ""But in the meantime they will remain the rhetorical whipping boy for lingering populist anger.""
The scandal-related fallout has started to hit Wells Fargo's profits as it needs to work harder to win new customers and additional marketing costs keep expenses high. In the first half of the year, Wells Fargo earned $10.3 billion, 10 percent less than a year earlier. Its full-year profits before taxes are expected to be 5 percent lower, according to Refinitiv.
The bank's Washington team is trying to shift the conversation to what the bank is doing now for communities and away from the misdeeds of the past. Success could mean fewer negative headlines and a looser regulatory leash. 
In interviews, Wells Fargo representatives said they had been telling lawmakers what the bank is doing to remedy customer abuses and prevent them from happening again. They also offer up the bank's expertise on lending and economic trends, tout the number of people Wells Fargo employs in lawmakers' districts and outline philanthropic programs that appeal to them.
For instance, Wells Fargo said it has provided $11.3 million in down payment help to homeowners in Los Angeles, which is represented in part by Democrat Maxine Waters.
Waters is positioned to chair the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take control of that chamber in the Nov. 6 mid-term election and has been one of Wells Fargo's harshest critics in Congress.
She has said expanding access to affordable housing would be a top priority as committee chair. Wells also says it has donated over $10 million to various nonprofits in Waters' district over the last two years.
Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has asked Waters for a meeting, her representative said, and bank representatives met with her staff in July.
""She looks forward to meeting with him once their schedules align,"" said Charla Ouertatani, staff director for Waters on the House Financial Services Committee.
The committee plans to revisit Wells Fargo's treatment of customers and its compliance with consumer protection laws after the election, she said.
Wells Fargo also donated $3.3 million last year to nonprofits and schools around Baltimore represented by Democrat Elijah Cummings tipped to chair the House Oversight Committee, if his party wins. 
""There are many exceptional organizations that are transforming lives in Baltimore and throughout Maryland with limited resources,"" Cummings said in a statement. ""Whenever Wells Fargo or any company chooses to assist their efforts, I applaud that decision.""
If Democrats take control of the House, Waters and Cummings would enjoy broad authority to examine Wells's business operations, as well as demand bank executives testify on past wrongdoing if they saw fit.
Wells Fargo said the bank had also donated $4.5 million to nonprofits across Iowa in 2017, a fact it highlights to the state’s mostly Republican lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.
LONG PATH
In total, Wells Fargo has pledged to give away $400 million to charitable causes in 2018, and 2 percent of after-tax profits in following years. That could position it as the top corporate cash donor in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks corporate giving. The bank was the top donor among financial firms in 2017 and the second-largest among corporations. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QJzGJr)
In 2015, prior to the sales scandal, the bank donated $281 million, though Wells credits tax cuts implemented at the start of this year for part of this year's increase. 
Even with those good deeds in hand, Wells Fargo will probably remain in the political crosshairs for some time, according to analysts and congressional staff.
On Oct. 4, Senate Banking Committee Democrats called for Sloan and Wells Fargo Chair Elizabeth Duke to testify about ""widespread and persistent failures at the bank."" Wells Fargo's plan to cut its workforce by up to 10 percent is also attracting ire from Democrats.
The bank has to make up ground with regulators too. Last week, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting told lawmakers he was ""not comfortable"" with the bank's efforts to make things right with 600,000 auto loan borrowers. During the hearing, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz characterized the bank as ""beyond repair.""
Wells's efforts have been noticed, but the reception has been mixed, according to members of Congress and staff interviewed by Reuters. 
While some say the bank is taking the right steps on a long path to a repaired reputation, distrust of banks stills runs deep, particularly among Democrats. Some lawmakers, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, have said the bank is still not doing enough to right past wrongs.
Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wells Fargo has a lot more work to do before lawmakers will take its efforts seriously.

""Trust is a tricky thing,"" he told Reuters. ""And it's a lot easier to lose it than it is to gain it.""

1134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","Stocks Head for Sixth Loss, Shrug off Tech Gains","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell for a sixth day, extending the longest losing streak of Donald Trump’s presidency, as energy companies and utilities plunged and tech couldn’t maintain earlier gains. The dollar fell with oil, Treasuries rose and gold posted its biggest gain in more than two years.
The S&P 500 Index dropped more than 1 percent on the day and is down nearly 6 percent in the past six sessions. The tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes surrendered earlier rallies and added to their declines on Wednesday. Trading was heavy with volume surging roughly 55 percent above average for this time over the past 30 days.
“This is just a normal run-of-the-mill correction that happens to be concentrated in some of the more expensive and most notable names in technology,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. But I think it’s been precipitated by the uncertainty about global growth and whether or not Fed policy is going too far too fast.
In addition to energy, insurers and household products manufacturers weighed on the market, while media companies and software makers were among the few bright spots. The Cboe Volatility Index declined but remained close to its highest level since April.
“Volatility is back and it may require more active strategies on the part of investors to pursue their long-term goals,” John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “Volatility is also not to be feared, but embraced, as varying data points will cause bouts of market anxiety. But remember that fundamentals are still strong.”
Earlier, Asian and European equities plunged as the market rout extended around the world. China’s Shanghai Composite gauge closed down more than 5 percent and Taiwan’s technology-heavy benchmark plummeted more than 6 percent. Europe’s main equity index fell to the lowest since early 2017. The euro and the pound both advanced.
Investors seeking to pinpoint the cause of the current rout in equities have no shortage of culprits: U.S companies are increasingly fretting the impact of the burgeoning trade war, while the same issue prompted the International Monetary Fund to dial down global growth expectations. In the tech sector, which was a key driver of the rally that pushed American equities to a record just a month ago, expensive-looking companies have been roiled by a hacking scandal.
Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve has been trimming its balance sheet and raising interest rates, provoking the ire of an unpredictable American president and helping force a repricing of riskier assets.
“What you’re seeing right now is a bit of a panic -- we wouldn’t say this looks like the end of the cycle,” said William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Investment Solutions in London. “You’ve got to try to keep the skin in the game for as long as possible because it’s an incredibly profitable period of the cycle to be invested through if you can keep your nerve.”
Elsewhere, West Texas Intermediate crude tumbled toward $71 a barrel amid a broad decline in commodities as OPEC cut estimates for demand. Precious metals gained with gold. A Bloomberg index of cryptocurrencies dropped as much as 11 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) on Thursday settled charges by New York's attorney general that it misled consumers in its drug copayment coupon program into thinking they would pay far less to fill prescriptions than they ended up having to shell out.
The drugmaker agreed to pay $500,000 in fines and costs, and make more than $200,000 in restitution over the coupons, which can help consumers burdened by health insurance plans that carry high copayments and deductibles.
Pfizer's coupons said consumers would ""PAY NO MORE THAN"" $15, $20 or $25 for Estring to treat vaginal atrophy, Quillivant XR and Quillichew ER for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Flector patches for acute pain from minor injuries.
New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said this was ""deceptive"" because Pfizer buried limits on the total savings in the small print, and that thousands of consumers ended up paying much more.
Underwood said one woman got a surprise at her pharmacy register when she was required to pay $144.62 for Estring instead of the promised $15 maximum.
The settlement resolves claims from 2014 to 2017, and Underwood said the rate at which New York consumers paid more than the advertised maximums went up over time.
Pfizer changed the text of its coupons this year to say consumers could ""pay as little as"" specified amounts.
The New York-based company acknowledged some of the attorney general's findings but did not admit or deny liability.
Pfizer confirmed the settlement, and said reimbursements will go to consumers who used coupons in the last three years.

It refunded $129.62 to the woman who paid $144.62 for Estring after the attorney general's office intervened, according to a footnote in the settlement agreement.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Top brewers raided by Indian watchdog in price-fixing probe - sources,"By Aditya Kalra, Aditi Shah and Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's antitrust watchdog raided the offices of three top beer companies on Thursday as part of an investigation of price-fixing allegations, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Search and seizure operations were conducted at dawn by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) at the offices of India's  United Breweries  (NS:UBBW), Denmark's Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) and the world's largest brewer  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (AB InBev) (BR:ABI) in at least two Indian cities, said the three people, including one government source and an industry source.
The regulator has been conducting an antitrust investigation of the three companies for the past year, said a fourth source with direct knowledge of the inquiries. 
The CCI was tipped off by one of the three companies after it filed a leniency application with the regulator, revealing details of the alleged price fixing, he added.
The regulator's leniency program is a type of whistleblower protection offered to cartel members.
The government source said that the raids found email exchanges showing that the companies were fixing prices. 
""That is smoking gun evidence,"" the source said.
All four sources declined to be named because they have not been authorized to discuss the matter with the media. 
Asked about the raids, a spokesman for AB InBev in India said: ""It would not be appropriate for us to comment at this time.""
The spokesman added: ""We take antitrust compliance very seriously. Integrity and ethics are part of our core values, embodied in our company culture. Our Code of Business Conduct makes clear that our employees must understand and comply with all applicable competition laws."" 
Carlsberg, United Breweries and CCI did not respond immediately to requests for comment. 
WELL-KNOWN BRANDS
United Breweries is known for its  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) brand while AB InBev's beer brands include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois. Carlsberg sells beer under its own-name brand among others and also owns Tuborg.
The rules are different in various parts of India, but the country's state governments generally decide the price of beer by adding excise duties, taxes and retail profit on the minimum ex-brewery price declared by the companies.
Two of the sources said the three companies are likely to have manipulated the ex-brewery price.
Under India's Competition Act, the formation of a cartel is a ""pernicious"" offence and the CCI has the power to impose fines up to three times the profit made in each year concerned or 10 percent of annual revenue, whichever is higher.
Executives at the brewers' Indian operations are being questioned as part of the investigation, one of the sources said.
""The brewery industry is already highly regulated and any further restrictions brought in as a result of this probe will be detrimental,"" the industry source said. 

Last month Reuters reported that AB InBev faces a European Union antitrust fine for preventing cheaper beer imports into Belgium despite its efforts to settle the with the regulator.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Deepening bear market sees $1 trillion wiped off emerging equities since 2018 peak,"By Karin Strohecker and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - A selloff in global stocks tore like a wrecking ball through emerging equities on Thursday with the key index flirting with its biggest daily tumble since the surprise Brexit vote stunned markets in June 2016. 
A toxic cocktail of rising U.S. Treasury yields and a strong dollar; tighter funding costs and slowing domestic growth; an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war and rising oil prices have roiled emerging markets in recent weeks, sending MSCI's emerging market index <.MSCIF> down more than 25 percent from January's peak.
The emerging benchmark is now falling deeper into bear market territory - defined as peak-to-trough losses of more than 20 percent - after first cracking that milestone in August. 
Translating this into the index's market cap, the MSCI benchmark has lost some $1.1 trillion or more than 18 percent of its value - more than double the drop in value global stocks have suffered. 
(Graphic: Global and emerging markets stocks market cap losses - https://reut.rs/2ywZ5hX)
China's tariff-hit slowdown and weakening yuan are among the causes of the wider emerging market malaise and shares in major Chinese firms are firmly in the firing line. The escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has cast a large shadow over developing economies partly because many rely on sustained growth in the world's second largest economy. 
""The sharp correction in global equity markets is the inevitable culmination of a number of different factors, but the most significant is the increasingly precarious position of the Chinese economy and financial markets,"" said John-Paul Smith, of emerging market consultancy Ecstrat, known for predicting the 1998 Russian crisis and correctly calling the underperformance of emerging market stocks from the end of 2010.
The recent selloff in emerging markets has been driven by a relatively narrow group of stocks, wrote Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager.
""The 10 bottom performers in the MSCI EM Index (are) accounting for nearly 40 percent of the hit,"" Turnill wrote in a note to clients. 
(Graphic: Big EM hitters suffer large losses - https://reut.rs/2OlXXby)
That list reflects the dominance of Asian, mostly technology, firms in emerging stock markets.
Of the ten stocks, six are Chinese heavyweights, such as e-commerce firms  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com, internet search firm Baidu, gaming and social media company Tencent as well as lenders China Construction Bank and ICBC. 
Taiwan's Hon Hai, South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), South Africa's Naspers and Russian lender Sberbank complete the list. 

Tech shares account for around a quarter of overall market cap for the emerging index. So if technology stocks are taking the most heat in this selloff, emerging markets - and especially emerging Asia - look very vulnerable.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said on Thursday it sees a return to margin growth next year as it posted a estimate-beating rise in quarterly profit on strong demand and tight cost controls, sending shares higher.
With oil prices hovering near four-year highs, Delta and peers such as  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) are facing a surge in fuel costs that is weighing on profits, even as demand for air travel is strong.
To combat that headwind, airlines have increased ticket prices, used more fuel-efficient planes and hiked baggage fees.
""Our commercial momentum and improved cost trajectory give us confidence that we are on a path to deliver continued top-line growth and expand margins as we move into 2019,"" Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said.
Net income rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the third quarter, from $1.16 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. The company took a $30 million charge from Hurricane Florence last month in the quarter, but said the impact from Hurricane Michael has been minimal.
On an adjusted basis, Atlanta-based Delta earned $1.80 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.74, according to Refinitiv data.
Adjusted operating revenue rose 8 percent to an all-time third-quarter record $11.8 billion, driven by a rise in domestic and transatlantic revenues.
Corporate travel remained strong in the United States and demand should not be hurt by rising U.S. interest rates, the carrier said. 
Shares climbed 3.4 percent to $51.42, underpinning gains on the Dow Jones US Airlines index (DJUSAR) and S&P Composite 1500 Airlines index <.SPCOMAIR>.
J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors that Delta's outlook left the door open for fourth-quarter margin expansion and higher margins in 2019, which it sees as ""critical"" for the stock performance.
Delta said it would keep any growth in nonfuel unit costs below 2 percent next year.
The company expects overall capacity to rise about 3 percent in 2019, and said it is replacing older narrowbody aircraft with larger, more efficient Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A321s and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737-900s through 2020. This will provide a nearly 15 percent improvement in seat cost, executives said.

Delta said it expects earnings of $1.10 to $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter, in line with estimates, and total annual revenue growth of about 8 percent versus 2017.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. retirees to get welcome bump in Social Security benefits,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Come January, most U.S. retirees will get some welcome news when they check their bank accounts - the biggest inflation adjustment to Social Security benefits in eight years. 
    The federal government on Thursday announced a 2.8 percent Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2019; seniors will see the raise in their January benefit payment. That is the largest increase since 2012, when the COLA was 3.6 percent.
   Just as encouraging, health insurance will take a smaller bite out of benefits next year. The standard Medicare Part B premium is forecast to rise just $1.50 to $135.50, according to the program’s trustees. Since the premium typically is deducted from Social Security payments, that means most beneficiaries will get to keep most of the COLA. (The official Part B premium will not be announced until later this year.)
COLAs are determined by an automatic formula tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). With inflation running very flat since the recession of 2009-2010, COLAs have been anemic in some recent years - there was no COLA at all in 2015, and it was three-tenths of 1 percent in 2016. The COLA awarded for 2018 was a more generous 2 percent.
But for many retirees, that increase was blunted by the impact of the little-understood hold-harmless rule, which prohibits the dollar amount of Part B premium increases from exceeding the dollar amount of the COLA for roughly 70 percent of beneficiaries. The rule ensures that net Social Security benefits do not fall when the dollar amount of the Part B increase is greater than the dollar amount of the COLA increase. Last year, however, due to some quirky dynamics of how the COLA and Part B premium interact, the COLA was wiped out for many seniors. [nL1N1NQ0ZA] (https://reut.rs/2iuZM3J). 
This year should be different for most beneficiaries. For example, assuming the standard Part B premium winds up at $135.50 in 2019, the 2.8 percent COLA will translate to a $40.50 monthly net raise (after the Medicare premium adjustment) for a beneficiary receiving $1,500 this year.
The math will be less straightforward for beneficiaries who currently pay less than the standard Part B premium - again due to the hold-harmless rule, which kept their premiums down in recent years. That group includes roughly 25 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries, according to research by the Senior Citizens League - in most cases, lower-income seniors. Most of these retirees will see their premium jump up to the standard 2019 level, consuming a larger portion of the COLA.
“That’s where we will see the biggest bite taken out of the COLA next year,” said Mary Johnson, a Social Security policy analyst for the League.
THE LONG VIEW ON HEALTH INFLATION
Despite the overall good COLA news, rising healthcare costs continue to pose a long-term threat to net Social Security benefits. For example, the Medicare trustees project that the Part B premium will start rising at a faster pace beginning in 2020, rising anywhere from 5.6 to 10 percent annually through 2026.
Overall healthcare inflation is projected to rise 4.22 percent over the coming 20 years, according to a report released last week by research firm HealthView Services. That is down from HealthView’s 2017 projection of 5.47 percent, due mainly to moderation of projected prescription drug costs. HealthView cited ongoing shifts by consumers from brand names to less expensive generics, and the earlier-than-expected closing of the doughnut-hole gap in plan coverage.
Still, HealthView calculates that healthcare expenses will consume about half (48 percent) of lifetime Social Security benefits for a healthy 66-year-old couple retiring this year. And the squeeze will get worse in the years ahead due to healthcare cost inflation. HealthView calculates that a 55-year-old healthy couple will need 57 percent of their benefits to cover future retirement healthcare costs, and a 45-year-old couple will spend 63 percent.
“That’s very worrisome, since so many seniors rely on Social Security for most of their income,” said Ron Mastrogiovanni, HealthView’s chief executive officer.
One way that seniors can control cost is to take advantage of the annual fall Medicare enrollment season, which begins on Oct. 15 and runs through Dec. 7. [nL2N1WJ111] (https://reut.rs/2yj24dB) This is the time of year when you can make changes to your basic coverage and prescription drug insurance. Prescription drug premiums, in particular, are volatile and can jump dramatically from year to year.
“People really need to do an annual checkup on their Part D coverage,” said Johnson. “Unfortunately, most seniors don’t do it.”

In some cases, seniors can mitigate those costs through improved health management of chronic conditions, the report finds. Mastrogiovanni also recommends making modest increases in contributions to retirement saving accounts to offset costs. “The simple idea of improving the management of health conditions and investing the savings underscores a key point – taking retirement healthcare off the table as a concern is an achievable goal.”

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Puma commemorates 'black power' salute in U.S. market push,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - Puma (DE:PUMG) is launching a campaign to mark the 50th anniversary of U.S. sprinter Tommie Smith's black-gloved salute at the 1968 Olympics, shortly after rival  Nike  scored a hit with an ad featuring a modern-day activist for racial equality. 
Nike (N:NKE) saw a jump in sales after its advertisement with American footballer Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling during the U.S. national anthem at NFL games in 2016 to protest against police shootings of unarmed black men - a gesture that has drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.
Puma's #REFORM campaign will see brand ambassadors such as rapper Meek Mill call for people to post images of themselves online with a raised fist to commemorate Smith's silent salute at the Mexico Olympics on Oct. 16, 1968.
The brand is working with rap mogul Jay-Z's Roc Nation on live and social media events to fight racism and sexism, and will match donations to charities such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), up to $100,000 in total.
Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said it was a coincidence the anniversary comes soon after the Kaepernick ad, and also shortly after Puma launched its garish orange and black ""Clyde Court Disrupt"" basketball shoes - marking its return to a sport with close links to the social justice movement. 
""We are not trying to make commercial advertising out of this but we think it is good for the brand because it is part of our values,"" he told Reuters.
Puma has sponsored Smith for more than 50 years. He took a pair of their shoes onto the platform when he did his salute.
Puma is launching a collection of shoes called ""Power Through Peace"" on Oct. 16, with the proceeds going to charity.
Gulden said Smith was a trailblazer for other athletes like Kaepernick, who could not find a job for the 2017 season and is still without a team. Smith never competed again after 1968, received death threats and struggled to make a living for years.
""What he did then ... was the bravest thing an athlete has ever done when you think about the consequences,"" Gulden said.
Nike sales jumped after the Kaepernick campaign, but its shares fell late last month when that did not feed through to an increase in the company's full-year forecast.
Both Puma and German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn) have been taking share from Nike in its home market in the last couple of years, helped by the popularity of their retro fashion styles.
RETURN TO BASKETBALL
CEO since 2013, Gulden has rebuilt Puma's flagging business by putting a big focus on soccer and running, while partnerships with celebrities like singers Rihanna and Selena Gomez have revived its popularity among women.
It is now making a drive to widen its appeal in the U.S. market by returning to basketball, naming Jay-Z as its creative director for the sport and signing sponsorships with four top picks in the National Basketball Association (NBA) draft.
""We are doing it not only to sell basketball shoes ... but to sell more soccer shoes, to sell more training and running shoes in America to that kid who then perceives us a performance brand,"" Gulden said. 
""Doing basketball is a real commitment to the American market and a necessary one to be a successful global company in the long-term.""
Puma's global marketing head Adam Petrick said basketball had a tradition of supporting social justice, with the NBA backing those who speak out such as Puma athlete Skylar Diggins-Smith, who is fighting unequal pay for female players.
""If we're going to participate in the basketball culture, then we have to participate in all aspects of that,"" he said.
Puma's core consumers aged between 14 and 30 have shown an increased interest in activism since the financial crisis in 2008, and Trump's election in 2016.
""As a brand we can't be worthy of their business unless we are sensitive to that,"" Petrick said.
Adidas faced brief boycott calls in May after the rapper Kanye West, who makes its Yeezy brand, described slavery as a choice and praised Trump.
Apart from that, it has not ventured into race politics in the same way as Nike and Puma, although it has scored with consumers with an environmental conscience, who have snapped up its “Parley” shoes made out of recycled ocean plastic.
Matt Powell, a senior adviser with market research firm NPD, said the sports industry was ahead in seeking to align with the values of its consumers, with Puma's rivals like Patagonia and Vans-owner VF Corp (N:VFC) putting a focus on sustainability.
He predicts Puma's ""fist-raising"" campaign will bring only a limited boost to sales but will help the brand longer term.
""The consumer ... wants brands to take visible and vocal stands on social issues,"" he said. ""There are many more people who would respond positively than negatively.""
Puma saw second-quarter sales jump almost 19 percent in the United States, after stripping out currency effects. Gulden declined to comment on current trading ahead of third-quarter figures on Oct. 25. 
Analysts expect the focus on the United States will help boost profitability, which lags well behind Adidas and Nike, as Puma currently lacks scale and distribution muscle in the world's biggest market for sportswear.

Puma's shares, which dipped in January when former French parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) said it would spin off the brand, have since rallied on an upbeat 2018 outlook and are trading up almost a third in the last year.

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc has agreed to pay $65 million to nearly 100,000 current and former cashiers in California who accused the retailer of violating state law by refusing to provide them with seating while they worked.
Walmart denied any wrongdoing in the nine-year-old case, which was scheduled to go to trial later this year, in a filing in federal court in San Francisco on Wednesday. The settlement must be approved by a federal judge.
In addition to the payout, the company said it would begin providing seating to its cashiers in California. 
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said “both sides are pleased to have reached a proposed resolution.”
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the court filing, Walmart and the plaintiffs' lawyers said the settlement, if approved, would be the largest ever under California's unique Private Attorney General Act. The law allows workers to sue their employers on behalf of the state and keep one-quarter of any money that they win. 
The lawsuit was one of the first brought under a California regulation that requires seating for employees ""when the nature of the work reasonably permits."" 
The regulation was originally adopted in 1911 to apply only to women working in the retail industry, and was tweaked and expanded several times in the ensuing century.
Walmart had claimed that placing stools at cash registers would pose a safety hazard and could make workers less productive. The company said the nature of cashiers' work did not reasonably permit seating because they need to scan large items, stretch to see the bottom of shoppers' carts, bag merchandise, and sometimes perform work away from registers.
Walmart had also said it had a policy of offering stools to cashiers with medical conditions or disabilities, and store managers have the discretion to provide stools to cashiers on a case-by-case basis.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) last year paid $15 million to settle a lawsuit by tellers over seating. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank NA , Kmart, AT&T (NYSE:T) Corp and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) have also faced similar lawsuits. 
The case is Brown v. Walmart Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:09-cv-03339.

Livent's debut comes a day after the major U.S. indices fell about 3 percent each, unnerving investors and pushing them to the sidelines. At its open Livent had a market capitalization of $2.34 billion. 
The company's IPO of 20 million shares was priced at $17 per share on Wednesday, below its target range of $18 to $20 per share. The IPO raised $340 million.
Prices of lithium, a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles, have halved in China this year from their peak of $24,750 per ton due to oversupply, hurting near-term earnings prospects for lithium producers.
China's  Ganfeng Lithium  (HK:1772) sank 29 percent in its debut on Thursday in Hong Kong.
Livent holds the lithium business of pesticides maker  FMC Corp  (N:FMC), which owns 86.01 percent stake in Livent, post the IPO which is seen as a test of whether a pure-play lithium operation can stand on its own
The Livent offering was planned due to expectations of higher global demand for the battery metal used in everything from cell phones to electric vehicles. 
FMC saw a 46 percent jump in lithium sales in the second quarter and expects to produce roughly 21,000 tonnes of the metal this year. (https://reut.rs/2NwLlcz)
Livent reported net income of $47.1 million and revenue of $210.7 million for the six months ended June 30, according to its IPO filing.
A source told Reuters on Wednesday the offer was oversubscribed.
Companies sometimes choose to dip below their target price range in an IPO to attract more institutional investors, even if books are oversubscribed within the price range.

SAN FRANCISCO/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking control over the power-management technology at the heart of its iPhones in a $600 million deal with Dialog Semiconductor that also secures the German-listed company's role as a supplier to the U.S. tech giant.
The agreement to license technology and take on people from the Anglo-German chip designer is not only unusual, but also the largest of its kind by Apple, whose last sizeable acquisition was the $350 million purchase of Face ID creator PrimeSense in 2013.
Dialog shares surged as much as 34 percent on Thursday, their most since 2002, as the deal bought the company time to reduce its dependence on Apple - which it expects to account for three-quarters of this year's sales.
Dialog's shares had tumbled earlier this year when it said Apple planned to use chips from another supplier.
Dialog Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli told Reuters he could now lead a ""managed, smooth"" transformation of the business as Dialog seeks new opportunities in areas such as the Internet of Things that includes connected devices like home speakers, fitness trackers or smart watches.
LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIP
Since the first iPhones a decade ago, Apple has used Dialog power-management chips to extend their battery life. Under the deal, Apple is buying patents, taking on a 300-strong engineering team, most of whom already worked on chips for Apple devices, and Dialog offices in Britain, Italy and Germany.
Dialog said its 2018 revenue would not be affected and it would continue shipments of existing main power management integrated circuits (PMICs) to Apple. It expects to sell current and future generations of so-called sub-PMICs to Apple.
Bagherli said that Apple increasingly viewed main PMICs, which are central to the operation of its devices, as a strategic element that it wanted to control directly. This was not the case for sub-PMICs that manage features such as on-board cameras, he told Reuters.
After the deal, Dialog expects Apple to account for 35-40 percent of its total revenues in 2022. That is down from around 75 percent in the current year. Headcount will fall to 1,800.
The chipmaker also said it would begin a share buyback program for up to 10 percent of its stock following its next quarterly trading update. The $600 million windfall will add to Dialog's already-healthy net cash position of $525 million, analysts said.
Other chip designers in Europe have struggled to manage their relationship with Apple due to its sheer scale. Britain's Imagination Technologies ended up being sold to a Chinese-backed fund last year after losing Apple as a client.
""Dialog has bought itself much more than just time,"" said Karsten Iltgen, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, which rates the stock 'buy'. ""Its Apple business has been clearly defined and put on a sound long-term footing."" 
EUROPE PUSH
Half of the deal's value, or about $300 million, is cash for the Dialog engineers and offices and the other $300 million is pre-payment to Dialog for supplying chips over the next three years, the companies said.
Dialog said it would continue to deliver chips to other customers, focusing on the automotive and internet-of-things markets, among others.
It forecast that its sub-PMIC business would achieve compound annual growth rates of 30-35 percent between 2018 and 2022. Its AMS, Connectivity and Automotive & Industrial business would grow at a 10-15 percent rate.
The deal represents an expansion of Apple's chip design operations, which kicked into high gear in 2010 when the company released its first custom processor for the iPad and iPhone.
Apple is buying about 16 percent of Dialog's workforce. Apple said these employees would stay in Europe and would report to Johny Srouji, the company's senior vice president of hardware technologies who oversees Apple's chip design efforts. 
""Our relationship with Dialog goes all the way back to the early iPhones, and we look forward to continuing this long-standing relationship with them,” Srouji said. Apple has added around 20,000 employees in Europe since 2000. It already has a chip design centers in Munich, Germany, where it employs 1,000 staff, and St Albans, Britain. The deal will give Apple four more from Dialog, in Livorno in Italy, Swindon in Britain, and Nabern and Neuaubing in Germany.
The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closings and regulator approvals, Dialog said. It expects annual operational savings of $35 million from the deal, but declined to give more detail on its financial impact ahead of an investor presentation on Nov. 1.

Dialog said Qatalyst Partners acted as its financial adviser and Linklaters as its legal counsel.

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Cheap and unloved: Europe Inc can't afford third-quarter miss as Wall Street gap widens,"By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - The third-quarter reporting season kicks off this week with European companies on track for a second year of solid profit growth, but investors are shunning them even though valuations have not been this cheap since the euro zone crisis.
As a result, European companies cannot afford to disappoint market expectations if they want to attract investors back to a region they have spurned in favor of Wall Street. 
European equities have been a painful trade this year, as political turmoil and the region's vulnerability to trade risks starkly contrasted with the allure of tax cuts, stock buybacks and a booming economy in the United States.
Even a developing stock market rout in the United States and Europe this week hit Europe harder, taking the S&P 500 (SPX) - fresh from record highs - to its lowest in just three months while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark hit a 21-month low.
""There's good reason to expect European growth is going to remain solid going forward but the U.S. is still going to be leading the global cycle,"" Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said.
""Overall the outlook is somewhat weaker [for Europe]. It's roughly half what we expect from the U.S. over the next twelve months. And geopolitical risks are likely to be a continued overhang for European stocks,"" he added. 
Wall Street's biggest banks formally kick off the results season on Friday. 
Overall according to IBES Refinitiv, third-quarter company earnings in Europe are expected to have increased 14 percent year-on-year, against the 21.4 percent growth expected for the S&P 500.
Europe's main equity index (STOXX) hit its lowest level since December 2016 on Thursday, bringing its underperformance versus the S&P 500 (SPX) this year to 11.7 percent. 
That has sunk European equity valuations to extreme levels. The discount to U.S. stocks is nearing 20 percent - a gap last seen during the 2009-2012 sovereign debt crisis which prompted hefty monetary policy easing in the euro zone.
Being cheap has not been enough to attract inflows, though.
After being a popular global trade in 2017 the tide has rapidly turned for European equities on the back of economic and earnings disappointments. 
As Britain's Brexit deadline nears and Italy seeks to loosen fiscal discipline, investors have pulled money out of European equity funds in 25 weeks out of the past 30, according to the latest figures from U.S.-based fund tracker EPFR Global.
""A lot of money has flowed out of European equities and I think that most investors are now waiting on the sidelines for confirmation that the situation is improving,"" Pierre Bose, head of European Strategy, International Wealth Management at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Zurich, said.
""For the over-allocation that you had to European equities at the end of last year you haven't been rewarded. You have withdrawn that positioning and haven't got an incentive at the moment to allocate to Europe away from other regions,"" he added. 
(Graphic: Europe's valuation gap back to euro zone crisis levels - https://reut.rs/2OhiUUY)
""THAT MAKES INVESTORS NERVOUS"" 
The gloomy outlook on Europe's trade-sensitive economy and fragmented politics has clouded the view on earnings. 
Even though European earnings are expected to rise 8 percent this year after growing 12 percent in 2017, over the last few weeks analysts' earnings downgrades have outnumbered upgrades.
""That makes investors a bit nervous,"" Christian Stocker, equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich, said. 
""This normally heralds some pressure and for the next few quarters I expect a significant slowdown in earnings growth for the euro zone,"" he added.
Against this backdrop, European companies' valuation multiples are unlikely to increase any time soon, at least until Brexit, Italy and trade war clouds are cleared.
To be sure, some investors are confident companies can deliver enough to push prices back up.
""We expect some deal as far as Brexit is concerned, and that the Italian situation will sort itself out, and the gap in Economic Surprise Index versus the US suggests the numbers posted in Europe should be relatively good,"" Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Paris, said. 
Citi's economic surprise index for the euro zone has risen since June, an indication economists are beginning to up their expectations for the bloc, while the U.S. index has fallen. 
(Graphic: European earning revisions turn negative - https://reut.rs/2OfJUnQ) 
VALUATION STRESS DRIVES EARNINGS FOCUS
While investors recoil from cheap autos and banking stocks, highly-valued luxury and tech sectors no longer seem to be a safe place to hide. That was clear this week when luxury stocks sank and Europe's tech sector (SX8P) had its worst day since the Brexit vote, while in the U.S. the tech-heavy Nasdaq had its biggest fall in seven years.
Europe's dearth of tech - the engine of the global rally - has hurt it on the up but could provide helpful insulation in a selloff focusing on the most expensive parts of the market.
The renewed focus on valuations suggests any recovery in European stocks hinges on companies' ability to deliver strong earnings. Any disappointment is likely to cause a bigger dent than the boost from positive surprises.
""Given all the uncertainty from Italy and trade tensions I do not expect we have room for (valuation) multiple expansion,"" UniCredit's Stocker said. ""The remaining potential for the European equity market is still earnings growth.""
Credit Suisse's Bose said it was unlikely that European stocks would be able to offset the macro headwinds over the next four to six weeks as they report their earnings updates. 
""I think what people will be looking for is ... just for companies to match expectations,"" he said.

On Wednesday,  The Financial Times reported that the 21st Century Fox CEO and son of Rupert Murdoch would take the role being vacated by the electric vehicle entrepreneur following a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
But Musk shot back on Twitter, tweeting ""this is incorrect"" in response to their headline. It's unclear whether he meant it was incorrect that Murdoch was the ""lead candidate"" as The FT reported, or that it was incorrect that Murdoch was in consideration at all. The CEO did not immediately respond to a request for clarification via Twitter.
Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years as part of a settlement with the SEC, which brought charges against Musk in late August for his now-infamous ""funding secured"" tweet, though he will remain CEO. Musk was also fined $20 million and Tesla must appoint two more independent board members as part of the settlement. He was given 45 days to step down as chairman.
There had already been speculation that Murdoch, who has served on Tesla's board as a nonexecutive director since last year, was the leading contender for the chairman position. But Murdoch has also faced blowback from shareholders in the past, with critics citing his lack of relevant experience. And as an incumbent director on Tesla's much-maligned board, Murdoch would likely face criticism for his role on a board  viewed by many being far too cozy with Musk.
Earlier this year, the proxy advisor Glass Lewis and the pension fund CtW Investment Group pushed for shareholders not to reelect Murdoch to the board. CtW also asked for shareholders to vote against reelecting Antonio Gracias, a private-equity investor, and Kimbal Musk, Musk's cousin.
Others who have been floated as possible chairman candidates include Al Gore, Warren Buffett, and Alan Mulally."
1179,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 09:26AM ET</span>",Sears skips payments to vendors amid bankruptcy concerns,"By Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) has started to miss payments to vendors, adding to concerns about its future after sources said the U.S. department store operator was preparing to file for bankruptcy in the coming days.
Three vendors told Reuters that Sears has missed scheduled payments in the last couple of weeks. 
It was not immediately clear how widespread the vendor problems were and how they would affect Sears' supply chain ahead of the holiday shopping season. Sears is also scrambling to secure financing for its expected bankruptcy, and has been unsuccessful so far, sources familiar with the effort said late Wednesday.
Vendors could stop shipments if they are worried Sears cannot pay, potentially sending the retailer into freefall.
""We went into business with them with our eyes open and knew this day would come one day,"" said Arnold Kamler, chief executive officer of Parsippany, New Jersey, bike maker Kent International Inc. Kamler said he withheld a shipment to Sears after it missed a regular payment last week for the first time.
Sears did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Vendors are usually considered unsecured creditors and usually get pennies on the dollar in bankruptcy court. 
For this reason, securing a sizable financing package to carry Sears through bankruptcy could boost confidence among vendors.
Sears' talks on Wednesday night with some banks, including Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), about securing debtor-in-possession financing ended unsuccessfully, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.
Sears could file for bankruptcy as early as Sunday, and it would need to secure the financing by then to avoid liquidation, the sources said. It was not clear whether Sears will succeed.
Bank of America and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the unsuccessful debtor-in-possession talks. 
If Sears files for bankruptcy, stocking shelves adequately could prove key to escaping liquidation. Both vendors and creditors will be looking at the retailer's sales performance during the holiday season in deciding whether to continue to back it, sources have said. 
""If consumers walk into a store and there are empty shelves, it lowers consumer confidence and that is what has ultimately happened,"" said Brett Rose, CEO of United National Consumer Suppliers, a wholesale distributor of overstocked goods such as garden tools, beauty products and toys.
""If you can go to Amazon.com and get Craftsman tools, why do you have to walk into a Sears,"" said Rose.
As Sears' financial condition deteriorated over the years, some vendors stopped supplying it, cut down on shipments or tightened repayment terms, concerned about the retailer's financial woes and the soaring cost of insuring supply agreements, Reuters reported last year. 
'PURCHASING PIPELINE STOPPED'
As vendors became more concerned about Sears' financial health, they started asking for full payment before they shipped orders. However, last summer Sears told vendors it would no longer prepay for orders, according to a source with direct knowledge of the strategy, who requested anonymity to discuss a commercially confidential matter.
Sears also tried to keep vendors onboard by placing purchasing orders and not picking up the goods until it could make payment, the source said.
Merchandise inventory at Sears was $2.7 billion as of Aug. 4, a decrease of about $719 million from a year ago, according to the company's most recent quarterly financial report. Sears cited store closures and improved productivity.
Sears said its inventory decreased in all categories, most notably apparel, tools and outdoor living, including lawn and patio furniture. Inventory at discount chain Kmart also decreased in all categories, Sears said.
The belt-tightening has been in sharp contrast to Sears' legacy. At its peak in the 1960s, Sears sold everything from toys and auto parts to mail-order homes, and was a key tenant in almost every big mall across the United States.

But it has struggled to reinvent itself in the face of online competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart Inc (N:WMT).

Swiss bank UBS Group AG, its French unit and six executives face charges of aggravated tax fraud and money laundering in an investigation into allegations they helped wealthy clients avoid taxes in France.
Under French law, a defendant can on the first day of trial raise objections to the case going ahead on grounds that the constitution has been flouted. The court described the bank's arguments as ""devoid of seriousness"".
After seven years of investigation and aborted settlement negotiations, UBS will also answer allegations that it illegally solicited clients in France.
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, said in a statement before the trial that the hearing would allow it to respond to ""the often unfounded allegations that were frequently leaked to the media"", but said it would reserve its arguments for the court.
If found guilty of money laundering, UBS could be fined up to 5 billion euros ($5.76 billion). French criminal law lets judges enforce fines as high as half the amount laundered and in this case prosecutors estimate that up to 10.6 billion euros was denied to the French tax authorities. 
The bank could also face damages to the French taxman for the missing revenue, while its executives risk jail time.
UBS's lawyer Jean Veil told the court on the opening day that the French state was asking for 1.6 billion euros in damages, which he said was excessive.
During the French investigation, UBS turned down a settlement offer of 1.1 billion euros made by the authorities, judicial sources have said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) has signed a joint venture with Eko, a developer of interactive video content, to attract shoppers and boost customer engagement, and will invest $250 million in the venture as well as a funding round, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Scott McCall, senior vice president for entertainment, toys and seasonal (products) for Walmart U.S. confirmed the venture to Reuters in an interview but declined to comment on the investment amount.
With the venture, called W*E Interactive Ventures, Walmart and Eko will develop interactive content spanning toy catalogs to cooking shows, McCall said.
The move broadens Walmart's entertainment offerings, which include its video-on-demand service Vudu and recently launched ebooks platform called Walmart ebooks. Earlier this week, the retailer signed a partnership with movie studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for Vudu and prop up the service's viewership.
Eko has previously received funding from investors like Sequoia Capital, Intel Capital, the investment arm of  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Warner Music Group Corp, Samsung (KS:005930), Walmart, and others, and has more than 15 patents for its technology.

1183,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs Says Growth Fears Are Causing the Equity Meltdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s on a frenetic quest to uncover the culprit behind the global equity rout -- and a straightforward theory from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is one of the more dispiriting.
Slice and dice cross-asset gyrations to filter out the noise, and the broader market signal is unmissable: Investors are tempering their growth projections as they price-in the era of higher rates and tighter oil supply.
“The biggest drag on equities -- particularly U.S. equities-- is U.S. growth, followed by global risk appetite,” strategists including Charles Himmelberg wrote in a note published Thursday. “Yesterday’s repricing of U.S. growth was an overdue gut-check following last week’s monetary and oil supply shocks.”
The strategists sifted 28 indexes across equities, rates, credit, currencies, and commodities through a clutch of macro indicators, including risk appetite, economic output, and the commodities outlook to divine the proximate cause for market moves.
The takeaway? The market maelstrom that’s now jumping through Asia and Europe reflects U.S. “monetary concerns” and recent oil-supply shocks -- exacerbated by an abrupt unwinding of crowded trades, according to Goldman.
Notably, during February’s volatility spike, the bank’s macro model “recorded almost no change in U.S. growth views,” suggesting technical factors back then were at play.
The International Monetary Fund this week said global output is plateauing as it trimmed its growth forecasts for the first time in more than two years, citing Sino-U.S. trade tensions and turmoil in emerging markets.
Higher inflation-adjusted borrowing costs and extra premiums for equity risk tend to curb corporate valuations by reducing the present value of expected cash flows. It’s enough to send shivers down the spines of traders whiplashed by this year’s vanishing S&P 500 returns.
Goldman’s U.S. Financial Conditions Index, which tracks changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and the dollar, has tightened to May 2017 levels -- reflecting a more-challenging risk environment that may weigh on economic output.
“Whereas investors previously thought the Fed would be slow to raise rates given the huge cost of a recession while still near the zero lower bound, risk premiums need to be adjusted higher to reflect increased odds that tighter policy slows the economy more than the Fed anticipates,” Evercore ISI strategists including Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note.
Don’t hold your breath for a dovish monetary offset -- the Fed will stick to its hiking mission in order to smooth the business cycle, the strategists reckon.
“As financial conditions tighten and U.S. economic readings fall relative to the rest of the world, dollar strength should fade, favoring high foreign-sales stocks and emerging markets,” they wrote.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 07:43AM ET</span>",BMW to buy control of China venture in 'new era' for foreign carmakers,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
SHENYANG, China (Reuters) - Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) will pay 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to take control of its main joint venture in China, the first such move by a global carmaker as Beijing starts to relax ownership rules for the world's biggest auto market. 
The luxury carmaker said on Thursday it would increase its stake in its venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd (HK:1114) to 75 percent from 50 percent, with the deal closing in 2022 when rules capping foreign ownership for all auto ventures are lifted.
The move will likely spur BMW to shift more production to China, helping to protect profits amid a whipsawing trade war between Washington and Beijing that has raised the cost of BMW importing cars manufactured at its U.S. plant in South Carolina.
The deal also marks a milestone for foreign carmakers which have been capped at owning 50 percent of any Chinese venture and have had to share profits with their local partner, and could encourage rivals such as Mercedes maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn).
""We are now embarking on a new era,"" BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said in a speech in Shenyang, northeast China, where the joint venture is based. He thanked Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, whom he said ""personally supported"" the plan.
Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst called the deal a major breakthrough. ""In the future, BMW will have the full control over the biggest regional profit pool of its business,"" he wrote.
Beijing has been keen for global carmakers to invest more in China and has also eased restrictions that cap foreign ownership of electric vehicle businesses at 50 percent.
The joint venture plans to add a new plant, spending over 3 billion euros on a large-scale expansion of the existing production facility, Krueger said.
Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said: ""Others will follow over time, but the divorce schedule depends on how strong or capable the local partner is.""
Daimler's Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told Reuters last week that recent signals from the Chinese authorities were encouraging, but the German carmaker did not yet have legal permission to make a move. 
""If we do, we need to see what opportunities there are,"" Zetsche said at the Paris Motor Show, adding any steps depended on talks with BAIC Motor Corp (HK:1958), Daimler's partner in joint venture Beijing Benz. 
As trade tensions have escalated, China's government has pledged to open up its markets more widely, including cutting taxes on imported vehicles, cancer medicines and a range of consumer goods.
The country's leaders have also played up other milestone deals such as German chemical maker BASF (DE:BASFn) winning approval in July to build China's first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex.
The rule changes have already helped Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) gain Beijing's approval for a wholly-owned manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai, the first time a foreign carmaker will be able to establish a full presence in China without a partner.
BMW is one of the biggest exporters of vehicles from the United States to China, putting it firmly in the crosshairs of the trade war.
""Given the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, there is a powerful incentive for automakers to produce vehicles in the market where they sell them,"" said independent auto industry analyst James Chao.
He said control of the joint venture could spur BMW to bring production of models like the BMW X4, X5 and X6 sport utility vehicles, which are currently built in the United States, to China.
NOT BRILLIANT FOR BRILLIANCE
But if the move is a big win for BMW, it spells a diminished role for its Hong Kong-listed partner.
Brilliance, which makes the vast majority of its revenue from BMW-branded cars, has seen its shares tumble nearly 50 percent this year on talk that such a deal was in the offing. Its shares were suspended on Thursday.
Brilliance Chairman Qi Yumin lauded the venture's past success and said the future offered further opportunities, in comments posted on the firm's WeChat account. He added that while the situation was complex, the partners would need to ""stick together through thick and thin"".
A number of carmakers said earlier this year they had no immediate plans to change their Chinese joint venture structures despite the planned rule changes.
But Chinese demand for mass-market passenger cars has fallen, increasing the dependence of some local players such as BAIC on income from ventures with premium brands like Daimler.
Industry insiders and analysts fear sales could fall this year for the first time in decades. China auto sales dropped in July and August.
BMW finance chief Nicolas Peter, however, said the firm remained bullish about its top market.
""Number one reason why we invest in China is because we are absolutely convinced the market has a further growth potential,"" Peter said in an interview at the Shenyang event. He said the firm was also investing in extra capacity in the United States.
The term of the joint venture will also be extended to 2040 from 2028.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Mounting costs add to worries about 2019 U.S. profit growth,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising costs for companies are worrying investors already concerned about a step down in U.S. corporate profit growth next year as Wall Street's focus turns away from 2018's tax-fueled earnings boost.
Investors are on edge after a recent sharp pullback in U.S. equities, including the biggest daily drop in the Dow and S&P 500 since Feb. 8 on Wednesday. A spike in U.S. bond yields has renewed worries about rising interest rates and higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers. 
Third-quarter reports will start pouring in this week from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and others, with investors and analysts likely looking for outlooks on higher labor costs, a stronger dollar and the impact of tariffs on raw materials prices. 
""It's going to come down to earnings. The big concern isn't really what third-quarter earnings numbers are, but really what the outlook for the fourth quarter and first quarters are,"" said Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
Even with Wednesday's selloff, the S&P 500 remains up 4.2 percent for the year. Strong earnings had helped stocks bounce back from steep drops in February and March and have kept investors largely optimistic about market valuations.
Analysts are projecting year-over-year profit growth of 21.4 percent for the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, in part reflecting the sweeping tax overhaul approved by Congress late last year.
But this year's earnings growth, estimated at 23.1 percent, is likely the peak for the profit cycle, with growth forecast to slow to 10.3 percent in 2019 as the comparison period reflects a full year of lower corporate tax rates. 
Cost pressures for companies are mounting, Lori Calvasina, RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy, wrote in a note on Tuesday, adding that more than a third of S&P 500 companies have seen full-year margin expectations shrink since June.
Calvasina said she's been factoring in ""back half deceleration"" in 2018 margins and also a stronger dollar, but expects those issues have not been ""fully baked into bottom up consensus estimates yet."" 
She and other strategists pointed to wage inflation as a key risk to profit margins, while companies already have cited worries about costs related to tariffs and the strengthening dollar.
In Friday's jobs report, the unemployment rate fell to near a 49-year low, suggesting the labor market has tightened further. But wages rose steadily, pointing to moderate inflation pressures.
The U.S. dollar index is up about 3.7 percent for the year so far and is now trading above year-ago levels. That could weigh on earnings from U.S. multinational companies. 
Tensions between the United States and China, which already have imposed tariffs on each other's good, have meanwhile fueled concerns about higher costs for companies. 
""What we're going to see is more of a focus on costs given that we've heard a lot rumblings"" on that front, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
""As tariffs proliferate, this becomes a bigger issue. It's cost of goods. Second, it's wage costs. We're not seeing it really borne out in the jobs data yet, but from my perspective, there have to be industries that are feeling and experiencing an increase in wage costs.""
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) last month cited employee compensation and other expenses as it reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street expectations. 
To be sure, even a moderated pace of profit growth next year could still be considered good, given the huge boost from corporate tax cuts in 2018. 

""The sooner we collectively re-anchor on that reality, the less disrupted the market could potentially be,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said on a conference call on Wednesday.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>",Chairman and CEO together or separate? Citigroup has to decide,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) have placed the jobs of chairman and chief executive in the hands of one person, and now No. 3  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) must decide whether to follow suit. 
The matter will be resolved in the next few months as the current chairman, Mike O'Neill, reaches 72, the company's retirement age for directors. Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat will soon know if he will be taking on the additional duties of chairman or working for a new boss. 
""The change in the chairman is the biggest corporate governance decision at Citigroup in six years,"" said analyst Mike Mayo of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). ""That's important given what we see as worst-in-class returns, efficiency and stock market valuation."" 
Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reports third-quarter results on Friday. Investors will be watching its progress toward cost efficiency and return on equity targets, as well as revenue from its big U.S. credit card business. 
Six years ago O'Neill became chairman and shortly after he led the board to replace then-CEO Vikram Pandit with Corbat. O'Neill said Corbat had impressed him with his handling of some $800 billion of Citigroup assets damaged in the financial crisis.
Since then Corbat, 58, has kept Citigroup on a path of improving profits and returning billions of dollars of excess capital to investors. But the recovery has been slow and has fallen short of the company's goals, as well as the performance of competitors. ""Citi needs a greater sense of urgency to improve,"" Mayo said. 
Under Corbat, Citigroup shares have nearly doubled. But their 91 percent gain, as of Wednesday, pales compared with the 163 percent jump for JPMorgan and the 210 percent gain for Bank of America, the biggest and second-biggest U.S. banks. 
Citigroup stock has lagged the past year but probably not enough for Citigroup directors to feel pressed to make big changes when O'Neill leaves, said analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
""You need something like for the stock to be down 30 percent,"" he said. ""That's not what is going on here."" 
In the second quarter, Citigroup's return on tangible common equity was 10.8 percent compared with Bank of America's 15.15 percent and JPMorgan's 17.2 percent.
Kleinhanzl said Citigroup stock is weak partly because investors doubt Citigroup can reach its target for return on tangible common equity, which rises to 13.5 percent in 2020. Getting there, Kleinhanzl said, ""is going to be a challenge.""
Citigroup declined to comment on the selection of the next chairman. In a statement, it said it was successfully executing its 2017 financial plan and had updated, and in one case raised, its targets for 2020.
O'Neill has publicly addressed the question of his successor at annual shareholder meetings. At the April meeting he said Corbat might become chairman and that he was ""a bit agonistic"" on whether the jobs of CEO and chairman should be kept separate.
One year earlier, O'Neill said the board believed that ""an independent chairman is a good idea.""
Other banks have faced shareholder votes on the issue. Bank of America took the chairmanship title away from CEO Ken Lewis in 2009 following a shareholder vote on the issue, only to give the job to CEO Brian Moynihan five years later. Since then the board has faced three shareholder votes on the question and prevailed in each.
In 2013, JPMorgan directors beat back a shareholder proposal seen as calling for CEO Jamie Dimon to give up his chairmanship after a $6.2 billion trading loss.
Mayo said some of Citigroup's largest shareholders have told him that they want the board to keep the chairman and chief executive roles separate. They ""would be reassured having an extra set of eyes representing their interests,"" he said.
Studies are inconclusive on whether companies perform better with different people in the two posts, said Abby Adlerman, founder of consulting firm Boardspan.
Adlerman said she used to advocate separating the two posts, but has come to realize that titles suggesting independence and objectivity are not as important as personalities and collaborative relationships between directors and executives.

""The best CEOs, whether they are currently a chair or aspire to be a chair, realize the value of independent boards,"" said Adlerman.

1192,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:39AM ET</span>",Stocks- U.S. Futures Point to Continuing Selloff as Tech Stocks Decline,"Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a sharply lower open on Wall Street on Thursday as a global selloff spurred by fears over rising bond yields, slowing global growth and trade tensions picked up speed.
The S&P 500 futures were down around 25 points or 0.91% by 6:36 AM ET (10:36 GMT), while Dow futures were down 262 points, or 1.03%. The tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures shed 65 points, or 0.92%.
The losses came after the largest decline for U.S. stocks in more than eight months on Wednesday, as rising U.S. Treasury yields and widespread risk aversion spurred a flight from risky assets.
Treasury yields started to climb last week amid expectations for a faster than expected pace of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as the outlook for the U.S. economy remains strong.
The sharp falls on Wall Street prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to renew his recent criticism of the Fed on Wednesday, calling it “crazy” for its plans to continue with gradual rate hikes in the coming months.
The president also said that Wednesday's stock market sell-off was in fact a long-awaited ""correction.""
""Actually it's a correction that we've been waiting for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump added.
Technology stocks remained in focus, after being particularly hard hit on Wednesday.
FAANG stocks were broadly lower, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) down around 2% premarket and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) off 1.5%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was down 1.6% ahead of the open.
In bond markets, U.S. Treasury prices edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to 3.16%
Investors were awaiting the September report on U.S. consumer prices set for release at 8:30AM ET (1230GMT).
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.2% last month and 2.4% over the prior year, according to estimates.
In Europe, London’s FTSE100 fell into correction territory, having lost more than 10% of its value since hitting an all-time high in May. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index hit its highest level since April.
Overnight in Asia, China’s stock market closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as worries over the trade war with the U.S. continued to weigh.
In commodities markets, oil headed for the largest two day decline since July ahead of the weekly report on U.S. oil inventories from the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 11:00AM ET.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Foxconn's Sept revenue jumps, buoys hopes for solid sales at Apple","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, a key Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, reported a 30 percent jump in September revenue on Thursday, boosting expectations for solid product sales for the American tech giant even as U.S.-China trade war escalates.
Apple's products, largely manufactured in China, have so far been spared from U.S. import tariffs, but it could be put in the crosshairs of the escalating trade dispute as Washington has threatened to expand the tariffs to almost all goods from China including iPhones.
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a stock exchange filing that revenue rose 30 percent to T$584.93 billion ($18.8 billion) in September, extending a streak of double-digit growth since May.
The strong monthly result, its second best ever, brings Foxconn's both nine-month and third-quarter revenues to record highs, a company official told reporters.
""This time, the three biggest product lines in terms of month-on-month and annual increase comes in this order: consumer, computing, and communications,"" the official said, without elaborating what the categories consist of. 
Caught in the middle of the intensifying trade dispute, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer warned in June that the spat between China and the United States was the biggest challenge it was facing.
China is a major production base for Foxconn, while the United States is a key market for the manufacturer.
Shares in Foxconn closed down 6.9 percent on Thursday, versus a 6.3 percent drop in the wider market that came under pressure after Wall Street faced its worst drubbing in eight months overnight. 
Last month Apple introduced its largest-ever iPhone and a watch that detects heart problems in an attempt to get customers to upgrade to more expensive devices amid stagnant global demand for smartphones. It reports the September quarter results on Nov. 1.

1194,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Equity Rout Set to Extend as Traders Say Bad Day Was Overdue,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 is set to extend losses after Wednesday’s stock rout spread to Asia, followed by a more contained slump in Europe.
From sector rotation hammering technology shares with elevated valuation multiples, higher Treasury yields, U.S.-China trade-war concerns and luxury stocks suffering from Chinese border checks, bearish investors could find plenty of justification for a cautious approach.
Futures indicated sentiment remained fragile ahead of Thursday’s trading session, following declines in Europe and Asia. S&P 500 e-mini contracts were down 0.7 percent as of 6:09 a.m. in New York, while Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.6 percent. Europe’s Stoxx 600 Index slid 1.8 percent, falling to its lowest level since early 2017.
Even so, Wall Street traders kept their cool on Wednesday after S&P 500 fell the most since February and the Nasdaq 100 had its worst day in seven years. A quick survey of 10 sell-side and buy-side traders found an “uptick in hedging activity” through the day. Others said investors stepped in to add to positions, with most sell tickets driven by passive funds via program desks.
“I don’t think anyone senses any panic at this point,” Larry Weiss, head of trading for Instinet LLC in New York, said by phone. “Given the levels we are currently at, a lot of people think that something like this and even more downside are slightly overdue.”
At the end of September, the S&P 500 was up 9 percent on the year, while the Nasdaq 100 had risen 19 percent. At Wednesday’s close, the gains had been whittled to 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Investors have been selling their most beloved shares in sectors like technology, and piling into discarded ones, signaling a rotation out of the “growth” investment style and into “value”.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, President Donald Trump again criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying the central bank “has gone crazy” tightening too fast. He called the sell-off “a correction that we’ve been waiting for for a long time.”
Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said there really wasn’t much in the form of new news. Rather, traders bailed out because others were.
“It’s just people saying ‘Gosh, my neighbor is selling,”’ Golub said on Bloomberg Television. “There is no news today. That to me means you’re going to take this back. I don’t know if it takes a day or a week. I would absolutely be buying this.”
Wednesday felt extra painful because gains had gotten so reliable lately, according to Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy for E*Trade Financial Corp. From trade tensions to hints of inflation setting off scares, the market has been resilient this year.
“We’ve been used to one direction lately, and that’s up,” Loewengart said in a message. “Naturally there are ebbs and flows, and that’s what we’re seeing right now. While it may be tempting to make a move to mitigate portfolio risk based on today’s activity, timing the market rarely works to an investor’s benefit.”
But some investors, including Alon Rosin, Oppenheimer’s head of institutional equity derivatives, have been looking to hedge risk. His team has been looking to add November ETF downside trades and long volatility exposures over the past two weeks, as profit warnings form companies such as BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and Delphi Technologies have raised red flags.
""Many are pointing to overall confusion, gross exposure reductions (selling longs/covering shorts), risk parity/factor related unwinds, etc., driving the overall selling,"" Rosin said in an email. ""ETF options volumes have been relatively light since Friday’s initial breakdown and we would like to see that pick up and more activity in the puts before any true stabilization kicks in for a trade-able bottom.""
Most attributed Wednesday’s weakness across consumer goods stocks to comments from LVMH’s Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, who said on a call with analysts that Chinese customs authorities are stepping up border checks on returning travelers, reinforcing concerns over the U.S., China trade war.
But even with trade concerns creeping back into the limelight, consensus is that this isn’t the beginning of the end. Fundamentals still look good, and earnings season is on the way.
“I do not think the cycle peak for stocks is in, if this is the start of a correction then so be it, but I think the bull market has gas left in its tank,” said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Right now it’s dealing with a decline in certain sectors driven by late cycle factors and it’s coming to grips with it in an ugly way.”

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Competition watchdog to study British Airways alliance,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog will investigate a partnership between British Airways and other airlines on transatlantic routes ahead of the 2020 expiry of a previous deal, the regulator said on Thursday. 
British Airways, American Airlines (O:AAL), Iberia and Finnair (HE:FIA1S) form the Atlantic Joint Business Agreement, a revenue-sharing joint venture that covers routes between Europe and North America and allows the partners to co-operate on pricing, capacity and schedules. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), however, said it would open an investigation of the agreement, adding that the case is at an early stage and no assumption should be made that partnership infringes competition law. 
Shares in IAG (L:ICAG), which owns British Airways and Iberia, fell 2.3 percent to 577 pence at 0947 GMT, their lowest for a year and underperforming Britain's blue-chip index, which was down 1.7 percent. 
The CMA said it had decided to study the partnership because commitments made by the airlines on six routes after a previous European Union competition investigation is due to expire in 2020. 
By that time, the UK will no longer be part of the EU, potentially removing the oversight of the European Commission, prompting the CMA to launch its investigation because five of the six routes involve London. 
The CMA said the new investigation would apply both and EU law. 
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analysts said the planned investigation could affect BA parent firm IAG because it could encourage IAG to take ""a more muted response to lifting fares"" on Atlantic routes that are key to the company's profits.
It could also deter IAG from any potential takeover of low-cost rival Norwegian (OL:NWC), in which it owns a 4.6 percent stake and has said it would be interested in buying. 
""The CMA review also potentially constrains and complicates scope for a 'rescue' takeover of Norwegian by IAG - maybe opening the field for Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) to consider further action,"" RBC analyst Damian Brewer said. 
IAG Group said in a statement that it would respond to the review. 
Compared to the market in 2010, the BA alliance now has a stronger rival after Britain's Virgin Atlantic (VA.UL) and U.S. carrier Delta (N:DAL) are teaming up with Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) on their own transatlantic revenue-sharing venture.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 04:57AM ET</span>","Steinhoff's shares plunge after global rout, report on retailer's ex-CEO","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Steinhoff's (J:SNHJ) shares fell more than 9 percent on Thursday to a near two-month low after a global market rout and a report by Bloomberg saying the retailer's former CEO advised friends to sell the firm's stock days before the shares collapsed.
Traders said the retailer's losses were exacerbated by a Wall Street rout that sparked a global sell-off. [GLOB/MKTS]
Steinhoff's shares fell as much as 9.9 percent in early trade and later traded 5.38 percent lower at 2.11 rand, their lowest since August 20.
Citing a mobile phone text message, Bloomberg said the message sent around Nov. 30 to at least two people, told recipients there was impending, unspecified bad news coming.
Steinhoff former chief executive Markus Jooste could not be reached on Thursday.
Jooste told a South African parliamentary inquiry in September that he never lied about activities of the company and neither sold his shares in Steinhoff nor held a short position on its stock.
Steinhoff has been working on a deal to restructure the debt of some subsidiaries with its creditors after revealing multi-billion euro holes in its balance sheet in December that wiped more than 90 percent off its market value and forced it to sell assets to fund working capital.
""Those revelations shouldn't affect the current price of Steinhoff but would probably just add, if true, to Mr Jooste's legal woes to come because insider trading is illegal,"" said Sanlam Private Wealth Director Greg Katzenellenbogen.

Katzenellenbogen added that the retailer's share price was following global stocks lower after Wall Street's worst losses in eight months led to broader risk aversion.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Life after ECB QE? Corp debt market gets a first taste,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone corporate debt will be hit harder and faster than government bonds by the withdrawal of massive European Central Bank support, which means companies will see funding costs rise and investors will need to scrutinize borrowers more carefully. 
Confident that the economy is in decent shape and inflation is picking up, the ECB appears set to end its $2.6 trillion ($3 trillion) asset purchase scheme in December. 
The big unwind from an era of easy money is already under way - overall ECB monthly bond buying dropped by half in October. But the end of quantitative easing (QE) comes with a bigger bump for corporate bonds than for government debt, which will continue to see massive inflows for some time thanks to reinvestments from maturing debt already held by the ECB.
As a result, several European companies are already finding new debt and refinancing conditions tighter. Corporate borrowing costs relative to those of governments have risen by around 50 basis points this year, and the pool of negative-yielding corporate bonds is at its lowest since June 2016.
Last month, the ECB bought 30 billion euros of debt, which includes 4.5 billion of corporate bonds, according to analyst estimates. With monthly purchases cut in half this month, buying of corporate bonds is estimated at 2.5 billion euros.
But next year, when purchases are likely to be limited to reinvestment of maturing debt, corporate debt's share will shrink faster than that of government debt.
ECB data shows a monthly average of just 470 million euros worth of corporate debt maturing over the next 12 months, compared to government debt maturing at a rate of almost 13 billion euros a month, almost as much as the ECB is buying now.
And there is still uncertainty over reinvestment policy, which the ECB has yet to spell out, including how it will deal with redemptions from asset-backed securities. Some policymakers have even advocated not rolling over corporate bonds and spending the proceeds elsewhere, Reuters reported. 
""The concern within the market is that reinvestments (in corporate debt) in 2019 are rather limited,"" said ING's head of developed market strategy and research Jeroen van den Broek.

READY OR NOT
As the ECB's sizeable presence unwinds, the corporate bond market is already starting to feel the effects. Higher funding costs could also reduce appetite for mergers and acquisitions, or push corporates back to the loan market for more concessional borrowing, bankers and investors said.
German media company Bertelsmann was unable to find enough demand to print a seven-year euro-denominated bond in May after offering a starting price of 45 basis points over mid-swaps, a risk-free benchmark.
Bertelsmann returned to the market last month with a slightly shorter tenor and a starting price of 85 basis points. The deal, which raised 750 million euros, was finally priced at 65 basis points over.
""Companies like Bertelsmann have seen their funding costs blow out,"" said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank.
""You can't see any clearer indication as the end of the effect of CSPP on the corporate bond market,"" he said, referring to the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme, the ECB's name for its corporate bond buying scheme.
A Bertelsmann spokesperson declined to comment. 
Bankers and dealers said this factor was only beginning to surface in the primary market.
""We've not had that much issuance since QE was tapered at the start of October, so I don't think the impact has been felt yet,"" said a debt syndicate banker in London.
The segment of the market most at risk is the 25 billion euros of high yield bonds which only just qualify for ECB purchases because they have an investment grade rating from one ratings agency, bankers said. Of this, 19 billion euros of bonds appear on the ECB's purchase list.
    Access to cheaper funding led to an ""explosion"" in the amount of single BBB-rated paper in Europe, which is now the ""most mispriced"" segment of the market, Baldini said.
UNCERTAINTY
ECB QE, launched in March 2015, first focused on the biggest and most liquid government bond markets but was extended to include corporate bonds in June 2016. Economists estimate the ECB now owns about a fifth of the stock of eligible corporate bonds, versus about a quarter of eligible government debt. 
Without a boost from ECB buying, bond prices will increasingly reflect market factors, said Edward Farley, head of European corporate bonds at PGIM Fixed Income.
""Ultimately, this means there will be more focus on fundamentals and getting those right because you don't have anybody propping up the market in an artificial way.""
As a result, the difference between corporate and government bond yields has widened and the pool of negative-yielding investment-grade corporate bonds is shrinking.

Pool of negative yielding corporate debt shrinks - https://reut.rs/2OMhFwx
""The whole corporate bond market has gone through a drastic repricing,"" said Baldini at Barclays. 
He said anticipation of the end of QE has helped push the euro-denominated European Aggregate Corporate BBB index 50 basis points wider from January to September, more than double the widening of the U.S. equivalent. 
Investment grade corporate bonds still retain a QE premium, so further spread-widening is likely said Stephen Caprio, global credit strategist at UBS.

Farley said the end of QE marks an opportunity, because prices more accurately reflect risk. Previously, his firm had been ""very underweight"" ECB-eligible names, because bond spreads traded so tight.

""New issues are now coming at sensible levels rather than ECB compressed levels,"" he said. ""There are plenty of reasonably attractive opportunities that just simply weren't there before.""

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Asia shares swoon to 19-month lows; investors await U.S data,"By Wayne Cole and Andrew Galbraith
SYDNEY/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Share markets in Asia plunged to a 19-month low on Thursday after Wall Street's worst losses in eight months led to broader risk aversion, a rise in market volatility gauges and concerns over overvalued stock markets in an environment of rapidly rising dollar yields.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 3.8 percent around 0500 GMT, and earlier touched its lowest level since March 2017.
Markets in Europe are seen as unlikely to stem the bleeding, with financial spreadbetters expecting London's FTSE to open 1.4 percent lower at 7,047, Frankfurt's DAX to open down 1.8 percent at 11,501 and Paris' CAC to open down 2.1 percent at 5,096. The sell-off, which came as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said stock market valuations have been ""extremely high"", erased hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth around the region. 
""Equity markets are locked in a sharp sell-off, with concern around how far yields will rise, warnings from the IMF about financial stability risks and continued trade tension all driving uncertainty,"" summed up analysts at ANZ.
Japan's Nikkei ended down 3.9 percent its steepest daily drop since March, while the broader TOPIX lost around $207 billion in market value, falling 3.5 percent.
Shanghai shares dropped 4.9 percent, on track for their worst day since February 2016, to their lowest level since late 2014, while China blue chips slid 4.4 percent.
Shares in Taiwan were among the region's worst-hit, with the broader index losing 6.3 percent. Seoul's Kospi index was down 3.8 percent.
""We can't see where the bottom point will be,"" said Chien Bor-yi, an analyst at Taipei-based Cathay Futures Consultant.
""Further short-term equity pain may well be unavoidable in South Korea as foreigners are selling, but bond market is holding up,"" said Peter Park, head of securities management at South Korea's IBK Insurance.
Sinking global shares have raised the stakes for U.S. inflation figures due later on Thursday as a high outcome would only stoke speculation of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
""We're all just watching the Fed. We're all watching the U.S. economy, we're worrying about an inflation spike or a wages spike that will come through,"" said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research at ING in Singapore. 
But he said that he expected the data to show inflation peaking rather than moving sharply higher, which ""could restore a little bit of calm.""

On Wall Street, the S&P500's sharpest one-day fall since February wiped out around $850 billion of wealth as technology shares tumbled on fears of slowing demand.
The S&P 500 ended Wednesday with a loss of 3.29 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 4.08 percent, while the Dow shed 2.2 percent.
The blood letting was bad enough to attract the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Fed for raising interest rates.
""I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,"" Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. ""I think the Fed has gone crazy.""
It was hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers that triggered the sudden sell off in Treasuries last week and sent long-term yields to their highest in seven years.
The surge made stocks look less attractive compared to bonds while also threatening to curb economic activity and profits.
""The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook,"" said Steven Friedman, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. 
""It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.""
YUAN A FLASHPOINT
The shift in yields is also sucking funds out of emerging markets, putting particular pressure on the Chinese yuan as Beijing fights a protracted trade battle with the United States.
On Thursday, the president of the World Bank said he is very concerned about trade tensions and warned of a ""clear"" global economic slowdown if tariff threats escalate.
China has suspended approvals for an overseas investment product in Shanghai and has asked license holders such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments to be ""low profile"" in marketing it, as concerns rise in Beijing over possible outflow pressures.
China's central bank has been allowing the yuan to gradually decline, breaking the psychological 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9377 at 0602 GMT.
The onshore yuan was trading at 6.9305 per dollar at 0606 GMT, 65 pips weaker than the onshore close of 6.9240 Wednesday.
China's move has forced other emerging market currencies to weaken to stay competitive, and drawn the ire of the United States which sees it as an unfair devaluation.
""The yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,"" said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche's global head of G10 FX strategy. ""Further weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital, and a loss of control.""
There was also a danger for the U.S. if Beijing had to intervene heavily to support the yuan as it could lead to China selling U.S. Treasuries, he added.
The dollar was already losing ground to both the yen and the euro, as investors favored currencies of countries that boasted large current account surpluses.
The euro was at $1.1550, up from a low of $1.1429 early in the week. The dollar lapsed to 112.17 yen, a telling retreat from last week's 114.54 peak.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 01:21AM ET</span>","Trump trade war delivers farm boom in Brazil, gloom in Iowa","By Jake Spring and Tom Polansek
LUÍS EDUARDO, Brazil/BOONE, Iowa (Reuters) - The Bella Vita luxury condominium tower rises 20 stories over the boomtown of Luís Eduardo Magalhães in northeastern Brazil. Its private movie theater and helipad are symbols of how far this dusty farming community has come since it was founded just 18 years ago.
Local soybean producers shell out upwards of a half-million U.S. dollars to live in the complex. Nearby farm equipment sellers, car dealerships and construction supply stores are bustling too.
Meanwhile, nearly 5,000 miles to the north in Boone, Iowa, farmers are hunkering down. At a recent agriculture trade show here, Iowa corn and soybean grower Steve Sheppard reflected the cautious mood.
""I'm not buying any machinery, I'm not spending any money,"" Sheppard said.
Two countries. Same business. Two very different fates. The reason: China.
A growing trade war between the United States and China is re-ordering the global grains business. In response to Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing this year imposed levies on U.S. agricultural products. Among them was a 25 percent tariff on soybeans, the single most valuable U.S. farm export. U.S. growers sold $12 billion worth to China last year alone.
The fallout has been quick. China, the world's largest importer of soybeans, has scaled back purchases of U.S. grain to feed its massive hog herd. 
It is turning instead to Brazil, which has ridden the wave of Chinese demand for two decades to become a global agricultural powerhouse. Brazilian soybean exports to the Asian country jumped 22 percent by value between January and September, compared to the same period a year ago.
Brazilian producers are not only selling more grain, their soy is fetching $2.83 more per bushel than beans from the United States, up from a premium of just $0.60 a year ago, thanks to stepped up Chinese purchases. 
Prices for U.S. soybeans, meanwhile, recently sunk to decade lows that farmers say are below the cost of production. The slump has made the agricultural sector a drag on an otherwise healthy U.S. economy. The Trump administration said in July it would spend up to $12 billion in taxpayer funds to help U.S. farmers offset trade-related losses, although the aid package could shrink.
Many American farmers, overwhelmingly conservative voters who helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency, are standing by their man. They believe he will eventually negotiate a better trade deal with China, whose appetite for soybeans is so vast that it cannot completely wean itself off U.S. grain. 
But for the time being, Trump trade policies are handing precious market share, money and momentum to Brazil, the United States' most formidable agricultural competitor. Some fear the lost ground will be hard to reclaim.
""Bad news on tariffs in the U.S. is good news for them,"" Robert Crain, general manager for the Americas for equipment dealer AGCO Corp, said about Brazilian farmers in an interview at the Iowa show.
(For a graphic on the diverging fortunes of farmers in the United States and Brazil, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CAOKWr) 
BOON TO BRAZIL
Like their U.S. counterparts, Brazil's farmers produce much more grain than is needed at home. Foreign customers are responsible for the country's agricultural boom. Nearly 80 percent of Brazil's soy exports now head to China.
The city of Luís Eduardo Magalhães is a testament to the importance of this international trade. Located in the state of Bahia, with farms stretching in every direction, the formerly unincorporated rural area in less than two decades has swelled to 85,000 people. That is bigger than Sioux City, Iowa's fourth-largest city.
Major employers in Luís Eduardo, as most locals call the city, include fertilizer factories, seed producers and processors of soy and cotton. The area ""relies 100 percent on agriculture,"" said Carminha Maria Missio, a farmer and president of the local growers union.
While Brazil's overall economy is stuck in a ditch, the nation's farm sector rolled to 13 percent growth last year. The John Deere dealership in Luís Eduardo saw its sales rise 15 percent in 2017 and is expecting double-digit growth again this year, managing partner Chico Flores Oliveira said.
The local real estate market is surging too. Another new luxury condo tower is slated to open next year. Single-family homes are sprouting throughout the city. Prices for prime farmland are up 37 percent since 2012, according to consultancy Informa Economics IEG FNP. 
Brazil's total soy area is expected to expand to a record 36.28 million hectares this season due to robust Chinese demand, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.
Farmers here also are bullish on this month's presidential election in Brazil. Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who is leading in the polls, favors rolling back fines for farmers who deforest illegally or break other environmental laws. Like Trump, Bolsonaro, is wary of China. But producers here trust him not to blow it on trade. 
""Rural producers support Bolsonaro emphatically,"" said Congresswoman Tereza Cristina, head of the powerful agriculture voting bloc in Brazil's Congress. ""We have access to him...and I am certain that he is smart and sensible.""
U.S. FARM BELT PINCHED The outlook is much gloomier in Iowa, the long-established heart of U.S. agriculture. 
It is the nation's top corn-producing state and the No. 2 producer of soybeans. But its access to some global markets has suffered under Trump. 
The president walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that would have opened valuable markets such as Japan to more American ag products. His renegotiation of the NAFTA accord had Mexico, the largest importer of U.S. corn, exploring other suppliers, including Brazil. Now the Chinese are pulling back.
Boone lays smack in the state's center, surrounded by miles of row crops, hogs and poultry. Farmland values here fell 12 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to Iowa State University. Worries about the U.S.-China trade war loomed over the recent Farm Progress show, which comes to town every other year.
Equipment dealer Lee Randall jotted down prices at an auction of used tractors and implements at the show. Prices have dropped on trade tensions and low crop prices, he said, shaking his head as a green and yellow Deere & Co combine sold for $118,000 and another fetched $82,000. 
""Five years ago you could have added 30 percent to every one of these pieces,"" said Randall, whose business, Randall Brothers, is based in Ohio. 
Nearby, Brett Begemann, chief operating officer for Bayer (DE:BAYGN) Crop Science said farmers were likewise scrutinizing purchases of seeds and chemicals. The trade dispute is making it difficult for Bayer to predict 2019 earnings for its agriculture unit.
A two-hour drive north of Boone in Algona, Iowa, a town of about 5,500 people, farm doldrums are crimping business at the local Deere and Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) dealerships, the operators said. 
""Ultimately this area lives and dies by the farmer,"" said Jim Wilcox, an owner of the Harley store. 
Farmers' woes are showing up on bank balance sheets as well. The proportion of the region's agricultural loans reported as having repayment problems was up in the second quarter, reaching mid-year levels not seen since 2002, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Rodney Jensen, who farms near Algona, regrets not making deals to sell soybeans from his autumn harvest when prices were higher. Like many, he is storing his crop, waiting for better times.
He worries China will not buy as much U.S. soy as it used to, even if the two nations patch things up.

""It's been pretty pessimistic around here,"" Jensen said.

The stock fell as much as 28 percent to HK$11.80 a share and traded at HK$12.38 as of 9:39am after being priced at HK$16.50, the lowest end of its offer range. Its Shenzhen-listed shares are down 46 percent this year.
Prices for lithium have declined this year amid concerns over the arrival of new supply and signs of weaker demand in China, falling about 8 percent in 2018, according to a Benchmark Mineral Intelligence index. Equity markets in Asia tumbled after the S&P 500 Index fell the most since February.
""Investors have decided to pause their investments around lithium and cobalt,” said Chris Berry, a New York-based analyst at House Mountain Partners LLC and consultant to companies in the sector. “Macro-economic concerns are driving the sentiment right now. With the threat of tariffs and trade war, there’s just a lot of uncertainty right now.""”
Click here for more on Ganfeng’s rise to become a world-leading lithium supplier.
Lithium producers needed to be more conservative in the face of concerns about oversupply, Ganfeng’s Vice Chairman Wang Xiaoshen said in an interview on Oct. 9. He delivered a cautious message on growth and said it was time to “fasten seat belts” for lithium producers.
Ganfeng’s debut in Hong Kong is being watched together with another initial offering in New York to gauge investor sentiment on lithium. Livent Inc., a lithium spin-off from chemicals producer  FMC Corp  (NYSE:FMC)., is due to go public later Thursday. “The Ganfeng IPO is going to raise less money than we thought and Livent is probably going to struggle a little bit just like Ganfeng” Berry said.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",Bad timing as Vanguard service glitches start before market drop,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - If plunging markets during Wednesday's U.S. trading session proved unlucky for investors, the timing was especially bad for Vanguard Group Inc.
Its main website conked out before trading even started, the Uptime.com outage-tracking service showed, presaging a day of problems for clients of the largest mutual fund company.
A spokesman for Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, John Woerth, said via email that a ""connectivity issue lasted through the day resulting in intermittent access issues,"" but did not give details such as how many users were affected or exactly what caused the problems. He said most clients were able to transact by phone or online.
Service glitches are a sensitive topic for Vanguard, which manages more than $5 trillion but has struggled at times to show its systems can keep pace with a rush of new money from clients looking to buy shares of its low-cost index funds.
Other companies have also had trouble during volatile trading in the past but on Wednesday spokespeople for two of them, Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade, reported no issues.
Woerth said Wednesday's problems ""were unrelated to volumes"" even as traders spooked by rising U.S. Treasury yields and fears of a deepening U.S.-China trade conflict sold shares causing the benchmark S&P 500 index to fall 3.29 percent on Wednesday, its worst one-day decline since February.
Well before U.S. markets opened, the Vanguard.com site went down for about a minute just before 6 a.m EDT (1000 GMT), according to Uptime.com. Around the same time, users on the Bogleheads.org online investing forum, named for Vanguard founder John Bogle, started sharing log-in troubles. ""Not a great feeling when you can't access your accounts,"" one wrote.
Woerth said the outage was related to the connectivity issues, which other users commented about during the day including Dan Wiener, editor of a newsletter for Vanguard investors, who said his screen froze when he tried to make a trade in the afternoon.
Avivah Litan, vice president at research firm Gartner, said via email that the problem ""sounds like a hiccup with their network that could be related to maintenance.""
But even if it was bad luck that the issue blew up during heavy trading, Litan said, being offline on a weekday is mostly unacceptable for a large financial firm.
""Sometimes downtime is acceptable during the wee hours of a weekend – for example 2 a.m. Sunday morning,"" she said.

Futures on the gauge sank as much as 1.1 percent to 2,750.25 in early trading Thursday, a level that is lower than the S&P 500’s 200-day moving average.

All stocks listed on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average retreated, while Japan’s Topix index headed for its steepest decline since March. The Hang Seng Index and China’s Shanghai Composite fell more than 3 percent each. Taiwan’s Taiex index led the rout with a 5.6 percent slump.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index headed for its worst day since February, with the measure sliding 3.1 percent. Turbulence spiked in Asian markets as the Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index surged 45 percent.
""It’s just a beginning,” Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp., said by phone. “The U.S. tech bubble may take a while to burst and we are facing many external uncertainties - trade wars, risks in emerging markets currencies and oil price. And people should also watch yuan closely.""
The regional benchmark gauge has slumped 12 percent this year as uncertainties such as the U.S.-China trade war weigh on investor sentiment. The Shanghai Composite Index has lost 20 percent in 2018, while Japan’s Topix is down 6.4 percent.
The S&P 500 Index sank 3.3 percent on Wednesday for its biggest drop since February, while the Nasdaq 100 Index tumbled 4.4 percent, setting the tone for a day of losses in Asian equity markets.
“The sharp selloff in the U.S. likely caught no-one by surprise,” said Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International. “If anything, market participants have been wondering how, in the face of tighter money, a tighter labor market and rising oil prices, the U.S. has continued to be so resilient.”
Investors are turning their attention to Chinese trade data due Friday for a read on whether the trade dispute is seeping through in the data. They’ll also be keeping an eye on inflation data scheduled for Thursday in the U.S.
“Asia is like a leveraged play on the U.S. market and the global trade situation right now, that’s not going to change until a deal is reached between the two largest economies in the world,” said Olivier d’Assier, head of applied research for the Asia-Pacific region at Axioma. For emerging markets, “the trifecta of a falling U.S. market, higher U.S. interest rates, and a stronger dollar is a deadly combination so they are likely to remain under pressure.”
Here’s what investors and analysts are saying about the selloff:
Going to Get Worse
“I think this is going to get worse before getting better,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. “We are not buying the dip yet. We are staying with our core value positions including energy and banks, but have significant cash buffers and significant long the Japanese yen.”
“We believe that ongoing structural deterioration in U.S.-China relations is likely to result in higher volatility in Asia going forward,” said Ross Cameron, head of the Japan office at Northcape Capital Ltd. “Volatility should be positive for active investors and stock pickers, as more opportunities arise to buy undervalued companies.”
Mixed Earnings Outlook
“The latest drop is reminiscent of February’s selling, which saw its recovery assisted by positive earnings results,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. “As for the upcoming earnings season commencing with major U.S. banks on Friday, the outlook is rather mixed thus adding to the uncertainty. It will be one worth watching for aid to the market given the proximity and it will be difficult to rule out further decline in the market absent positive factors.”
No Crisis
“We haven’t reached a crisis scenario,” said Lam of CEB International. “After all, corporate fundamentals are not that bad. It’s all because of these external uncertainties. Yes the economic data - especially from China -- may show some slowdown in the near future but the situation is still far away from a hopeless crisis.”

Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman, accused the United States of starting the trade war over ""an unfounded fear"" that China's rise threatened the national security of the American people, the South China Morning Post said on Thursday.
Tsai was speaking at a conference hosted by the newspaper in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump repeated his threat to slap tariffs on an additional $267 billion of Chinese imports.
Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce firm, owns the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.
""It is really ill-advised for the United States to launch a war of some sort targeting China, thinking that they can treat China like the way they treated Russia by isolating the economy and bringing on pain,"" Tsai was quoted as saying.
""We are so integrated that the pain is going to be felt all over the world,"" he added.
Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma told the conference via video link that he believed the United States would ""suffer more"" from the dispute, the newspaper said.
Ma said in September trade frictions between the world's two largest economies could last for two decades and would be ""a mess"" for all parties involved.
Ma had a high-profile meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump last year where Ma promised to create one million jobs in the United States linked to small merchants selling items on Alibaba platforms.

Trade relations have since deteriorated between China and the United States in a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Bayer AG's (DE:BAYGn)  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit received a tentative ruling for a new trial on the $250 million in punitive damages awarded by a jury to a groundskeeper who alleged the company's glyphosate-based weed killers, including Roundup, caused his cancer.
According to a Wednesday court filing in San Francisco's Superior Court of California, Judge Suzanne Bolanos was considering whether to grant the company's motion for a new trial on the punitive damages.
The judge's ruling, granting a new trial on the punitive damages, is tentative and was being discussed at a court hearing underway on Wednesday. The Aug. 10 award to Dewayne Johnson included $39 million in compensatory damages. 
The combined $289 million verdict marked the first decision finding that Monsanto had failed to warn consumers of the alleged cancer risks posed by glyphosate, the world's most widely used weed-killer. 
Bayer, which bought Monsanto earlier this year for $63 billion, faces more than 8,000 similar lawsuits in the United States. 
The German company has denied the allegation and has said that decades of real-world application and scientific studies have shown the chemical to be safe for human use. 
Investors have raised concerns over the litigation risk, with Bayer shares falling sharply after the decision and still trading some 20 percent below their pre-verdict level at 75.10 euros ($86.57) on Wednesday.
In September 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found that the chemical was not a likely carcinogen to humans. However, in 2015 the cancer unit of the World Health Organization classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
On Wednesday, the judge said that Johnson had failed to meet his burden of producing clear and convincing evidence of malice or oppression by Monsanto, a requirement for allowing a jury to award punitive damages.
Monsanto had asked Bolanos in court filings on Sept. 18 to set aside the entire verdict or, in the alternative, reduce the award or grant a new trial.
The judge's order said the company's request for an entire new trial that includes liability grounds would also be discussed during Wednesday's court hearing.
Bayer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Lawyers for Johnson said they would only comment after Wednesday's court hearing concludes.
Johnson's case, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, that he alleged was caused by years of exposure to Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto herbicide that contains glyphosate.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 08:37PM ET</span>",FT says Murdoch in line for Tesla chair. Musk reply: incorrect,"By Alexandria Sage and Ross Kerber
SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Outgoing Twenty-First Century Fox Inc Chief Executive James Murdoch is the lead candidate to replace Elon Musk as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chairman, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, but Musk in a tweeted reply to the newspaper said, ""This is incorrect."" 
Tesla has until Nov. 13 to appoint an independent chairman of the board, part of settlements reached last month between Tesla, Musk and U.S. regulators in the wake of Musk tweeting in August that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker private.
The SEC settlement capped months of debate and some investor calls for stronger oversight of Musk, whose recent erratic public behavior raised concerns about his ability to steer the money-losing company through a rocky phase of growth. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said Musk's tweeted statements about going private were fraudulent, allowed the billionaire to retain his role as CEO while requiring he give up his chairmanship.
Musk had said he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, a number that is slang for marijuana. He tweeted the three-word denial of the Financial Times story, on Wednesday at 4:20 pm PT (2320 GMT), about six hours after the newspaper's post.
In a vote of confidence for Musk, shareholder T. Rowe Price Group Inc said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had raised its stake by nearly half to 10.2 percent at the end of September from just under 7 percent in June.
The Financial Times cited two people briefed on discussions saying Murdoch was the lead candidate for the job. 
Murdoch, already an independent director of Tesla, has signaled he wants the job, the report said.
The son of Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, he joined Tesla's board last year after years of work with media companies. He has no experience in manufacturing and has never led a company that makes cars or electric vehicles.
Murdoch could not immediately be reached for comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Twenty-First Century Fox declined to comment. 
Musk is the public face of Tesla, and any chairman would have to contend with his powerful personality. Thanks to his vision and audacious showmanship, Tesla's valuation has at times eclipsed that of traditional, established U.S. automakers with billions in revenues and the company has garnered legions of fans, despite repeated production issues.
""The question when it comes to James Murdoch is, 'Is he the guy who'll be able to establish that level of authority with Elon Musk?'"" asked Abby Adlerman, CEO of Boardspan, a corporate governance consulting company. 
Investor concerns that Tesla's board was too closely tied to Musk led to the company's addition of two independent directors, including Murdoch, in July 2017.
Earlier this year, leading U.S. proxy advisers Glass Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services, and union-affiliated investment adviser CtW Investment Group, had recommended investors cast votes ""against"" the re-election of Murdoch as a Tesla director at the company's annual meeting held on June 5.
While CtW cited a lack of relevant experience and a ""troubled history as an executive and director,"" both proxy firms warned that Murdoch already served on too many boards. 
Murdoch currently serves on the boards of Twenty-First Century Fox and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). He stepped down from the board of Sky Plc (LON:SKYB) on Tuesday following the completion of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's takeover of the broadcaster.
Murdoch was forced out as chairman of Sky, then BSkyB, in 2012 after being embroiled in Britain's phone-hacking scandal. He returned to Sky's board in 2016 after rebuilding his career at Fox.
Glass Lewis research director Courteney Keatinge said on Wednesday that while Murdoch's departure from Sky could alleviate some concerns, the Tesla chairmanship would still require a big time commitment as the company faces pressures on many fronts. 
""I would still have reservations about the time he would be able to allot to this,"" Keatinge said.
According to the FT report, external options were still being considered. 
Considering a broad choice of candidates was important, said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, because ""Investors should really be wary about the board making the easy choice here"" in opting for Murdoch.
Murdoch is set to be succeeded by his brother Lachlan Murdoch as Twenty First Century Fox chief executive officer, after the media group completes the sale of bulk of its assets to Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS).
'STABILITY AT THE TOP'
Tesla faces a crucial moment as it struggles to produce its Model 3 sedan in large volume and deliver it quickly to customers amid an ongoing cash crunch that has concerned some analysts. Musk has vowed that the loss-making company will be profitable and cash flow-positive in its third and fourth quarters.
Concerns about Musk due to production delays and manufacturing challenges have been exacerbated by a series of damaging actions, including Musk insulting analysts on a conference call, calling a British cave rescuer a pedophile, and joking on April Fool's Day that Tesla was going bankrupt.
Shares are down 20 percent since the beginning of the year.
""Elon Musk is building a great company but has been erratic to say the least when it comes to thinking about his investors,"" said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors. ""The company needs some added stability at the top to win back investor confidence."" 
Under terms of the SEC settlement, Musk is not permitted to be re-elected to the chairman's post for three years. Tesla is also required to appoint two new independent directors to its board. 

With U.S. stock markets broadly lower, Tesla shares closed down 2.3 percent at $256.88.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",Rattled Wall Street stock investors fret about a correction,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - The deepest one-day selloff in Wall Street stocks in eight months has investors using the market equivalent of a dirty word: ""correction"". 
With traders spooked by rising U.S. Treasury yields and fears of a deepening U.S.-China trade conflict, the benchmark S&P 500 index on Wednesday dropped 3.29 percent, its worst one-day decline since February, bringing its loss to almost 5.0 percent since closing at a record high on Sept 20.
Many investors define a stock market correction as a fall of at least 10 percent from a high, often as a reaction to excessive gains. 
“It’s probably the beginning of the correction,"" said Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
""It’s going to come down to earnings. The big concern isn’t really what third-quarter earnings numbers are, but really what the outlook for the fourth quarter and first quarters are.""
Fears of a potential correction became more acute as the S&P 500 technology index plummeted 4.77 percent, the deepest one-session decline since 2011 for the sector behind much of the market's gains in recent years.
U.S. President Trump blamed the Federal Reserve, which he said has gone ""crazy"" raising interest rates.
“Actually it's a correction that we've been waiting for for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania.
Investors are worried about how aggressively the Fed will raise interest rates, and some are skeptical about whether the central bank will support markets the way it was seen to have done under previous Fed chairs. 
A stock market downturn hitting voters' retirement savings would be inopportune for Trump and the Republican party ahead of U.S. midterm elections on November 6. 
The S&P 500 index fell 10 percent in early February from a high the previous month, raising fears that a decade-old bull market was ending. 
However, fueled by the deep corporate tax cuts passed by the Trump administration last year and an expanding economy, Wall Street deftly recovered. It racked up a 2018 gain of nearly 10 percent in late September, until soaring 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields and trade policy related worries sent investors fleeing for safety.
""When interest rates go up it can throw a cold towel on an overheating economy, and that's what it looks like is happening now,"" said Sandy Villere, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans. 
U.S. stocks are widely considered to be in the longest ever bull market, which started in March 2009, when investors grappled with the global financial crisis that had vaporized over half of the U.S. stock market's value. 
Since then, the S&P500 index has more than quadrupled, and many investors have been debating when, not if, the run-up in stock prices would end.
""The market has been on a 10-year bull run and we have seldom seen a 10 percent correction during that time. Every time we get around that number, markets come rallying back. What’s different now is that the 10-year bond yield is much higher. I think we're getting an overdue correction in the market,” said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners in Memphis. 
HINGES ON EARNINGS 
Whether the S&P 500 index slides into a prolonged downturn may hinge on what companies say about their outlooks when they report their quarterly results in coming weeks.
Analysts expect aggregate S&P 500 earnings per share to surge 21 percent, year over year, in the September quarter and 20 percent in the December quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
But in 2019, deep corporate tax cuts that started in 2018 will be a year old, and companies are unlikely to repeat the same strong earnings growth they saw this year. Earnings repatriated from abroad this year as part of the tax overhaul may lead to fewer big increases in stock buybacks next year.
Executives on quarterly earnings call will also provide details about how they expect Trump's trade conflict with China to affect their businesses.
September consumer price data due on Thursday might fuel worries that the Fed may raise interest rates more aggressively than previously thought. 

""The market is digesting the potential that rates moving upwards eventually seep into the real economy in the form of mortgage rates, auto rates, student lending rates,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York. ""What we're seeing here is the market positioning for potential lower growth going forward.""

ORLANDO, Fl. (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force on Wednesday said that it had awarded a total $2.3 billion in contracts to develop rocket launch systems for national security missions.
The awards go to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin; United Launch Services, part of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT); and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) Innovation Systems.
The three contracts are part of a Department of Defense initiative to assure constant military access to space and curb reliance on foreign-made rocket engines, like ULA's flagship Atlas V rocket that uses Russian-made RD-180 boosters. The contracts are to develop rockets and carry defense payloads into space.
Centennial, Colorado-based United Launch Services received $967 million to develop its Vulcan rocket; Kent, Washington-based Blue Origin was awarded $500 million to build its New Glenn booster, and Northrop Grumman of Arizona received $791.6 million for its OmegA rocket. 
Blue Origin's and Northrop's prototype vehicles for military launches are expected to be ready to fly by late 2024 and ULA's Vulcan rocket development should be completed by March 2025.

Blue Origin said in a statement following Wednesday's announcement that it will build a launch site at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, although it did not say what rockets would launch from the site. ULA announced in September that its Vulcan rocket will be powered by Blue's BE-4 liquid rocket engines.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Lift off: Singapore Airlines to boost U.S. presence with world's longest flight,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) is poised for a major boost to its U.S. footprint from Thursday evening as it resumes, after five years, the world's longest commercial flight - a near-19 hour non-stop from Singapore to New York.
The route, combined with the airline's plans to restart non-stop services to Los Angeles and add more non-stop flights to San Francisco next month, will give the premium Asian carrier its biggest-ever U.S. presence.
The airline has already ordered seven new ultra-long range twin-engine Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-900ULRs fitted with just 161 business class and premium economy seats - and no economy class seats - for the U.S. capacity increase. 
Singapore Airlines had abandoned the marathon Newark and Los Angeles routes in 2013 when high fuel prices made the use of four-engine Airbus A340-500 jets uneconomic. 
It has since flown to New York's JFK Airport via Frankfurt and to Los Angeles via Tokyo and Seoul.
The airline's revenue contribution from the Americas region is currently at 14 percent, down from 20 percent in 2013 due to the loss of the non-stop flights, Corrine Png, CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective, said.
""Operating trans-Pacific connecting flights opened Singapore Airlines to a lot more competition from other carriers and resulted in the loss of high-yielding business traffic,"" she said. ""We expect Singapore Airlines to regain market share, especially in the premium travel market."" 
She said capacity would need to be managed carefully given high fuel prices, but there should be sufficient demand as long as the United States and global economies remained robust.
Non-stop ultra-long haul flights can typically command an airfare premium of around 20 percent versus those involving one or more stops, according to travel industry data, given their popularity with time-sensitive business travellers.
However, Singapore Airlines has been offering low initial fares on its U.S. non-stop routes, including as little as S$1,438 ($1,040) return for premium economy on Singapore-Newark, CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said.
""While it's early days, there will be questions whether the latest attempt at U.S. nonstops will be profitable for Singapore Airlines given the very intense competition in the Singapore-U.S. market, rising fuel prices and the large number of premium seats Singapore Airlines has to fill on the seven newly delivered A350-900ULRs,"" he said.
Brent crude prices (LCOc1) are currently trading near $85 per barrel, significantly below a 2013 peak of about $119 but still up about 27 percent so far this year. The benchmark is on track for its third straight year of gains. [O/R]
United Airlines offers non-stop flights from Singapore to San Francisco, while other carriers like Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp (TW:2618) compete with one-stop Singapore-U.S. offerings.

The Singapore-Newark route will top Qatar Airways' Doha-Auckland route as the world's longest, but Australia's Qantas Airways is considering the introduction of an even longer 20-hour Sydney-London flight from 2022.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 06:54PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Citigroup may face fair lending penalty from regulator - sources,"By Patrick Rucker and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. financial regulator is mulling sanctions against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) for denying minority customers the kinds of mortgage discounts that the bank offered to many other borrowers, three people familiar with the probe told Reuters.
While performing a review to ensure it adhered to fair lending standards, Citigroup found that some minority borrowers were not getting the discounts they were due under a program that gives a break on mortgage rates to customers who have large deposits or wealth in the hands of the bank, said the sources.
Citigroup flagged the ""relationship pricing"" problems last year to its regulator, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said the sources, who were granted anonymity to discuss the regulatory probe, which is not public.
The bank told the OCC that discrepancies in ""relationship pricing"" were inadvertent and it had taken steps to resolve the issue, they said.
Many lenders use mortgage rate discounts to deepen customer ties, but scrutiny of Citibank's ""relationship pricing' offer could prompt questions about how other banks run such programs.
The OCC is examining whether Citigroup breached fair lending standards, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of customers' race, gender, age or religion, the people said. 
If the OCC finds wrongdoing, it could fine Citigroup or put it under tighter oversight, among other options, they said.
An OCC spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday.
In a statement provided to Reuters on Wednesday, Citigroup spokesman Drew Benson acknowledged the problems but said the bank ""firmly believes it has not engaged in discrimination or violated fair lending laws.""
""In 2014, Citi self-identified errors implementing its relationship pricing program which affected a small percentage of our mortgage customers,"" Benson wrote in an email. ""We conducted a comprehensive review, reimbursed affected customers and have strengthened our processes and controls to help ensure correct implementation going forward.""
The OCC referred Citigroup's findings to the Justice Department, which also enforces fair lending laws, in July 2018, according to a DOJ official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The matter was sent back to the OCC for ""administrative enforcement"" in recent weeks, the official said.
The Justice Department may decline referrals from other agencies if officials determine the problem has already been addressed or victims made whole.
Citigroup's mortgage loan officers have in recent months been trained on the dangers of bias and instructed to explain the benefits of ""relationship pricing"" to all prospective borrowers, two employees who have been part of the training told Reuters.
Benson said recent bias workshops were voluntary and popular among employees and the ""training had nothing to do with"" relationship pricing.
Under the program, customers with $1 million in deposits or investments can receive a half-percentage point off their interest rates. Customers with smaller holdings are due smaller savings.

Many fair lending rules were written in the 1960s to eliminate mortgage discrimination, or 'red-lining'.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 06:34PM ET</span>",Sears prepares to file for bankruptcy in coming days: sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the coming days following years of declining sales, sources said on Wednesday, casting doubt over the survival of what was once the world's largest retailer.
The bankruptcy filing would end a standoff between Chief Executive Officer Eddie Lampert, the retailer's biggest shareholder and lender, and a special board committee the company has formed to consider a rescue plan proposed by Lampert that would involve asset sales and a debt restructuring. 
The committee has been resisting the plan amid concerns that creditors and shareholders would sue over it being too favorable for Lampert. His history of financial engineering at Sears for more than a decade through deals tied to his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc could now be subjected to new scrutiny by Sears' creditors in bankruptcy court, according to the sources.
Both Lampert and the Sears special committee now accept that only a court-supervised process can determine the company's future, one of the sources said. Talks are under way to arrange debtor-in-possession financing for a bankruptcy filing that could come in the next few days, the sources added. CNBC first reported on the debtor-in-possession financing talks, while the Wall Street Journal first reported on Sears' bankruptcy preparations.
A $134-million debt payment that Sears has to meet on Monday has added pressure on both Lampert and the special committee to find a resolution. Lampert had told the special committee he would not help the company fund that obligation unless it agreed to his plan, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Spokespeople for Lampert and Sears declined to comment.
""For whatever reason, Sears' board said enough is enough,"" said Chad Brand, president of Peridot Capital Management, which holds Sears bonds. Brand added that he had significantly cut down on his Sears bond holdings earlier this year amid concerns from his clients.
At its peak in the 1960s, Sears sold everything from toys and auto parts to mail-order homes, and was a key tenant in almost every big mall across the United States. But it has struggled to reinvent itself in the face of online competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), as well as from other brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart Inc (N:WMT). 
IN THE SHADOW OF TOYS 'R' US
It is not clear whether Sears would survive a bankruptcy process. When Toys 'R' Us, the largest specialty toy retailer, filed for bankruptcy protection last September, it sought to emerge from it after restructuring its debt and shutting stores. Instead, it was forced to liquidate last March, after creditors balked at providing a new lifeline to the company.
If Sears were to file for bankruptcy, its financial performance during the upcoming holiday season could prove crucial in determining its future, according to the sources. Toys 'R' Us' creditors lost faith in the retailer after revenue during last year's holiday season failed to meet their expectations.
Retaining the confidence of vendors is also key to Sears remaining operational. Victor Sandy, who helps suppliers hedge the risk of nonpayment for goods at Michigan-based Global Commercial Credit LLC, said vendors will be looking to see if Sears can secure enough financing to see it through bankruptcy.
""The risk is a formal reorganization turns into a liquidation if things do not go well. That is a real risk that we saw happen with Toys 'R' Us,"" said Sandy.
Sears shares were down 31 percent at 40.5 cents in afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of just $40 million. The stock, which traded above $100 a decade ago, has fallen to less than $1 in the past year. Sears' borrowings totaled $5 billion as of Aug. 4.
The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer has posted seven straight years of losses and its sales have not grown since the 2008 financial crisis. The retailer warned last month it may go out of business if the deals proposed by Lampert were not approved. 
LAMPERT'S DEALS
Lampert, who created Sears in its current form in 2005 by acquiring it in a $11 billion deal and merging it with his discount retailer Kmart, proposed deals to reduce the company's debt load to $1.2 billion from $5.6 billion in September. The Sears special committee had also been weighing a prior offer from Lampert to acquire the retailer's Kenmore appliances brand and its home services business for as much as $480 million. 
Lampert has invested and lent to Sears many times over the years, making him and his hedge fund the company’s largest shareholders with a stake just shy of 50 percent, as well as its biggest creditor, with about $2.5 billion owed to him or funds he controls. 
Lambert became Land End's Inc (O:LE) biggest shareholder when the clothing manufacturer was spun out of Sears in 2014. In 2015, Sears sold 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to  Seritage Growth Properties  (N:SRG), a company he created. 
Such prolific dealmaking has made it difficult to assess whether Lampert has made a profit or loss on Sears over the years.
In an earlier attempt to avoid bankruptcy, Sears last year sold its Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (N:SWK) for $900 million. It also signed a deal to sell Kenmore appliances on e-commerce site Amazon.com.

Shares of real estate investment trusts (REIT) exposed to Sears properties also fell Wednesday. Seritage slid 5.9 percent, CBL & Associates Properties (N:CBL) lost 1.1 percent and Pennsylvania REIT (N:PEI) was down 0.5 percent.

The amount is less than an $8 million gain Vornado had previously said it expected to report on its third-quarter financial statement. A financial statement gain of $134 million was as expected, Vornado said in a regulatory filing.
Vornado reported in August it had completed the sale of its 49.5 percent stake in the office portion of 666 Fifth Avenue, a flagship holding once overseen by Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka.
Vornado at the time reported net proceeds from the sale were about $120 million and that the existing mortgage loan was repaid.
Canada's Brookfield Asset Management said at the time that it had acquired a 99-year lease-hold on the tower.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 05:31PM ET</span>",U.S. trial begins for London forex traders accused of rigging prices,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Wednesday urged jurors in Manhattan federal court to find three former London-based currency traders guilty of scheming to rig prices, kicking off the latest trial to emerge from a U.S. probe into the multitrillion-dollar foreign exchange market.
Lawyers for Chris Ashton, Rohan Ramchandani and Richard Usher, who worked at  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), respectively, countered that while the three had exchanged information, nothing they did was illegal.
U.S. prosecutors announced the charges in January 2017, and the three came to the United States to face them voluntarily.
In his opening statement on Wednesday, prosecutor Jeffrey Martino, of the U.S. Department of Justice, said they used a chatroom they dubbed ""the cartel"" to coordinate euro-U.S. dollar transactions in order to maximize their profits.
""They worked together to stack the deck,"" he said, harming other participants in the market, including in the United States.
Martino said jurors would see the defendants' chats and hear their calls. He also said they would get a first-hand account of the scheme from another participant, former Barclays and UBS AG trader Matthew Gardiner, who is expected to testify under an agreement with prosecutors.
Ramchandani's lawyer, Heather Tewksbury, said Gardiner was testifying to avoid being prosecuted himself. She said the prosecutors' case relied on ""cherry-picked"" chats and that the ""cartel"" moniker was a joke.
Ashton's lawyer, Lisa Manning, similarly said that the chat room went by ""dozens of silly names."" Usher's lawyer, Michael Kendall, said chats like the one at issue were commonplace.
""A typical trader might have dozens of chats,"" he said.
All three said it was not illegal for traders to share information, and that their transactions were not coordinated as part of any scheme to fix prices.
The case followed worldwide investigations that resulted in about $10 billion in fines for several large banks, and the firing of dozens of traders.
Several others have been charged in the U.S. probe, including Mark Johnson, a former head of foreign exchange cash trading at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) who was sentenced to two years in prison in April after being found guilty by a jury, and former Barclays trader Jason Katz, who pleaded guilty and faces sentencing next year.

Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan,  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) all entered related guilty pleas, and were collectively fined more than $2.8 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow marking their biggest daily declines since Feb. 8, and technology stocks were at the center of the carnage as rising U.S. Treasury yields sent investors fleeing from risky assets.
U.S. long-dated Treasury yields rose again in extension of a trend over the last few weeks fueled by solid U.S. economic data that reinforced expectations of multiple interest rate hikes over the next 12 months. 
Investors also worried about the impact of trade tensions on corporate profits and Hurricane Michael's landfall in Florida adding to the uncertainty. 
The Nasdaq registered its biggest daily drop since June 24, 2016, hurt by technology stocks which had their biggest one-day drop since August 2011. The S&P 500 ended the day down 3.3 percent, representing a 4.95 percent drop from its Sept. 20 record closing high. 
""It's a bit of a blood bath today, clear risk-off action with few places to hide. Gold is up a little bit. The Vix is up more substantially,"" said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU). 
""It's primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies,"" he said. ""We saw stocks hanging in there pretty good as interest rates were moving and now they're starting to crack. Markets are starting to contemplate that this could be a Fed that's over-zealous in terms of interest rate hikes.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 831.83 points, or 3.15 percent, to 25,598.74, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 94.66 points, or 3.29 percent, to 2,785.68 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 315.97 points, or 4.08 percent, to 7,422.05.
All three indexes had hit records between Aug. 30 and Oct. 3. The Russell 2000 small-cap index closed down 2.9 percent. 
Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York, said the market could potentially sell off as much as 10 percent from its records before advancing again.
""The market is digesting the potential that rates moving upwards eventually seep into the real economy in the form of mortgage rates, auto rates, student lending rates,"" Mahajan said. ""What we're seeing here is the market positioning for potential lower growth.""
But assuming economic growth stays intact, ""this could be an interesting buying opportunity,"" according to Mahajan, who said equity markets tend to perform well in the six months after U.S. midterm elections. 
The S&P technology sector (SPLRCT) dropped 4.8 percent, with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) creating the biggest drag with a 4.6 percent decline. 
The communications services, (SPLRCL), consumer discretionary (SPLRCD), energy (SPNY) and industrial (SPLRCI) sectors all showed declines of more than 3 percent. 
The energy sector was one of the biggest losers for much of the day as U.S. oil production was decimated while the industry waited out Hurricane Michael.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" rose 7 points, or nearly 44 percent, to 22.96, going above 20 for the first time since April 11 and hitting its highest close since April 2.
The best performer in the sea of red was the defensive utilities sector (SPLRCU), which closed down 0.5 percent.
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York said risk parity funds could have made the sell-off more pronounced.
“Risk parity has influence in any market by accentuating the change in asset class exposure,” said Ghriskey.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 7.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 7.05-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 47 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 12 new highs and 227 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 9.86 billion shares changed hands compared with the 7.42 billion average for the last 20 trading sessions.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Column: 'Restricted application' can boost Social Security benefits,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits is one of the most popular financial strategies for retirement, but it can put couples that retire in their 60s in a bind if they then must wait years for monthly benefit checks to start.
Consequently, financial planners recommend that couples who qualify should use the hybrid strategy of a ""restricted application.""
This is where a spouse files for their own benefits, and then the other spouse files a ""restricted application"" at age 66 to get spousal benefits while delaying their own filing until 70 to maximize benefits.
Waiting those four years boosts the individual's benefits by 32 percent. Meanwhile, there are still two checks coming into the household.
The optimum approach varies based on the couple's ages, longevity and past income, but starting Social Security at age 62 can be a setback for some because benefits are 25 percent lower than those at the full retirement age of 66 (for those born between 1943 and 1954).
An estimated 13 million people may qualify, some generating as much as $67,000 in extra income, according to Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor who developed MaximizeMySocialSecurity, software that identifies a wide range of Social Security enhancing strategies.
But time is running out on this approach, because the government changed the rules a few years ago to limit the restricted applications to people currently over the age of 64 and nine months. 
The strategy typically works best when the person who had the lowest income throughout their career files first to start taking their own Social Security, noted William Reichenstein, principal of Security Solutions and a finance professor at Baylor University.
When the other member of the couple files for spousal benefits, they get a check for half of the other's benefit. 
Financial planner Mike Giefer recently did the math for one of his clients in Minneapolis. A doctor and nurse couple, both 66, decided that when the nurse turned 66 this past April, she would retire so she could be with their grandchildren and spend time as a volunteer.
Giefer suggested she start taking benefits immediately because she had reached the full retirement age, which would give her $22,000 for a full year of benefits. The doctor would then file for Social Security benefits as the spouse of the nurse, which would amount to another $11,000. 
If he applied for his own benefits at 66, he would have received about $35,000 for a full year. But if he waits four years, he will get $47,000 instead. Meanwhile the couple would receive more than $132,000 in that time period. If they both live to age 95, the strategy will give them $215,000 more than if they had both retired at age 66 and claimed Social Security.
""Nine out of 10 people are not aware they can do this,"" said Giefer. 
The restricted application strategy also applies to divorced couples, though rules apply.
If you are divorced, you can qualify to get benefits based on your ex-spouse's work history as long as you were married at least 10 years, your ex is entitled to Social Security and you are at least 62 and unmarried.
You can get help directly from the Social Security Administration on when to claim benefits (https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/1960.html). 
But Elaine Floyd, director of retirement and life planning for Horsesmouth, a service that trains financial planners on Social Security claiming strategies, said SSA staff might not be versed on all the intricacies of figuring out the best claiming strategies. 
She also suggested that people applying for ""restricted applications"" do so online.
Individuals trying to calculate their best Social Security options can also find help with spousal benefits at Open Social Security (https://opensocialsecurity.com/) and Financial Engines (https://financialengines.com/education-center/social-security-planner/).

For a fee, people can find elaborate Social Security benefit-maximizing strategies through companies such as MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com and SocialSecuritySolutions.com.

1243,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Will U.S. Weakness Hit Global Markets?
Individual stocks and economic indicators will take a back seat as investors try to regain a sense of stability after the beating the market took today.
Just last week the Nasdaq was around 8,000. It closed around 7,422 today.
And it’s going to take a lot of assessing as there’s no good single explanation for why the rout continues.
Rallying Treasury yields have been the go-to excuse, but the 10-year yield was lower at the close of the stock market after post-auction supply hit the market.
Trade is another reason that’s been trotted out consistently, but there’s little new on that front. If anything, the aversion of the complete dismantling of NAFTA was a positive.
Tech’s weakness is reminiscent of previous fourth-quarter pre-earnings jitters, but valuations have been lofty for a while.
Early birds will want to look at the Asian and European markets for signs of contagion. If they can hold off the kind of carnage Wall Street saw, with some sectors, especially tech, showing some resilience, that will be a good sign of U.S. futures.
2. Walgreen’s, Delta Set to Report
Dow component Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) reports earnings before the bell tomorrow.
The drugstore chain is expected to report a profit of $1.45 per share on sales of about $34 billion.
Shares of Walgreen’s have been climbing steadily since hitting a 52-week low in June that was reached in part by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announcing its intentions to acquire online pharmacy PillPak.
The chain is benefiting from its recent acquisition of Rite Aid stores. That deal helped fuel growth in back-of-store sales at the prescription counter, which account for more than 70% of Walgreens' U.S. drugstore sales. Investors will be especially keen to see an improvement in same-store sales, which had actually declined in the previous quarter.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will also weigh in with its latest results.
Wall Street forecasts that the carrier earned $1.75 per share, with revenue of about $12 billion.
In the last three months Delta stock is little changed, about in the middle of the performance of the U.S. carriers. Airlines stocks were hit today in the broad market selloff.
3. CPI Rise of 0.2% Expected
Retail inflation numbers arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) tomorrow on the heels of today’s data on wholesale prices.
The producer price index (PPI) came in just about as expected. The market’s focus continues to be on rates and yields, so the core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes food and energy prices, will be of particular interest.
The core CPI is expected to have risen 0.2% in September, up 2.3% year on year.
The overall CPI is also forecast to have risen 0.2% last month, with a year-on-year rise of 2.4%."

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>",Third Point tells Campbell Soup not to hire new CEO before meeting,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Richa Naidu
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Third Point LLC warned  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) board on Wednesday against picking a new chief executive before next month's annual meeting, where the hedge fund wants to oust all current directors.
Campbell reiterated last week that it is searching for a full-time replacement for former Chief Executive Denise Morrison, who left abruptly in May, and said on Wednesday that it expects to complete its search by year end.
Third Point said in a letter sent to Campbell's board seen by Reuters that it is not appropriate to search for a new chief executive during a proxy contest when shareholders will be asked to vote on a new board at the meeting on Nov. 29.
""We think it is entirely uncontroversial to insist that the next permanent CEO be selected by the newly elected Board,"" Third Point wrote. Third Point asked Campbell to defer any decision about a new CEO until after the upcoming annual meeting.
Campbell responded by saying that it will pick its next chief when it finds the best candidate. ""It has always been the board's intention to select the company's next CEO upon finding the best candidate, which we expect to do by the end of the calendar year,"" the company said in a statement. Search firms have helped the company review candidates for months.
CNBC first reported that Third Point wrote to the board.
The New York-based hedge fund is stepping up pressure on Campbell as it tries to line up support from other shareholders for its slate of 12 directors. Third Point, which owns nearly 7 percent of the company, has criticized the board for making poor decisions that pushed the stock price lower over years.
Campbell's stock traded at $32.22 on Wednesday, off 17.56 percent since the start of the year.
Campbell has said its board, including several heirs of the man who ran the company a century ago, is best placed to pursue the best strategies for the company and shareholders. 
Reuters reported last month that Campbell is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender.
With the annual meeting approaching, Third Point said Campbell would have a tough time recruiting top external candidates who might not serve a long time if new members join the board.

Third Point has previously criticized the company for failing to have a plan in place for when a CEO leaves.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Law firm Slater & Gordon Ltd has filed a class-action suit against Commonwealth Bank of Australia seeking damages of more than A$100 million ($71 million) after the bank allegedly invested the retirement savings of thousands of customers into low, uncompetitive interest-returning products.
The lawsuit is the seventh against a major financial firm stemming from the Royal Commission misconduct inquiry, that released a scathing interim report into its findings last month.
Slater & Gordon lawyers filed the action in the Federal Court on Tuesday night, the company said in an emailed statement.
The firm had previously flagged it would launch a series of class actions against the country's largest banks and wealth manager AMP Ltd for giving customers ""ludicrously low"" or negative returns without justification.
The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) said in a statement that it will vigorously defend the proceedings.
The suit will allege CBA's pension arm, Colonial First State, invested the retirement savings of its members with CBA where it received uncompetitive bank interest rates.
Slater and Gordon head of class actions Ben Hardwick said Colonial was obligated to act in the best interests of its members, not its parent company, by finding the best products for them. 
""This class action will allege Colonial First State placed the interests of its members beneath the interests of the Commonwealth Bank.""
Australia's financial institutions are being forced to put aside substantial sums of money to fight lawsuits, settle customer complaints, and prepare for regulatory changes expected to flow out of the Royal Commission, which will deliver its final report in February.
Australia's top financial firms have had nearly A$40 billion wiped off their collective market value this year, as the inquiry unearthed systemic malpractice including alleged fraud, bribery, regulator deception, fee gouging and illegal telephone marketing.
During public hearings, CBA admitted it sold insurance to tens of thousands of customers who were not eligible to claim against it, charged customers for services-not-rendered, took fees out of dead client accounts and double-charged interest to thousands of customers due to a coding error.[KCN1MI2A4]
Revelations out of the inquiry earlier this year triggered five shareholder class actions against the country's largest listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd, for allegedly failing to disclose governance problems. 
Lawyers have also sued National Australia Bank and its pension unit on behalf of customers who were allegedly sold worthless insurance policies for their credit cards.

Christian Ramirez, coordinator-general of the public administration ministry (SFP), told Reuters on Tuesday that he expected Mexico's tax authority to seize the $30 million ""in the coming months.""
Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] has spent the past few years at the center of one of the largest corruption scandals in Latin America, and has admitted paying bribes from Peru to Panama.
In Mexico, the SFP imposed fines worth some $56.8 million in total on two Odebrecht subsidiaries in April. Since the end of 2017, it has punished several Odebrecht businesses in Mexico, barring them from signing contracts with public bodies for up to four years.
Mexico's government did not detail the reasons for the fines, but officials said they related to probes into suspected corruption between Odebrecht and Pemex [PEMX.UL].
Ramirez on Tuesday said the Brazilian firm had ""practically left"" Mexico and that tax officials who recently visited an Odebrecht subsidiary only found ""two computers and a desk.""
Neither Odebrecht in Mexico nor in Brazil responded to requests for comment. In April, the company said it planned to fight the fines.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian regulatory group said on Wednesday that it had found that the level and quality of disclosure by cannabis companies was insufficient.
The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), which conducted a review of disclosure practices of 70 Canadian and U.S. cannabis producers, said some companies were inconsistent in complying with Canadian securities requirements on issues such as providing forward-looking information and giving guidance for balanced disclosure.
""Licensed cannabis producers often did not provide sufficient information in their financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for an investor to understand their financial performance,"" the CSA said in a report posted on the websites of provincial securities regulators.
The move comes ahead of next week's expected legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada. Cannabis stocks have been on a tear over the past year in anticipation of strong demand following legalization.
""Issuers in the industry in a very short time period have graduated from being on the fringe to having multi-billion dollar market caps,"" said James Munro, co-chair of the cannabis practice at law firm McMillan.
""The CSA is reconciling the size of the industry with the type of meaningful disclosure that is required of such companies.""
The review appears to have already had an impact on cannabis companies. 
The CSA, an umbrella group representing provincial securities regulators, singled out companies with U.S. cannabis operations for improving disclosures, while saying that overall licensed producers took steps to improve disclosure. 
As a result of the review, 74 percent of issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities took action to beef up disclosure and 17 percent refiled their most recent MD&A documents. 

CSA did not name any producers in its review.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 03:07PM ET</span>",Graphic: Rising U.S. bond yields bring back Wall Street's sinking feeling,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For stock investors, the recent spike in bond yields may be prompting some uncomfortable deja vu.
Back in late January and early February, there was a 10 percent correction in the S&P 500 (SPX), with stock investors spooked as Treasury yield increases intensified with a monthly payrolls report showing the biggest wage gains for workers since 2009.
This time around, strong economic data worried bond investors, who sent the benchmark yield on Tuesday to 3.261 percent, the highest since early May 2011.
“A sustained rise in rates is probably reflective of improving economic conditions, so that in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing for stocks,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. ""Where it does get tricky for stocks is how fast they are rising. That’s where you get a similarity to what happened in January.”
The S&P was down nearly 4 percent in less than five sessions as of Wednesday afternoon. Still, that decline is from all-time high levels, so the market has not been knocked too far off.
Higher bond rates can weigh on stocks as they provide more competition for yield-hungry investors. They can also inhibit corporate borrowing. 
(Graphic: SPX vs 10-yr yields in 2018 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OfgQwI)
Historically, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), rising bond yields have not posed major issues for stocks as long as their ascent has been gradual.
For example, a yield rise in a month of one standard deviation or less, which would be 20 basis points currently, is manageable for stocks, Goldman said in a note last week.
But historically, a monthly move of one to two deviations, or 20 to 40 basis points now, would result in flat S&P 500 returns. A move of more than two deviations, or 40 basis points currently, leads to negative S&P 500 returns, Goldman says.
Since Sept 10, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is up about 28 basis points, including a big spike last week. In the month before the S&P 500's correction in February, the 10-year yield rose 31 basis points, to 2.77 percent, making it an even bigger relative move since the yield at the time was at a lower starting point. 
""The speed of changes in bond yields often matters more for equities than the level,"" Goldman Sachs strategists said in a note.
In only seven trading sessions this month, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) have climbed about 18 basis points and crested over 3.20 percent, hitting their highest levels in more than seven years. 
""The stock market in the U.S. has started to take notice, and will continue to, particularly if the speed at which rates rise becomes alarming,"" Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, told Reuters last week.

(Graphic: Bond sensitive sectors in 2018 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ypxMpO)
Other yield rises in the past decade have been faster and larger than the current one, including in 2009, 2010, 2013, 2015, 2016, and early 2018, according to Brian Reynolds, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. 
""The indications we look at lead us to conclude this is likely to be yet another brief pullback in the context of a 9.5-year bull market with another 3-5 years left to go,"" Reynolds said in a note.
In further evidence that stocks can rally despite rising Treasury yields, LPL Research found that in all 12 periods of rising 10-year yields since 1996, the S&P 500 ended the period higher than it began, according to senior market strategist Ryan Detrick.

One concern is that stock and bond prices appear to be increasingly moving together, based on short-term correlations. Such moves are worrisome for investors, who could face sharp shifts in their portfolios if asset prices move in sync.
“It’s quite a challenge for stocks when there is no natural shock absorber from bonds,” said Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research.
(Graphic: S&P 500 and bond fund correlation - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OiOqSK)
Compared to the start of this year, one aspect of current market conditions may be concerning. 
Bets on market calm, measured by the number of contracts shorting futures for the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) compared to long contracts, are at a higher level than before the market correction, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
That is a potential sign of investor complacency.

With stock markets in freefall on concerns about global growth and rising rates, investors sought out retailers that generate the bulk of their revenues from the United States, to weather the turbulent period.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) rose more about 2%, despite analysts' recent warning that U.S. tariffs on China would increase input costs for the retailer. Dollar Tree imports about 42% of its products, mostly from China, according to the Telsey Advisory Group, a research and consulting firm.
Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) rose 2% and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) edged up 0.3%.
On the flip side, industrials were one of the biggest losers on the day. Concerns over growth comes as the IMF lowered its global economic growth forecasts and warned that trade wars and rising import tariffs would weigh on commerce.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell more than 2% as JPMorgan warned that the company's 737 production issues were raising the risk of weak third-quarter results, which are slated for Oct. 24.
""We are still not forecasting upside to cash flow guidance due to the cost of 737 delays and the Tanker,"" JPMorgan said.

A quick survey by Bloomberg News of 10 sell-side and buy-side traders saw a ""little uptick in hedging activity"" on Tuesday and early on Wednesday. However, others are seeing investors step in to add to positions, while a majority of sell tickets are being driven by passive funds off program desks.
Oppenheimer Head of Institutional Equity Derivatives Alon Rosin said in an email to Bloomberg “over the past two weeks, we have been aggressively looking to add November ETF downside trades and long volatility exposures into November as companies like BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and Delphi Technologies issued profit warnings citing global concerns such as trade, softness in China and FX.”
Rosin continued ""Many are pointing to overall confusion, gross exposure reductions (selling longs/covering shorts), risk parity/factor related unwinds, etc. driving the overall selling pressure"". He added, ""ETF options volumes have been relatively light since Friday’s initial breakdown and we would like to see that pick up and more activity in the puts before any true stabilization kicks in for a trade-able bottom.""
Larry Weiss, head of trading for Instinet LLC in New York, said by phone ""I don’t think anyone senses any panic at this point. Given the levels we are currently at, a lot of people think that something like this and even more downside are slightly overdue.""
Most attributed today’s weakness across consumer goods stocks to comments from LVMH’s Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, who said on a call with analysts that Chinese customs authorities are stepping up border checks on returning travelers, reinforcing concerns over the U.S., China trade war.

1279,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Tesla Is Closing In on $145 Million Plot for China Factory,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is in the process of procuring land in Shanghai for its first factory outside of the U.S., according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, pushing ahead with plans to set up production in China after months of tumult involving CEO Elon Musk.
The carmaker is the sole bidder for a plot of land with an auction price of about 1 billion yuan ($145 million), the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. A decision by the Shanghai government to allocate the land to Tesla could be made as soon as this month, they said.
In July, Tesla reached a preliminary agreement with Shanghai authorities to build a factory that the electric-car pioneer has said will eventually produce 500,000 battery-powered vehicles annually, more than what its lone U.S. assembly plant has made. Setting up manufacturing in China will enable the Palo Alto, California-based company to avoid paying import duties as high as 40 percent and offer cheaper cars in the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles.
The Shanghai government didn’t respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Representatives for Tesla also didn’t immediately comment. The company has said the China factory will augment existing production and that its U.S. manufacturing operations won’t be affected.
The progress on its China plans is a bright spot of news for Tesla, which has been pummeled in the stock market the past few months after Musk’s funding-secured tweeting scandal and the resulting fallout with U.S. regulators.
The carmaker is considering raising some of the $5 billion it intends to invest in the plant near Shanghai from local partners, Bloomberg News reported on Aug. 1, citing a person familiar with the plans. Musk told analysts on an earnings call later that day that he expected it would take about $2 billion worth of investment for the factory to be able to produce around 250,000 vehicles a year.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) won U.S. antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET), the Justice Department said on Wednesday, paving the way for a combination with potential to cut U.S. healthcare costs for consumers.
The companies have said they will save administrative and patient care costs when they combine, in part by steering Aetna customers to walk-in clinics in CVS stores for less expensive medical services. CVS could offer more preventive care services and screenings in its clinics, such as enabling patients with diabetes to monitor blood sugar levels, avoiding higher cost visits to doctors or emergency rooms.
CVS aims to cut costs by $750 million annually by the end of the second year after the deal closes. 
It is the second large recent healthcare deal to win U.S. Justice Department approval. The agency gave the green light to health insurer Cigna Corp's (N:CI) $52 billion acquisition of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX), on Sept. 17.
Shares of CVS and Aetna each rose about 1 percent on Wednesday, a day when the broader market was sharply lower, with CVS trading at $80.20 and Aetna at $206.48.
The deal was approved on the condition that the companies sell Aetna's standalone Medicare prescription drug plan business, known as Medicare Part D, the Justice department said. 
Aetna last month said it would sell all of those standalone plans for prescription drugs that are part of the Medicare program for Americans aged 65 and older and the disabled to WellCare Health Plans Inc (N:WCG), paving the way for the deal's approval. 
Without the sale the two companies would have owned more than a 30 percent share of those standalone Medicare drug plans, creating concern about the amount of control the new CVS would have had over this part of the Medicare insurance market. Drugs administered by doctors and hospitals are covered under a separate Medicare benefit.
Together Aetna and CVS have 6.8 million members in standalone Medicare drug plans, the Justice Department said. CVS also has a large PBM business.
""The divestitures required here allow for the creation of an integrated pharmacy and health benefits company that has the potential to generate benefits by improving the quality and lowering the costs of the healthcare services that American consumers can obtain,"" Makan Delrahim, head of the department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement.
ON TRACK TO CLOSE THIS YEAR
California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington also joined the antitrust review.
""We know that over consolidation is bad for healthcare and leaves millions of Californians with fewer options. We will keep close watch to ensure that the terms of this settlement are met,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.
CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement that the deal is on track to close early in the fourth quarter. CVS first announced plans to buy Aetna last December.
Since then, online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) stepped into the healthcare market with the purchase of online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it expand further in healthcare and undercut major players across the prescription drugs supply chain.
Amazon has also aligned itself with  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc  to experiment with new models for employee healthcare - one of Aetna's target markets for health insurance.
The decision comes as the Trump administration intensifies pressure on healthcare industry ""middlemen,"" such as PBMs, over practices it says increase the cost of prescription medicines for U.S. consumers.
After the deals were announced, antitrust experts described them as ""vertical"" combinations that were less troublesome from a competitive standpoint than a previous round of proposed consolidation deals among insurers, which were blocked.

The Justice Department sued and won its case to stop Aetna's $37 billion plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM). It also blocked a combination of health insurers Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) and Cigna.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equities fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday, sliding to three-month lows, as technology shares slumped on fears of slowing demand, while rising U.S. bond yields made stocks less compelling.
On Wall Street, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 3.07 percent after Swiss vacuum valve maker VAT Group said demand was softening from chip equipment makers.
Among the tech sector's worst performers in Europe were Austrian chipmaker AMS fell 6.6 percent and STMicroelectronics was down 5.6 percent.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes fell 3/32 in price to push their yield up to 3.2196 percent. But the yield on shorter-term 2-year and 3-year notes was just under or hovered at 3 percent, respectively, providing long-absent competition for equities.
The rise in U.S. Treasury yields has been bolstered by solid U.S. economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. 
The fiscal and monetary policy signals for higher rates have been unambiguous, said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund in New York.
""Investors missing this rate move is tantamount to letting yourself get run over by a glacier,"" Terwilliger said.
Traditionally stocks and bonds have been in a tug of war for capital and for the last 10 years bonds have pulling on that rope with one arm tied behind their back, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.
""Short-term bonds are getting to be a compelling place to hang out,"" he said. ""This orphan status that equity markets have enjoyed for the last 10 years is disappearing and finally get some competition from the bond market.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 400.44 points, or 1.52 percent, to 26,030.13. The S&P 500 lost 43.98 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,836.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 169.06 points, or 2.18 percent, to 7,568.96.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.15 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.43 percent.
The euro and sterling rose, underpinned by optimism for a Brexit deal, while the dollar lost ground against a basket of currencies even as U.S. yields posted fresh multi-year peaks.
European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier signaled progress on a deal with the UK over its withdrawal from the bloc.
""There is more optimism that they will find some agreement between Britain and the European Union before Brexit,"" said Steve Englander, global head of G10 FX research at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in New York.
The dollar index fell 0.24 percent, with the euro up 0.35 percent at $1.1529. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback at 112.67.
Oil prices eased after the IMF lowered its global economic growth forecasts, but markets were supported as Hurricane Michael closed nearly 40 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output and U.S. sanctions restricted Iranian exports. 
U.S. crude was down 1.99 percent at $73.47 per barrel and Brent was last at $83.64, down 1.6 percent.

Scott Keogh, currently head of Audi of America, will become president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America as well as head of the Volkswagen brand for the North American region effective Nov. 1, the company said.
Keogh, 49, will succeed Hinrich Woebcken, who will remain with the company as an adviser. 
""Scott Keogh, who led Audi to excellence in the U.S., will build upon the momentum and implement the next stage in the growth strategy as we continue to develop Volkswagen into a more relevant player in North America,"" Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said in a statement.
Woebcken, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive who ran global purchasing among other jobs, was named in January 2016 as head of VW's North American region, after the automaker admitted to using secret software to evade diesel emissions standards. 
In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buy backs will continue through the end of 2019.
Volkswagen's U.S. sales through September this year were up 5.5 percent to 266,228 vehicles, but it is still struggling to shift gears away from slow-selling cars to SUVs. 
Sales of the company's brand new Jetta sedan are down 33 percent this year, while sales of the Passat and Golf cars are also down 34 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Two new sport utility vehicles – the Atlas and Tiguan – now account for more than 40 percent of all U.S. sales. 
Keogh will be succeeded at Audi, effective on Dec. 1, by Mark Del Rosso, who is currently president and CEO of Bentley Motors and previously was chief operating officer of Audi of America, the company said. Del Rosso's replacement at Bentley will be named later. 
Keogh joined Audi as chief marketing officer in 2006 and was promoted to president in 2012, helping the brand double sales in the region from 2010 to 2015, the company said.

Del Rosso, 54, joined Audi of America as COO in 2008 from Toyota Motor Corp. (T:7203)

PARIS (Reuters) -  Casino 's (PA:CASP) upmarket Monoprix supermarket chain said the start of its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime's (O:AMZ) delivery service for Paris had been better than expected - an alliance that could prove crucial for debt-ridden Casino's fortunes.
Monoprix Chief Executive Regis Schultz told Reuters that orders had been beating expectations, and that he hoped the delivery service could be extended elsewhere in France, although the decision was in the hands of e-commerce giant Amazon.
Nearly a month after the launch, the number of orders was exceeding by 2-3 times the expectations of the two partners, he said.
""A first assessment is very, very satisfactory. Our priority is now to expand the service,"" said Schultz.
Monoprix, which is seen by analysts as being similar to U.S. retailer Whole Foods, started filling orders for subscribers to Amazon's Prime loyalty program in parts of Paris on Sept. 12 through a two-hour delivery partnership.
The performance of the alliance is being closely watched since Monoprix was the first French retailer to agree in March to sell its products via Amazon, causing a stir in the fiercely competitive domestic French market.
Monoprix, one of Casino's most valuable assets, is also under scrutiny as parent Casino faces concerns over its debts and has been selling assets to cut debt.
The Amazon Prime service currently covers a third of the French capital, generating sales of 10 million-20 million euros ($11.5 million to $23 million), equivalent to the food sales of a Monoprix store. It should cover the whole of Paris next year.
Asked if there were plans to expand elsewhere in France, Schultz replied: ""We are ready to follow Amazon's deployment in all big French cities. They are likely to make the announcement when they are ready. It's part of their plans for sure.""
Asked if the partnership paved the way to other deals with Amazon, he added: ""Today this is not the spirit of our agreements.""
The U.S. e-commerce giant, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its ambitions to expand in food retail.
OTHERS TARGET PARIS MARKET
Amazon's purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (L:MRW), have led to speculation it could target the European food and supermarket sector next.
Amazon Prime currently offers 6,000 new products chosen by Monoprix. The products are prepared in one Monoprix store and delivered by Amazon. Delivery is free for orders over 60 euros. For those under 60 euros, a 3.90 euros fee is charged.
Monoprix had 2017 sales of 5 billion euros and a margin estimated by some analysts at 5-6 percent. A key contributor to parent Casino's overall profit, it makes over 30 percent of its sales in the lucrative Paris market.
Schultz said the deal with Amazon gave Monoprix access to the 70 to 80 percent of Amazon Prime clients who were not already Monoprix clients, including many offices.
""We clearly are getting new clients from Prime. There are no elements showing a cannibalisation of Monoprix or Monoprix.fr.""
However, competition in the sector is looming in Paris.
Leclerc, France's largest grocer by market share and which has built its reputation on low prices, also has its sights on Paris, giving itself three years to establish a solid foothold in the capital.
Rival  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which has 250 convenience stores in Paris, has launched six pickup points in the capital, where customers can order 15,000 products online and collect them in store.
Shares in Casino - which has also been linked with Carrefour - are down nearly 30 percent this year.
Worries over its debts and the competition it faces in France have led some analysts to speculate that Casino may have to sell Monoprix, but Schultz played this down.
""This is mere speculation. This is not what I focus on.""

1343,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",SoftBank is in talks to invest $15B to $20B in WeWork for a majority stake,"SoftBank is in discussions about investing $15 billion to $20 billion in WeWork, giving it a majority stake in the coworking-space company, according to a  Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday.
The deal — a massive investment in a private company even by the dizzying standards of Silicon Valley — would effectively give Japan's SoftBank control of the fast-growing office-sharing company.
And it would cement the SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son's position as the dominant power in the modern tech economy, with everything from the semiconductors that power smartphones to telecommunications networks in his empire.
The discussions to invest in WeWork are ongoing, and a deal is not guaranteed, according to the Journal report, which cited anonymous sources. Representatives of SoftBank and WeWork did not immediately return Business Insider's requests for comment.
It's not clear what valuation SoftBank would give WeWork in the majority-stake deal.  Business Insider reported in June that Rajeev Misra, the chief executive of SoftBank's Vision Fund, told a conference that WeWork was seeking to raise new funds at a valuation of $35 billion, up sharply from its 2016 valuation of $20 billion. He did not say whether SoftBank was participating in the round.
WeWork, which was founded eight years ago, has attracted billions in capital to fund its business fitting up and leasing out building space as shared offices. The company has expanded to 22 countries and is on track to generate more than $2 billion in revenue this year.
But the company's rapid expansion and  multiple diverse acquisitions mean it's burning money. Skeptics worry that WeWork's core proposition of taking on long leases, doing up office spaces, and then subleasing them doesn't justify its huge valuation.
The company lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the first six months of the year, according to media reports, and its losses in the UK nearly tripled,  according to recent filings seen by Business Insider. That said, WeWork's European flagship building in London turned a profit in 2017, a vindication of what the company claims is a viable business model.
SoftBank's investment would most likely be through its $92 billion Vision Fund, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi wealth funds as well as SoftBank's own capital, The Journal reported. The technology-focused Vision Fund already made a  $4.4 billion investment in WeWork last August, giving it a 20% ownership stake in the company.
SoftBank's largest investment to date in a venture-backed startup was $7.7 billion for 15% ownership in Uber, according to The Journal.

The struggling retailer is bringing in M-III Partners to put together a bankruptcy filing that could land as early as this week, The Journal reported citing people familiar with the plans.

While U.S. small-cap and midcap equities have historically underperformed large caps during recession-linked downturns, the gap pales in comparison with smaller stocks’ superior returns over a full economic cycle, according to a note from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists led by Eduardo Lecubarri. They say an economic contraction isn’t imminent, but are encouraging investors to limit risk in case one comes sooner than expected.
During the past five recessions, the Russell 2000’s average loss from peak to trough is 39.2 percent, compared with 34 percent for the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan’s calculations.
However, their performance in the 12 months before the peak and the 12 months after the trough far exceeds that of the big companies. The Russell 2000 beats the S&P 500’s by 18.2 percentage points prior to the apex, and 30.4 percentage points after the nadir.
“Avoiding SMid in hopes of timing a recession is a money-losing strategy,” the strategists wrote. “It is around recessions that one cannot afford to be out of SMid.”"

Snap said the episodes will be fast-paced for mobile viewing and as short as five minutes long, with each show having a profile page where viewers can easily find each episode. 
That could address criticism from users and advertisers that Snapchat's recent app redesigns have made it confusing to use.
The episodes, like Snapchat's existing shows, will include six-seconds of advertising that are unskippable.
Last week, a leaked memo from Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel laid out goals to reach full-year profitability in 2019 by attracting more older users and redesigning its Android app to better serve emerging markets.
Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said in a note on Tuesday that Snap was falling ""woefully short"" of its goal to be profitable, estimating the company will lose more than $1.5 billion next year.
Snap shares declined almost 3.0 percent on Tuesday after Nathanson's note. 

The company has also seen high turnover among its executives, and said in September its Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan would step down.

1357,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Gives Up on Flattening Yield Curve Too Soon,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Matthew Hornbach, global head of interest-rate strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), has never been afraid of making bold calls in the $15.3 trillion U.S. Treasury market. Even if they sometimes don’t pan out.
In July 2016, when the 10-year Treasury yield reached an unprecedented low of 1.32 percent, he pushed the envelope, declaring “the year of the bull for rates markets” would push the global benchmark to 1 percent. That didn’t happen. In what the bank’s chief cross-asset strategist deemed Morgan Stanley’s “most controversial call, by a country mile,” Hornbach projected in late 2017 that 30-year yields would fall to a record low 2 percent by the end of this year. That hasn’t happened, either: The 30-year bond just topped 3.4 percent for the first time since 2014. 
But even amid these too-bullish calls on longer-term Treasuries, the crucial prediction that Hornbach held on to was a wager that the U.S. yield curve would flatten toward zero. And that turned out to be not just the right call, but the story of 2017 — and much of 2018 — for the world’s biggest bond market. The spread between two- and 10-year notes narrowed to less than 20 basis points in August, from almost 140 basis points in December 2016. Investors and Federal Reserve officials alike were closely watching as it seemed destined for inversion, which historically has presaged a recession.
That trend reversed last week as 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields set new multiyear highs. The curve steepened by the most in eight months. Still, with a spread of just 30 to 35 basis points, it seemed more like a blip to strategists at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, BMO Capital Markets and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). Indeed, on Tuesday, the curve from two to 10 years flattened by 3 basis points, while the spread between five-year and 30-year Treasuries easily bounced off its 200-day moving average. 
But Morgan Stanley apparently saw enough last week to issue a “mea culpa.”
“We were wrong to expect Treasury yields to be capped at previous year-to-date highs,” Hornbach wrote in an Oct. 5 note. And while it may not be the right time to enter curve-steepening trades, he said he could no longer recommend curve flatteners, either.
It was a surprisingly abrupt change of heart, particularly because the increase in yields last week seemed largely driven by the market breaking through key technical levels. Strong U.S. economic data helped initiate the sell-off, but positioning and momentum exacerbated the move. As I wrote, bond bears couldn’t form a clear narrative. When you’re blaming the surge in interest rates mostly on a rising term premium, it’s basically acknowledging that yields are going up because it feels as if they should.
To be fair, that was a perfectly reasonable feeling. The 10-year yield was range-bound for months even though the Fed showed no signs of slowing its rate increases; equities nevertheless managed to set records.
But Treasuries appear to be settling into a new range rather than lurching higher. On Tuesday, U.S. yields fell, even though bonds across almost all other developed countries sold off. And that rally came in the face of a big slate of auctions. On Wednesday, the Treasury will sell $36 billion of three-year notes and $23 billion of 10-year debt. On Thursday, it will offer $15 billion of 30-year bonds.
Of course, it’s no sure thing that the sell-off will abate. Ira Jersey at Bloomberg Intelligence wrote this week that a sustained break of the 3.25 percent level could push 10-year Treasury yields toward a test of 3.6 percent.
But what looks more and more certain is that Fed officials will keep boosting interest rates until something strongly indicates they shouldn’t. And that means short-term yields will continue to grind higher. But don’t just take my word for it. Here’s what Hornbach has to say:
“If economic data continues surprising to the upside, we think investors will begin looking for FOMC participants to become even more hawkish into year-end. What would a more hawkish FOMC look like? … We think scope remains for higher 2019/2020 median dots which could come at the December FOMC meeting. If market participants price in a more aggressive rate path in 2019 and 2020, the yield curve will find it tough to trend steeper, in our view.”
That sounds like someone who, deep down, is not quite convinced that his previous stance was all that wrong after all. Long-term yields don’t have much more room to rise, while the market could very well price in a faster Fed? It’s the same argument, just with yields at higher absolute levels.
It’s simply too soon to call the end of the flattening trend. Sure, much of the “easy money” has been made on the trade over the past two years. It’s one thing for the curve to flatten toward inversion, but it’s another to actually see two-year notes trade at a higher yield than 10-year Treasuries. 
Morgan Stanley could turn out to be right that Treasury yields move in largely parallel fashion for the next few months. That’s a straightforward and respectable call. It’s just not what I expected after years of out-of-consensus forecasts.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>","U.S., European regulators investigating Google glitch","By Angela Moon and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - At least two U.S. states and two European Union member states are investigating a breach at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google that may have exposed private profile data of at least 500,000 users to hundreds of external developers.
The investigations follow Google's announcement on Monday that it would shut down the consumer version of its social network Google+ and tighten its data-sharing policies after a ""bug"" potentially exposed user data that included names, email addresses, occupations, genders and ages.
""We are aware of public reporting on this matter and are currently undertaking efforts to gain an understanding of the nature and cause of the intrusion, whether sensitive information was exposed, and what steps are being taken or called for to prevent similar intrusions in the future,"" Jaclyn Severance, a spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen, said.
The New York Attorney General's office also said it was looking into the breach.
Google said the issue was discovered and patched in March as part of a review of how Google shares data with other applications. No developer exploited the vulnerability or misused data, the company's review found.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Google opted not to disclose the security issue due to fears of regulatory scrutiny, citing unidentified sources and a memo prepared by Google's legal and policy staff for senior executives.
On Tuesday, Ireland's data protection regulator said it would seek more information from Google regarding the breach.
""The Data Protection Commission was not aware of this issue and we now need to better understand the details of the breach, including the nature, impact and risk to individuals and we will be seeking information on these issues from Google,"" it said.
In Germany, the data protection regulator in Hamburg, the city-state where Google has its country office, is also examining the incident. 
It was doing so because the incident occurred before a EU-wide data privacy law took effect in May, creating a ""one-stop shop"" oversight regime under which Ireland became the lead regulator for Google.
""We have sent a series of questions to Google,"" said spokesman Martin Schemm. The Hamburg regulator wants to find out to what extent German users of Google+ were affected, he added. Under Germany's old data protection law, Google would face a maximum fine of 300,000 euros ($345,000).
Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect on May 25, maximum fines run to 4 percent of a company's annual global turnover, meaning that penalties against the biggest Silicon Valley players could in theory run into billions of dollars.
Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

1361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Italy's Banks Stumble Into a New Crisis,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Spare a thought for Italian banks if you can. Barely recovered from their recent crisis, the country’s lenders find they have stumbled into a new one.
Rome’s populist administration has sent yields on government bonds soaring by passing a budget that busts the EU’s fiscal rules. And since Italian banks still hold hefty amounts of those bonds, investors have taken fright, dumping the lenders’ shares.
The country’s finance industry is better placed to weather a shock than it was a few years ago. But the consequences of prolonged turmoil shouldn’t be underestimated. Banks could restrict credit, which would weigh on the economy. And were one of the weakest lenders to get into serious trouble, the Italian government would face some unhappy choices. That could cause a widespread loss of confidence.
Following Italy’s long recession, its banks have been under severe pressure because of their big holdings of non-performing loans. Yet there has been an improvement. Bad loans made up 11.4 percent of the total loan book in the second quarter of 2018, down from 15.2 percent in the same period last year, according to Bank of Italy data. Some of the banks in worst shape, such as Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, have been shut down.
Investors had taken heart from what they’d seen. Between the liquidation of the two Veneto banks in June 2017 and mid-May this year, a sectoral index including Italian banks rose by more than 80 percent. But the formation of a populist coalition in May between the Five Star Movement and the League has halted the rally. The same index has lost more than 30 percent over the past five months.
Italian banks face some very strong headwinds, as the populist government has unveiled a long list of lavish promises and started putting some into practice. As lenders have significant exposure to Italian debt, they are highly sensitive to changes in the credibility of the Italian sovereign. An increase of 100 basis points in the sovereign spread between Italy’s bonds and Germany’s bunds, reduces the Common Equity Tier 1 capital of  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) SpA and UniCredit SpA, the country’s two largest banks, by 35 basis points, according to a note by Citi Research. For UBI Banca SpA and Banco BPM SpA, two mid-sized lenders, this is larger – standing at 56 and 66 basis points.
As the International Monetary Fund warned in its Global Financial Stability Report today, the reemergence of the sovereign risk-banking system nexus in Italy could be destabilizing.
Fortunately, under pressure from the European Central Bank, Italy’s banks have improved their capital position. The average CET1 ratio was 13.8 percent at the end of last year, compared to 7.1 percent in 2008, according to Bank of Italy data included in a study by Intesa. While the largest banks look in better shape, though, other smaller lenders are in a more perilous position.
Indeed, investors shouldn’t take too much comfort from capital strength, even for the biggest lenders. For a start, Italian banks are facing an increase in their funding costs because of the spike in bond yields. If prolonged, this could affect their ability to lend. Borrowing costs for families and businesses are still very low, but they started to rise in August. Should they increase further, it might hasten Italy’s incipient economic slowdown. A new recession would undermine the efforts of the banks to cut non-performing loans, and affect their profitability. 
Trouble at any bank would be tough to manage. The new Italian government opposes EU banking rules, which demand that shareholders and bondholders take a financial hit before a government can rescue a bank. Yet were an Italian bank to come under serious pressure, it could be difficult for Rome to avoid state intervention. Investors would be reluctant to provide fresh capital and foreign banks might have better things to do than save an Italian bank. As for fellow Italian lenders, they already chipped in during the last crisis. It would be hard for them to come to the rescue. This could leave the government with no choice but to negotiate a bailout with Brussels and Frankfurt – a very difficult task given Italy’s opposition to the rules.
Italian banks have themselves to blame for keeping so many of their government’s bonds on their balance sheets. But there’s plenty for which they have little responsibility, from the risk of recession to bust-ups with Brussels. Their hope – maybe a forlorn one – is that politicians see sense before it’s too late.

CEO Jamie Dimon once defined a financial crisis to his daughter. Queen Elizabeth II asked “why did nobody notice” the seeds of the last one.
Stung by their failure to spot the turmoil of 10 years ago and two decades since Asian markets were roiled, policymakers, traders and economists are looking at the clock as they wonder when and where the next meltdown will hit.
As it holds its annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia this week, the International Monetary Fund is already warning investors may be underestimating the risk of a financial shock.
One of the axioms of financial history though is that no two crises are the same so the search is on for potential triggers in the world economy and markets. A policy mistake by the Federal Reserve, such as raising rates too fast or for too long, could sideswipe the U.S. economy and disrupt markets around the world.
Here is a rundown of potential hot spots, including some you may not have thought of.
China
Credit fueled China’s rapid rise as an economic power. Lately, Beijing has been taking steps to slow the rate of corporate debt growth, but total debt outside the banking sector continued to rise last year and remains on an unsustainable path, according to the IMF.
The odds are against a soft landing. Of 43 cases of rapid growth in debt-to-GDP similar to China’s, only five ended without a major slowdown or financial crisis, according to the fund. Many economists still think Beijing has several factors in its favor, including a strong current-account position and room to ramp up government spending. But the trade war with the U.S. could force China to slow its debt reduction, driving financial risks even higher.
“While a China hard landing still remains a low-probability scenario, if it did in fact occur, it would likely unleash a tsunami of contagion across the Asia-Pacific region,” according to Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific at IHS Markit.
Emerging Markets
Interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve coupled with a rising greenback have sent shock waves through emerging markets, making it harder for companies that borrowed in dollars to pay their debts. Argentina is borrowing $57 billion from the IMF, the largest in the fund’s history, to stem the nation’s currency crisis. The Turkish lira plunged as investors questioned the ability of Recep Erdogan’s administration to contain inflation.
“Emerging markets that are over-leveraged on U.S. dollar debt and large oil importers are probably the most vulnerable,” said Hak Bin Chua, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng in Hong Kong.
Some emerging markets, such as Mexico and Colombia, have avoided being sucked into the maelstrom. But as central banks raise interest rates, investors may not be so discerning.
“Emerging-market risks will likely be confined to idiosyncratic cases, but the potential for contagion is there,” said Mark Sobel, former U.S. executive director at the IMF and now U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.
Corporate Debt
Surging private debt has been the driving force behind the steady rise of global debt since 1950, according to the IMF. In the last crisis, U.S. household debt was the ticking time bomb. Consumers have since tightened their belts, but U.S. companies have picked up the slack.
Taking advantage of low rates and strong demand, American companies have issued record amounts of debt, pushing key debt ratios to near 30-year highs, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) chief cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets.
It may be harder for the world to respond this time to turbulence, because central banks still haven’t raised rates back to normal levels, leaving them less ammunition if and when they need to provide stimulus, said Jerome Jean Haegeli, group chief economist at Swiss Re Institute.
Crisis Survivors
In some advanced economies, housing prices never crashed despite the 2008 crisis, and the buildup of household debt is now raising red flags. In its latest global financial stability report, the IMF put Australia, Canada and Nordic countries in this category. Australia’s 27 years of recession-free economic growth helped fuel a property boom with Sydney house prices leaping fivefold. National prices are now in decline and have fallen for 12 straight months.
Italy, Euro Zone
The risk of an ugly exit from the euro zone has a new name: Quitaly.
Fears that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will push debt to unsustainable levels by bloating the nation’s budget deficit have driven up Italian bond yields to levels not seen since the euro debt crisis.
Italy’s public debt tops 2 trillion euros, more than any other European Union country and the equivalent of around 130 percent of its economy. Its government though is planning a wider budget deficit next year, a push which has taken a toll on its bond and equity markets.
Oil
Rising crude prices are stirring talk of a return to $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, hitting countries that rely heavily on imports, including India, China, Taiwan, Chile, Turkey, Egypt and Ukraine. Prices have gained more than 15 percent since mid-August and oil traded above $74 a barrel in New York on Wednesday.
While higher prices is a positive for exporters, paying more for oil will put even more pressure on emerging markets vulnerable to rising U.S. interest rates.
Bad Brexit
Markets are bracing for the risk that the U.K. won’t reach a deal on the terms of its divorce from the EU -- causing a disorderly exit at the end of March, when Britain is scheduled to leave. The fallout could be ugly for the financial sector: British banks will lose their “passport” rights in the EU, which may force them to beef up capital, for example. The IMF is warning central banks to stand ready to provide emergency liquidity.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) machine-learning specialists uncovered a big problem: their new recruiting engine did not like women.
The team had been building computer programs since 2014 to review job applicants' resumes with the aim of mechanizing the search for top talent, five people familiar with the effort told Reuters.
Automation has been key to Amazon's e-commerce dominance, be it inside warehouses or driving pricing decisions. The company's experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said.
""Everyone wanted this holy grail,"" one of the people said. ""They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we'll hire those.""
But by 2015, the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.
That is because Amazon's computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.
(For a graphic on gender breakdowns in tech, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OfPWoD)
In effect, Amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word ""women's,"" as in ""women's chess club captain."" And it downgraded graduates of two all-women's colleges, according to people familiar with the matter. They did not specify the names of the schools.
Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral to these particular terms. But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory, the people said.
The Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon's recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires, but never relied solely on those rankings, they said.
Amazon declined to comment on the recruiting engine or its challenges, but the company says it is committed to workplace diversity and equality.
The company's experiment, which Reuters is first to report, offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning. It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) that are looking to automate portions of the hiring process.
Some 55 percent of U.S. human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years, according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm CareerBuilder.
Employers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters. But computer scientists such as Nihar Shah, who teaches machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, say there is still much work to do.
""How to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable - that's still quite far off,"" he said.
MASCULINE LANGUAGE
Amazon's experiment began at a pivotal moment for the world's largest online retailer. Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world, thanks to a surge in low-cost computing power. And Amazon's Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree: Since June 2015, the company's global headcount has more than tripled to 575,700 workers, regulatory filings show.
So it set up a team in Amazon's Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people. Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting, the people familiar with the matter said.
The group created 500 computer models focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognize some 50,000 terms that showed up on past candidates' resumes. The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants, such as the ability to write various computer codes, the people said.
Instead, the technology favored candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ resumes, such as ""executed"" and ""captured,"" one person said.
Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models' judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. With the technology returning results almost at random, Amazon shut down the project, they said.
THE PROBLEM, OR THE CURE?
Other companies are forging ahead, underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiring.
Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a startup near Salt Lake City, said automation is helping firms look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied. His firm analyzes candidates' speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on resumes.
""You weren’t going back to the same old places; you weren’t going back to just Ivy League schools,"" Parker said. His company's customers include  Unilever  PLC (L:ULVR) and Hilton.
Goldman Sachs has created its own resume analysis tool that tries to match candidates with the division where they would be the ""best fit,"" the company said.
Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, has gone further. It offers employers algorithmic rankings of candidates based on their fit for job postings on its site.
Still, John Jersin, vice president of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) Talent Solutions, said the service is not a replacement for traditional recruiters.
""I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own,"" he said. ""The technology is just not ready yet.""
Some activists say they are concerned about transparency in AI. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a law that allows criminal prosecution of researchers and journalists who test hiring websites' algorithms for discrimination.
""We are increasingly focusing on algorithmic fairness as an issue,"" said Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney with the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU.
Still, Goodman and other critics of AI acknowledged it could be exceedingly difficult to sue an employer over automated hiring: Job candidates might never know it was being used.
As for Amazon, the company managed to salvage some of what it learned from its failed AI experiment. It now uses a ""much-watered down version"" of the recruiting engine to help with some rudimentary chores, including culling duplicate candidate profiles from databases, one of the people familiar with the project said.
Another said a new team in Edinburgh has been formed to give automated employment screening another try, this time with a focus on diversity.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>","Aging Japan: Built for young families, minicars attract a huge following among elderly drivers","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - When Honda Motor Co (T:7267) launched the latest version of its N-Box a year ago, it promoted features on the pint-sized minicar such as error-detecting pedals, automatic emergency braking and moveable seats, part of a push to market the vehicle to young families.
But a drastically different demographic has made the N-Box the country's best-selling passenger vehicle: roughly half the owners of the most recent model are 50 or older.
Automakers had hoped high-tech options would attract younger buyers to minicars, or kei-cars, even as the number of Japanese drivers under 30 has slid nearly 40 percent since 2001.
Instead, with a price tag starting around $7,500 and low ownership taxes, minicars have gained a more loyal following among the rapidly growing population of Japanese elderly, many of whom are on fixed incomes.
""After their children are grown and leave home, more people are looking to downsize from larger family cars to more compact ones,"" said Kiminori Murano, managing director at Tortoise, a dealership specializing in minicars in Yamato, Kanagawa prefecture, just south of Tokyo.
At Tortoise, seniors have overtaken young families as the biggest customer group in the past decade, making up more than 70 percent of its clientele.
Kei-cars represent nearly a third of all Japanese passenger car sales, and about one of every 20 cars sold this year has been an N-Box.
(Click here for an interactive graphic on demand for minicars in Japan https://tmsnrt.rs/2y0uB8F)
All of Japan's major automakers sell the no-frills, fuel-sipping vehicles, almost exclusively for the domestic market. With their 660cc engines - a size more common in motorcycles than cars - minicars are considered too small for most overseas markets.
Many in the industry predict that eventually, automated cars, taxis and buses will keep the elderly mobile for longer.
Until that future arrives, demand for cheap, safe and easy-to-drive vehicles such as the N-Box is growing sharply among older Japanese in a country that is home to one the world's most rapidly aging populations. The success of these cars could also provide a blueprint for marketing such vehicles to older drivers overseas.
When Yoshiyuki Imada's car insurance expires early next year, the 68-year-old retired truck operator from Kagoshima Prefecture is planning to trade in the Toyota Mark II sedan he has been driving for nearly 20 years for a minicar.
""Smaller cars are easier to drive as you get older,"" he said.
Honda said the safety features in the N-Box were not designed just with the elderly in mind. But the company said they could help older drivers stay on the road.
""We wouldn't want elderly people to become holed up in their homes because they can't get around. We want to do what we can to enable them to stay mobile for as long as possible,"" Hideaki Takaishi, senior safety engineer at Honda, told Reuters in an interview.
SENIOR-FRIENDLY MESSAGE
For years, TV commercials for kei-cars have been a montage of energetic twentysomethings, often popular boy band members, camping or frolicking at the beach. More recently, ads have featured sentimental snapshots of families with young children.
But minicar marketing is slowly starting to reflect the segment's biggest buyers. This year, Daihatsu Motor, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), released a TV spot featuring an elderly cabbage farmer who berates his son for suggesting that he switch to a minitruck with automated emergency braking, misreading it as a slight to his driving skills.
""It's true that our biggest markets are drivers in rural areas, women and elderly people,"" Daihatsu spokesman Kazuki Inoue said. ""Our minitrucks are widely used on farms, and farming communities are graying rapidly at the moment, so we wanted to market advanced safety systems on this model.""
Honda's Takaishi said that using sensors to track a vehicle's surroundings and assess whether drivers have depressed the wrong pedal is among the features that can offset common challenges for older drivers, including reduced alertness and reaction time.
The automaker is also trying to develop artificial intelligence-driven systems for ""coaching.""
Cars could theoretically advise drivers via flashing dashboard icons, sounds and steering wheel vibrations if they are about to drift out of their lane or make a potentially risky maneuver.
""Elderly drivers in particular, they really want to maintain their independence while they're driving, as it's a skill they've honed over many years,"" said Takaishi at Honda.
RISING ACCIDENTS
In Japan, the number of driving license holders aged 60 and older is growing faster than in other developed countries, and in the past five years has grown to double that of those under 30.
(Click here for an interactive graphic on elderly drivers in Japan https://tmsnrt.rs/2N3hCHU)
Particularly in rural areas, people are driving well into their 80s and 90s as train and bus services pull out of depopulating towns.
That has led to an increase in traffic accidents involving drivers older than 65, even as the overall number of accidents has decreased. Last year, older drivers were involved in 55 percent of the country's accidents, up from about 47 percent 10 years ago.
(Click here for an interactive graphic on traffic fatalities involving elderly drivers https://tmsnrt.rs/2BXq2hZ)
Partly in response, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry last year launched its Safety Support Car system, which categorizes safety technology on cars sold in Japan.
""As the number of traffic accidents involving elderly drivers became a national issue, we decided to promote these technologies as a whole, to increase awareness and expand usage,"" said Naohiko Kakimi, head of the intelligent transportation system and autonomous driving promotion department at the ministry.
Automakers can use the government-endorsed logo to promote vehicles, and drivers can save on insurance by buying them.
Yorie Miho, a retiree in Kanagawa prefecture, said kei-car safety had come a long way since he bought his Daihatsu Sonica more than a decade ago.
During a recent demonstration outside the Tortoise showroom, the 80-year-old was shaken when the Daihatsu Tanto he was in automatically slammed on its brakes centimeters away from a makeshift wall. But he said afterward the feature would make him feel safer on the road.
""I'm not sure if I'll live so long that I will need to buy another car ... but this would be nice to have,"" Miho said.

M-III Partners LLC, a boutique advisory firm, has been working on the potential filing in the past few weeks and Sears continues to discuss other options and could still avert an in-court restructuring, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the situation.
Sears, which has been losing money for years, has $134 million in debt due on Monday.
A Sears special committee is weighing a prior offer from Chief Executive Eddie Lampert to acquire the retailer's Kenmore appliances brand and its home services business for as much as $480 million. Sears warned it could go out of business as it waits for approval from the committee on the deal.
Lampert, who also runs hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, has said the company should take steps to reduce its debt load to $1.2 billion from $5.6 billion. Lampert and his hedge fund own about 50 percent of Sears.
However, Lampert wants to restructure the debt without filing for bankruptcy protection, because he views bankruptcy as risky for retailers, the paper said.
Lampert also expects that Sears could get more value for its assets by selling them while it is a going concern, the newspaper added. 
Sears, which was the world's largest retailer in the 1960s, has been struggling in recent decades, in the face of declining foot traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores as online shopping gains popularity. 
In May, Sears said it plans to shut 72 locations by the end of third quarter to stem losses in the face of deepening financial distress.

Sears has closed nearly 400 stores since last year. It operates a network of stores with 866 full-line and specialty retail stores in the United States as of Aug. 4, operating through Kmart and Sears.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's bond firms are sopping up a growing amount of Treasury debt as the U.S. government seeks to fund a rising budget deficit stemming from the massive tax cut enacted last December, Treasury Department data released on Tuesday showed.
In late September, the Treasury sold a combined $106 billion in two-year, five-year and seven-year fixed-rate debt to soft investor demand.
The Treasury will sell three-year, 10-year and 30-year bond supply this week, worth $74 billion.
In addition to the growing debt stockpile, analysts blamed last week's sharp bond market sell-off on inflation worries stemming from upbeat economic data, which may result in a faster pace of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.
Rising bond yields and the trade spat between Washington and Beijing have boosted the dollar, reducing overseas demand for Treasuries in recent months.
Growing U.S. yields appeal to some foreign investors, but a lofty greenback has made it more expensive to hedge against other currencies, analysts said.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note's yield hit a seven-year high at 3.261 percent on Tuesday. 
In Japan, investors reduced their U.S. bond holdings in August when U.S. yields were lower than current levels.
At the Treasury auctions two weeks ago, foreign investors bought fewer two- and seven-year debt issues than in the previous month, but they purchased $4.337 billion in five-year notes, the most since March. 
As foreign purchases at Treasury auctions have waned, bond dealers have increased their buying, though they prefer to resell them quickly at a profit. 
Wall Street's 23 top bond firms, or ""primary dealers,"" in particular may have done so to comply with requirements to maintain their status to do business directly with the Federal Reserve. 
In late September, bond dealers bought $17.701 billion in two-year notes, the most since July 2014 and up from $15.698 billion the previous month.
They purchased $13.734 billion in five-year debt at a decade-high yield of 2.997 percent. That was the highest amount they bought since July 2016 and up from $9.802 billion in late August.
They bought $8.379 billion in seven-year notes, the most since September 2016 and up from $7.151 billion a month earlier.
The two- and seven-year notes were sold at decade-high yields of 2.829 percent and 3.034 percent, respectively.

Investment funds' purchases at the Treasury auctions in late September were within their recent average, the Treasury data showed.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",Gangnam style: KKR to invest in office property in southern Seoul,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A group of companies led by KKR & Co (N:KKR) will invest in an existing real estate project under construction in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea, hoping to cash in on one of the world's fastest-rising commercial property markets.
The U.S. private equity firm will invest along with South Korea's National Pension Service and IGIS Asset Management, the country's biggest real estate fund manager, KKR said in a statement.
The project will include office space, retail space, and a five-star hotel, with a gross floor area of 239,188 square meters (2.6 million square feet), the statement said. 
The total cost of the project is expected to be about 2.1 trillion won, or $1.9 billion, which includes the purchase price paid by the group and other costs, KKR said. 
The project is KKR's biggest real estate investment in South Korea, said a spokeswoman for the firm who declined to be named. 
Seoul's affluent southern Gangnam district gained international fame thanks to the song and music video for Gangnam Style by South Korean pop star Psy. 
The area of the South Korean capital is home to one of the major offices of Samsung (KS:005930) Group, though the company agreed in September to sell the building for 748 billion won ($660 million). Hyundai Motor Group will also build its new headquarters in Gangnam.
Investors spent $10.4 billion on office assets in Seoul in the 12 months through June 2018, second only to Hong Kong in the Asia-Pacific region, according to a report by Real Capital Analytic. 
Seoul registered the fifth-fastest price growth of major global markets in the second quarter, with commercial property prices rising by 7.8 percent year-over-year, according to the report released this month. 
KKR in January sold a prime office complex in central Seoul, which it bought in 2014. KKR did not release the price, but real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield said the deal was priced at 713 billion won, or 28.1 million won per pyeong (3.3 square meters), a record high for an office building.

“Dark clouds are an appropriate phrase but it’s not raining yet,” Menon, managing director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “I don’t want to paint too glossy a picture on it but I don’t think we should overreact.”
Menon struck a relatively upbeat outlook for the world economy, cutting through the gloom that’s followed escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, among Singapore’s largest trading partners, and a global emerging-market rout. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global growth forecast for the first time in more than two years, while early indicators already show a possible slide in manufacturing.
The MAS chief said he’s taking a balanced view, pointing to still solid growth in Asia, despite an expected slowdown in China, and a U.S. economy that’s “chugging along.”
“We’re not seeing any major collapses in growth in any part of the world,” said Menon, 54. “What is interesting I think is the underlying resilience of the global economy.”
The bulk of trade disputes that dominated the news last year have also largely subsided with the exception of the conflict between the U.S. and China, he said.
Export-Dependent
A prolonged U.S.-China trade war and a sharper downturn in the world economy have serious implications for export-reliant Singapore. The city state’s exports amounts to 173 percent of gross domestic product, and a rebound in trade last year helped to spur economic growth to 3.6 percent. Growth is forecast at 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent this year.
The solid growth outlook enabled the MAS to tighten monetary policy in April, as other global central banks also began doing the same. Menon declined to comment on the central bank’s policy decision due on Friday, but just over half of the 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey predict the MAS will tighten again.
Global trade risks are set to dominate talks as the world’s financial elite gather in the Indonesian island of Bali this week for the IMF-World Bank’s annual fall meeting.
Global Confidence
Menon’s sanguine outlook doesn’t mean that everything is “hunky dory.” He said a major worry is a possible slump in investment if global sentiment takes a knock.
“The bigger casualty may well not be trade but investment,” Menon said. “If corporates start feeling uneasy or uncertain about their future, they may well not make investments and that may well have a much stronger impact.”
Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing last week cautioned that the confidence in the global economy could suffer if there’s a protracted trade war. Adding to that, the IMF said a further inflaming of the conflict between the U.S. and countries including China would accelerate capital flight from emerging markets.
Asia’s emerging economies are in better shape, with sound fundamentals and policy responses making them well-placed to avoid the financial crisis that struck the region two decades ago, Menon said.
“Emerging Asia should ride through this period of volatility,” he said.

Lagarde pointed to Trump’s recent renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico as one reason for hope alongside EU efforts to close new trade deals.
“Let us try to use that momentum to turn tension into rapprochement,” she said on Wednesday.
But she also warned that the global trading system was under threat and that the risks of further disruption remained. The IMF this week lowered its forecast for global growth to 3.7 percent this year and next, warning that U.S. tariffs and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing were starting to drag on the global economy.
Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank president, said slowing global growth was already starting to have an effect on poverty reduction around the world. He warned that trade tensions were causing companies to put investment decisions on hold, something that would further hinder growth.
“Every country will feel the negative effects,” he said.
Roberto Azevedo, the WTO’s director-general, said the organization’s members had started to acknowledge the need for reform of the institution and global trading rules. There was also a near-universal acknowledgment that globalization had not benefited everyone in the world and that more needed to be done to help those left behind.
But he warned that abandoning the WTO, as Trump has threatened to do, and killing the multilateral trading system that had evolved since World War II would mean walking away from decades of work that had broadly benefited the world.
Boulder, Hill
“It took a lot of people a lot of time to push the boulder this far up the hill,” Azevedo said. “It is vital that everyone who believes in the system raises their voice.”
Angel Gurria, the head of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, called for more to be done to find multilateral solutions to problems such as excess global steel capacity.
While the OECD has been hosting a special steel forum to try to negotiate a solution to the stand-off between China and developed economies over the surge in Chinese steel production in the past decade, those efforts were now largely on hold as a result of U.S. tariffs, Gurria said.
But a multilateral solution remained the best hope for solving that issue, he said, and finding a solution that “sticks.”

Indian government took control of the debt-laden IL&FS last week after defaults on a string of debt obligations triggered wider concerns about risks in the country's financial sector.
The five companies under SFIO probe are IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd (NS:ILFT), IL&FS Financial Services Ltd, IL&FS Energy Development, IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power and IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company (NS:ILFE), the paper said.
The five firms constitute for more than 50 per cent of the entire group's revenue and may have diverted funds in projects that were worth 300 billion rupees ($4.04 billion), ET reported, citing two government officials.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has also begun probing the matter and issued notices to statutory auditors seeking an explanation, it said. 
IL&FS Group, SFIO and ICAI did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.

Reports that U.S. President Donald Trump felt the Federal Reserve is hiking rates too fast received some focus.
“I think we don’t have to go as fast,” Trump told CNBC. ""I don't want to slow it down even a little bit,” he said, adding that he believed there was no need to raise rates when there were no signs of inflation in the economy. Trump did, however, acknowledge that he has not discussed with Federal Chair Jerome Powell about the central bank's rates decision.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% by 9:48PM ET (01:48 GMT). Sony Corp (T:6758) took center stage after the company confirmed it is working on building a new game console.

""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Softbank (T:9984) is reportedly in talks to acquire a “majority stake” in WeWork Cos, a shared office space provider.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 06:55PM ET</span>",Ackman's Pershing Square unveils $900 million stake in Starbucks,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - William Ackman said on Tuesday his activist hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP has built a roughly $900 million position in  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), betting the world's biggest coffee chain can overcome stagnant sales in its home market.
Ackman's unveiling of a 1.1 percent stake in Starbucks comes as the Seattle-based company is trying to convince investors it can fend off heavy competition from rivals, including fast-food chains and high-end coffee shops. Last month, it announced a reorganization that includes leadership changes and job losses.
While activist shareholders are known to pick fights with chief executives and corporate boards, Ackman sounded a conciliatory tone on Tuesday, as he unveiled Pershing Square's investment at the Grant's Fall 2018 Conference in New York.
Ackman said recent actions by Kevin Johnson, who took over from Howard Schultz as Starbucks CEO last year, were ""encouraging"" and that Starbucks' recent challenges are ""fixable with appropriate management execution."" Schultz stepped down as Starbucks' executive chairman in June.
Ackman praised the re-evaluation of Starbucks' portfolio, the closure of Teavana stores, a rejiggering of its owned and licensed businesses, its cost-cutting initiatives and a $19 billion three-year share buyback program.
""We look forward to maintaining a productive dialogue with Mr. Ackman as we do with all of our shareholders,"" Starbucks said in a statement. Pershing Square declined to comment further.
Starbucks shares rose as much as 5.5 percent on the news and closed 2.1 percent higher at $57.71 on Tuesday. The shares have been flat this year, while the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has risen 8 percent.
In his presentation dubbed ""Doppio"" - a reference to a double shot of espresso - Ackman said Starbucks' share price could more than double over the next three years if the company can meet its targets.
Pershing Square built its stake in Starbucks in the last three months, according to people familiar with the matter. It was not immediately clear whether Pershing Square had any discussions with Starbucks prior to unveiling its position. 
Ackman has made his name in the activist shareholder world as a passionate advocate of his positions, even breaking down in tears on occasion while defending his bets on companies such as  Herbalife  Nutrition Ltd (N:HLF) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT). 
After three years of losses at Pershing Square, Ackman has adopted a lower profile that appears to be paying off, with his hedge fund up 13.8 percent in the first nine months of the year. The average hedge fund has gained less than 2 percent during the same period.
This is partly thanks to Ackman's managing to turn previous losses into wins. Last year, he lost a bitter proxy contest against payroll processing company Automatic Data Processing Inc (O:ADP), yet the company's recent strong performance has boosted his portfolio.
Pershing Square, which has $8.4 billion in assets under management, has also unveiled positions this year in  Nike  Inc (N:NKE), United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW). None of these investments resulted in a public fight, and Pershing Square has already exited Nike.
Historically only one or two of Ackman's roughly one dozen positions develop into the kind of public fights that make headlines, like the short bet against Herbalife or his effort to rescue drug maker Valeant that cost him billions of dollars.

Ackman also has experience in the food retail sector, having invested in McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) over 10 years ago and in  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) more recently.

1383,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. A Tame Monthly PPI Rise Expected
Tomorrow morning kicks off with the latest reading on wholesale inflation from the Labor Department.
With rising bond yields becoming a major bone of contention for stocks, any inflation numbers that could push the Federal Reserve to a more hawkish tilt will be scrutinized.
The September producer price index (PPI) arrives at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists are predicting a rise of 0.2% for the month, with the year-on-year rise at 2.8%.
The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is also forecast to have risen 0.2% in September, with a gain of 2.5% in the last 12 months.
2. Oil Trading Could be Heavy as Hurricane Michael Nears
Oil prices and energy stocks will be in focus again as Hurricane Michael nears the oil-producing Gulf region.
The storm is expected to be the first Category 3 hurricane to hit Florida’s Panhandle since 2005 and threatens more than 300 miles of the Gulf Coast, according to CNN.
Companies operating in the Gulf shut down nearly 20% of their oil production as of Tuesday.
According to forecasts by various weather services, Michael could deliver the most powerful strike in at least a decade on the Panhandle, a 200-mile strip on northwest Florida that’s home to the state’s largest crude and natural gas fields. The Panhandle previously took direct hits from Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Dennis in 2005.
But a Reuters report suggested the hurricane’s track would largely avoid major oil-producing assets in the Gulf, although a change in that path could widen its impact.
Crude futures rose 0.8% today.
3. Can Snap Hold $7?
Social media investors are facing barrage of headlines and stocks could be active again tomorrow.
The sector has one fewer player now that Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) decided to abandon its not-very-popular Google+ after a security breach.
And the sharks are circling Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which was pummeled today, losing 6.4% and ending right at $7 a share.
A MoffettNathanson note out today said the company is “quickly running out of money” and might need to raise capital, Bloomberg reported.
The resumption of selling continued after a brief respite Friday when Snap CEO Evan Spiegel set a target for the company to be profitable in 2019.
Before profits, though, investors need to see signs that the company is no longer shedding daily average users. And that may be tough with increased competition, as many Snapchat users are moving to Instagram stories."

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","P&G gets steel tariff exemption for Gillette, Venus razors","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) was informed on Tuesday that it is now exempt from the 25 percent U.S. tariff levied on imported Japanese and Swedish steel that is used in its Gillette and Venus razor blades, a company spokesman told Reuters.
The exemption notification, from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, came nearly four months after P&G's biggest razor rival,  Edgewell Personal Care  Co (N:EPC), received an exemption. Edgewell, owner of the Wilkinson Sword and Schick brands, filed an exemption application in late March and told Reuters it was informed it was granted the week of June 18.
""There was definitely a financial impact to the company, but we haven't disclosed any numbers,"" P&G spokesman Damon Jones said of the effect of the steel tariff. Gillette and Venus are the biggest components of P&G's grooming business, which accounted for about 10 percent of global net sales in fiscal 2018, ended July 31.
""It wasn't materially market-moving, but given the competitiveness of this industry we think it is important and significant,"" Jones said.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed tariffs on steel imports from most countries in March, and on the European Union in June.
P&G and Edgewell both said that U.S. steel manufacturers cannot supply the high-quality grade of steel needed to make precision razor blades, obliging them to pay higher prices for steel or seek exemptions. 
P&G, the world's No. 1 personal care goods company, which has been struggling with soaring raw material and transportation costs this year, chose not to pass the 25 percent surtax onto consumers at a time of intense competition in the industry.
The company has been cutting prices at its grooming business, hoping to claw back market share from upstart shaving brands such as Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. Like other consumer goods companies, P&G has been squeezed this year between pressure to cut prices and surging input costs.
Jon Moeller, P&G's chief financial officer, told Reuters in August that the tariffs on steel imports were the company's biggest trade-related concern.

A company spokesman told Reuters in July that products sold in Canada - from Febreze candles to Gillette shaving foam - would be affected by retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made goods after Canadian authorities rejected a request for exemptions. The company has also identified more than a dozen products that could be hurt by the latest round of U.S. tariffs as tensions with China rise.

1396,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Dow Closes Lower as Rate Concerns, Malaise in Materials Weigh","Investing.com - The Dow seesawed to a lower close Tuesday as fears over rising rates hurt sentiment, even as bond yields eased from multi-year highs and tech stocks rebounded from a selloff a day earlier.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.21%. The S&P 500 fell 0.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.03%.
For the second-straight day, investors had to contend with wild swings on Wall Street as markets continued to dance to the tune of movements in U.S. government bond yields.
The 10-year US Treasury yield retreated intraday from a fresh seven-year high above 3.25%, dampening the narrative somewhat that higher yields would prompt investors to ditch riskier assets like stocks in favor of less riskier ones like Treasuries.
Still, gains in the broader market were kept in check by a malaise in materials, led by a rout in shares of PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) after the paint company said costs are rising at the fastest pace in two years, sounding the alarm bells for a pullback in profits of U.S. manufacturers.
Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), WestRock (NYSE:WRK) and  Packaging Corp  of America (NYSE:PKG) also weighed heavily on materials, with the latter's shares off 8%.
Energy, however, attempted to lead the charge higher, supported by surging oil prices as Hurricane Michael barrelled toward the oil-rich U.S. Gulf Coast, raising the prospect of output disruptions.
Bargain-hunting investors, meanwhile, scooped up battered tech stocks following a slide a day earlier as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) closed higher.
Sentiment on stocks was soured ahead of the U.S. open, after the International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, and its 2019 estimates for U.S. and China, citing pressure from the monthslong trade war.
President Donald Trump did little to allay investor fears about the U.S.-China trade war after he repeated a threat to impose tariffs on $267 billion worth of additional Chinese imports if Beijing retaliates to Washington's recent levies.
The volatile day on Wall Street was characterised by sharp moves in popular names including Tesla and Snap.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 5% after Macquarie upgraded its rating on the stock to outperform with a price target of $430, touting the electric automaker's “strong brand presence,” and downplaying concerns about funding.
Tesla will get over the ""debt maturity event hump,"" if shares reach $360 by March 1, Macquarie said.
Snapchat operator Snap (NYSE:SNAP) fell 6% as MoffettNathanson warned that the social media company was at risk of ""running out of money,” boosting the need for a capital raise.
In other corporate news, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) rose 2% after Bill Ackman's Pershing Square disclosed a new $900 million stake in the coffee chain.
The fund bought 15.2 million shares in Starbucks, or about $900 million worth, according to The Wall Street Journal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes failed to make much progress on Tuesday as investors, worried about global growth prospects, fled from materials and industrials stocks. 
The International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, and its 2019 estimates for U.S. and China, saying the two countries would feel the brunt of the impact of their trade war next year.
President Donald Trump also repeated a threat to impose tariffs on $267 billion worth of additional Chinese imports if Beijing retaliates to Washington's recent levies.
The materials index (SPLRCM) was down more than 3 percent, on track for its biggest one-day percentage drop since February 8. Its biggest drags were from chemical companies after PPG Industries (N:PPG) fell 9.4 percent following a warning late on Monday that its current-quarter profit would be hit by higher raw material costs and softer demand in China. 
""If industrials and materials are weighed on because of concerns about global activity, it's going to cast a pall over the market at large since S&P 500 companies generate about half of their business from overseas markets,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
At 3:03PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 12.84 points, or 0.05 percent, to 26,499.62, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 2.97 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,887.4 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 20.68 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,756.63.
Along with chemicals companies, paper packaging stocks such as WestRock (N:WRK) and  Packaging Corp  of America (N:PKG), which both fell 8 percent, after BMO flagged the risk of rising industry supply.
The trade-sensitive industrials sector (SPLRCI) was down 1 percent, with  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) falling 2.2 percent and airline stocks <.SPLRCALI> down 2.6 percent.
American Airlines (O:AAL) fell 6 percent after the company said fuel prices were higher than expected in the third quarter, raising concerns that rising fares were not enough to offset energy costs.
The energy index (SPNY) was the S&P's biggest gainer, with a 1.1 percent jump as oil prices rose on growing evidence of falling Iranian crude exports and a partial Gulf of Mexico production shutdown due to Hurricane Michael. [O/R]

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Stocks in developing nations will return an average of 7 percent annually during the next decade, more than any other asset class, the Newport Beach, California-based firm said. That’s up from its January forecast of 6 percent.
Research Affiliates is dialing up a prediction it made back in February 2016, when the firm called emerging markets the “trade of a decade.” The advice proved prescient: Stocks surged 81 percent through their peak in January 2018.
This year has been less rosy as equities slumped into a bear market amid the threat of an all-out trade war, a strong dollar and rising U.S. interest rates. Still, investors and strategists from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). to UBS Group AG and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have also highlighted attractive valuations in the asset class.
Research Affiliates also said it expects emerging-market local bonds and an index of stocks from Europe, Australasia, Israel and Asia to outperform. The firm sub-advises about $200 billion for Invesco Ltd.,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. and other managers in addition to Pimco.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 02:03PM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU supervisors monitoring Italian banks' liquidity, no cause for alarm - source","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European banking supervisors have stepped up their monitoring of liquidity levels at Italian banks after a sharp increase in the country's government bond yields, although there is no cause for alarm, a senior EU source said on Tuesday.
The source told Reuters the monitoring was being carried out ""more intensely than usual"" due to market turmoil in recent days.
The checks involve both customer deposits and the interbank market that banks use to lend to each other without requesting collateral, the source said, adding that ""no sign of alarm"" had been detected.
Both the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank, the euro zone's single banking supervisor, declined to comment. 
The ECB, along with national supervisors, regularly monitors lenders' liquidity conditions and adjusts its monitoring, including its frequency and depth, during periods of stress or market volatility, a source at the ECB said. 
A budget standoff between Rome's anti-establishment government and European Union authorities on Tuesday pushed Italy's benchmark 10-year debt costs (IT10YT=RR) to 3.72 percent, the highest level since February 2014. 
The ruling coalition last month set a deficit target of 2.4 percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous government's goal for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving investors and prompting sharp criticism from the European Commission.
Italian banks are vulnerable to sovereign debt problems because they hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds - or 10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by hurting the value of those holdings, eats into their capital levels.
Shares in the country's lenders have fallen sharply in recent months and the cost of insuring major banks' debt against a potential default has increased.
However, the ample liquidity provided by the ECB during years of ultra-expansionary monetary policy is shielding the interbank market from any tensions, Milan traders said.

Banks have not suffered any deposit flights either, based on the latest available data. Italian banks' deposits stood at 2.39 trillion euros in July from 2.41 trillion euros in June, when the new government was sworn in, and have been broadly stable in recent months.

DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) fell more than 3% after its full-year 2018 home sales and orders forecast fell short of analysts' estimates.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) delivered 61 of its best-selling 737 single-aisle aircraft in September, unexpectedly surging past numbers for August and suggesting manufacturing problems at suppliers may be easing.
The news briefly pulled Boeing shares back into positive territory in afternoon trading, on a day when industrial stocks were being weighed down by concerns over trade and China's growth.
Boeing's production has been hit by delays at suppliers such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and GE joint venture CFM International, which makes engines for the 737s, resulting in deliveries of just 29 planes in July.
The bounce to 48 planes in August offered hope that the company could still make good on its target to deliver 50 more airplanes overall in 2018 than last year's record 763. 
Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said last month only that September deliveries of the 737 narrowbody jetliners would be as good as August.
Boeing's quarterly numbers indicate ongoing progress with suppliers and set the world's biggest aircraft producer up for a strong finish to the year, said Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu.
""We expect a full recovery in the fourth quarter,"" Kahyaoglu said.
The numbers brought overall aircraft deliveries for the first nine months of 2018 to 568, up from 554 at the end of September a year ago.
Boeing, which aims to deliver between 810-815 planes in 2018, is in front of its main rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which delivered 503 aircraft through September this year, up from 454 aircraft deliveries in the same period last year. 
Boeing delivered 57 planes in September last year.
Europe's Airbus SE (PA:AIR) has been grappling with delays to deliveries and quality problems, leaving it a steep trajectory in deliveries for the fourth quarter in order to meet end-year targets.
Deliveries so far this year included eight of the recently acquired Bombardier CSeries, now known as the A220. The Toulouse, France-based company expects to deliver about 800 planes in 2018, excluding the Canadian-designed A220.

Boeing is also ahead in the order race with Airbus, booking 631 net aircraft orders after cancellations in the first nine months of the year, well ahead of the 256 orders recorded by Airbus.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","French lawmakers back privatizations, corporate law overhaul","PARIS (Reuters) - French lawmakers gave their backing in a first reading on Tuesday to an overhaul of corporate law aimed at cutting red tape for companies and setting several privatizations in motion.
The legislation is part of President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business reform drive that has already eased labor laws and cut taxes on companies and entrepreneurs. 
The law aims to make it faster and cheaper to register and wind down companies while also simplifying a complex system that imposes new regulations in multiple stages as firms increase their workforce.
It includes incentives to make profit-sharing more common among small firms and encourage employees' voluntary contributions to all types of savings products.
The bill also sets the stage for several large privatizations already flagged by the government, with the proceeds due to finance a new 10 billion euros ($11.49 billion)innovation fund.
It will in particular lift legal restraints on selling down stakes in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) while allowing the national lottery FDJ to be privatized.
Some 361 lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted in favor of the law while 84 were against and 103 abstained from voting. 

The bill now goes before the Senate for consideration in January before returning to the lower house for a final vote. ($1 = 0.8706 euros)

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>","The rating game: 'Junk' Italy still hard to imagine, funds say","By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - For Italy's sovereign debt the timing could hardly be worse: A budget standoff with Brussels is driving the country's bond yields to new peaks, just as two credit agencies are weighing whether to cut their ratings to within one notch of 'junk'.
But as markets move to price in chances of the euro zone's biggest sovereign bond market losing its investment grade rating, major bond investors reckon political factors and significant contagion risk make that almost inconceivable.
Moody's and S&P Global, both rating Italy two rungs above 'junk', are widely expected to downgrade in late October as the new government's outsize spending plans put it on a collision course with EU authorities. 
One rung lower and Italy would fall below investment grade for the first time, a move that would potentially cost it hundreds of billions of euros in lost bond investments.
The conundrum for financial investors is how to accurately price the risk of a euro zone sovereign in junk territory - given that particular sovereign's market footprint, the complication of still-active European Central Bank bond buying, eligibility rules for that ECB support and an outside risk to Italy's euro membership. 
(Graphic: Italy's sovereign long-term credit ratings - https://reut.rs/2yqr1nx)
HOW WIDE IS TOO WIDE?
Some think current Italian government benchmark bond spreads - which hit a five-year high of 312 basis points over German Bunds on Tuesday - and credit default swaps pricing already show the country trading as a junk-rated borrower. 
Kaspar Hense, portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, said an Italy/Germany 10-year spread of 300 basis points was more compatible with a junk-rated issuer, based on a model comparing Italy with other developed and emerging market sovereigns. 
The main credit agencies say their rating decisions are guided solely by credit analysis and not any wider political backdrop.
But investors are wary that current debt pricing comparisons may be misleading as they don't account for political sensitivities, given the sheer scale of Italy's bond market and its systemic importance to the euro zone project.
""A downgrade to junk could trigger a full-blown (euro zone) crisis,"" said Nicola Mai, a portfolio manager at PIMCO, the world's largest bond investor. ""...Which is why I don't the agencies will do it, I don't think they will want to be the ones causing a crisis in Europe.""
Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management - another bulge bracket bond investor - also said a junk-rated Italy was highly unlikely. 
""It would be a very, very big decision, just given the size of the Italian bond market, it makes up something like a fifth of government bonds in the euro zone,"" he said.

That backdrop suggests the bar is higher for Rome than other borrowers, and the possibility of a junk rating is therefore only partially factored in.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said last month in separate notes they reckoned full pricing in would equate to an Italy/Germany yield spread of 400 bps.
At the height of the euro zone debt crisis the spread went even higher, to over 550 basis points, and the country still kept its investment grade ratings - though that was without the effect of the ECB's bond-buying scheme.
However the numbers are parsed, anxiety over the ratings risk is likely to persist.
""The threat of a junk rating won't go away while the current coalition is in partnership,"" said John Taylor, fixed income portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, a fund with $546 billion of assets under management.

WHAT'S AT STAKE
Italy comprises about 22 percent of the 1.346 trillion euro iBoxx EUR Eurozone index, 5.7 percent of $1.35 trillion ICE BofAML Global Government Index and 7.53 percent FTSE Russell World Government Bond Index, which is tracked by $800 billion of assets. 
Most major indexes, such as iBoxx and the Bloomberg/Barclays euro aggregate index, which has a market value of over 10 trillion euros ($11.8 trillion), use the average ratings of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. 
So downgrades to junk from two of these agencies would be enough to take Italy out of these indexes. 
The ECB, on the other hand, would require all three major agencies plus DBRS to cut to junk to take Italy out of its bond-buying programme.
This issue becomes sharper as the ECB unwinds the programme this year. When Portugal was merely faced with the threat of that fourth downgrade from DBRS in August 2016 -- it never actually came to pass -- its 10-year bond yield spread over Germany widened 80 basis points in just under two months. 
Given the complexities and sensitivities, some feel they may just kick any decision far down the road.

""The ratings agencies will give an issuer as influential as Italy a lot of time,"" said Stealey of JP Morgan AM.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 11:07AM ET</span>",Unions accuse Chevron of 'massive' tax avoidance via the Netherlands,"By Anthony Deutsch
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - International and Dutch unions filed a complaint with a global trade body on Tuesday accusing  Chevron  Corp. (N:CVX) of funneling billions of euros through letter box companies in the Netherlands to avoid taxation.
In a rare step, the federation of Dutch trade unions, the International Transport Workers' Federation and Public Services International lodged the complaint with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in The Hague.
""Chevron fully complies with all tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates,"" Chevron spokeswoman Sally Jones said.
Reuters was unable to determine why the U.S. oil major had been singled out in the complaint, but the trade unions said tax avoidance deprived workers they represented of basic government services and pressured their wages.
""The workers and communities we represent suffer when government-provided services such as health care, education, infrastructure, water, energy, and public safety decline,"" the complaint said. 
""Unfortunately, multinationals’ practice of avoiding paying taxes in the countries in which their wealth is earned deepens global wealth inequality and empowers multinationals against workers and governments,"" it added.
Scores of multinationals use the Netherlands, which has a network of tax treaties with roughly 100 countries, to shift dividends, interest and royalties untaxed through Dutch shell companies to tax havens overseas.
BREAKS SPIRIT OF THE LAW 
In their 35-page complaint the unions alleged Chevron had used its Dutch subsidiaries to breach OECD disclosure guidelines in respect of their operations with Chevron’s Nigerian, Argentinian, and Venezuelan businesses. In those examples, the complaint states that Chevron specifically failed to meet requirements to pay tax in the country of extraction and to adhere to Dutch financial disclosure requirements.
The unions' statement said Chevron’s Dutch subsidiaries, through frequent intra-group operations whose main purpose was the avoidance of taxes in multiple jurisdictions, breached the spirit of Dutch corporation tax law.
""The American company is carrying out tax avoidance on a massive scale,"" the groups said in a statement to the media, detailing the complaint.
""The Netherlands is already a tax haven which encourages companies to pay less.""
The Dutch government, which says it wants to help stop tax avoidance, has come under pressure from the OECD and the European Commission to take measures to halt tax avoidance.
The Dutch Finance Ministry said the government cannot comment on cases involving individual companies due to secrecy laws.
A major complaint expressed by the OECD and the European Commission, is the Dutch finance ministry's practice of granting ""advance rulings"", or agreeing in advance with large corporations on how a given structure will be taxed. 

In 2015 the European Commission ordered the Dutch to reclaim up to 30 million euros ($34.7 million) in back taxes from Starbucks (O:SBUX) after ruling that the tax arrangement with the U.S. coffee company amounted to illegal state aid. Starbucks denied wrongdoing and has appealed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders vote for Unilever's (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) proposed move to the Netherlands before the plan was scrapped last week. 
 Unilever  pulled the plug on the proposal last Friday after opposition from a vocal group of UK shareholders. That happened before U.S.-based Glass Lewis, influential with U.S. institutional investors, distributed its report.
In endorsing Unilever's move, Glass Lewis had taken a different path from rival firm PIRC, a smaller adviser with a greater focus on the United Kingdom. 
PIRC encouraged shareholders to oppose the move, noting that many of them would have been forced to sell their Unilever shares at a time and price not of their choosing, due to the shares being kicked off Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index.
In contrast, Glass Lewis said the long-term benefits of simplifying the company's dual-headed, Anglo-Dutch structure outweighed the near-term consequences for those shareholders.
""We do not consider index rebalancing to be inherently uncommon or onerous,"" Glass Lewis said in its report from last week, which was made public on Tuesday.
""Nor do we believe scuttling the simplification by virtue of this issue ... represents a suitably long-term perspective.""

It argued that opposing the change ""would have the effect of obstructing a range of strategic and governance benefits and essentially signal that Unilever should maintain an arguably anachronistic structure indefinitely"".

1460,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 09:53AM ET</span>",Tech stocks get hit for a 3rd straight day,"Stocks continued a three-day losing streak Monday following a bond selloff last week and as escalating trade tensions between the US and China left Wall Street on edge.
The bond market was closed Monday for Columbus Day, but the 10-year Treasury yield had jumped to multi-year highs at 3.23% last week after a string of robust economic data. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue tightening, on top of three rate increases this year and eight since the financial crisis.
Technology companies, which have led Wall Street's latest bull run, took the biggest hits. The  Nasdaq Composite closed down 52.50 points, or 0.67%, to 7,735.95. Among the losers were  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (-1.14%), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (-1.02%) and  Nvidia (-1.52%).  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares recovered after nearing their lowest level in a year and a half. 
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average erased losses after falling more than 200 points in earlier trading and climbed back to 26,486.78. The S&P 500 was little changed. 
Concerns about conflicts between Washington and Beijing weighed on large-cap industrial stocks, including  Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which are sensitive to trade tensions. 
 Bloomberg reports the Trump administration is weighing whether to name China a currency manipulator. A weaker yuan could be used to boost exports and mitigate effects of US tariffs. 
On the commodities front,  oil prices fell as much as 3% after reports the Trump administration may offer certain countries waivers when US sanctions against Iran set to kick in next month."
1461,By Business Insider,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>",Here's why hedge funds could keep the stock sell-off raging — and what you can do to protect yourself,"As the stock market suffers through its most recent bout of selling pressure, it feels as if a perfect storm of bearish factors have culminated simultaneously.
There are spiking Treasury yields, which have reduced the relative appeal of equities and exacerbated fears of a liquidity crunch.
Then there's President Donald Trump's trade war, which has rattled nerves worldwide and left investors to assess the potential market fallout.
There's also the unfortunate fact that corporate share buybacks — which have buoyed stocks during lean times throughout the 9-1/2-year bull market — are in a market-wide blackout period prior to earnings season.
And if all of that weren't stark enough, hedge funds are doing their part to make the experience as miserable as possible. After all, it's their most popular holdings that are absorbing the brunt of the selling.
Before you dismiss this as an unfortunate coincidence, consider that hedge funds — particularly those of the passive-investing variety — have come under fire over the past few years for continuing to pile into proven winners. That has created stretched positions in the best-performing stocks, leaving them particularly vulnerable.
Now that the market's pendulum is swinging back the other way, those same investors are being forced to sell out of positions. And much of that is due to the type of systematic programming found in quantitative funds.
As a result, stocks with the highest hedge fund ownership have fallen to an outsize degree. Last week, the stocks most popular with hedge funds fell almost 4%, while the ones with the lowest holdings declined just 1.4%, according to UBS data.
""This is suggestive of an unwind of hedge fund positioning, which is over three standard deviations above average, based on our measures, and thus could prolong the rotation,"" Keith Parker, the chief US equity strategist at UBS, wrote in a client note. ""This is indicative of increased passive selling.""
To further drive this point home, consider that many of the high-flying tech stocks responsible for much of the US equity rally are also widely held by hedge funds. And, wouldn't you know it, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has fallen roughly 4% over the past five days, compared with just 1% for the S&P 500.
So what's a trader to do amid all of these swirling headwinds? UBS has a few ideas.
The firm recommends looking at so-called high-quality stocks, or companies with minimal debt that churn out reliable profits. It's a suggestion that matches research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), which found recently that high-quality stocks were set to start trading at a premium to the broader market.
To that end, Parker warned that higher interest rates could make life even more difficult for companies with weak balance sheets. He also said to avoid stocks serving as bond proxies, since their appeal is weakening as bonds themselves become more attractive.
As for specific sectors, Parker said he preferred to rotate out of retail and in to other parts of consumer discretionary and even healthcare. In the financial space, he said UBS preferred banks to insurance companies because of relative margin trends.
Further, UBS remains overweight tech and industrials and underweight materials, utilities, and real-estate investment trusts.
While these recommendations won't keep you in the clear if a major market downturn hits, they're a great start for someone looking to exercise some caution."

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 07:34AM ET</span>",German firms would face billions in extra tariffs in hard Brexit: study,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - German firms would face extra tariffs of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) a year if Britain quits the European Union without a trade deal, and their exports to Britain might drop by up to 57 percent, Germany's IW institute said on Tuesday.
Talks on ending four decades of Britain's membership in the European Union have entered their final stage more than two years after Britons voted for Brexit. A hard Brexit would mean Britain leaving the bloc with no trade deal.
The BDI industry association - one of Germany's most influential lobby groups - said a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations was needed at an Oct. 17-18 summit in Brussels.
""Otherwise there is the risk that Europe slides into a disorderly Brexit and that would cause a huge crisis,"" Managing Director Joachim Lang told a news conference in Berlin.
A hard Brexit would cause huge difficulties for tens of thousands of companies in Europe and hundreds of thousands of employees in Britain and the European Union, Lang said.
He noted that many companies were preparing for a hard Brexit and some wanted to suspend production in Britain from April as delivery routes could not be secured and some were moving their headquarters from Britain, adjusting their legal frameworks and looking for new transport routes.
Lang said there was no overall figure for how much companies had spent on preparing for Brexit but some individual pharmaceutical and chemical companies had spent up to 100 million pounds ($130 million) preparing for Brexit.
AUTO SECTOR TO SUFFER
A hard Brexit would affect the auto sector - which employs some 800,000 people in Germany and is the country's biggest exporter - particularly hard as it would be hit with about 60 percent of the extra costs German companies would face, IW said.
About 5 percent of Germany's gross domestic product depended either directly or indirectly on trade with Britain, IW said, making it the third biggest trading partner for German firms.
""That could dramatically change in the foreseeable future,"" the IW study said.
Referring to a potential plunge in German exports to Britain if a hard Brexit happens, IW researcher Markos Jung said: ""This horrific scenario should force politicians to act constructively.""
In the long term, a hard Brexit would probably result in price rises and a shift in Germany's flow of goods, the IW said.
Lang said a transition period, which would only be possible with a Brexit deal, was indispensable to enable German companies to adapt to the changes to the legal framework that would come afterwards.

""A strong agreement with the EU is far more important for both sides, especially for Britain, than the remote prospect of deals with third countries,"" he said.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>",China's HNA lists property assets worth $11 billion for sale: documents,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] has put up for sale property assets worth at least $11 billion, according to documents seen by Reuters, accelerating a push to cut its large debt and restructure.
Two sets of documents reviewed by Reuters listed more than 80 assets that HNA has either put up for sale or intends to sell, including hotels, commercial and residential buildings. They are mostly within China, with the bulk of them located in Hainan Island, where HNA is headquartered.
The documents were sent to prospective investors in August, said sources.
Under pressure from Beijing, the aviation-to-hotels conglomerate has in 2018 sold real estate, stakes in overseas companies and aviation-related assets after a $50 billion acquisition spree in recent years.
Since January, HNA has sold or agreed to sell over $20 billion worth of assets, including real estate in Sydney, New York and Hong Kong, according to Reuters calculations and media reports. 
""We are strategically exiting some areas but it's not a fire sale,"" said a company source familiar with the group's plans.
It was not immediately clear if some of the assets listed in the two sets of documents have been already sold. 
An HNA spokeswoman declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
HNA's total debt stood at 657.41 billion yuan ($94.96 billion) at the end of the first half, down 10.7 percent from end-2017. Despite the decrease, the group's total debt to EBITDA stood at 21.36 times at the end of the first half.
In one set of the documents, HNA listed 24 assets in China and 11 overseas, including HNA International Plaza, a commercial-to-residential landmark complex in Haikou, and 850 Third Avenue in New York, which came under scrutiny by the U.S. government because of its proximity to the Trump Tower, according to a media report.
It estimated the total value of 26 assets listed in this set of documents as $10.5 billion but didn't give the estimated valuations of the remaining assets. 
In a separate set of documents sent to another potential investor, HNA listed 57 domestic property assets as ""planned for sale"", 10 of which also appear in the first set of documents. 
The assets listed in the second set of documents include hotels in Hainan, Beijing and Shanghai, as well as residential buildings in Hainan, Tianjin and Tangshan in northern China's Hebei province. 
The second set of documents did not give the estimated valuations. It, however, set a time frame for sales of most of the assets, with 18 targeted to be sold in the second half of 2018 and 23 in 2019.
Earlier this year, HNA sold a 25 percent stake in Hilton Grand Vacations Inc, trimmed shares held in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and sold three land parcels in Hong Kong, among other sales.
The group is also exploring the sale of its newly acquired CWT logistics unit, people familiar with the situation told Reuters last month.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",StanChart CEO criticizes media coverage of bank's Iran sanctions controls: memo,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Chief Executive Bill Winters hit back at critical media coverage of the bank's attempts to improve its financial crime controls, in a memo sent to hundreds of senior managers at the bank on Tuesday.
Winters sought to reassure staff about StanChart's recent financial performance and progress mending flaws in regulatory compliance, after media reported last week that the lender faced a possible $1.5 billion fine for past Iran-related sanctions violations.
""You'll have undoubtedly seen recent articles commenting on our financial performance and speculating about a financial penalty for the U.S. investigation regarding our historical sanctions conduct and controls,"" Winters wrote in the memo obtained by Reuters. 
""I'd like to briefly address each because I don't think they reflect the progress we are making as a Bank,"" Winters wrote.
A spokesman for the London-based bank confirmed the contents of the memo but declined to comment further.
The unusual step of criticizing media coverage in a memo sent to hundreds of the bank's 'business leadership team' reflects a bolder stance in StanChart's efforts to rehabilitate its public image following years of costly fines.
Media reports last week said the fine of around $1.5 billion was a preliminary assessment based on some of the communications between the bank and regulators, and that final discussions had not yet begun.
StanChart last week declined to comment on the size of the possible fine but said it was ""engaged in ongoing discussions with U.S. authorities"".
The bank has been subject to a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the United States since 2012. The DPA was extended in 2014 and again earlier this year. It is due to expire in December.

The current negotiations with U.S. authorities and the possible fine relate to whether the bank violated Iranian sanctions after 2007, when it said it would no longer do business with Iran-related entities.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday said she wants to hear critics of  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Alstom's (PA:ALSO) plan to create a Franco-German rail champion which is being investigated by the European Commission.
The Commission in July opened a probe, saying the deal which could create a global leader with three times the market share of its closest rival, could reduce competition and lead to higher fares for travelers.
""People are coming to us with concerns saying that this would be a very big company in Europe. The analysis is still ongoing. We hope anyone with concerns will come forward to us. It is not too late. Please come forward if there are any concerns,"" Vestager told a European Parliament hearing.
German industrial group Siemens and French rival  Alstom  announced the planned rail merger in September last year, an industrial boost for French President Emmanuel Macron which, however, has prompted criticism from opposition politicians.
Vestager said her investigation would look into the role of other big global companies in Europe and whether these would provide a competitive constraint to the merged company.
Siemens and Alstom have defended their deal, saying it was necessary to stave off the competitive threat from bigger Chinese rival CRRC (China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation) and Canada's Bombardier Transportation.

The European Commission will decide by Jan. 28 whether to clear the deal. The deadline can be extended should the companies offer concessions.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Ford picks BBDO as lead creative agency in blow to Britain's WPP,"By Kate Holton and Gaurika Juneja
(Reuters) - Ford (N:F) has chosen Omnicom's (N:OMC) BBDO as its lead creative advertising agency in a symbolic blow to its partner of 75 years, WPP (L:WPP).
The British group, the world's largest advertising company, is in the process of rebuilding after the sudden departure of its founder Martin Sorrell earlier this year. 
New boss Mark Read is planning fresh investment in the creative talent of its big agencies as the broader industry goes through a period of unprecedented change. Clients are increasingly taking work in house and using the giant online platforms of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to reach consumers. 
Named as 2018 Network of the Year at the annual Cannes awards, the New York-based BBDO replaces WPP on the creative front at Ford from November 1, while independent agency Wieden + Kennedy will also be a creative partner on some projects. 
WPP, which has worked with Ford since 1943, has however retained much of Ford's most profitable work, such as media planning and buying and customer retention following a five-month review by the automaker.
It also frees up the group to bid more aggressively for work with other auto makers. Its shares were down 0.9 percent at 0930 GMT. 
Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said the financial impact on WPP would be limited, as it had lost only less profitable creative work, although the decision could spark questions as to whether it is the beginning of the end for WPP's tight relationship with Ford.
""The greater impact is more symbolic than anything else - Ford has been WPP's flagship client and, with the departure of Martin Sorrell, there will be inevitable questions over whether that was a factor,"" he said. 
NEW IDEAS
Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, is looking for new ideas after struggling with slumping sales, weak demand in Europe and trade tariffs with China, forcing it to cut costs.
""Today is a big big day,"" BBDO Worldwide said on Twitter. ""We have a wonderful new brand to help build.""
Like many other big ad spenders, Ford said it would also create more than 100 new in-house global marketing positions, a trend that has stripped the big advertising groups of some of their income in recent years.
WPP, which had created an entire agency to support Ford, said it would continue to handle some advertising work for the car giant in the U.S., the China advertising operations, advertising for Ford's luxury vehicle brand Lincoln and all Ford's public relations. 
The sudden departure of Sorrell, who built WPP into an advertising giant through 33 years of dealmaking, prompted fears that without his contacts WPP could lose clients.
Major WPP clients have put a raft of work out for review this year, putting pressure on the market leader. It has retained ties with Sky (L:SKYB) and  BP  (L:BP) but lost HSBC (L:HSBA). 
WPP owns some of the most storied names in advertising, such as JWT, Ogilvy, Grey and Y&R. It combines these with data analytics, media planning, public relations and consultancy work and had outperformed peers for several years until 2017.

Clients such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) have also called for WPP to simplify its offering and provide an integrated service, rather than different strands of work via multiple agencies.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank governor is to meet representatives of telecommunications company MTN (J:MTNJ) and banks on Tuesday to discuss a dispute over the repatriation of $8.1 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The dispute is over the transfer of $8.1 billion of funds which Nigeria's central bank said the company had sent abroad in breach of foreign-exchange regulations.
The people with knowledge of the matter, who did not want to be named, said executives from MTN and the four lenders involved in the case -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), Stanbic IBTC Bank (LG:IBTC), Citibank (N:C) and  Diamond Bank  (LG:DIAMONB) - would hold talks with Nigerian Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele on Tuesday.

Washington in May announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Of the 4,300 product exemptions that the company and its customers applied for, 2,640 have received a response from the U.S. administration, Voestalpine said. Of those, roughly 2,360 were granted and 280 turned down, it added.
""The economic risk for Voestalpine related to these tariffs has thus reduced ... significantly,"" the company said in a statement. 
Voestalpine repeated its assessment in June that only up to around 3 percent of its revenue could have been affected by the tariffs. It said at the time that the associated economic risk was ""very manageable"".
""We are optimistic that we will receive mainly positive responses to the remaining applications,"" Voestalpine added on Tuesday.

Voestalpine supplies sectors including the auto, rail and energy industries with specialty steel products but also produces steel strip. When asked which products had received exemptions, a spokeswoman said they were ""across the board"" and involved all four of the company's divisions.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 05:28AM ET</span>",European stocks find footing after Asia drops to 17-month low,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe battled to fend off a four-day losing streak for world stocks on Tuesday, after weary investors had seen Asia stumble to a 17-month low and bond markets hit by a fresh bout of selling.
Strength in oil stocks on higher crude prices and a rise in banking stocks on increased global borrowing had initially lifted Europe's STOXX 600 index, but it was back near a 6-month low as the early momentum faded.
Italy's benchmark 10-year government bond yield also moved toward a 4-1/2-year high as Economy Minister Giovanni Tria struck a resolute tone on his controversial budget plans in Rome's parliament.
There was plenty more to keep the stress levels elevated.
The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global growth forecast on Monday for the first time since 2016.
Asian shares had then fallen to their lows after China briefly allowed its currency to slip past a psychological bulwark. Pakistan's rupee slumped about 5 percent in an apparent devaluation ahead of what looks likely to be another IMF program.
""It all feels like it's quite nervous here over whether things going to break (out of ranges) or not,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX Strategy John Hardy.
He pointed to the rising U.S. and Japanese government bond yields which tend to set the bar for borrowing costs globally as well as the latest pressure on China's yuan.
China's central bank fixed its yuan rate at 6.9019 per dollar on Tuesday, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9120 in the spot market.
The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips edge up 0.3 percent. Yet that followed a 4.3 percent slide on Monday which was the largest daily fall since early 2016.
Japan's Nikkei fell 1.3 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbor yen and as yields on Tokyo's government bonds tested the 0.15 percent cap [JP10YTN=JBTC] the Bank of Japan effectively has on them.
""Risk sentiment is in a foul mood and stocks are sinking everywhere,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note.
""With Chinese economic momentum continuing to weaken alongside increasing pressure from the United States, currency weakness is the obvious release valve,"" they warned. ""A lurch through the 7.0 level by year end is possible.""
A senior U.S. Treasury official on Monday expressed concern at the fall in the yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with Chinese officials this week.
On Wall Street, futures were pointing lower again. The tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen for the third straight day on Monday and growth stocks were pressured by worries rising bond yields might ultimately hobble the economy.
NO SAFETY NET
Yields on 10-year Treasury paper notched a new seven-year top on Tuesday at 3.252 percent.
Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now as rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening.
Yet recently the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed.
""The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the US growth prospects and policy projections,"" said Damien McColough, Westpac's head of rates strategy.
""The Fed's expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored-in.""
That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood up 0.15 percent at 95.88, from a low of 93.814 a couple of weeks ago.
The dollar had less luck on the safe-haven yen, pulling back to 113.16 from a 114.54 peak last week.
The euro was undermined by political troubles in Italy and loitered at $1.1476, well off September's $1.1815 top.
Italy's borrowing costs have surged as a war of words between Rome and the European Union over the country's budget plans escalated.
The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds hovered at 3.615 percent, just off February 2014 highs, while Italy's FTSE MIB clawed up 0.3 percent having hit its weakest since April 2017 on Monday.
In commodity markets, gold got a modest safety bid at $1,191.10, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Industrial bellwethers copper and nickel jumped 1.4 and 2 percent.
Oil prices also rose as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, are declining in the run-up to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions and as a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico.

Brent crude added 50 cents to $84.41 a barrel and U.S. crude firmed 41 cents to $74.70.

1483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Trump Tariffs Push Small Firms to Plead for Same Relief as Apple,"(Bloomberg) -- Paul Shekoski thinks he presented a good case why the weather stations and other products his company makes in China should be spared from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. As a small-scale employer, he’s not optimistic he will win.
Shekoski, chief executive of the Primex Family of Companies in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, is among the hundreds of U.S. companies filing requests by Tuesday’s deadline for exclusions from the initial round of tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. While Shekoski has testified against the duties, asked elected representatives for help and filed for exclusions on almost 80 products, he puts the odds of getting them approved at less than 10 percent.
“It’s swimming upstream,” said Shekoski, whose business employs about 200 people. “At the end of the day, we’re fairly small and not very visible, so we’re kind of caught in the process.”
Companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). successfully avoided having tariffs imposed on products, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and HP Inc. are among those seeking duty exclusions for goods such as the China-built Buick Envision and toner cartridges. But some smaller businesses such as Primex say they fear they lack the clout and resources to prevail, and they can’t afford to quickly switch suppliers.
Threaten Business
Shekoski said his supply chain was built over three decades and the duties are enough to wipe out his annual profit, which would threaten the 75-year-old business.
Meanwhile Ohio-based Weastec Inc. has filed more than 60 requests for exclusions from tariffs on switches and other automotive parts it imports from a sister company in China for warehousing and just-in-time delivery to Honda and other automakers in the U.S., said Doug Ernst, senior manager of operations at the firm, which employs about 190.
The parts are made with unique tooling and manufacturing processes that only exist in China and can’t be produced in a cost-effective manner in the U.S. or any other country, Ernst said. The initial round of duties would add $635,000 in costs in the coming year, and the total with the third tranche of duties would be $4.1 million, he said.
“I hope I’m wrong, but I would think that the bigger players would get more consideration than folks like us would,’’ Ernst said. “Money talks and the big businesses get more press and economically they’re more, I guess, critical to the overall country.’’
Each request for exclusion is judged by career trade experts on the same criteria, regardless of the requester, the Office of the U.S. Office of Trade Representative said in a statement. Decisions are based on whether a product is available only from China, whether duties “would cause severe economic harm” to the company or U.S. interests, and whether the item is strategically important.
More Duties
The Trump administration has imposed three rounds of tariffs, starting with 25 percent on $34 billion in goods July 6 and on $16 billion worth of products Aug. 23. A 10 percent duty on $200 billion took effect last month and is set to increase to 25 percent on Jan. 1, while Trump has threatened even more duties on top of that.
Before each tranche of tariffs, hundreds of U.S. companies and trade groups testified at public hearings seeking to avoid the duties, most unsuccessfully. The White House spared some categories of products, including those that cover the Apple Watch and AirPods as well as fitness trackers from Fitbit Inc.
Filing Deadline
Exclusions are the final chance for companies to avoid the duties. Besides Tuesday’s filing deadline for the initial tranche of tariffs, companies must file requests for exclusions from the $16 billion list by Dec. 18. While the Trump administration hasn’t put an exclusion process in place for the $200 billion list, the National Retail Federation and 120 other organizations in the Americans for Free Trade coalition have asked USTR to include one.
The USTR has begun to issue decisions, and of the more than 2,000 requests posted as of Oct. 4, 108 have been denied and 25 are being reviewed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to determine whether an exclusion can be administered, according to data published by the government.
Chicago-based Hallmark Industries Inc., which has 10 employees and supplies water pumps and motors, had four exclusion requests denied and expected that, President Henry Huang said. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports, and granting exclusions undermines that effort, he said.
“If you exclude everything made in China, pretty much this whole tariff thing is a waste,’’ Huang said.
Trade War
Mike Bergmeier, president and principle owner of Shield Industries Inc. in South Hutchinson, Kansas, said he supports what the administration is trying to do but can’t afford a protracted trade war. Bergmeier said he only filed exclusion requests on his agricultural equipment parts that have never been made in the U.S. While they technically could be manufactured outside of China, the time and cost it would take isn’t practical for the company with 42 employees.
“It’s not going to hurt anybody except me and my company and my employment,’’ he said.
Robert Piazza, chief executive officer of California-based Price Pump Co. with 36 employees, said he doesn’t have the political pull or ability to lobby as an Apple or other large company. But he’s filed for exclusions on metal castings he imports from China because they would cost about three times as much made elsewhere, and he’s obligated to try.
“I would hope that government would be objective, but I think that’s just wishful thinking,’’ Piazza said."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday he was ""hopeful and optimistic"" that industrial relations issues would not damage the airline further this year after strikes contributed to a rare profit warning last week.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier cut its full-year profit forecast by 12 percent on Oct. 1 and warned that worse may follow if recent strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.
In an interview with Reuters in Brussels, O'Leary said management was making progress in talks with unions and was hopeful there would not be a further financial hit this year although there is ""always a risk."" 
""I am hopeful and optimistic that we are making real progress with the unions and that we won't have any further damage to the business this year,"" O'Leary said. 
""But the airline industry is under significant pressure. The oil price is now up at $85 ... it's not a good time for unions to be creating disharmony.""
Asked about comments by Ryanair management during an Oct. 1 analyst conference call, quoted by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), that the airline was working to resolve all union deals in the next 3-5 months, O'Leary said: ""I don't think it is helpful to put a timetable on it.""

O'Leary pointed to breakthroughs in talks with unions in Ireland and Italy and said Ryanair ""hopes to make similar progress in other countries in the coming months.""

LONDON (Reuters) -  Aviva  (L:AV) CEO Mark Wilson has agreed to step down from his role after a sweeping restructuring of the British insurer during six years at the helm failed to translate into improved shareholder returns.
Wilson will be replaced temporarily by Chairman Adrian Montague while a permanent successor is appointed, a task the company said on Tuesday it aimed to complete within the next four months after assessing internal and external candidates.
Wilson will remain at the group until April to help with the transition. Aiding Montague will be a ""Chairman's Committee"" of Andy Briggs, CEO of UK Insurance, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Stoddard and Maurice Tulloch, CEO, International Insurance.
""There is much further to go in accelerating our strategic development and enhancing shareholder value. We have agreed with Mark this is the right time for a new leader to ensure Aviva delivers to its full potential,"" Montague said.
During his time at Aviva, Wilson led the company's 5.6 billion pound ($7.33 billion) takeover of Friends Life in 2016 in the sector's biggest acquisition in more than a decade. 
The money-spinning deal helped increase the company's assets under management to more than 300 billion pounds.
He also oversaw company's exit from a number of markets, falling from 28 markets to 14, as well as increasing operating profit and ramping up investment on technology.
Despite the restructuring, though, Aviva's share price has underwhelmed. It is down 8.2 percent in the year to date, lagging a 6 percent decline in the FTSE 100 (FTSE), and around 8 percent below its level at the start of 2016.
Separately, Aviva said it continued to perform well and remains on track to deliver operating earnings per share growth of greater than 5 percent in 2018 and to achieve a dividend payout ratio of 55-60 percent of operating earnings per share by 2020.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>","Citigroup, Deutsche Bank face Australian court in landmark cartel case","By Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian units of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) faced court in Sydney on Tuesday accused of criminal cartel conduct over a A$3 billion ($2.1 billion) stock issue, in a landmark case being watched around the world.
Australian authorities filed criminal charges in June against the two subsidiaries as well as Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and six senior bankers over the sale of ANZ shares in 2015, and subsequent trading by the underwriters.
Lawyers jammed into the courtroom in downtown Sydney for the first administrative hearing of the case, which could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide.
The government accuses the banks of forming a criminal cartel to either ""directly or indirectly"" restrict the supply of ANZ shares or maintain the price of ANZ shares, according to court documents.
The banks have denied wrongdoing. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which underwrote the capital raising along with Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, has not been charged and has not commented on the case.
Charges have also been brought against six executives - ANZ former treasurer Rick Moscati; Citi former Australia head Stephen Roberts; Citi's current Australia head of capital markets, John McLean; Citi's London-based head of foreign exchange trading, Itay Tuchman; Deutsche's former Australia chief, Michael Ormaechea; and Deutsche's former Australia capital markets head, Michael Richardson.
If convicted, the companies could face penalties of up to A$10 million or triple the benefit of the conduct. The individuals charged could face 10 years in jail.
The matter was adjourned until Feb. 5 and the prosecution ordered to file the full details of their case by Dec. 11.
The allegations stem from an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country's competition watchdog.
ANZ, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup declined to comment on the case, but Citigroup referred Reuters to a previous statement in which it said it had ""operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades"".
""This is a highly technical area and if the ACCC believes there are matters to address, these should be clarified by law or regulation or consultation,"" it added.
All six bankers were excused from appearing personally and none were present. Lawyers on their behalf pressed the prosecution to file a statement of facts, which would disclose in detail exactly what the banks and bankers are accused of.
Prosecutor Ruth Higgins said there was ""no present obligation"" to file the details while they were still being compiled.
None of the executives charged in the case has commented publicly.
The case comes as Australia's financial sector comes under intense scrutiny from a separate public inquiry that has uncovered widespread misconduct.

The fund said in its updated World Economic Outlook that it was now expecting growth of 3.7%, down from the 3.9% growth it forecast in July. It was the first downgrade since July 2016.
Worsening financial conditions and capital outflows were putting pressure on emerging markets, while escalating trade tension between the U.S. and its trade partners also clouded global economic outlook, the IMF said.
""U.S. growth will decline once parts of its fiscal stimulus go into reverse,"" IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a statement. ""Notwithstanding the present demand momentum, we have downgraded our 2019 U.S. growth forecast owing to the recently enacted tariffs on a wide range of imports from China and China’s retaliation.""
The fund also reduced its growth outlook for China to 6.2% from 6.4% for the year 2019.
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports so far this year, and Beijing retaliated with levies on $110 billion of U.S. goods.
Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.73 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped by 0.7% while the S&P 500 closed largely unchanged at 2,884.43.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 1.3% lower by 9:40PM ET (01:40 GMT) as traders returned after a long weekend. A stronger yen was cited as headwind for local equities.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both rose 0.6%, while the Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.4%.
On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi accused the U.S. of “constantly escalating trade friction toward China,"" and making ""groundless criticism of China's domestic and foreign policies”in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo responded by saying: ""The issues that you have characterized, we have a fundamental disagreement.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia said on Tuesday it will refund fees taken out of dead client accounts and unwind a controversial system of charging customers commissions on financial products.
The changes, sparked by damaging revelations from a powerful inquiry into financial sector misconduct, come during a time of upheaval for Australia's biggest financial institutions which are facing unprecedented scrutiny from the public, courts and lawmakers.
Australia's biggest bank said in a statement it would remove certain fees on legacy wealth products and would launch a program to refund unauthorized advice fees charged to deceased estates in the last 12 years, among other initiatives.
It would also rebate all ongoing commissions to financial planning customers charged on old products not caught by laws banning such fees.
The changes to its fee structures would cost the bank at least A$45 million ($31.8 million) a year, CBA said.
""The changes announced today continue the process of reform underway in our wealth management businesses and form part of our response to specific issues identified this year through the Royal Commission,"" CBA Wealth Management Chief Operating Officer Michael Venter said in the statement.
The inquiry, called a Royal Commission, released a scathing interim report into banking and wealth management practices last month after nine months of grueling public hearings. A final report, that could recommend legal charges and a regulatory overhaul, is due in February.
Among Australia's ""Big Four"" banks, CBA has taken the biggest reputational hit, after it conceded selling insurance to tens of thousands of customers who were not eligible to claim against it, charged customers for services-not-rendered, took fees out of dead client accounts and double-charged interest to thousands of customers due to a coding error.
CBA's changes to its wealth management business are just the latest example of how the inquiry has impacted Australia's financial sector more broadly. 
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said on Monday it would take a A$711 million hit to profit due to higher costs including compensation for customers stung by poor bank practices, sending its shares sharply lower.
Last month, Westpac Banking Corp, the country's second-largest bank, said its annual cash earnings would fall by about A$235 million on account of provisions for customer refunds and litigation.
CBA is due to release a quarterly trading update on Nov. 7, followed by its half year results in February.
Shares in CBA were flat shortly after the market opened on Tuesday in a weak market.
Australia's highest profile bankers are scheduled to start appearing before a parliamentary committee this week, where they will be grilled over their business practices.
CBA Chief Executive Matt Comyn, who took over the role in April after formerly heading CBA's retail banking operations, is the first chief executive scheduled to appear, on Thursday.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Column: Unfazed by record short U.S. bonds position, hedge funds gun for 3.50 percent - McGeever","By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds may have trimmed their record bet against U.S. Treasuries, as the latest data show, but the 10-year yield's spike to fresh multi-year highs in the days since suggests that short position will now be even greater.
Given the scale of that short position, you might expect an imminent squeeze and the yield falling back down to 3.00 percent or below. Instead, a test of 3.50 percent looks more likely.
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures for the week ending Tuesday, Oct. 2 show funds scaled back their net short position in 10-year Treasury futures to 740,192 contracts from a record 756,316 contracts the week before.
That fits nicely with the 10-year yield's move over the period in question: it eased to 3.05 percent from 3.10 percent. In the days since, however, it has surged to 3.25 percent, a level not seen since May 2011.
The speed and extent of that spike are noteworthy. The rise of 10.5 basis points on Wednesday, Oct. 3 was the biggest one-day rise since the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, leading to a weekly rise of more than 17 bps.
The 2s/10s curve, the gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields, steepened by 10 bps last week, the second-biggest weekly widening since November 2016.
The daily standard deviation in the 10-year Treasury yield, which measures its divergence from the mean, also shot up last week, reaching its highest level in four months and second highest since the 2016 U.S. election.
On top of that, the rise in Treasury market implied volatility last week, as measured by the Merrill Lynch one-month Mermove index, was the biggest since the last week of 2014.
All that points to an acceleration of the selling momentum that has resulted in the record short position and breakout in yields.
September was a bad month for Treasuries. They lost 0.934 percent, the steepest monthly decline since January, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and  Barclays  (LON:BARC). The 0.55 percent fall on Oct. 3 was the biggest one-day loss since Feb. 2017.
But that's music to the ears of traders, investors and funds shorting Treasuries, right?
Preliminary data shows the Barclayhedge Fixed Income Arbitrage index rose 0.62 percent in September, the best month since February 2017. It is up 1.87 percent so far this year.
The Global Macro index also posted a positive performance in September, according to the preliminary data, although it is still down year to date.
Eurekahedge's Fixed Income index rose 0.44 percent in September, lifting year-to-date returns to 1.40 pct. The Global Macro index fared worse, posting a return of 0.17 percent in September to widen the 2018 returns so far to -1.27 percent.
The Commodity Trading Advisors/Managed Futures index, however, which also tracks the performance of speculative accounts trading U.S. Treasuries, posted a -0.40 percent return in September, its worst month since march. Year-to-date returns are -1.60 percent.
The Fed raised interest rates last month for the eighth time this cycle and removed from its statement its longstanding reference to policy being ""accommodative."" It still foresees another rate hike this year and three more next year.
If last week's surge in yields is any indication, the market is finally falling in line with the Fed's thinking. Hedge funds will probably be reloading up on their short positions, too.

Kessler has spent nearly three decades in consumer packaged goods business and has worked with  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) and Clorox (N:CLX). He was most recently the chief executive officer and president at the Lorillard Tobacco Co [LO.UL]. 
Lorillard's market value surged to about $28 billion from about $9 billion during Kessler's tenure as CEO between 2010 and 2015, Perrigo said. Lorillard was acquired by Reynolds American Inc (N:RAI) in 2015.
Earlier this year, Perrigo said it would separate its generics prescription business, which has been a drag on results, to focus on consumer healthcare following a strategic review.
""Given the decision to separate the Rx pharmaceuticals business and pursue a consumer-focused strategy, the board is looking forward to partnering with him to develop Perrigo's strategic plan,"" board Chairman Rolf Classon said in a statement. 
The separation of the generics prescription business is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019, with the board exploring all options, including a possible tax-efficient separation to shareholders, a sale or merger, the company has said. 
Rohrhoff, who joined Perrigo in January, spent seven years as chief executive of Gerresheimer AG (DE:GXIG).

Under Rohrhoff, Perrigo's shares have shed 21 percent of their value, through Monday's close.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell on Monday for the third straight day as a sell-off in Chinese markets sparked concerns about slowing global economic growth, though the S&P 500 pared losses to end nearly flat.
Beijing announced a steep cut in the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs and spurring growth amid the trade spat. In Monday's trading session, the first trading session for mainland China investors since new U.S. and Chinese tariffs went into effect, both Chinese stocks and the yuan slid.
The possibility of tapering global growth, led by China's slowdown, spurred a retreat from the high-flying tech sector, which declined 1.2 percent. 
Among the biggest drags on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), down 1.1 percent, and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc, down 3.2 percent.
By contrast, defensive sectors, including utilities, consumer staples, and real estate, led the S&P's major sectors in percentage gains.
""Growth stocks are so sensitive to global growth expectations,"" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. ""Any time you see concern about that, you'll see the reversal of that trade.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.73 points, or 0.15 percent, to 26,486.78, the S&P 500 lost 1.14 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,884.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 52.50 points, or 0.67 percent, to 7,735.95.
The U.S. bond market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.
Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc were pressured after Google announced that data from up to 500,000 users of its social network Google+ may have been exposed to external developers. The company said it would shut down the consumer version of Google+. Alphabet shares ended 1 percent lower. 
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co shares rose for the sixth day in a row after the company said it plans to sell $1 billion in energy investments to Apollo Global Management LLC. GE shares ended the session up 3.3 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 138 new lows.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.15%. The S&P 500 closed flat, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.67%.
Stocks clawed back the bulk of their losses moments before the close, even as technology stocks fell victim to selling pressure amid investor fears that U.S. government bond yields will continue to rise, denting demand for riskier investment like stocks.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was in the spotlight in late-afternoon trade amid a double whammy of negative reports.
CNBC reported, citing execs at multiple media agencies, that advertisers were ditching Google search for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ads, while The Wall Street Journal said the tech giant covered up a software glitch on its social media platform, Google+, which had exposed the data of about 500,000 users.
U.S. Treasuries, which did not trade on Monday as the bond market was shut for Columbus Day, rose to multi-year highs last week, sparking a selloff in stocks.
The bearish sentiment in stocks was underlined by a jump in the so-called fear index, or CBOE Volatility Index, on the back of a wobble in global markets.
European markets slumped on Italy budget concerns, while Chinese stocks saw sharp declines, even as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) introduced pro-market measures on Sunday.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) closed higher.

1525,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Canada's Largest Oil Refinery Shut After Diesel Unit Blast,"(Bloomberg) -- Irving Oil Corp.’s refinery in New Brunswick, a major supplier of fuel to the northeastern U.S., was shut after an explosion and fire in a diesel unit.
The hydrotreater, which removes sulfur from diesel to make fuel that meets environmental standards, was in the part of the refinery that was still running, while other units were shut for maintenance that had been planned to start at the beginning of the month.
It’s “too soon” to tell how long the refinery and the unit will be down, Kevin Scott, Irving’s chief refining and supply officer, said in a press conference. Irving is working to minimize any impact on customers, using fuel it has in tanks and reaching out to other suppliers, he said. Four workers were treated for non life-threatening injuries at a local hospital.
Saint John is the biggest Canadian oil refinery, able to process about 300,000 barrels a day of crude. About half of the plant’s fuel is sent to the northeast U.S, making it a key provider of gasoline and diesel to New York and New England. In September, tankers hauled 2.78 million barrels of gasoline, 959,000 barrels of diesel and 119,000 barrels of jet fuel down the coast, according to U.S. Customs import data compiled by Bloomberg.
Market Reaction
Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange reversed an earlier decline to rise 0.4 percent to $2.0937 a gallon, while diesel gained 0.1 percent to $2.3942.
The market will be waiting to find out “the severity of the damage,” said Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Florida. “If it’s something that is reparable quickly and within the normal measure of scheduled maintenance, it probably won’t change the supply circumstances of gasoline in New York. If it’s of long duration, it could. New York is very well supplied now.”
Ample gasoline stockpiles along the U.S. East Coast may limit the price impact. Inventories in New England are above the five-year seasonal average, while tanks in New York Harbor are stuffed with the most gasoline for this time of year in U.S. government data stretching back to 1990. Heating homes may become a bit more expensive this winter, however, with New England and New York-area distillate stocks below the seasonal average.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 03:53PM ET</span>","Jason Karp to shut hedge fund Tourbillon, focus on health and wellness","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Tourbillon Capital Partners is shutting down after several years of poor returns, making it the third well-known fund to announce plans to close its doors within a week.
""We have recently not delivered the results that you expect of us and what we know we are capable of,"" Jason Karp, who has been running Tourbillon for six years, wrote to clients in a letter seen by Reuters.
He said he plans to spend his time focusing on private and public companies within the health and wellness industry.
At its peak, Tourbillon managed roughly $3 billion in assets and Karp was named one of the hedge fund industry's rising stars in 2012 after stints as co-chief investment officer at hedge fund Carlson Capital and as director of research and portfolio manager at SAC's CR Intrinsic Investors Group. It currently manages over $1 billion. 
A spokesman declined to comment. 
Last week, Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital, which oversees roughly $12 billion, announced to clients that it would be shutting down. Criterion Capital also said last week that it would be shutting down, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.
Two years ago, Karp spoke for many hedge fund managers when he said the industry, once largely united in its dislike for Donald Trump, now felt fund managers could benefit from the new administration and make more money by judging companies on their earnings.

Now he said he plans to keep investing in the stock market but in ""radically different and unconstrained manner."" Fueled by a deeply personal interest in the health and wellness sector rooted in his own experience with autoimmune diseases in his early 20s, Karp said he would spend most of his time on this sector. In part he plans to grow Hu Kitchen, a food products company and restaurant his family launched six years ago.

1527,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","Morgan Stanley Says It Was Wrong About Treasury Yields, Scraps Call on Curve Flattening","(Bloomberg) --  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has thrown in the towel on one of its high-profile predictions for 2018 -- a call that the U.S. Treasury yield curve from the two-year to the 30-year would flatten completely.
The forecast was based on expectations for gradual monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and deterioration in the forward growth outlook. Morgan Stanley’s global head of interest-rate strategy Matthew Hornbach broadened it in June, adding a two- to 10-year flattener and a bet that the 10-year yield had peaked for the year at 3.12 percent in mid-May. Investors should go long at the prevailing level of 2.90 percent with a view toward a mid-2019 level under 2.75 percent, he said at the time.
Last week, the pain threshold -- or at least the end of Hornbach’s patience -- was reached, as the 10-year yield climbed to fresh year-to-date highs north of 3.20 percent. The two- to 30-year curve spread, which fell as low as 32.9 basis points in September, topped 50 basis points. On Friday, Hornbach canceled the long recommendation as well as the flatteners.
“We were wrong to expect Treasury yields to be capped at previous year-to-date highs,” Hornbach said in a note titled “Our mea culpa.” Morgan Stanley’s inclination to be long duration “ended the moment yields broke those levels.”
What changed? A second straight month of strong U.S. economic data “has caused investors to reevaluate the prospects for both Fed policy and future economic growth.” That trend could continue, Hornbach said.
Steepening could go further as well, whether yields rise or fall. But it’s too soon to bet on it because if the economic data keep surprising to the upside, investors will start expecting Fed policy makers “to become even more hawkish into year-end,” and the curve “will find it tough to trend steeper.”"

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) is close to hiring  Citigroup  (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JP Morgan (N:JPM) to help with the potential stock market listing of its truck unit Traton, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) said last month that Traton should by year-end be in shape for a potential stock market listing, which is expected to take place in mid-2019.
VW plans to convert Traton's legal structure to a Societas Europaea (SE) and to shortly mandate investment banks and legal advisers for a possible initial public offering, Volkswagen said at the time.
VW, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Officials at Citi were not immediately available for comment.
Bloomberg earlier on Monday reported that the banks were likely to be mandated for the IPO.
Volkswagen is targeting proceeds of more than 6 billion euros ($7 billion) with a potential listing of its truck and bus subsidiary, the division's chief executive had said earlier this year.
Volkswagen has said in the past that it is considering a listing or partial listing of the trucks division, but that this would not happen in 2018.
VW has plans to build a global trucks business by integrating its MAN and Scania divisions to challenge rivals  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo (ST:VOLVb).

A flotation could also allow Volkswagen Truck & Bus to build a war chest to completely buy out (N:NAV) Navistar, a U.S. truck maker in which it already owns a 16.85 percent stake.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), commonly known by the acronym FANG, traded lower hours before the close, dragging the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite down more than 1%.
The rout comes as investors weigh up the benefit of holding high-flying tech stocks ahead of earnings, particularly as the surge in U.S. government bond yields to multi-year highs last week has dampened investor appetite for risk.
Shares of Alphabet came under added selling pressure late afternoon, as investors digested a report suggesting the tech giant covered up a software glitch in its social media platform, Google+, which had exposed the data of hundreds of thousands of users.
Apple was well off its lows after Citigroup lifted its price target on the tech giant's stock to $265 from $230. Apple's push into original content, meanwhile, was boosted Monday amid reports the iPhone maker had entered into talks with BT Group (LON:BT) to boost its entry into pay TV.
Elsewhere in tech, semiconductor stocks were struggling after Raymond James warned there is more pain ahead in the sector.
""We are cutting estimates across much of the space. … Net, we think it's too early to call a bottom, despite what's now widespread bearish sentiment among investors,"" Raymond James said."
1530,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","Former Tesco executives encouraged profit overstatement, misled stock market, court told","LONDON (Reuters) - Two former senior executives of  Tesco  (L:TSCO) abused their positions to encourage practices that resulted in a 250 million pounds ($327 million) overstatement of expected profits and misled the stock market, a prosecutor told a London court on Monday. 
With a motive to support the share price of Britain's biggest retailer, secure huge compensation packages and retain their jobs, the two executives ""pressurized or coerced"" unidentified subordinates into compliance, lead prosecutor Sasha Wass told London's Southwark Crown Court. 
Christopher Bush, 52, who was managing director of Tesco UK, and John Scouler, 50, who was UK food commercial director, both deny charges of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting.
Legal representatives for Bush and Scouler declined to comment ahead of the trial. 
According to the indictment, Bush and Scouler concealed Tesco's true financial position from its auditors and other employees between Feb. 1, 2014 and Sept. 23, 2014. 
Bush and Scouler ""were in positions of trust and were paid huge compensation packages in order to safeguard the financial health of the company,"" said Wass. 
The court heard that in 2014 Bush's compensation package including share schemes was 2.8 million pounds, while Scouler's was 1.4 million pounds, according to official documents.
Wass said that, having dominated the British retail market for decades, by 2014 Tesco had seen a dramatic reduction in profit and market share, hurt by the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. 
She told the jury the case centered on two statements made by Tesco to the stock market in 2014. In the first, the firm published a trading update on Aug. 29 in which it downgraded its financial guidance. In the second, on Sept. 22, Tesco said it had found a 250 million pound overstatement of its expected profit, mainly due to booking commercial deals with suppliers too early. 
In the following days and weeks, Tesco suspended eight senior members of staff, including Bush and Scouler. Tesco's shares lost 2 billion pounds of value and the retailer was plunged into the worst crisis in its near 100-year history. 
The profit forecast overstatement, identified three weeks after Dave Lewis took over as chief executive from Philip Clarke, was later raised to 263 million pounds. 

Wass said Tesco employees involved in producing the false paperwork were the ""foot soldiers"". Bush and Scouler were ""generals"" at the top of the organization encouraging those under their control to record income before it had been earned in order to deliver unrealistic margin targets ""at all costs"".

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 01:14PM ET</span>",Swiss bank UBS on trial in France over alleged tax fraud,"By Inti Landauro and Emmanuel Jarry
PARIS (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), its French unit and six executives faced charges of aggravated tax fraud and money laundering on Monday, the first day of a trial into allegations they helped wealthy clients avoid taxes in France.
After seven years of investigation and aborted settlement negotiations, UBS will also answer allegations that it illegally solicited clients in France. It risks being fined up to 5 billion euros ($5.76 billion) plus potential damages to the French taxman for the missing revenue.
On the first day of the court hearing on Monday, the defendants' lawyers raised technicalities to try to get the court to drop the money laundering charges and limit the proceedings to tax fraud, which carries lighter penalties.
UBS's lawyer Jean Veil said the French state was asking for 1.6 billion euros in damages, which he told the court was excessive.
""They are asking crazy amounts,"" he told the court.
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, has said it intends to firmly defend its position.
""After more than six years of legal proceedings, we will finally have the opportunity to respond to the often unfounded allegations that were frequently leaked to the media, in clear violation of the presumption of innocence and the legal confidentiality of the process,"" UBS said in a statement ahead of the trial. The bank said it would reserve its arguments for the court.
Banks have become more rigorous after the 2008 financial crisis and the banking scandals that followed, while tighter regulations have forced the industry to become more cautious, analysts say.
UBS's trial in France follows a similar judicial process in the United States, where the bank in 2009 accepted to pay $780 million in a settlement. In Germany, UBS agreed to a 300 million euro fine in 2014.
During the French investigation, UBS turned down a settlement offer of 1.1 billion euros made by the authorities. The amount corresponded to what the Swiss bank had already paid as a court bond, according to judicial sources.
The investigation into UBS in the United States began after employee Bradley Birkenfeld revealed a scheme to funnel wealthy customers' cash from the United States to Switzerland, bypassing the U.S. taxman.
Birkenfeld spoke separately to French investigators. Even though he is not due to testify in court in Paris he intends to attend all the hearings. 
The whistleblower told Reuters that he hoped for a heavy penalty for the Swiss bank. ""If they set an example with UBS, most other banks will be scared,"" he said.
For money laundering, French criminal law lets judges enforce fines as high as half the amount laundered. In the French case, prosecutors estimate that up to 10.6 billion euros was denied to the French tax authorities.
The court hearing is due to resume on Thursday and the case is scheduled to continue until Nov. 15.

PARIS (Reuters) - Planemaking boss Guillaume Faury was named as the next chief executive of Airbus (PA:AIR) on Monday, ending months of uncertainty over the leadership of Europe's largest aerospace group and underlining the dominance of its commercial jet arm.
The 50-year-old Frenchman will replace German-born Tom Enders when he retires at the next shareholder meeting in April 2019, the Franco-German-Spanish company said in a statement.
Chairman Denis Ranque, a Frenchman, will step down when his own term expires in 2020, it added.
The announcement came after the board brought forward discussions on the handover amid a growing leadership vacuum in the wake of a series of management departures, internal and external graft probes and the pre-announced exit of Enders.
It did so as the board grappled with the need to avoid appearing indecisive following months of uncertainty over the top job and a string of mid-level and senior departures. 
On Sept. 28, Reuters exclusively reported Airbus was moving swiftly towards appointing Faury as its next CEO and could announce a decision within weeks.
Faury was appointed head of the core planemaking business last December after Fabrice Bregier agreed to quit following a power battle with Enders, in a shake-up that also saw the German CEO draw back from plans to seek a third term in 2019.
Pressure to end uncertainty over the CEO job grew with the resignation of sales chief Eric Schulz in August, with the former Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) executive's abrupt departure strengthening calls for an internal successor to Enders..
FAURY SEEN COMBINING ROLES
A person close to Enders denied there had been any leadership vacuum since he announced his intention not to seek a third term and said he had remained involved in the business.
As CEO of the only serious rival to U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA), Faury will continue to tackle industrial problems affecting some jet deliveries while overseeing smaller but increasingly autonomous helicopter and defense units.
People familiar with the matter said he would not be replaced in his current role, though this did not exclude shoring up the operational management as two top industrial executives prepare to retire at the end of this year.
The Airbus planemaking business merged with the parent group last year, but until now had maintained separate figureheads.
Faury will also need to restore morale shattered by a probe into the use of middlemen, now in its third year and which has left management sidelined as board directors pilot the inquiry.
Airbus said its board would begin selecting a new chairman ""in due course"", with a view to ""maintaining international diversity"" at board and management level.
Sources said last month that Faury's hiring could herald changes in the board as Ranque would step down in 2020. 

Airbus usually divides chairman and CEO jobs between French and German nationals, though the ability of Paris and Berlin governments to dish out top jobs for purely political reasons was halted in 2013. Although their power is curtailed and Airbus claims full independence, the two governments each maintain a voice as 11-percent shareholders and major defense buyers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. software giant Microsoft (O:MSFT) is set to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $7.5 billion purchase of privately held coding website GitHub, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Microsoft announced the deal in June, its largest acquisition since it bought LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) for $26 billion in 2016. The GitHub deal is expected to boost the U.S. software giant's cloud computing business and challenge market leader Amazon (O:AMZN).
GitHub, the world's largest code host, has more than 28 million developers using its platform. 
It will become a part of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit once the acquisition is completed.
Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has tried to assuage users' worries that GitHub might favor Microsoft products over competitors after the deal, saying GitHub would continue to be an open platform that works with all public clouds.

The European Commission, which is set to decide on the deal by Oct. 19, did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Microsoft declined to comment.

1548,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Greek Banks Tumble as Italy Adds to Capital Worry,"(Bloomberg) -- Greek banks slid as contagion from Italy exacerbated concerns they’ll need to raise more capital to deal with their mountains of bad loans.
The FTSE/Athex Bank Index was down 4.9 percent at 3:18 p.m. in Athens, having earlier fallen as much as 7.9 percent. Eurobank Ergasias SA tumbled as much as 14.4 percent before paring its losses to 8.6 percent, while Piraeus Bank dropped 9.8 percent, having earlier fallen 13.6 percent.
Greek banks have fallen more than 40 percent this year amid doubts they can clean up their balance sheets fast enough, as supervisors pressure them to cut their bad-debt holdings. They have also been hurt by bearish market sentiment emanating from Italy, where the government is embroiled in a standoff with the European Commission over how big a budget deficit it can run.
Greek bonds also fell on Monday, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes rising 13 basis points to 4.64 percent, its highest since Sept. 5. After exiting its bailout in August, the government needs its borrowing costs to drop before it can tap markets.
The banks’ drop on Monday was the fourth decline in the last five trading sessions. Banks rallied on Thursday after Bloomberg News reported the country is weighing a plan to let lenders unload bad loans into a special purpose vehicle, though that plan could run afoul of European Commission state-aid rules, according to Fitch Solutions Macro Research, part of the Fitch Group.
“The sector’s profitability is under pressure and progress on reducing non-performing loans has been slow,” Fitch analysts wrote in a note on Monday. “Uncertainty as to how the Greek government will support the sector and whether the solution would involve private investor losses will weigh on investor sentiment, and lead to higher external financing costs.”

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday as fears a trade war could have a bigger impact than expected on China added to concerns that rising U.S. interest rates are gradually making stock markets less attractive for investors.
A mounting clash between Rome and Brussels over the Italian government's spending plans also soured the mood.
""The re-emergence of the Italy/EU budget deficit battle as a key market mover proved to be a disaster for the European indices,"" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.
Shares in Asia slumped overnight despite Beijing's central bank increasing liquidity to offset the effects of the tariff row with the U.S., while Wall Street started in the red.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index fell 1.1 percent to its lowest close in around six months, while the export-oriented German index (GDAXI) fell 1.4 percent.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) suffered the most, falling 2.4 percent to its lowest in more than 17 months as banking stocks came under fresh pressure after Italy's borrowing costs soared further.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), whose large government bond holdings makes them sensitive to political risk, declined 3.7 percent, also weighing on the broader European banking sector.
Top faller on the STOXX was German fintech company Wirecard (DE:WDIG), which fell 12 percent with traders citing technical factors. Wirecard shares, which ousted Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) from the DAX index, are up 78 percent so far this year.
Hearing aid maker  William Demant  (CO:WDH) was another big faller, down 10.6 percent, on competition worries after the U.S. approved Bose Corp's new hearing aid, which can be used without a doctor's assistance. 
Shares in two other hearing aid makers, Sonova (S:SOON) and  Amplifon  (MI:AMPF), fell 8.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively.

Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) was a bright spot, up 3.9 percent after the aluminum firm received a permit helping it towards restarting its Alunorte alumina refinery at half capacity.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Brazil markets soar on strong first-round vote for Bolsonaro,"By Bruno Federowski and Paula Laier
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian markets rose on Monday after far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro ran up a huge lead in the first round of voting, boosting investors' hopes that he will tackle a growing fiscal deficit and privatize key companies.
The benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) rose 3.6 percent to 85,307, led by state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), which contributed over 500 points of the Bovespa's 2,985-point gain. 
State utility Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (SA:ELET6), which Bolsonaro has said he would privatize, soared 12 percent. 
Brazil's currency, the real (BRBY), gained 2 percent to 3.78 to the dollar, the strongest since August, while yields on interest rate futures <0#DIJ:> fell sharply.
Bolsonaro, an outspoken apologist for Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, came up short of a majority needed to avoid the runoff. He will face leftist Fernando Haddad, the former mayor of São Paulo, in a second round of voting on Oct. 28.
Brazilian markets had already rallied in recent weeks as polls showed a consistent lead for Bolsonaro, a longtime statist who made a late conversion to orthodox economic policies after tapping a University of Chicago-trained banker as his main economic adviser.
Bolsonaro, who has served for decades as a lower house lawmaker, has pledged to crack down on crime and corruption, seizing on voter anger with the establishment after a series of graft scandals he blamed on Haddad's Workers Party.
His strong showing in the polls outperformed even the most favorable major surveys and he managed to turn his once-tiny party into a powerhouse in Congress, suggesting he may have an easier-than-expected time passing reforms.
""If you take away the votes of every leftist lower house member, you'd still have enough votes to pass the necessary reforms,"" said David Souccar, who helps to manage $20 billion worth of emerging-market assets for Vontobel Quality Growth. ""Even if Haddad wins, it is clear that he would have to take steps towards the center to do so.""
Vontobel holds roughly 10 percent of its emerging-market portfolio in Brazil, compared to a 6 percent exposure for MSCI's emerging-market index (MSCIEF). It has focused on companies that would benefit from a consumption-driven recovery under a scenario of gradual fiscal reform -- such as beverages firm Ambev SA (SA:ABEV3) and Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4), the nation's largest private bank.
Itaú Unibanco and rival Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4) were, along with Petrobras, among the biggest point contributors to the Bovespa's gain. 
Souccar's bullish sentiments were widely shared. Strategists at Banco BTG Pactual SA said the benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) has been trading at multiples below its historical average and could now jump to around 90,000.
If Bolsonaro wins a runoff election, they ""wouldn't be surprised"" if the index reached 105,000, with stocks of state-controlled companies, consumption and real estate among the largest winners.
Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil strategists upgraded their recommendation on Brazilian stocks to ""overweight"" in its Latin American portfolio and forecast the index would reach 105,000 by year-end.

Sixty of 65 stocks included in the index rose on Monday, with many posting double-digit gains. Losses concentrated on export-driven firms such as wood pulp producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SA:SUZB3), which would suffer from a stronger currency.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italian ship agents consider lawsuit after bridge collapse,"By Emilio Parodi
GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Italian shipping agents who say their business has been affected by a deadly bridge collapse in Genoa are taking legal advice and considering whether to sue toll-road operator  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) if the group is found responsible.
The government has blamed an Atlantia unit, which operated the viaduct that collapsed killing 43 people on Aug. 14, for the disaster. The company is under judicial investigation, along with the transport ministry, for culpable homicide.
The unit, Autostrade per l'Italia, has denied wrongdoing, saying regular, state-supervised inspections had indicated the aging bridge was safe. A spokesman for Atlantia declined to comment. 
The shippers are also looking into lawsuits against the government if the transport ministry is held responsible. The government denies responsibility. 
Spediporto, which represents about 330 shipping agents in Genoa, says trucks are forced to take lengthy detours to and from the port since the collapse of the viaduct, which formed part of a motorway linking the city and its port with southern France. 
It fears shippers may choose alternative routes because this means an average shipping delay of more than an hour. 
""We have already contacted our legal advisers over the possibility of a collective lawsuit and we will take a final decision in the coming months when we have collected more data over the financial impact of the disaster,"" Spediporto director general Giampaolo Botta told Reuters.
The Genoa Chamber of Commerce estimates more than 14,500 businesses were impacted when a 200-meter (660-ft) section of the viaduct collapsed, including the container port which generates around 1.5 percent of Italy's gross domestic product.
It has started asking firms across the city to estimate the impact of higher transport costs arising from road detours and port delays. So far, it has spoken to 1,400 firms, said spokeswoman Anna Galleano. 
The survey is aimed at helping firms claim relief from state disaster-aid funds but the data could be used in future law s. She said the chamber had not sought legal advice ""for now"".
FINANCIAL THREATS
Civil lawsuits could take months to emerge but would pose an extra financial threat for Atlantia. Rome has already moved to revoke its national toll-road concession, worth 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) a year, and threatened it with heavy fines. 
Autostrade has set aside 500 million euros to offer initial support to families and small businesses and also to rebuild the bridge, but the chamber said early evidence suggested the total damage could be much higher.
""You can easily expect that the 500 million euros will be multiplied by four, reaching 2 billion euros,"" Chamber General Secretary Maurizio Caviglia told Reuters.
Any civil suit would have to wait until prosecutors wrapped up their investigation and could also be aimed at the transport ministry, if it was found to be culpable in its role as supervisor of safety on toll roads, said lawyer Lucio Galino.
Under the Italian law, if prosecutors took Atlantia or the transport ministry to trial, businesses could file for damages with the same court. The trial judge could at the time of sentencing award provisional damages to those businesses.
The government could also take legal steps. At a recent meeting in Genoa, state lawyers asked government representatives and local officials to keep records of extra emergency work and be ready in case it tries to claim damages against Atlantia, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Uber has around 60,000 drivers in Britain and earlier this year won back its right to operate in London after it was stripped of its license by the city's regulator.
The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) expects hundreds of drivers at least to participate in the industrial action from 1200 GMT (1300 BST) on Tuesday by not signing into the app. Protests are also planned outside Uber's offices. 
Uber drivers are not obliged to work particular hours by the firm and choose when to sign in and out of the app. 
The Silicon Valley-based company said it had improved its offering to drivers in recent months.
""We’ve introduced dozens of new features, including sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections,"" said a spokesman. 
""We continue to look at ways to help drivers increase their earnings and our door is always open if anyone wants to speak to us about any issues they're having.""
Uber has faced protests and legal action around the world as it disrupts traditional operators. 
In Britain, its drivers are self-employed, entitling them in law to few workplace rights, prompting the IWGB and others to launch legal action. 

A Court of Appeal hearing over workers' rights at the company is due later this month.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) on Monday named Hyatt Hotels Corp's (N:H) financial chief Patrick Grismer as its new chief financial officer, making another leadership change in the past year as it battles intense competition in a cooling U.S. coffee market.
Grismer's appointment completes a three-month search for a new finance chief since current CFO Scott Maw announced plans to retire in June.
Maw's announcement coincided with Executive Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz's departure from the company, who built Starbucks into a global powerhouse over four decades. 
Battling heavy competition from rivals, including high-end coffee shops and affordable fast-food chains, the company said in a memo last month that it would undergo an organizational restructuring that would see leadership changes, job losses and role expansions.
Grismer, currently serving as CFO of Hyatt Hotels, will join Starbucks on Nov. 12 and will take the role after Maw retires on Nov. 30, Starbucks said in a statement.
""As a seasoned CFO of multiple global, consumer-facing growth companies, (Patrick) brings tremendous finance expertise, a customer-centric mindset and a wealth of restaurant industry experience to Starbucks,"" company CEO Kevin Johnson said in the statement. 
Prior to joining Hyatt, Grismer held a variety of leadership positions at companies including KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants owner Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM), where he was CFO. He also worked at The Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) in finance and strategy roles over a ten year period, Starbucks said.
""We know Mr. Grismer from his time serving as YUM CFO from May 2012-February 2016 and have mixed feelings about his appointment,"" Cowen analysts said in a note pointing to Yum's stagnant stock price during his tenure as CFO. 
The analysts, however, said his tenure at Hyatt has been more fruitful, where total shareholder returns have risen 58 percent.
Maw, who has been CFO since Feb. 2014, will remain a senior consultant through March 2019 to ensure a smooth transition, the company said.

Starbucks shares, which are down 9 percent this year, were up nearly 1 percent in morning trading.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",General Motors China sales go into reverse as market stalls,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) quarterly sales in China fell for the first time in over a year, hit by faltering economic growth and a wider slowdown in the world's biggest auto market amid a whipsawing trade war with the United States.
The U.S. carmaker sold 835,934 vehicles in the third quarter ended September, down a sharp 14.9 percent from a year earlier, which the firm said was due to a ""softening"" vehicle market and issues shifting to a new engine system with its Buick brand.
""The major reasons are a softening market, slowing lower-tier cities, Buick's engine change-over and a strong Q3 last year,"" a Shanghai-based GM spokeswoman said. She added the fall was not linked to trade tensions. 
The fall marks the maiden drop since the first quarter of 2017, when GM's China sales fell 5.2 percent. GM switched to reporting only quarterly China sales earlier this year, scrapping monthly sales figures it had previously revealed.
China's automobile sales have been falling more broadly in recent months, with a slowing economy and trade frictions making consumers cautious about spending, an industry body said last month.
GM has been shifting its Buick cars to a new type of more efficient three-cylinder engine to meet emissions targets, which Chinese dealers told Reuters had hit sales because consumers were not yet convinced by the smaller engines.
""Many consumers still have concerns because they read negative comments about three-cylinder technology online, which aren't really fair,"" said a sales manager surnamed Hu at a Buick dealer in Zhejiang province.
China, the world's largest auto market, is critical for the U.S. carmaker. It sold over 4 million vehicles in the country last year, even more than it sold in the North Americas market.
GM's sales in China inched up 0.7 percent in the second quarter of the year, slowing from an 8 percent rise in the January-March quarter.
GM's joint venture in China, Shanghai GM, will also recall over 3.3 million Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles from Oct. 20 due to a defect with the suspension system, a Chinese regulator said earlier this month.

China's main auto industry body, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), is set to reveal September auto sales later this week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Denmark's financial watchdog faces an inquiry by the European Union's banking supervisor into how it supervised  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), which last week said it was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over alleged money laundering.
""We are doing preliminary breach of union law inquiries on ... the Danske bank case in Denmark,"" European Banking Authority Chair Andrea Enria told the European Parliament.
As in a similar EBA probe into how Malta's supervisor oversaw one of its banks, the watchdog has powers to make recommendations that national supervisors must follow.
Enria also told the parliament on Monday that the EBA is launching a review into how all the EU's member states apply anti-money laundering rules and will report by the end of 2018.
Danske Bank's revelation last month that between 2007 and 2015 payments totaling 200 million euros ($230 million) flowed through its tiny Estonian branch, many of which Denmark's largest lender said were ""suspicious"" has prompted calls for an overhaul of bank supervision in Europe.
The escalation in the Danske Bank case follows an admission in September by Dutch financial services group ING that criminals had been able to use its accounts to launder cash, a lapse which led to a 775 million euro fine.

The world's seventh-largest carmaker said in June it would invest 9 billion euros ($10.3 billion) in electric and hybrid cars over the next five years to become fully compliant with emissions regulations across regions. 
It also pledged to phase out diesel engines in European passenger cars by 2021.
The Jeep Renegade plug-in hybrid, expected in the market in early 2020, will be produced at FCA's Melfi plant in southern Italy, which is already churning out the combustion engine version of the model and the Fiat 500X crossover, FCA said. 
More than 200 million euros will be spent on the new engine, the company said, adding workers would be retrained for the new technology and the plant modernized.
By 2022, FCA plans to offer a total of 12 electric propulsion systems, including battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and full hybrids, it said, adding thirty different models would be equipped with one or more of these systems.
Former FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne had long refused to embrace electrification, saying he would only do so if selling battery-powered cars could be done at a profit.
He even urged customers not to buy FCA's Fiat 500e, its only battery-powered model, because he was losing money on each sold. But Tesla's success and the need to comply with tougher emissions rules forced Marchionne to commit to what he used to refer to as ""most painful"" spending.
Marchionne died unexpectedly in July after succumbing to complications from surgery, but his successor, Mike Manley, vowed to continue the strategy laid out in June.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>",Schroders targets British wealth boost with Lloyds tie-up,"By Simon Jessop and Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) -  Schroders  (L:SDR) could soon help manage the money of people with significantly less in their bank accounts than the super-rich it has targeted so far, if talks with Lloyds (L:LLOY) about a wealth management tie-up succeed.
Schroders, Britain's second largest listed fund management group by assets under management and Lloyds Banking Group, Britain's biggest retail lender, confirmed on Sunday they are in talks, but gave no further details.
However, sources familiar with the discussions confirmed details of a Sky News report which said Lloyds would roll 13.8 billion pounds ($18 billion) of client money into a joint venture with Schroders, which would contribute its technology, operational platform and investment skills.
This would allow Schroders to access thousands of so-called mass affluent, those with hundreds of thousands of pounds, rather than millions or billions, in investable capital.
It would be the latest step in a long-standing plan by Schroders to diversify its revenues and follow other recent acquisitions in the sector as the industry consolidates.
Rathbone (L:RAT) bought Scotland's Speirs & Jeffrey for 104 million pounds earlier this year, but as one of the only large British asset managers with a significant wealth management arm, analysts do not expect the Schroders talks to trigger copy-cat deals. 
""A relationship with Lloyds could be an important source of new assets in Schroders' home market. This points to management's flexibility in the way it goes to market and to its savvy around building distribution relationships,"" Bernstein analyst Edward Houghton said in a note to investors.
Lloyds (L:LLOY), which is looking for ways to diversify its business mix from banking, where further expansion is limited, has targeted insurance and wealth and made them a key pillar of its most recent three-year strategy outlined in February.
The bank, which would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, stood to gain from Schroders' investment skills and greater diversification, analysts said.
Lloyds is also discussing taking a minority stake in Schroders' Cazenove Capital wealth management arm, which manages the money of its existing wealthy clients.
MANDATE 
The third pillar of the deal would see Schroders secure a high-profile new business mandate to manage 109 billion pounds of Lloyd's insurance assets.
This has been up for grabs since February, when Lloyds ended a management deal with newly-merged  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) which it said had become a ""material competitor"".
The annual revenue associated with the Lloyds asset management contracts represented around 130 million pounds.
Since then, several of the world's biggest asset managers have competed for the mandate, which analysts at UBS said could add between 5 and 7 percent to Schroders earnings.
""It would give Schroders an important scale advantage when attempting to win further mandates from insurers, given the scale-driven nature of the business,"" they said, flagging a price target of 3,600 pence and 'buy' rating.
Schroders, whose shares were 0.2 percent lower at 1216 GMT, saw its existing wealth management business post a solid first half, with net income up 8 percent to 144 million pounds and pre-tax profit of 38 million pounds.
The FTSE 100 (FTSE) index was down 0.7 percent.
For Lloyds, whose shares were down 0.9 percent, the plans involve leveraging its position to be able to offer insurance and wealth services under the same roof via its insurance subsidiary Scottish Widows. 
""Something like this I think will be transformative from the perspective of the growth of that business,"" John Cronin, financials analyst at Goodbody, told Reuters.

1600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Investors Flee China Stocks as Foreigners Dump $1.4 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks’ worst October start in a decade has scared off the last remaining bulls.
Foreigners dumped 9.7 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) of A shares through exchange links with Hong Kong on Monday, just short of a record hit eight months ago, as mainland markets reopened after a week-long break. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., Kweichow Moutai Co. and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. -- old favorites that jumped at least 97 percent last year -- were the most sold by overseas traders Monday.
The China A50 Index of large caps, which includes stocks that overseas investors are more likely to own, sank almost 5 percent for its biggest selloff since January 2016. The yuan slumped as much as 0.78 percent onshore to 6.9260 per dollar amid speculation the central bank will give up defending the 6.9 level, further hurting the outlook for A shares.
Some traders said the apparent absence of the national team, as China’s state-backed funds are known, helped accelerate declines in the afternoon. Supportive measures from the People’s Bank of China didn’t ease the pain, following a recent barrage of negative news, including weak manufacturing data and accusations of election meddling. The slump followed losses of a similar magnitude by Chinese shares in Hong Kong last week.
“Foreign investors turned bearish, unlike their previous optimistic buying of Chinese A shares,” said Steven Leung, executive director at Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “The massive northbound selling is a sign of growing concern over the relationship between the U.S. and China.”
Testing Demand
International investors had started to load up on Chinese shares as global index compilers increased weightings of yuan-denominated shares on their benchmarks and a slump made valuations more compelling relative to global peers. The nation’s equity market had already lost $2.4 trillion in value since January before Monday amid signs that deleveraging and a trade spat with the U.S. is hurting economic growth.
Foreign demand for another type of Chinese assets will be tested later this week, when the nation markets a sale of dollar bonds.
Bulls Turn
Brokerages are giving up their bullish calls on China’s equities. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s cautious turn last week followed similar moves by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Nomura Holdings Inc. and Jefferies Group earlier in the year. Contrarians include  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), whose strategists are sticking to the overweight rating they’ve had on China throughout 2018. It’s been a “painful” call though, they said in a note Monday.
The selloff has spread to stocks in Hong Kong, among the world’s worst performers this year.
Mainland markets may struggle to find a floor if foreigners continue fleeing, as domestic investors are unlikely to jump back in after being battered in this year’s selloff. Policy makers’ previous attempts this year to stem declines in stocks haven’t lasted.
“The reserve requirement cut was within expectations and far from sufficient to counter the negatives on all fronts during the China holiday,” said Zhang Gang, Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co. “Even China’s state funds won’t be able to prop up the market until the systemic risks are all factored in.”

1601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Baker Hughes to Pay $550 Million for Stake in Adnoc Drilling,"(Bloomberg) -- Baker Hughes, the Houston-based oilfield services business, agreed to buy a 5 percent stake in Adnoc Drilling, a deal that values the unit of government-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. at about $11 billion.
The investment marks the first time that an international partner takes a direct equity stake in an existing Adnoc services business, the companies said Monday in a joint statement. The valuation of Adnoc Drilling includes about $1 billion of net debt.
Baker Hughes, a GE company, will provide specialized equipment and technologies to Adnoc Drilling, which supplies oil rigs to other Adnoc businesses and is the Middle East’s largest drilling company, they said. The agreement may help Adnoc Drilling expand outside the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC producer in which the emirate of Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil, the companies said.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is seeking to boost supply to offset a decline in oil exports from Iran, due to U.S. sanctions, and plummeting production in Venezuela. The increase has yet to significantly reduce prices, with Brent crude 25 percent higher this year.
Faster Drilling
The partnership with Baker Hughes “comes at an important time in the drilling needs of Abu Dhabi as Adnoc grows its conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources and as we see future potential for further regional growth,” Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber said.
Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said the deal will help “drive predictable revenue streams and long-term growth for both companies and lets us invest in a stable, reliable and secure market environment.”
The partnership aims to help Adnoc boost its conventional drilling activity by 40 percent by 2025, increase the number of its unconventional wells and reach its target of reducing drilling time by 30 percent by the end of 2019, according to the statement. Having a single company provide all necessary services will prove “transformative” for Adnoc, said Robin Mills, chief executive officer of Dubai-based consultant Qamar Energy.
“We needed to get away from operating in different silos, from different contractors working the well,” Abdul Munim Al Kindy, director of Adnoc upstream and chairman of Adnoc Drilling, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. The agreement with Baker Hughes “is about removing the interfaces between different services that go to complete a well and integrate it all in one company,” he said.
The deal will close in the fourth quarter, upon regulatory approval, and Baker Hughes will hold a seat on Adnoc Drilling’s board of directors, the companies said.
Moelis & Co. is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Adnoc in the transaction, while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). is advising Baker Hughes.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>",Mass action against Google over iPhone data blocked by London court,"LONDON (Reuters) - London's High Court on Monday blocked an attempt to bring legal action against Alphabet Inc's Google over claims it had collected sensitive data from more than 4 million iPhone users although it said the company's actions had been ""wrongful"".
The claimants had said Google (O:GOOGL) had illegally accessed details of iPhone users' internet browsing data by bypassing privacy settings on the Safari browser between June 2011 and February 2012.
Richard Lloyd, a consumer activist who was behind the ""Google You Owe Us"" court challenge, had estimated that about 4.5 million people had been affected by the ""Safari Workaround"" and wanted the tech giant to pay out several hundred dollars in damages to each affected individual.
Google had argued the mass case brought by Lloyd, the only named claimant, was not appropriate and should not proceed.
""There is no dispute that it is arguable that Google's alleged role in the collection, collation, and use of data obtained via the Safari Workaround was wrongful, and a breach of duty,"" the judge, Mark Warby, said in his ruling.
However, he said the case brought by Lloyd did not support the contention that he and those he represented had suffered ""damage"" as specified by Britain's Data Protection Act nor could the court allow such representative action to go ahead.
In his ruling, he said the main beneficiaries of the claim would have been those who funded it and the lawyers.
POSSIBLE APPEAL
Lloyd said his group, to which 20,000 people had signed up to, would seek permission to appeal the decision.
""Today's judgment is extremely disappointing and effectively leaves millions of people without any practical way to seek redress and compensation when their personal data has been misused,"" he said in a statement.
""Google's business model is based on using personal data to target adverts to consumers and they must ask permission before using this data. The court accepted that people did not give permission in this case yet slammed the door shut on holding Google to account."" 
A Google spokeswoman said: ""The privacy and security of our users is extremely important to us. This claim is without merit, and we're pleased the Court has dismissed it.""
Google remains under pressure from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices in the United States, where it has acknowledged making mistakes in the past.

In 2012, it agreed to pay a then-record civil penalty of $22.5 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it misrepresented to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Safari Internet browser users that it would not place tracking ""cookies"" or serve them targeted ads.

1604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Watch FANG Stocks for Warning of Fed Mistake, Says Julius Baer","(Bloomberg) -- If the Federal Reserve tightens U.S. monetary policy too far, investors in the bull market’s biggest winners will feel the pain first, according to Bank Julius Baer & Co. That’s tech stocks.
Strong economic growth will encourage the Fed to keep raising interest rates, even if the tightening sucks out more liquidity than financial markets can tolerate, said Yves Bonzon, chief investment officer at Julius Baer. That could drive the S&P 500 Index down about 20 percent before the equity losses start moderating the central bank’s actions, he said.
“I’m the most nervous I’ve been in a long time because I think we’re approaching that point,” he said at a press roundtable in Hong Kong on Monday, referring to when Fed tightening starts to drive a reversal in stocks. “The biggest beneficiary of the expansion of liquidity will be the biggest casualty, irrespective of their fundamentals.”
Bonzon says that the interplay between economic data and the share prices of the FANG stocks -- a loose grouping variously consisting of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. -- is his favored way to gauge whether liquidity conditions pose a risk to the broader market. The Swiss private bank has been reducing its holdings of U.S. stocks, while remaining “modestly overweight,” he said.
While the S&P 500 has powered to a string of all-time highs this year even against the backdrop of Fed interest-rate increases, the rally is facing a renewed threat from surging Treasury yields and the risk of economic fallout from the U.S.-China trade war. The NYSE FANG+ Index topped out in June, three months before the broader market’s current peak, and has fallen 13 percent since then.
Bonzon noted that regulatory measures targeting technology stocks were clouding his signal’s effectiveness, both in the U.S. and China. Facebook has been under fire after last month disclosing that as many as 50 million accounts were compromised in its worst security breach, while China’s government has tightened its oversight of the video game industry to curtail device addiction among young people.
Julius Baer last year began to consider whether Chinese stocks should be a “core asset class” that the bank recommends to all investors, similar to U.S. equities, according to Bonzon. Recent developments have given him pause.
The bank is now assessing whether or not China’s government is “still in favor of a market-based economy and private entrepreneurship,” or whether it is moving back towards a more state-controlled, centrally-planned model, Bonzon said. The latter may undermine the country’s long-term success, making its stocks less attractive, Bonzon said.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Codelco in talks to sell copper to China's Minmetals in three-year deals,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Codelco is in talks to sell up to 60,000 tonnes of copper a year to China Minmetals from 2019 to 2021, marking a change in sales strategy at Chile's state-owned miner which typically made deals on an annual basis, industry sources said.
Sources say the aim was to agree ""evergreen"" three-year deals in which the Chinese company would commit to buy 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes a year of copper for the period.
Under the arrangement, the three-year pact would be rolled over annually, so from 2020 the deal would be extended to run for three years until the end of 2022 and so on.
The deal with China Minmetals, part of Codelco's efforts to secure longer term supply contracts, focuses on the quantity of copper to be supplied, sources said. 
Typically supply contracts are agreed annually for the next year during what is known as ""mating season"" in October and November when producers and customers agree quantities. Premiums are set above the London Metal Exchange benchmark price.
""Codelco is looking to establish a base of bigger and long term strategic customers worldwide and Asia is not an exception,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
A Codelco official said the company did not comment on negotiations with customers. A China Minmetals spokesman said the company could not immediately comment.
""The relationship between Minmetals and Codelco has been there for many years, the important thing is the three years and the quantity,"" a copper industry source said.
Codelco, the world's largest copper miner, accounted for 1.734 million tonnes of global supplies last year, about 7 percent of the total estimated at about 23 million tonnes. It has historically been used as a benchmark for copper premiums.
Many companies are keen to lock in long-term supplies due to expectations of shortages over coming years, created by a dearth of new projects, deteriorating ore grade and healthy demand. 
Sources say companies seeking to buy copper at the moment can easily find sellers and any deficits in the short term would see prices rise, which would see more scrap heading for the market to close the gap.
However, a 25 percent duty on Chinese imports of U.S. copper scrap imposed since from Aug. 23 has fuelled uncertainty about supplies in China, the world's largest consumer of the metal used widely in power and construction.
""These tariffs have the potential to create a lot of problems for Chinese consumers. But it's not just the tariffs, some companies just want to be sure they have supplies secured,"" another copper industry source said.
""People think you can't agree contracts without premiums, but premiums can be agreed at a later time,"" the source added.
For 2019, Codelco has agreed some deals with premiums at $98 for European customers. Some Chinese customers have agreed to pay $88 a tonne and other Asian clients have agreed $83 a tonne.

Copper prices on the LME  at around $6,200 a tonne are down more than 15 percent since early June, but up from the 14-month low of $5,773 a tonne hit on Aug. 15.

Spot yuan  ended the afternoon at its lowest official close in seven weeks against the U.S. dollar as expectations of more easing measures by China, plus surging U.S. bond yields, put pressure on the Chinese currency.
Beijing has stepped up liquidity support across the financial in recent months as policymakers have focused on calming fears of capital outflows and sought to soothe battered markets as anxiety grows that the tit-for-tat trade war with the United States could deal a damaging blow to the broader economy.
""There's an acute shortage of confidence in the market. Few investors are buying,"" said Alvin Ngan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at brokerage Zhongtai International.
""China's economy is under heavy downward pressure... and you need time to observe if recent easing measures are effective or not,"" he added. 
On Monday, the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) plummeted 4.3 percent to 3,290.90 points, its sharpest one-day percentage fall since February 2016. 
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) lost 3.7 percent, to 2,716.51 points, its worst day since June 19.
For the year, both Chinese indexes are down about 18 percent. 
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) dropped 1.4 percent to close at its lowest points in 15 months, extending last week's 4.4 percent loss as investors worried about tensions between the U.S. and China. 
Monday was the first chance for mainland investors to react to the escalating trade tensions and a sell-off in Hong Kong markets last week after a week-long holiday on the mainland to celebrate National Day.
On Sunday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced a 100-basis-point cut to banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), stepping up efforts to support the economy and calm market worries. 
""An RRR cut is not enough to counter the impact of the trade war. The economy is quite weak, and I see a growing number of companies putting their assets up for sale"" due to pessimism, said David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd, a hedge fund.
""And today's fall is not surprising after weak performance in external markets during the holiday."" 
""MALIGN"" EFFORTS 
Last week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence intensified Washington's pressure campaign against Beijing by accusing China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of next month's congressional elections and of reckless military actions in the South China Sea.
And on Friday, Chinese technology stocks listed in Hong Kong, including Lenovo  (HK:0992) and ZTE Corp  (HK:0763), slumped on a Bloomberg report that the systems of multiple U.S. companies had been compromised by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese spies. 
China's IT sector <.CSIINT> fell sharply on Monday, tumbling over 5 percent as they played catch-up with their Hong Kong peers. Shenzhen-listed shares of ZTE (SZ:000063) was down over 8 percent at close. 
Real estate <.CSISFBI>, consumer <.CSI300CS> and healthcare <.CSI300HC> sectors were also among the biggest casualties, all tanking more than 4 percent.
The market's obliviousness toward the RRR cut - China's central bank said the move would inject a net 750 billion yuan ($109.2 billion) in cash into the banking system - highlights concerns that monetary easing alone would do little to heal battered confidence.
""Cutting RRR at a time of relatively ample liquidity in the banking system is not likely to have much effect,"" wrote Zhao Jian, a finance professor of the University of Jinan.
""Liquidity is not the issue. The issue is the loss of confidence,"" said Zhao, adding China is in a ""liquidity trap"" where there's a shortage of credit demand from the real economy, especially the private sector.

POLICY DIVERGENCE 
China's RRR cut reinforces expectations of more policy easing ahead, putting China on a divergent path of monetary policies with the United States, where 10-year treasuries yields hit seven-year highs as the Federal Reserves keeps raising rates.
Yields of China's 10-year central government bonds have been trending lower this year, standing at 3.633 percent on Monday. That compares with the 3.227 percent yield for U.S. bonds. (US10YT=RR), the highest level since May, 2011. 
""The narrowing interest rate differentials between China and the US will exert more downward pressure on the RMB,"" wrote Nathan Chow, strategist at DBS Group Research.
The spot market  opened at 6.9000 per dollar and registered its weakest official closing level since mid-August, at 6.9135. The last close before the long holiday was 6.8725 to the dollar.
Before trading began on Monday, the PBOC set the midpoint of the yuan's daily trading band  at 6.8957 per dollar, its weakest level since May 11, 2017.
The onshore yuan has weakened about 5.5 percent against the dollar this year. 
Reflecting expectations of further yuan weakening, the one-year non-deliverable yuan futures in Hong Kong  fell to around 7.015 against the dollar on Monday, the lowest level in 15 months.

""In the face of rising trade frictions, moderate yuan depreciation aids exporters and is what the market expects to see,"" Tang Xiangbin, currency analyst at China Minsheng Banking Corp said, predicting additional U.S. rate hikes would help strengthen the dollar further.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 05:38AM ET</span>","European shares slide on 'powerful cocktail' of China slump, Treasuries and Italy","By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - European markets fell heavily on Monday as investor confidence took a knock from last week's spike in Treasury yields and from a Chinese market slump brought on by concerns that an escalating trade war with the United States could dent China's growth. 
Chinese stocks returned from a week's holiday to record their biggest one-day drop since February, with the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI300 down more than 4 percent for only the second time in more than 2-1/2 years. [L4N1WO13F]
This helped set the tone for the European open and stock markets fell with the pan-European index down 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX 0.8 percent lower. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.34 percent. 
The fall in global equities boosted demand for the dollar as investors rushed for safety. Against a basket of its rivals the greenback rose 0.3 percent, edging toward a 14-month high hit in mid-August.
Investor fears of higher U.S. interest rates, global protectionism, emerging market weakness and an Italian budget row have all combined to send equities sharply into the red in October, with world stocks down more than 2 percent already.
The dark mood in China sent shivers across Asian markets and will add to investors nervousness - the MSCI benchmark emerging markets index dropped 0.7 percent to its lowest level since May 2017, and is now down 22 percent from January’s peaks.
Growth concerns led the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday to cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs as policymakers worry about the fallout from the tariff row with the United States. 
""China just cut reserve requirement ratios and expanded monetary policy, which is a response to the fact that China’s economy is slowing down but the market doesn’t believe there is enough stimulus to cut the slowdown,"" said Guillermo Felices, a senior strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, calling the current concerns markets face a ""powerful cocktail"". 
""They've injected more liquidity into the market to contain the slowdown, which has already translated into weaker equity prices.""
The Chinese slide comes after U.S. Treasury yields hit seven-year highs on Friday following strong data that signaled a continued tightening of the labor market and increased inflationary pressures - adding to the reasons for the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue with its hiking cycle. 
U.S. trading is likely to be muted on Monday, with markets closed for Columbus Day. 
ITALY UNDER PRESSURE
Renewed concerns over Italy's budget also added to the risk-off tone in European equities. The FTSE MIB skidded 2.2 percent to its lowest since 21 April 2017, as government bonds yields hit new highs, putting pressure on bank shares.
The European Commission has told Italy it is concerned about its budget deficit plans for the next three years since they breach what the EU asked the country to do in July, but Rome insisted on Saturday it would ""not retreat"" from its spending plans.
Italy's 10-year government bond hit fresh four and a half year highs on Monday. As a result the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.1480, close to its lowest since Aug, 20.
""We are a bit surprised by the strength of the reaction in bond markets, but it appears the market is jumping to the conclusion that the European Commission will take a hardline stance when Italy submits its budget,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. 
Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, remains close to four-month highs at 0.559 percent.
Oil dropped back to $83.27 per barrel after Washington said it may grant waivers to sanctions against Iran's oil exports next month, and as Saudi Arabia was said to be replacing any potential shortfall from Iran.

1613,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",China Sets Tone for Emerging Markets Suffering From Yield Fever,"(Bloomberg) -- China joined an emerging-market rout sparked by the jump in U.S. Treasury yields as mainland markets reopened after a week-long holiday.
The latest move by the People’s Bank of China to reduce reserve requirements for lenders failed to mitigate the blow. The onshore yuan declined as much as 0.5 percent to 6.9069 per dollar Monday, while stocks on the mainland tumbled. Equities and currencies in other developing-nations slid.
Events in Brazil and Turkey are also likely to keep traders busy this week. The real’s implied volatility was at the highest since May last year as Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former Army captain, led in the first round of Brazil’s presidential elections held Sunday. Turkey is due to publish current-account data Thursday, with many economists forecasting a record surplus, while the next hearing into a detained American pastor -- the cause of a diplomatic spat with the U.S. -- is scheduled for Friday.

Treasury 10-year yields rose the most since February last week as stronger U.S. data added to the case for reduced stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve. Emerging-market stocks tumbled 4.5 percent in the five days through Friday, their worst performance since February, while currencies and domestic bonds dropped the most since August.
“The dollar’s rally will likely continue,” with the Fed seen extending its policy of gradual interest-rate increases at least through the end of 2019, said Richard Segal, a senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management Ltd. in London. “That and the U.S. bond-market reaction will weigh on emerging markets, especially the local-currency market. Keep to the higher-quality credits in the dollar markets and keep shorter durations.”

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 03:08AM ET</span>",Emerging market stocks' descent to 17 month lows entices U.S. investors,"By David Randall and Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The steep decline in emerging market stocks since early this year are attracting some U.S. fund managers who think they may find long-term bargains amid the sell-off.
Portfolio managers from Harding Loevner, Federated Investors, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are among those who have been adding emerging markets stocks to their portfolios in the face of the imposition of import tariffs by President Trump and rising interest rates in the U.S.
Emerging market asset prices have been hit hard this year. The MSCI index of emerging market stocks (MSCIEF) closed Friday at its lowest since May 2017 and it is down about 21 percent from January's high. An MSCI index of emerging market currencies (MIEM00000CUS) is down 8 percent from its 2018 high, hit in March.
On Thursday, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cut its rating on Chinese equities, the largest weight on the benchmark index, to neutral from overweight on expectations that a protracted trade war with the United States will hurt the Asian giant's economy next year.
Yet some U.S. international and global fund managers say that emerging markets offer better deals than the U.S. market, where stocks continue to hit record highs. 
""We're finding opportunities because of the trade war,"" said Chris Mack, a portfolio manager of the Harding Loevner Global Equity fund. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on more than half of the $500 billion the U.S. imports from China yearly, for which Beijing has retaliated.
Investor concern about the impact of the trade war has sent stocks in China and other emerging markets sharply lower this year. 
Mack's fund has its highest weighting in emerging market stocks since 2006 and its lowest in the U.S. since the same year in search of better values, he said.
The fund sold its position in Google's parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and bought South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930). Investors pay more than $25 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months at Alphabet, while they pay just over $6 at Samsung according to forward price-to-earnings estimates.
""You're getting the benefits of a company that is being boosted by a secular trend at a much cheaper price,"" Mack said
(Graphic: U.S. vs Emerging Markets stock valuations - https://reut.rs/2NqqUOr)
Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, said his firm recently upgraded its stance on emerging markets from negative to neutral. The reasoning behind the move included compelling valuations and the likelihood the trade tariffs will not hurt emerging market companies as much as the broad market expects. 
""People are slow to come around to the realization that the U.S. isn't going to close its borders to all emerging markets,"" he said, adding that Vietnamese companies could stand to benefit if the U.S. and China continue to slap tariffs on each other's goods.
Overall, U.S. global funds have nearly 7 percent of their portfolios in emerging market stocks, a 25 percent increase from 3 years ago, according to Lipper, a Refinitiv company.
Yet this year the $58.1 billion Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) is down almost 15 percent and posted about $2 billion in outflows since July, according to Lipper. It closed on Friday at its lowest since March 2017.
However, there are signs the tide could already be turning. 
Investors pumped money into emerging market equities and debt at the fastest weekly rate since April, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysis of EPFR data showed on Friday.
""I've never seen sentiment (on emerging market equities) be so negative when fundamentals are actually pretty good,"" said Teresa Barger, co-founder and CEO at hedge fund Cartica Management.
""When you get a situation like this, what you usually see is the retail investors getting scared and exiting but institutional investors entering.""
Barger is looking beyond China to India and Brazil, both of which may be less affected by the U.S. trade tariffs, she said. 
Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone in New York, also sees a silver lining for emerging market countries outside of China if the Washington-Beijing trade war intensifies, pointing to Brazil and Indonesia.
""I'd be very selective in where I look for my exposure in emerging markets,"" he said.
""Look for countries with a large U.S. dollar reserve, direct trade partners with the U.S. and that have (relatively) less exposure in terms of exports to China.""

The drug maker's Shanghai-listed stock fell the maximum allowed 10 percent, its biggest drop in three months, after the company said on Sunday that the move by the U.S. FDA along with regulators in Europe would hit its export business.
The bulk manufacturer of the high blood pressure treatment valsartan recalled the product from consumers in the United States in July after an impurity linked to cancer was detected.
The case has thrown a spotlight on hidden risks in China's sprawling market for generic medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and underscored regulatory blind spots that have caught out Chinese, European and U.S. watchdogs.
European authorities said late last month they had found that Huahai did not comply with good manufacturing practices and that the company's factory in Linhai, China, was no longer authorized to produce valsartan.
Chinese markets resumed trading on Monday after a week-long national holiday. Huahai, which says its makes over 50 drugs, APIs and intermediate products, made 61 percent of its total revenue last year outside of China.
Huahai said in a statement on Sunday that it faced risks including being sued by clients and from further action by authorities in Europe. It added that the firm and its units had been sued by U.S. consumers over the valsartan issue.

1624,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Malaysia Contractors Slide as Mahathir Deepens Spending Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Malaysian contractors are plunging as the government intensified its efforts to rein in spending by reducing the cost of an almost $14-billion mass-rapid transit project.
Shares of Gamuda Bhd. slid by a record and MMC Corp. fell to the lowest in nine years, after the Finance Ministry rejected an offer from the MMC-Gamuda consortium to build an underground portion of the MRT2 project. The government also shaved 5.22 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) from the above-ground portion that will be constructed by the same group, the ministry said in an emailed statement Sunday.
The Southeast Asian nation has been grappling with debt and liabilities exceeding 1 trillion ringgit and state revenue curbed by the removal of a sweeping consumption tax that was replaced with a more selective levy. Since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad swept into power in May, he has reviewed billion-dollar transportation projects, and canceled or deferred many of them due to budget constraints.
The MRT2 announcement “reinforces the government’s priority with cost-down of major infrastructure projects,” Adrian Wong, an analyst at Maybank Investment Bank Bhd., wrote in a research note on Monday as he downgraded his recommendation for Gamuda to sell.
“MMC-Gamuda’s decision to walk away from the underground package is due to too significant a cost-down required by the government, to the extent that the risk-reward is no longer tenable,” Wong wrote.
Construction Index
Malaysia’s infrastructure developers and contractors slumped across the board after the news, with the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index sliding 7 percent to the lowest since April 2009. Gamuda fell as much as 28 percent to 2.32 ringgit a share, while MMC lost up to 13 percent to 1.17 ringgit and IJM Corp. dropped 8 percent as of 10 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
The MRT2 is set to connect Putrajaya, where the government is based, to Sungai Buloh in the north of the nation’s capital Kuala Lumpur. The project was initially earmarked to cost about 28 billion ringgit, but the budget ballooned to 56.93 billion ringgit following a plan to extend a line to Bandar Malaysia, which the previous government sought to develop as a transportation hub.
The government holds “steadfastly to obtaining value for money” on all public expenditure, “especially when large borrowings are required,” Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in the statement Sunday.

1626,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>","China Traders Digest PBOC Cut, Last Week's Turmoil After Holiday","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese investors face a complicated outlook for markets as they return after a week-long holiday.
They’ll be reconciling last week’s turmoil in Hong Kong, where equities just had their worst week since February, with increasingly supportive measures from China’s central bank. Looser monetary policy may help stem some of the losses expected onshore after the five-day break, indicated by a slump in a U.S. fund tracking A shares, as well as pressure on China’s currency and government bonds from the surging dollar and higher Treasury yields.
The People’s Bank of China cut the amount of cash lenders must hold as reserves for the fourth time this year, effective Oct. 15. The move followed last week’s long list of bleak news, including weak manufacturing data, a close call between a U.S. and a Chinese destroyer in the disputed South China Sea, a North American trade deal that’s set to sideline China, accusations of election meddling and a Bloomberg News report that the country spied on U.S. companies.
“We are not surprised to see the RRR cut given mounting economic growth pressure, sizable seasonal liquidity demand, and weak investor sentiments,” Jerry Peng, a strategist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. “We reckon the authorities will step up intervention to support RMB in view of the RRR cut. Overall, we believe the RRR cut should be regarded as a positive move.”
The offshore yuan weakened as much as 0.3 percent Monday to near a seven-week low.
Hong Kong stocks lost 4.4 percent in the four days through Oct. 5 after a holiday Monday, some of the worst declines in the world. A prediction of a “full-blown trade war"" next year by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists added to the gloom. One victim was Lenovo Group Ltd., down as much as 23 percent Friday on concern that the PC-maker was tied to the Beijing hack. Lenovo later denied it was supplied by the manufacturer featured in the Bloomberg article.
All eyes will be on where the PBOC decides to fix the currency. At stake is whether policy makers allow it to weaken in line with the offshore rate, or whether it opts for a stronger-than-expected fixing to signal support for the yuan. Traders dumped the yuan in Hong Kong as the dollar surged, sending it past the 6.9 level for the first time since August.
Surging Treasury yields have set the tone for China’s bond market. The past week’s moves mean that Chinese 10-year government debt, which hasn’t traded since Sept. 28, yields only slightly more than the U.S. benchmark 10-year rate, shrinking the spread to the narrowest since 2011. Rising inflation concerns in China suggests government debt is unlikely to be a haven for the risk averse in the fourth quarter.
JPMorgan was the latest brokerage to turn more cautious on Chinese stocks, saying the trade conflict will only escalate as the U.S. maxes out tariffs on Chinese imports, the dollar strengthens and the yuan weakens further. That follows similar moves by strategists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Nomura Holdings Inc. and Jefferies Group earlier this year.
“Things don’t look so good,” Hao Hong, Bocom International Holdings Co.’s chief strategist in Hong Kong, said before the PBOC cut the required reserve ratio. “Depreciation pressures on the yuan will persist, bonds probably won’t work as a shelter for risk, and the national team’s influence on the equity market is waning. Stocks are of secondary concern for the top when there are bigger fish to fry.”

1627,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Hope Returns for Philippine Stock Investors After 17% Plunge,"(Bloomberg) -- Some investors are finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel for Philippine stocks -- at least in the short term.
After a plunge of more than 17 percent this year, ATR Asset Management Inc. and First Metro Investment Corp. are among the fund managers who see gains coming for the Philippine Stock Exchange Index as they say Friday’s inflation data signal the surge in consumer prices could be peaking. Julian Tarrobago, the head of equities at ATR, said he’s deploying cash.
“It reinforces our buy-on-weakness strategy,” said Tarrobago, who helps manage $1.8 billion and has less than 7 percent of his portfolio in cash. He said he prefers infrastructure, property and consumer stocks. “This is the time to buy as value is re-emerging more significantly now and inflation will soon decelerate.”
Consumer prices rose less than estimated in September and trailed the central bank’s forecast. The results are a sign the recent interest-rate increases are helping, Tarrobago said. He sees the PSEi climbing to 7,300 in the near term -- up 3.1 percent from Friday’s close -- and hit 8,000 by year-end should inflation ease and oil prices moderate.
Soaring consumer prices, a tumble in the peso and slowing economic growth have triggered an exodus from Philippine equities, which lost almost $47 billion of value this year as foreigners withdrew more than $1.6 billion from the nation’s stocks. The PSEi’s valuation sank to 15 times estimated earnings for the next year, the least since January 2016 -- just before the market staged a rebound that eventually took the index to a record in January.
Robert Ramos, the chief investment officer at East West Banking Corp., says that even though Friday’s inflation data may fuel a rally in both stocks and bonds, the benchmark index may struggle to stay above its 7,300 in the near term. He advises to stay cautious and selective, citing rising oil prices and the peso’s weakness as potential headwinds. The gauge should hold above 6,800 if moves in crude and the currency support the central bank’s outlook that inflation will begin to ease this quarter.
“We are keeping durations very short for our fixed-income portfolio but watching for opportunities to go long while we remain liquid for the discretionary-equity accounts,” Ramos said. “We will continue with that for now and wait for opportunities to buy if prices move lower because there might still be more volatility down the road.”
For Cristina Ulang, the head of research at First Metro in Manila, consumer prices could ease should the government implement non-monetary measures to counter inflation, such as importing rice based on tariffs rather than quotas. She said the PSEi could “easily” climb to 7,300 -- and even 7,350 -- in the near term.
“We have gone so far down below what the fundamentals justify, and value is emerging,” Ulang said. “There are signs inflation is easing and hopefully it will hold and decelerate in the fourth quarter. Investors are more incentivized now to do a slow accumulation.”

1628,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",China's Investment In Australia Slumps 40% Amid Diplomatic Spat,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese investment in Australia plunged 40 percent in 2017 from the year before, according to research released Monday.
After peaking in 2016 at A$14.9 billion ($10.5 billion), investment from Chinese companies last year slumped to A$8.9 billion, according to the Australian National University database. In 2017, Chinese deals in Australia’s mining sector accounted for just over half of the total value of transactions, with the health-care and social assistance sector at about 15 percent, according to the database.
While the report doesn’t offer explanations for last year’s steep decline in investment, business relations between the nations have been under increasing pressure due to a diplomatic spat, sparked by concern in Australia about alleged Chinese meddling in government and media. The figures may also reflect Beijing’s decision to implement controls on the outflow of capital.
Earlier this year, Australian exporters blamed strained ties for delays of shipments into China as the nation in June passed sweeping laws against foreign interference, which then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said was aimed in part at reducing Chinese meddling in national affairs.
Collating data between 2014 and 2017 showed state-owned enterprises accounted for about 47 percent of total Chinese investment in Australia, the university said. The research used figures from the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and includes investment from Hong Kong and other global financial centers.
Several planned high-profile investments into Australia by Chinese state-owned companies and others linked to the government in Beijing have been blocked on national security grounds. FIRB is currently weighing up whether to approve CK Group’s A$13 billion bid for gas pipeline operator APA Group."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog said on Monday it may ban accounting firms from providing consultancy work to firms whose books they check.
Under pressure from lawmakers to toughen up supervision of accountants after collapses at outsourcer Carillion and retailer BHS, the Financial Reporting Council announced a new ""strategic focus"" to ensure that audit serves the public interest better.
The Big Four accountants, PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG often provide lucrative consultancy work to the same firms whose books they check, raising concerns that accountants may not be willing to challenge management of those companies.
""The review will include determining whether further actions are needed to prevent auditor independence being compromised, including whether all consulting work for bodies they audit should be banned,"" the FRC said in a statement.
The FRC will work closely with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area, it said.
Taking lessons from recent company failures, the FRC said it will look to toughen up requirements for auditors to determine if a company is correct in stating it is a going concern, meaning it has enough resources to continue in operation for a year or more.
The review will consider if accountants should say publicly if they have doubts about ""realism"" in a company's statement on going concern, the FRC said.
The government has already ordered an independent review of the FRC after it was described by lawmakers as timid in its handling of accounting firms.
The review by John Kingman will report by later this year and could propose increasing the FRC's powers or a more radical restructuring.
The CMA has already heard proposals from the UK accounting sector setting out temporary curbs on how many big listed companies the Big Four can audit.
The proposals are aimed at meeting lawmaker criticisms that the Big Four, who audit nearly all blue chip companies, don't face enough competition.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Why are investment banks nervous about Australia's cartel case?,"By Paulina Duran and Alun John
SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investment bankers are bracing for the start of a landmark legal case about alleged cartel activity in Australia's financial sector, nervous the proceedings could lead to increased scrutiny and tougher measures from regulators worldwide.
Australian authorities filed criminal charges in June against the local units of  Citigroup  (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and six bankers over a $2.3 billion stock sale.
Most past investigations into cartels by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) have looked at trade in goods. This is the first time a probe has led to charges alleging criminal cartel conduct in the financial sector.
Lawyers representing the banks and the six bankers are due to appear in court in Sydney on Tuesday, although hearings are not expected to begin for several months.
WHAT ARE THE CHARGES?
The charges are linked to an August 2015 sale of $2.3 billion worth of new ANZ shares and the subsequent trading of some of the shares by two of the underwriters - Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. All three have denied wrongdoing and said they will fight accusations.
JPMorgan (N:JPM), which also underwrote the capital raising, has not been charged and has not commented on the case.
Charges have also been brought against six executives - ANZ's former treasurer Rick Moscati; Citi's former Australia head Stephen Roberts, current local head of capital markets John McLean, London-based head of foreign exchange trading Itay Tuchman; and Deutsche's former local chief Michael Ormaechea as well as former local capital markets head Michael Richardson.
None of the executives have commented publicly so far.
An ANZ spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Moscati when Reuters contacted the bank on Friday.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
For investment banks, the case will set a precedent in an area of financial markets activity that lacks clear rules and has never been tested in the courts, according to Citi.
""Underwriting syndicates exist to provide the capacity to assume risk and to underwrite large capital raisings, and have operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades,"" Citi said when the case was first made public.
A Citi spokeswoman declined to comment any further when contacted by Reuters.
The fear is that a court hearing involving such high-profile firms and individuals might prompt regulators to take a fresh look at equity deals.
""These aren't just criminal charges at the trader level, or someone in operations, these are very senior people who have been charged,"" said Ben Quinlan, CEO of consultancy firm Quinlan & Associates.
Cartel charges in Australia come with a maximum penalty of three times the profit made from the cartel activity or 10 percent of a firm's revenue. Penalties for individuals found guilty carry fines or a maximum 10-year jail term.
OTHER AUSTRALIAN BANKING SCANDALS?
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has sued ANZ over the same share placement.
The regulator said ANZ broke company laws by failing to tell investors that its underwriters had bought about A$791 million ($558 million) of the total it was trying to sell.
Regulators are under pressure to rein in Australia's finance sector, as a powerful public inquiry, or Royal Commission, airs almost daily allegations of misconduct.
The commission has issued a scathing interim report saying big banks and wealth managers had pursued profit ahead of customer interests and viewed regulatory compliance as a cost rather than a guide to proper conduct. Several other scandals have engulfed Australian banks, ranging from rate-rigging to money laundering.
WHAT NEXT?
The cases against all parties involved are listed as to be ""mentioned"" on Tuesday's calendar for Sydney's Downing Local Court. Prosecutors told Reuters that the people accused have been excused from being present as it will be an administrative affair where a timetable for future hearings will be set.
Meanwhile, the Royal Commission continues, and ANZ alongside Australia's other three major banks are scheduled to face questioning over the interim report before a parliamentary committee in Canberra this week.

The deal would be among the biggest wealth management tie- ups in recent years and would come amid widespread consolidation in the broader industry sector.
Schroders spokeswoman Beth Saint confirmed the move after Sky News reported that Lloyds was to merge its 13 billion pound ($17 billion) wealth management arm into a new joint venture with Schroders.
""Schroders confirms that it is in discussions with Lloyds Banking Group plc with a view to working closely together in parts of the wealth sector,"" Saint said in an email to Reuters, adding there was ""no certainty that these discussions will lead to any formal arrangement being entered into.""
Lloyds Banking Group issued a similar statement, saying any further announcement ""will be made at the appropriate time."" 
Sky News reported that the deal would see Lloyds owning 50.1 percent‎ of the joint venture, with Schroders owning the rest, Sky News said, citing sources.
Wealth management contributed 273.3 million pounds to Schroders' net income in 2017 and has been an area of focus for future growth.
Sky News said the new joint venture would be part of a three-pronged tie-up between the companies.
It would include Schroders taking on a 109 billion pound investment management contract from Lloyds-owned Scottish Widows that is the subject of a disagreement with  Standard Life  Aberdeen (LON:SLA), which previously managed the money.
The mandate was pulled from SLA after Lloyds said the 2017 merger of insurer Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management meant the enlarged company had become a material competitor.
The dispute remains in arbitration.

The third leg of the Lloyds-Schroders deal involves wealth manager Cazenove Capital, Sky reported.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) top security officer told Congress on Sunday that it had found no sign of suspicious transmissions or other evidence that it had been penetrated in a sophisticated attack on its supply chain.
Apple Vice President for Information Security George Stathakopoulos wrote in a letter to the Senate and House commerce committees that the company had repeatedly investigated and found no evidence for the main points in a Bloomberg Businessweek article published on Thursday, including that chips inside servers sold to Apple by Super Micro Computer Inc (PK:SMCI) allowed for backdoor transmissions to China.
""Apple’s proprietary security tools are continuously scanning for precisely this kind of outbound traffic, as it indicates the existence of malware or other malicious activity. Nothing was ever found,"" he wrote in the letter provided to Reuters.
Stathakopoulos repeated Apple's statements to the press that it never found malicious chips or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server or been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about such concerns. He said he would be available to brief Congressional staff on the issue this week.
The letter follows statements on Friday by Britain's National Cyber Security Centre and on Saturday by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that those agencies have no reason to doubt denials from Apple and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) that they had discovered backdoored chips.
Bloomberg said on Friday it stood by its story, which was based on 17 anonymous sources. Some allegations were based on fewer accounts or even a single unnamed source, Apple noted in its letter.
A Bloomberg spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions sent on Sunday.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Telecom Italia CEO says board situation problematic, committed to job: paper","MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) CEO Amos Genish said tensions between the company's management, its board and shareholders were counterproductive, but said he was committed to staying, according to an excerpt of an interview with La Repubblica.
TIM's top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) has been at loggerheads with Elliott since the activist fund took a stake in Italy's biggest phone group this year and ended up wrestling board control away from the French media group in May.
The battle of words has intensified in recent months as TIM fell under pressure due to tougher competition at home, which prompted speculation that Genish's position could be at risk.
Shares in TIM are down about 30 percent so far in 2018, worse than a 15 percent fall in the European telecoms index (SXKP).
In an excerpt of an interview to be published in full on Monday, Genish pledged to push ahead with a strategy focused on a transition toward fifth-generation mobile services. 
But he said there was a ""problematic situation"" within TIM that was ""creating a lot of trouble and is becoming unsustainable"". 
Vivendi reaffirmed its support this week for Genish and accused Elliott of running a ""rumor campaign"" to discredit him.
The attack follows a similar move last month when Vivendi said TIM's performance had been ""disastrous"" since Elliott seized control of the Italian firm's board.
Elliott has said Vivendi had ""fallen prey to the 'short-termism' it has previously decried"", casting judgment on the new board just four months after it was appointed. It also urged Vivendi to work on constructive solutions at board level.
Genish told La Repubblica ""greater alignment between shareholders, management and the board were needed"" to support the company's growth. 
Under Genish, who was appointed when Vivendi controlled the board, TIM is working on a three-year turnaround plan focusing on a digital transformation and fixing the group's finances.
The former state phone monopoly has been facing growing challenges in fixed-line and mobile businesses as broadband group Open Fiber rolls out a rival fiber optic network and after French telecoms group  Iliad  (PA:ILD) entered Italy in May with a low-price mobile offer. 
Separately, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters TIM had mandated Enrico Laghi, a business professor in Rome and one of three administrators looking after struggling airline Alitalia, to review the valuation of the phone group's assets. 

Such review could result in a writedown of some of TIM's infrastructure, including its copper and fiber networks, that could weigh on its profits, La Repubblica said on Saturday.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Italy keen to keep 15 percent stake in Alitalia in rescue plan: paper,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy is working on an Alitalia rescue plan that would see the state taking a stake of around 15 percent in the carrier along with separate investments by state-owned firms such as Ferrovie dello Stato and a foreign player, Il Sole 24 Ore said on Sunday.
Once a symbol of Italy's post-war economic boom that has recently struggled to compete with low-cost carriers and high speed trains, Alitalia was put under special administration last year after workers rejected a rescue plan.
As part of the administration process, Rome has been looking for a buyer for the airline, with a deadline set for Oct. 31.
It also granted Alitalia a bridge loan of 900 million euros ($1 billion) to keep it afloat in the meantime.
According to the paper, once Alitalia has repaid the loan, the Treasury would reinvest part of that money in the carrier to retain a stake of about 14 to 15 percent or it may choose to convert part of the loan into shares.
Alitalia has until Dec. 15 to repay the bridge loan, although a source said on Saturday the government was working on an extension of the deadline of up to six months. nL8N1WM0HU]
As part of the government's 2 billion euro rescue plan, Italian railways group Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) would confer some assets to the airline that would then be converted into a stake, while state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti would help finance the acquisition of new aircraft, the paper added.
FS Chief Executive Gianfranco Battisti said last month that Alitalia could be an opportunity for the state-owned railways group, adding he saw synergies in ticketing and routes.
To make the plan work, Italy still needs to strike a deal with a foreign rival willing to invest in Alitalia. That investor could take a stake of 20 to 30 percent, the paper said.
Italy has been in talks with various players since Alitalia first went into administration.
EasyJet (L:EZJ), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and budget carrier Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) submitted expressions of interest this year in at least parts of Alitalia.
On a trip to China last month, the government asked China's Silk Road Fund, Air China (SS:601111) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) to consider buying a stake of up to 49 percent in Alitalia but so far no commitment from that side has been made.
Separately, daily Il Messaggero said the government was planning to ask one of Alitalia's three commissioners, Luigi Gubitosi, to become the airline's new chief executive.
Alitalia declined to comment. A spokesman for the Industry Ministry said it was premature to discuss details of government plans for Alitalia, adding more might be known next week.
Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, who this week promised to conclude the Alitalia case in November, has called a meeting with the airline's unions for Friday, Oct. 12.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","Vivendi reaffirms support for TIM CEO, decries 'rumor campaign'","PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) reaffirmed its support for Telecom Italia's (TIM) (MI:TLIT) Chief Executive Amos Genish, while accusing activist fund Elliott of running a ""rumor campaign"" to discredit him. 
The French media group, which owns 24 percent of TIM, has been at loggerheads with Elliott since the U.S. hedge fund took a stake in Italy's biggest phone group earlier this year and ended up wrestling board control away from Vivendi in May.
The battle of words has intensified in recent months as TIM fell under pressure due to tougher competition at home, which in turn prompted speculation that Genish's position at the company could be at risk. 
Shares in TIM are down around 30 percent so far in 2018, worse than a 15 percent fall in the European telecoms index (SXKP).
""Vivendi supports TIM's CEO Amos Genish unreservedly and values his contribution,"" Vivendi said on Saturday, confirming comments also reported by Italian media on Saturday.
""We believe that this vicious rumor campaign is orchestrated by Elliott, whose lack of organization is bringing down  Telecom Italia ,"" added Vivendi.
The attack follows a similar move last month when Vivendi said TIM's performance had been ""disastrous"" since Elliott seized control of the Italian firm's board.
When contacted by Reuters on Saturday, Elliott referred to the statement it had released in response to Vivendi's previous accusations in September.
At the time, Elliott said Vivendi had ""fallen prey to the 'short-termism' it has previously decried"", casting judgment on the new board just four months after it was appointed. 
It also told the French group that TIM was executing a plan that was ""devised and approved by Vivendi"" and urged the French group to work toward constructive solutions at the board level. 
Under Genish, who was appointed when Vivendi controlled the board, TIM is working on a three-year turnaround plan focusing on a digital transformation and fixing the group's finances.
However, the former state phone monopoly has been facing growing challenges in both fixed and mobile: Broadband group Open Fiber is rolling out a rival fiber optic network while French telecoms group  Iliad  (PA:ILD) in May launched its low-price mobile offer for Italy.

TIM also committed this week to spending more than 2.4 billion euros ($2.77 billion) - much more than initially expected - on fifth-generation mobile spectrum in Italy, in a move that is likely to raise its debt pile and could affect its ambition to return to an investment grade credit rating next year.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Italy works on extending Alitalia loan deadline: source,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy is working on an extension of as much as six months to a Dec. 15 deadline for Alitalia to repay a 900 million euro ($1 billion) loan meant to keep the airline afloat while it searches for a buyer, a government source said on Saturday. 
Once a symbol of Italy's post-war economic boom, but recently in trouble due to competition from low-cost carriers and high speed trains, Alitalia was put under special administration last year after workers rejected a rescue plan.
As part of the process, Rome has been looking for a buyer, but it has been delayed because of a change of government.
Any extension to the bridge loan deadline may irk the European Commission, which has already been looking into whether it constituted state aid. It may also violate EU guidelines, which allow rescue loans only as a short-term emergency measure. 
Alitalia declined to comment. 
Officials within the populist government that came into power in June have said that Rome would like to put 51 percent of Alitalia in public hands, possibly via a tie-up with one of Italy's state-owned giants, flanked by a strong industrial player.
Gianfranco Battisti, the head of Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), said last month that Alitalia could be an opportunity for the state-owned railways group, adding he saw synergies in ticketing and routes. 
However, Battisti said on Friday that FS was not focused on ""financial participations in other companies"" at the moment, in comments attributed to him by Italian newspapers on Saturday. 
Earlier this year, EasyJet (L:EZJ), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), and budget carrier Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) submitted expressions of interest in at least parts of Alitalia.
Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, who this week promised to conclude the Alitalia question in November, has called a meeting with the airline's unions for Friday, Oct. 12. 
The sale was supposed to be concluded by April 30, but that was moved to the end of October due to the government change.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 08:36PM ET</span>",Are transportation stocks the market's canary in a coal mine?,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. transportation sector, which many see as a proxy indicator of the economy's health, has retreated 3.1 percent from its Sept. 14 record, hinting to some analysts that the longest bull market on record has entered its late stages.
Railways, freight carriers and package deliverers get less attention than heavy-hitting momentum stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the sector could be showing cracks in what analysts and the U.S. Federal Reserve characterize as a robust economy.
Several constituents of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) have provided disappointing guidance in recent months. As the third-quarter reporting season approaches, investors will watch to gauge whether trade, fuel and dollar risks are affecting the sector's bottom line.
The 20-company DJT has recently diverged from the broader market after a strong run since late June, suggesting these headwinds could be taking a toll.
As the DJT has retreated, the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved in the opposite direction. The Dow reached its most recent all-time high on Tuesday, 13 trading days after the DJT's Sept. 14 record.
Diverging highs between the two indexes can signal growing market instability. Similar divergences occurred leading into the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2009, and most recently heading into the market correction that began in late January.
""The transports have been going sideways and haven't confirmed the new highs in the industrials,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""If the transports were to break down further from these levels, if you saw them declining another 2 or 3 percent in the near future, you would call that a bearish non-confirmation.""
On Friday, both indexes closed lower, with the DJT slipping 0.8 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.7 percent.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) is due to report on Oct. 9, a week after lackluster forecasts from the company and its peer United Continental pulled U.S. airline stocks lower. The bulk of the companies in the DJT are expected to post results in the latter half of October.
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), the first in the group to post quarterly earnings on Sept. 17, missed Wall Street estimates as costs weighed on margins. The global package delivery company has been challenged this year by the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and its major bilateral trading partners, notably China and Europe.
Although a preliminary deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has boosted railway stocks, looming tariffs threaten to increase the cost of transporting goods and services, further testing other DJT constituents.
""There may well be blood in the water before we actually get some kind of agreement on trade between the US and China,"" said Bernard Baumohl, managing director and chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. ""It could do some serious damage in the long run as China seeks to establish new supply chain routes from other countries and rely less on the United States.""
Analysts see costs of transportation fuels, which include gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, continuing to climb due to tightening supply and increasing demand.
Rising fuel costs are ""depressing stocks that make up the transportation index,"" Baumohl added.
Brent Crude prices have risen nearly 26 percent since the beginning up the year and energy analysts see the trend continuing well into 2019.
""In the near-term we've seen prices increase as a result of Iranian sanctions reducing the supply of crude oil to the market,"" said Andrew Lipow, consultant at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. ""I expect that over the next year, the price in transportation fuel is going to be increasing.""
The climbing dollar could also pressure transportation companies as U.S. goods grow less affordable to foreign consumers, which might result in fewer shipments abroad.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major world currencies, has risen almost 4 percent so far this year.
""The net effect is that (the strong dollar) could impact the transportation index over the course of the next 12 months,"" Baumohl said.
Meanwhile, investors will get a clearer picture in coming weeks of the extent to which trade jitters, fuel costs and the rising dollar may have turned transports into a warning sign.

""There are a lot of wild cards out there now,"" said Baumohl.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 08:09PM ET</span>",Scooter company Bird enters Latin America with launch in Mexico City,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California startup Bird said on Friday it has launched its electric scooters in Mexico City, expanding its effort to shake up urban transportation globally. 
The launch marks Bird's entry into Latin America, a market that transportation startups and investors see as ripe for growth. The company also said it would expand its operations to Brazil.
Bird is operating out of a shared office space in Mexico City and has been recruiting locally for weeks, according to public job postings. It has hired some local staff and is building up a network of workers tasked with keeping the electric scooters charged, the company said.
Bird is still looking for a country manager, the company said, and in the interim a general manager based in Austin, Texas, will oversee Mexico operations. 
Latin America has in general fewer regulatory hurdles for electric scooters than for car-hailing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], creating an easier path for growth, according to a Bird investor. 
Bird has joined a trade association of mobility companies in Latin America, known as MaaS Latam, which is working to promote its services with regulators and local authorities.
However, questions about where scooter users should ride the vehicles, the impact on bicycle lanes, helmet laws and liability have concerned regulators globally, leading some cities to limit scooter permits. The dockless scooters have also posed safety issues when they are abandoned on sidewalks and in driveways.
Transportation startups of all kinds have looked to Mexico and Brazil for growth. The countries are two of Uber's biggest markets globally, and China ride service Didi Chuxing last year acquired a Brazilian ride-hailing startup, 99, and in April brought its own ride-hailing network to Mexico.
Bird said last month that its e-scooter service has completed 10 million rides since launching a year ago. The company has raised $418 million and is valued at $2 billion, a large sum for a company just a year old.
Some scooter companies will struggle to live up to their valuations. In the last year, electric scooters have blanketed the streets of American, European and Chinese cities, and this proliferation is widely expected to result in price competition that could eat into profits and force consolidation in the industry. 

In Brazil, Bird will face an already crowded market of local competitors, including Yellow, started by the founders of 99, as well as startups Ride and Scoo.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) fell 7 percent on Friday, as David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital slammed the electric carmaker the day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk mocked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter.
The sell-off started in morning trading the day after Musk stirred nerves about a settlement of his securities fraud lawsuit by calling the SEC the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" on Twitter. His tweet came hours after a federal judge ordered him and the regulator to justify their settlement.
""Just want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,"" Musk, a frequent critic of investors betting against the electric car company said in the tweet. ""And the name change is so on point!""
In its quarterly letter, Greenlight said on Friday its short position on Tesla was its second-biggest winner in the third quarter. The hedge fund said Musk has been deceptive and the carmaker's woes resemble those of Lehman Brothers before its collapse.
Tesla shares plunged last week after the SEC accused Musk, 47, of fraud over ""false and misleading"" tweets on Aug. 7 that promised to take Tesla private and said funding had been secured.
The lawsuit threatened Tesla and Musk with a long fight that could have undermined the company's operations and ability to raise capital.
In the settlement announced over the weekend, Tesla and Musk agreed to pay $20 million each to the regulator while Musk, also a large Tesla shareholder, would step down as chairman but continue as CEO.
The settlement provided for appointment of a new chairman and directors, as well as moves to oversee Musk's output on social media.
Peter Haveles, a partner in the Trial and Dispute Resolution Practice Group, said Musk's tweets showed his lack of self discipline and puts intense pressure on Tesla board.
Several Twitter users also criticized Musk, who has over 20 million followers on the social media platform, for his tweets targeting regulators and short sellers.
""I have lost 30 years of my life savings all in $tsla thanks to your tweets please stop,"" TrendTrader007 wrote.
""If you continue this self destructive path you will lose all your ardent supporters and the goodwill from diehard $tsla longs like me,"" the user tweeted.
Teresa Goody, a former SEC attorney and CEO of The Goody Group, said Musk’s “contempt for the SEC is sending a message that he has no regard for the securities laws that are intended to protect investors and ensure a fair and efficient marketplace.”
In a separate tweet, Musk took another shot at shortsellers and accused BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) of enabling them by saying, ""The big funds can & will (sic), as they're suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket (sic) make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for 'passive' index tracking.""
Widely seen as the driving force behind the company, Musk's talent for promotion has helped Tesla vault much bigger manufacturing operations like General Motors (N:GM) and Ford (N:F) to become America's most valuable car company. 
As news on the settlement emerged at the weekend, he told employees in an email that Palo Alto, California-based Tesla was ""very close to achieving profitability."" 
Production numbers on Tuesday showed the company finally meeting its promises on output of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial for the its long-term prospects, while also fighting hard to overcome logistical issues with deliveries. 

Shares of the company, down around 14 percent this year but still up almost 30 percent since the start of 2017, were last down 6.9 percent at $262.63.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar rose to their largest since mid-December 2016, according to calculations by Reuters and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $26.68 billion in the week ended Oct. 2, from $23.17 billion the previous week.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning <0#NETUSDFX=> that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net long position of $27.427 billion in the week ended Oct. 2, up from $24.796 billion a week earlier.
The dollar has been on a tear since the last week of September as the Federal Reserve flagged multiple interest rate hikes this year and in 2019. Over the last seven days, the dollar index has gained 2.1 percent.
On Friday, the dollar retreated slightly, but no one doubts that its trajectory is on the way up.
""The relative strength of the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve's resolve to tighten monetary policy is unquestionable,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy, at BK Asset Management in New York.
She added that the dollar on any dip, is very much a buy.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","Under fire from Musk, top fund firms defend securities lending","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Accused by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk of making ""excessive profit"" by lending shares to short-sellers, top index fund companies shot back on Friday that they are only looking out for their investors.
The responses from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group came after Musk criticized the index fund providers on Twitter, part of his long-running grudge with short-sellers betting that shares of his electric carmaker will fall.
Securities lending has emerged as small but significant source of extra returns for fund firms, a function they were quick to defend against Musk's Twitter comments. 
""BlackRock engages in securities lending to provide fund investors the ability to collect higher returns than they otherwise would receive,"" BlackRock said in a statement sent by spokesman Brian Beades. 
Short-sellers borrow stock and sell it into the market in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later and pocketing the difference, creating a market for securities lending by fund firms who split revenue from the activity with their own investors.
BlackRock, Tesla's eight-largest shareholder, reported total securities lending revenue of $597 million in 2017, compared with $579 million in 2016, according to a securities filing. Musk cited the latest figure in a tweet on Friday afternoon. 
BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, running a total of $6.3 trillion as of June 30, followed by Vanguard with more than $5 trillion under management.
Vanguard spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann said via email that the firm's securities lending program ""is a source of additional income that can enhance returns for our shareholders.""
Wegemann also pushed back on another point Musk made on Twitter, when the CEO wrote that there is ""no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts,"" who can attack the company and drive down total returns.
""Short selling provides greater price transparency and liquidity to the market,"" Wegemann said. She noted market participants could also borrow securities for other needs like custody or brokerage functions.
A Tesla spokesman declined to comment. 
Musk could be technically correct that funds make extra profits because it costs them little to run lending programs, said Neil Bathon, managing partner of Boston-based fund analysis firm Fuse Research Network. 
But fund investors benefit from the extra income funds take in while any hit to the price of Tesla tied to shorts would have nearly no impact on a large index portfolio, Bathon said.
""The net impact to shareholders is decidedly positive from securities lending,"" Bathon said.
In his Twitter post on Friday Musk also said ""companies like BlackRock keep up to 50 percent of short interest revenue.""
BlackRock spokespeople pointed to filings and company disclosures that showed retail investors receiving around 71.5 percent or more of securities lending income, and said the revenue splits are fully disclosed to clients.
For instance, BlackRock's largest Tesla fund holder is the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, with 433,964 Tesla shares as of Sept. 30 valued at about $115 million, a small part of the fund's $43.7 billion in net assets.

A recent fund filing stated that fund investors will keep between 65 percent to 75 percent of fees earned from securities lending, depending on total revenue metrics. During the 12 months ended March 31, investors in the ETF kept $4.6 million from securities lending, or 73 percent of the net income from securities lending.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Himanshu Gulati, who received startup capital from Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, launched Antara Capital Partners this week with roughly $200 million in assets, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The New York-based firm will focus on making event-driven investments and can shift to distressed investing, the people said.
Blackstone wrote a $150 million check to Antara through its Strategic Alliance Fund III, a so-called seeding fund that helps incubate promising hedge fund managers who are starting out. Corbin Capital Partners also committed money to Antara, said one of the people, who were not permitted to speak publicly about the private fund. Corbin Capital is expected to add additional money over the coming year, the person said.
Antara, Blackstone Group and Corbin declined to comment.
Before launching his own fund, Gulati was the head of U.S. Distressed Credit and Special Situations at Man GLG for three years. Before that he worked at Perry Capital, Richard Perry's former hedge fund which was shuttered in 2016.
At Antara, Gulati will be working long-term colleagues Rick Paige and Eric Mason. Paige and Gulati worked together at Man and Perry while Gulati and Mason worked together at Man. 
David Lieberman will be the head trader and previously worked at Moore Capital where he was head of credit execution. Lance Kravitz, also a Perry Capital alumnus, is the firm's chief operating officer and chief financial officer.
Blackstone raised roughly $1.5 billion in capital for its third seeding fund and roughly a year ago it wrote its first check from that fund, committing $100 million to Keita Arisawa's Hong Kong-based Seiga Asset Management.
Recent data from Hedge Fund Research show that fewer hedge funds are launching this year than in last two years at a time where it has become increasingly difficult to raise money as clients complain about funds' generally lackluster returns and high fees. At the same time though, the data show that fewer funds are going out of business.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico creditors end opposition to bank debt restructuring,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's unsecured creditors will drop their opposition to a deal to restructure roughly $4 billion of debt issued by the U.S. commonwealth's defunct Government Development Bank (GDB), under an agreement revealed on Friday. 
During a U.S. District Court hearing, lawyers for the government, the unsecured creditor committee (UCC) and Puerto Rico's federally appointed financial oversight board announced the agreement. This advances the island’s first consensual debt restructuring under the federal Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability (PROMESA) Act.
""We think that Title III debtors and creditors are better off,"" said Luc Despins, a lawyer from Paul Hastings who represents the creditor committee.
Overwhelmed with $120 billion of debt and pension liabilities, the Puerto Rico government and four of its public corporations last year filed for a court-ordered bankruptcy process under Title III of the PROMESA Act.
The proposed GDB restructuring deal is being pushed through Title VI of the federal law, which provides for a consensual restructuring framework between the government and creditors. The plan, overwhelmingly approved by creditors last month, would transfer to a GDB Debt Recovery Authority the bank’s municipal loan portfolios, real estate assets and unencumbered cash. The authority would issue new bonds backed by a statutory lien on those assets in an amount equal to 55 percent of outstanding debt.
The deal calls for establishment of a Public Entity Trust, which would mostly receive non-performing loans made by the GDB to other government entities. 
The unsecured creditor committee, mostly government suppliers and labor unions, had tried to halt the proposed GDB restructuring deal, arguing it violated the court-ordered bankruptcy stay and PROMESA. The group also raised a flag over the deal’s release of potential claims against current and former GDB directors, officers and other representatives. 
U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing the island's bankruptcy, last month rejected a motion by the committee to stop the deal. Under the latest agreement, the creditor committee will withdraw all legal actions against the deal, as well as any claim in connection with issuance of GDB debt. Certain funds and deposits that would have gone to the GDB Debt Recovery Authority will now go to the Public Entity Trust.
If Swain approves the agreement, the next step would be final court approval, which the government expects by Nov. 6. 
The agreement does not require a recertification of the GDB restructuring deal, nor does it affect the schedule for its approval, lawyers said.
Puerto Rico also has deals in the works to restructure debt issued by its bankrupt Sales Tax Financing Corporation, known as COFINA, and Electric Power Authority (PREPA).

1682,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks Fall as Treasuries Extend Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks capped the worst week in a month, as the selloff in Treasuries that took yields to seven-year highs persisted amid speculation the latest jobs report clears the path for raising interest rates.
Technology shares led losses Friday, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index to a weekly drop of 3 percent amid concern the U.S.-China trade spat will intensify. Eight of 11 sectors declined in the S&P 500.  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). dropped the most in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Bloomberg’s report on Chinese hacking. Stocks began the day higher after the employment data added to confidence in the strength of the American economy.
Just a week after U.S. stocks plowed to fresh records, investors continued to sell the bull market’s biggest winners, ditching high-flyers from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The tech rout is the latest blow for global stocks in a week that saw 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climb to seven-year highs, reducing demand for riskier assets. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stoked the rates surge when he said the central bank could eventually boost its benchmark past the neutral level.
“It’s more trade worries than anything else because these companies, they either sell a lot to China or produce a lot in China,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “And we have the issue of the two naval boats in China, which raises it to more than just an economic issue -- there’s political tensions there. And then of course there’s the hacking issue.”
The 10-year bond yield pushed above 3.21 percent as the unemployment rate fell to a 48-year low, though the number of jobs created fell short of estimates. The dollar turned lower versus major peers. Gold futures rose, crude gained and the pound advanced.
“The jobs report was nothing great -- it was ok. Today we’re all over the place,” Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities, said. “It will be volatile, it will chop around in both directions. We’ll settle into a lower range until earnings start coming out towards the end of the month.”
Treasuries resumed a slide as investors speculated the low unemployment rate and major upward revision to prior months would do little to deter the Fed from raising rates for a fourth time this year. The hiring figures were influenced by the hurricane that hit the Southeast last month, muddling the picture.
“This is a report that’s consistent with being pretty close to full employment and it’s going to reinforce the Fed’s path for raising rates,” Alan Krueger, professor of economics at Princeton University, said on Bloomberg TV.
Earlier, a rout in technology shares roiled Asian equity markets. PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. plunged 15 percent in Hong Kong, amid Bloomberg’s report that China infiltrated U.S. companies by hacking hardware. In Europe, miners led the Stoxx 600 lower as industrial-metal prices fell and Danske Bank A/S headed for a four-year low. Germany’s 30-year bond was poised for its biggest one-week yield increase since April. Italian bonds also slipped as GDP forecasts failed to convince investors the country will be able to meet fiscal targets.
Elsewhere, West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices climbed back toward $75 a barrel. Copper led a decline in industrial-metal prices as a rally in raw materials stalled. Gold advanced, capping the best week in six for the precious metal.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 03:27PM ET</span>","'Despondent' Musk's Tesla resembles Lehman, Greenlight's Einhorn says","By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn lambasted Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and its ""despondent"" Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday, comparing the electric car company to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, where he had flagged accounting problems several months before its 2008 collapse.
""Like Lehman, we think the deception is about to catch up to TSLA,"" Einhorn's firm Greenlight Capital, which has sold Tesla shares short, said in a quarterly investor letter obtained by Reuters. ""Elon Musk's erratic behavior suggests that he sees it the same way.""
Greenlight's letter came one day after Musk, a longtime critic of short-sellers, appeared to taunt the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by calling it the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" on Twitter.
That came just five days after Musk settled SEC fraud charges, in an accord that lets him remain Tesla's chief executive but requires he step aside as chairman. A judge has yet to approve the settlement.
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Its shares were down 7 percent at $262.05 in late afternoon trading.
Greenlight is having a difficult year, with its main fund down 25.7 percent through September, but said its Tesla short position was its second biggest winner in the third quarter.
In an investor presentation in May 2008, four months before Lehman went bankrupt, Einhorn had questioned the investment bank's accounting, including for real estate, and said it needed to raise large amounts of capital.
Einhorn said Tesla has ""many parallels"" to Lehman, which he said ""threatened short sellers, refused to raise capital (it even bought back stock), and management publicly suggested it would go private.""
""Months later, shareholders, creditors, employees and the global economy paid a big price when management's reckless behavior led to bankruptcy,"" Einhorn said.
He said a big problem for Musk is that Tesla would lose too much money targeting a mass audience by selling its Model 3 at a $35,000 starting price, and yet ""can't bring himself"" to cancel the program and refund customer deposits.
""His conduct suggests that he is doing his best to be relieved of his position as CEO to avoid accountability,"" Einhorn said.
Musk, for his part, has used Twitter to mock Einhorn, saying on Aug. 1 he would ""send Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time.""
Greenlight said it also sold its last Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares in August at $228 per share, eight years after buying the iPhone maker at less than one-sixth that price, on growing fear of ""Chinese retaliation against America's trade policies.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares were down 1.4 percent at $224.71 late Friday.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EBRD head faces investigation call over dossier on directors,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Several member states have called for the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be investigated over claims the lender inappropriately gathered personal information on some of its directors, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The May 29 complaint against EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti was made by several board members, who represent some of the bank's 67 member governments, to its chief compliance officer at the end of May, four sources told Reuters. All four were directors at the EBRD at the time.
""The President and ExCom (executive committee) members would seem to have put a repeated practice in place which involves collecting sensitive and personal information on Board Members,"" the complaint, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said.
""We hereby request that you, as Chief Compliance Officer, initiate a procedure … regarding alleged misconduct and alleged inappropriate behavior by the President of EBRD,"" the letter said. It was anonymously signed ""a number of concerned board members and shareholders"".
The four sources said an external investigation had since been opened.
The letter of complaint said that on May 3-4 a number of board members anonymously received documents containing copies of email exchanges between the president and executive committee, as well as excerpts from other official bank reports, which contained personal information on board members compiled without their consent.
The letter said the language used in some of the documents appeared as ""rude, unethical and derogatory"".
One of the sources said that seven government representatives had jointly filed the complaint.
Chakrabarti declined to answer questions on the matter when approached by Reuters. The EBRD's Managing Director for Communications, Jonathan Charles, declined to confirm or deny the existence of the leaked documents or whether there was an inquiry.
""We would never comment on any alleged leaks of documents or alleged inquiries,"" Charles said. ""That should not be taken as either confirmation or denial of whether any documents or inquiries exist.""
The British government, which put Chakrabarti forward for the EBRD president role in 2012, also declined to comment.
Reuters has not seen or been able to independently review the leaked documents or establish the reasons why they were produced.
The letter of complaint said that based on the contents of the leaked documents, ""there is reason to believe"" that ""sensitive medical information"" on one government-appointed director had been relayed to the executive committee, the EBRD’s top management body, without consent.
It also said that, based on the documents, there was reason to believe that members of the executive committee had ""collectively and knowingly"" misled another director to slow down a strategic decision and ""planned and taken measures"" to influence the composition of influential committees at the bank.
The letter was written on EBRD headed paper and referred in depth to technical details of the bank's code of conduct. 
SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS
In another letter seen by Reuters, Chakrabarti wrote to EBRD board directors on May 4, days after the documents were said to have been leaked. He said that he had been ""made aware that some of you have been sent, anonymously, sensitive official bank documents.""
In the letter, he said the matter would be looked into by the bank's chief compliance officer but questioned whether it was a deliberate attempt to stoke divisions within the EBRD.
""It seems to me that both the act and its timing are designed to try to both divide Board colleagues and to create a rift between Board and management,"" the letter said. ""We must not let either of those things occur.""
The letter did not specifically refer to any dossier containing personal information.
The EBRD declined to comment on the May 4 letter.
Two of the sources said the EBRD’s chief compliance officer had referred the complaint from the group of board members to the head of the bank's audit committee, who then convened a broader committee to assess it. The two sources said that committee decided to bring in an external investigator.
One of the sources said the external investigation was being carried out by Swiss law firm Lenz & Staehelin.
Two spokeswomen for Lenz & Staehelin did not respond to e-mailed and phone requests for comment.
The EBRD's secretary general and the head of its audit committee also did not respond to requests for comment.
The EBRD was founded in 1991 by the international community to help the communist Eastern Bloc transform to capitalism after the Cold War. The bank has seen rapid expansion in recent years into the Middle East and North Africa.
It is owned by 67 governments, invests around 10 billion euros ($11.5 billion) a year in almost 40 countries, but has faced a run of turbulence in recent years.

In 2014 it stopped lending in Russia, once its biggest market, after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, while Britain's vote to leave the EU in 2016 has stirred debate about its location in London and the fact that a Briton runs it.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 02:58PM ET</span>",Wall Street slides as bond yields climb on jobs data,"By Medha Singh
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday, weighed down by rising Treasury yields after data showed job growth slowed in September, while wage increases were not enough to fan worries over rising inflation or faster interest rates hikes.
The losses were led by heavyweight stocks in the technology and communication services sectors, including the so-called FAANG group – Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL).
Apple fell 2.7 percent after David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital said it sold its remaining shares in the company on growing fear of ""Chinese retaliation against America's trade policies"".
Twitter (N:TWTR) dropped 0.5 percent, giving up earlier gains after Greenlight also said it sold its entire stake in the company due to worries about regulatory risks affecting social media companies. Facebook (O:FB) dropped 1.2 percent, while Snapchat-parent Snap (N:SNAP) slid 1.7 percent.
That added to the pressure on the stock market from earlier in the session after the September jobs report.
Nonfarm payrolls increased less than expected in September, likely due to the effect of Hurricane Florence, though data for July and August was revised higher, a Labor Department report showed.
""Good news for economy is bad news for equity investors right now,"" said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group's in New York.
""The labor report on the surface looked a bit weak but once you got under the surface it kind of supported the story of a strong labor market.""
The report pushed longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields higher. That piled more pressure on U.S. stocks, which are trading near record-high levels, raising concerns about valuations with the earnings season just around the corner.
The technology sector (SPLRCT) sank 2 percent, dropping for the second day in a row as it also took a hit from a fall in shares of Intel (O:INTC) and Microsoft (O:MSFT).
The communication services sector (SPLRCL), which houses Netflix, Facebook and Alphabet, dropped 1.5 percent.
At 13:18 EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 276.53 points, or 1.04 percent, at 26,350.95, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 27.89 points, or 0.96 percent, at 2,873.72.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 146.44 points, or 1.86 percent, at 7,733.07, its lowest since mid August.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments said on Friday that its asset management chief, Charles Morrison, is leaving the company and that it plans to name a replacement in ""the near term.""
Morrison, who has been with Fidelity for 32 years, has been president of the asset management division since 2014. He is expected to retire at the end of the year, Fidelity said. During his tenure, assets under management climbed by 37 percent to a record $2.6 trillion at the end of August.
Fidelity said it has a succession plan and expects to ""be in a position to name Charlie's replacement in the near term.""
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. 
Morrison is leaving Fidelity at a time the privately-held firm has been lowering fees, even eliminating management fees altogether on two recently launched index funds, as it battles industry rivals to attract and keep increasingly cost-conscious clients.
In his nearly five years as asset management chief, Morrison expanded the types of portfolios Fidelity offers, pushing more into exchange traded funds, for example.
Before being elevated to asset management chief, Morrison ran Fidelity's fixed income division.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's largest lenders, state-owned Sberbank (MM:SBER) and VTB (MM:VTBR), saw outflows of foreign currency deposits in August amid a rouble depreciation and concerns about new U.S. sanctions, according to an analysis of central bank data.
Some of their smaller rivals, however, and subsidiaries of foreign banks in Russia saw inflows to their FX deposits in the same period.
""Moderate funding outflows from larger state banks were presumably driven by concerns over potential new sanctions,"" Fitch ratings said in a note, referring to August flows. 
Concerns about an extension of U.S. sanctions against Moscow that could possibly target Russian state banks and holdings of Russian government bonds plagued markets in August and sent the rouble to its lowest levels since 2016.
Some depositors used the rouble's slide to levels close to 69 against the dollar from around 62 seen in early August as an opportunity to cash in on the currency moves, withdrawing foreign currency so they could use it to buy roubles cheaply.
The amount of foreign currency that retail clients held in Sberbank, Russia's No. 1 lender, declined by $1.1 billion in August to $33 billion, while the bank's corporate FX deposits shrank by $2.2 billion to $55 billion.
Sberbank's Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Morozov told Reuters last month that concerns about fresh U.S. sanctions, elevated volatility on the currency market and the seasonal demand for foreign currency during summer holidays had all driven the outflow from households' foreign currency deposits.
For companies, a seasonal need to pay dividends in roubles had also taken its toll in August, the Sberbank press-office said.
In September, such outflow continued as Sberbank's retail clients withdrew around 130 billion roubles ($1.95 billion) worth of FX, data from the bank's earnings report under Russian accounting standards showed on Friday.
Later on Friday, Sberbank said that, according to its calculations and the rouble exchange rate it used, outflows of foreign currency from retail deposits totaled $900 million in September but the bank also had inflows worth $1.5 billion from legal entities.
The data on flows at Russia's five biggest lenders and subsidiaries of major foreign banks was collated by Reuters. It was based on the banks' financial results submitted to the central bank as well as on the relevant rouble exchange rate. VTB, Russia's No.2 lender, saw corporate and retail FX deposits falling by a total of $3.15 billion in August.
""We observe the trend that corporate clients are replacing foreign currency deposits with rouble ones,"" VTB's press office said in an email.
""We don't observe any contraction in (retail) foreign currency deposits. In August VTB has increased the portfolio of retail dollar deposits by more than 6 percent in the rouble equivalent,"" VTB said.
Corporate deposits denominated in foreign currency have also shrunk by $1.7 billion at state-owned Gazprombank, Russia's third-largest lender by assets.
Russia's fourth-largest state-owned lender Rosselkhozbank, however, saw corporate FX deposits rising to $5.93 billion by the end of August from $5.72 billion a month earlier. The fluctuation was in line with a monthly average, the bank said.
Alfa Bank, Russia's fifth-largest lender by assets and the largest among non-state banks, saw corporate FX deposits rising by $160 million to $6.38 billion as of end-August.
Russia's branch of Citibank saw FX deposits growing by 15 billion roubles ($224.65 million) in August. This was the result of transactions of ""a limited number of affluent customers,"" said the head of banking products at Citi, Dmitry Emelin.
Foreign currency deposits at Raiffeisen Bank in Russia grew to $1.88 billion from $1.37 billion in August, while FX deposits at Rosbank, a subsidiary of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), rose to $1.95 billion from $1.70 billion.

Gazprombank, Raiffeisen and Rosbank did not reply to a request for comment.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Saudi crown prince pledges Aramco IPO by early 2021: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince insisted the stalled plan to sell shares in oil giant Aramco will go ahead, promising an initial public offering by 2021 and sticking to his ambitious view the state-run company is worth $2 trillion or more, Bloomberg reported on Friday.
""I believe late 2020, early 2021,"" he said, discussing the timing of the IPO in an interview with Bloomberg at the royal palace in Riyadh. ""The investor will decide the price on the day. I believe it will be above $2 trillion. Because it will be huge.""
Aramco declined to comment.
For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has prepared to place up to 5 percent of its national oil company on the stock market. Officials talked up the Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) with international exchanges, global banks and U.S. President Donald Trump.
The planned listing of the world's biggest oil producer was to be the cornerstone of the kingdom's promised economic overhaul and, at a targeted $100 billion, the biggest IPO ever.
It was the brainchild of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir apparent of the world's largest oil exporter.
After months of setbacks, the international and domestic legs of the IPO were pulled, as the prince's father King Salman stepped in to shelve it, three sources with ties to government insiders told Reuters in late August.
Prince Mohammed said in the Bloomberg interview that the Saudi government will keep the shares of Aramco after the IPO, rather than transfer them into the sovereign wealth fund as originally planned. 
Instead, the public investment fund (PIF) will receive the $70 billion from the sale of its stake in Sabic, plus the $100 billion that country hopes to raise from the Aramco IPO, the report said.

Prince Mohammed provided a detailed timetable of his plans for Aramco, saying that after the deal with local petrochemical giant Sabic is completed in 2019, the company would need a full financial year before it can go ahead and sell shares to the public, the report said.

1690,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>","U.S. Stocks Sell Off on Trade, Rising-Rate Worries","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks headed for the biggest two-day slide since May as the sell-off in technology shares deepened amid growing concern the U.S.-China trade spat will intensify. Treasury yields rose to seven-year highs on speculation the latest jobs report clears the path for raising interest rates.
The Nasdaq 100 Index sank to a six-week low and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). led declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Bloomberg’s report that China infiltrated American companies with hardware hacks. Chipmakers in the S&P 500 Index fell almost 2 percent, as the measure careened toward its worst weeks since March. It has fallen 1.9 percent in the past two days. Stocks began higher after the employment data added to confidence in the strength of the American economy.
Just a week after U.S. stocks plowed to fresh records, investors continued to sell the bull market’s biggest winners, ditching high-flyers from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The tech rout is the latest blow for global stocks in a week that saw 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climb to seven-year highs, reducing demand for riskier assets. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stoked the rates surge when he said the central bank could eventually boost its benchmark past the neutral level.
“It’s more trade worries than anything else because these companies, they either sell a lot to China or produce a lot in China,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “And we have the issue of the two naval boats in China, which raises it to more than just an economic issue -- there’s political tensions there. And then of course there’s the hacking issue.”
The 10-year bond yield pushed above 3.21 percent as the unemployment rate fell to a 48-year low, though the number of jobs created fell short of estimates. The dollar turned lower versus major peers. Gold futures rose, crude gained and the pound advanced.
“The jobs report was nothing great -- it was ok. Today we’re all over the place,” Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities, said. “It will be volatile, it will chop around in both directions. We’ll settle into a lower range until earnings start coming out towards the end of the month.”
Treasuries resumed a slide as investors speculated the low unemployment rate and major upward revision to prior months would do little to deter the Fed from raising rates for a fourth time this year. The hiring figures were influenced by the hurricane that hit the Southeast last month, muddling the picture.
“This is a report that’s consistent with being pretty close to full employment and it’s going to reinforce the Fed’s path for raising rates,” Alan Krueger, professor of economics at Princeton University, said on Bloomberg TV.
Earlier, a rout in technology shares roiled Asian equity markets. PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. plunged 15 percent in Hong Kong, amid Bloomberg’s report that China infiltrated U.S. companies by hacking hardware. In Europe, miners led the Stoxx 600 lower as industrial-metal prices fell and Danske Bank A/S headed for a four-year low. Germany’s 30-year bond was poised for its biggest one-week yield increase since April. Italian bonds also slipped as GDP forecasts failed to convince investors the country will be able to meet fiscal targets.
Elsewhere, West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices climbed back toward $75 a barrel. Copper led a decline in industrial-metal prices as a rally in raw materials stalled. Gold advanced, capping the best week in six for the precious metal.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Summer lull hits U.S. loan fees despite Refinitiv deal,"By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK (LPC) - Bank fees earned from arranging US syndicated loans fell in the third quarter amid a summer lull as bankers awaited the US$13.5bn financing backing Blackstone’s US$20bn buyout of Refinitiv, the biggest buyout deal to test the markets since the financial crisis. 
A soft third quarter was offset by a move towards new money loans, which offer higher fees than debt refinancings, and by record first-half fees on a flurry of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) loans.
The rush into Refinitiv’s loan and bond buyout financing in September resulted in lower pricing, a shift of debt to loans from bonds, and set a more aggressive tone for fourth quarter lending. 
Blackstone’s purchase of 55% of the newly named Refinitiv, which includes LPC and IFR, from Thomson Reuters closed on October 1.  
“Refinitiv was overhanging the market in the summer. Now, there’s a risk-on attitude among investors after seeing how well the Refinitiv deal did,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. “That will have a big impact on the fee pool, because the fees on new money deals like this are much higher than on refinancings.”
Total US syndicated lending slumped to US$432bn in the third quarter, the lowest quarterly amount since the first three months of 2016. However, 38% was new money lending, which is the highest quarterly share of the loan market in more than two years, LPC data show. 
The rise of more profitable new money deals - which include loans for acquisitions, loans backing the creation of new companies as units are carved out of existing businesses, and the upsizings of existing credit facilities - helped offset the drop in fees from the drop in overall loan volume. 
Arranging banks made US$2.5bn of fees from underwriting leveraged loans for highly indebted companies in the third quarter, down 27% from a year earlier, according to Freeman Consulting, which estimates fees based on Refinitiv data.
Leveraged loan fees in the first nine months of 2018 of US$8.8bn were roughly flat with the same period of last year, showing a 2.2% decrease. 
Third quarter lending to leveraged companies of US$177bn was around 40% lower than the third quarter of 2017, even with a post-Labor Day rush that also included large buyout loans for chemicals company Akzo Nobel and physician outsourcing services provider Envision Healthcare. 
ENCOURAGING SIGNS
Bank fees earned from lending to blue-chip investment grade companies also slid in the third quarter, dropping 22% to US$523m from a year earlier. 
The first half of the year was dominated by mega mergers, mainly in the healthcare, media and technology sectors, before activity stalled in the third quarter.  
Companies are still focused on growing by acquisition, and the pace is expected to pick up after a slow summer for corporate marriages, bankers and lawyers said.
“On the investment-grade side, loan fees track M&A very closely,” said Nassof. “Acquirers are still in a pretty aggressive mindset.”
Prolonged regulatory review periods caused some companies to hesitate before pulling the trigger on big mergers. Concerns about the potential fallout from tariffs, trade wars, and upcoming midterm elections also contributed to the summer slowdown, bankers said.
But the logjam seems to have broken now that Cigna (NYSE:CI) Corp’s US$52bn acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and retail pharmacy CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corp’s US$69bn acquisition of health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) appear to be on course for completion. 
“We’re very encouraged about Cigna and Express Scripts – it bodes well for deal approvals,” a senior banker said. “Companies are looking for top-line growth, and it’s hard to achieve that organically so acquisitions are the way to go.”
In the first nine months of the year, investment-grade lending fees of US$2.07bn were 22% higher than the US$1.70bn earned in the same period last year due to the first half deal wave, according to Freeman.
The third-quarter drag on US syndicated lending to low- and high-rated borrowers has helped pull down the total US investment banking fee pool.
Adding bank earnings from equity and bond underwriting, as well as M&A advisory to the syndicated loan arrangement fees, the total US investment banking fee pool dropped 18% in the quarter from a year earlier to US$11bn. 
Year to date, the US$37.4bn earned is down 3.5% from US$38.8bn seen in the first nine months of last year.
